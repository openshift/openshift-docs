= Configuring node tuning in a hosted cluster

//# Manage node-level tuning with the Node Tuning Operator

To set node-level tuning on the nodes in your hosted cluster, you can use the Node Tuning Operator. In hosted control planes, you can configure node tuning by creating config maps that contain `Tuned` objects and referencing those config maps in your node pools.

.Procedure

. Create a config map that contains a valid tuned manifest, and reference the manifest in a node pool. In the following example, a `Tuned` manifest defines a profile that sets `vm.dirty_ratio` to 55 on nodes that contain the `tuned-1-node-label` node label with any value. Save the following `ConfigMap` manifest in a file named `tuned-1.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: tuned-1
      namespace: clusters
    data:
      tuning: |
        apiVersion: tuned.openshift.io/v1
        kind: Tuned
        metadata:
          name: tuned-1
          namespace: openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
        spec:
          profile:
          - data: |
              [main]
              summary=Custom OpenShift profile
              include=openshift-node
              [sysctl]
              vm.dirty_ratio="55"
            name: tuned-1-profile
          recommend:
          - priority: 20
            profile: tuned-1-profile
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not add any labels to an entry in the `spec.recommend` section of the Tuned spec, node-pool-based matching is assumed, so the highest priority profile in the `spec.recommend` section is applied to nodes in the pool. Although you can achieve more fine-grained node-label-based matching by setting a label value in the Tuned `.spec.recommend.match` section, node labels will not persist during an upgrade unless you set the `.spec.management.upgradeType` value of the node pool to `InPlace`.
====

. Create the `ConfigMap` object in the management cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig="$MGMT_KUBECONFIG" create -f tuned-1.yaml
----

. Reference the `ConfigMap` object in the `spec.tuningConfig` field of the node pool, either by editing a node pool or creating one. In this example, assume that you have only one `NodePool`, named `nodepool-1`, which contains 2 nodes.
+
[source,yaml]
----
    apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    kind: NodePool
    metadata:
      ...
      name: nodepool-1
      namespace: clusters
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      tuningConfig:
      - name: tuned-1
    status:
    ...
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can reference the same config map in multiple node pools. In hosted control planes, the Node Tuning Operator appends a hash of the node pool name and namespace to the name of the Tuned CRs to distinguish them. Outside of this case, do not create multiple TuneD profiles of the same name in different Tuned CRs for the same hosted cluster.
====

.Verification

Now that you have created the `ConfigMap` object that contains a `Tuned` manifest and referenced it in a `NodePool`, the Node Tuning Operator syncs the `Tuned` objects into the hosted cluster. You can verify which `Tuned` objects are defined and which TuneD profiles are applied to each node.

. List the `Tuned` objects in the hosted cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig="$HC_KUBECONFIG" get tuned.tuned.openshift.io -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME       AGE
default    7m36s
rendered   7m36s
tuned-1    65s
----

. List the `Profile` objects in the hosted cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig="$HC_KUBECONFIG" get profile.tuned.openshift.io -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                           TUNED            APPLIED   DEGRADED   AGE
nodepool-1-worker-1            tuned-1-profile  True      False      7m43s
nodepool-1-worker-2            tuned-1-profile  True      False      7m14s
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If no custom profiles are created, the `openshift-node` profile is applied by default.
====

. To confirm that the tuning was applied correctly, start a debug shell on a node and check the sysctl values:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig="$HC_KUBECONFIG" debug node/nodepool-1-worker-1 -- chroot /host sysctl vm.dirty_ratio
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
vm.dirty_ratio = 55
