= {oadp-short} backup and restore guidelines

With the {oadp-short} Operator, you can back up and restore your applications on your target clusters by using `Backup` and `Restore` CRs wrapped in `ConfigMap` objects.
The application must work on the current and the target {product-title} versions so that they can be restored after the upgrade.
The backups must include resources that were initially created.

The following resources must be excluded from the backup:

* `pods`
* `endpoints`
* `controllerrevision`
* `podmetrics`
* `packagemanifest`
* `replicaset`
* `localvolume`, if using Local Storage Operator (LSO)

There are two local storage implementations for {sno}:

Local Storage Operator (LSO):: The {lcao} automatically backs up and restores the required artifacts, including `localvolume` resources and their associated `StorageClass` resources. You must exclude the `persistentvolumes` resource in the application `Backup` CR.

{lvms}:: You must create the `Backup` and `Restore` CRs for {lvms} artifacts. You must include the `persistentVolumes` resource in the application `Backup` CR.

For the image-based upgrade, only one Operator is supported on a given target cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For both Operators, you must not apply the Operator CRs as extra manifests through the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR.
====

The persistent volume contents are preserved and used after the pivot.
When you are configuring the `DataProtectionApplication` CR, you must ensure that the `.spec.configuration.restic.enable` is set to `false` for an image-based upgrade.
This disables Container Storage Interface integration.

[id="ztp-image-based-upgrade-apply-wave-guide_{context}"]
== lca.openshift.io/apply-wave guidelines

The `lca.openshift.io/apply-wave` annotation determines the apply order of `Backup` or `Restore` CRs.
The value of the annotation must be a string number.
If you define the `lca.openshift.io/apply-wave` annotation in the `Backup` or `Restore` CRs, they are applied in increasing order based on the annotation value.
If you do not define the annotation, they are applied together.

The `lca.openshift.io/apply-wave` annotation must be numerically lower in your platform `Restore` CRs, for example {rh-rhacm} and {lvms} artifacts, than that of the application.
This way, the platform artifacts are restored before your applications.

If your application includes cluster-scoped resources, you must create separate `Backup` and `Restore` CRs to scope the backup to the specific cluster-scoped resources created by the application.
The `Restore` CR for the cluster-scoped resources must be restored before the remaining application `Restore` CR(s).

[id="ztp-image-based-upgrade-apply-label-guide_{context}"]
== lca.openshift.io/apply-label guidelines

You can back up specific resources exclusively with the `lca.openshift.io/apply-label` annotation.
Based on which resources you define in the annotation, the {lcao} applies the `lca.openshift.io/backup: <backup_name>` label and adds the `labelSelector.matchLabels.lca.openshift.io/backup: <backup_name>` label selector to the specified resources when creating the `Backup` CRs.

To use the `lca.openshift.io/apply-label` annotation for backing up specific resources, the resources listed in the annotation must also be included in the `spec` section.
If the `lca.openshift.io/apply-label` annotation is used in the `Backup` CR, only the resources listed in the annotation are backed up, even if other resource types are specified in the `spec` section or not.
