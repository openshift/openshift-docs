[id="cluster-compare-configure-inline-diff_{context}"]
= Configuring inline validation for template fields

You can enable inline regular expressions to validate template fields, especially in scenarios where Golang templating syntax is difficult to maintain or overly complex. Using inline regular expressions simplifies templates, improves readability, and allows for more advanced validation logic.

The `cluster-compare` plugin provides two functions for inline validation:

* `regex`: Validates content in a field using a regular expression.
* `capturegroups`: Enhances multi-line text comparisons by processing non-capture group text as exact matches, applying regular expression matching only within named capture groups, and ensuring consistency for repeated capture groups.

== Configuring inline validation with the regex function

Use the `regex` inline function to validate fields using regular expressions.

.Procedure

. Create a `metadata.yaml` file to match your use case. Use the following structure as an example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v2
parts:
- name: Part1
  components:
  - name: Example
    allOf:
    - path: example.yaml
      config:
        perField:
        - pathToKey: spec.bigTextBlock <1>
          inlineDiffFunc: regex <2>
----
<1> Specifies the field for inline validation.
<2> Enables inline validation using regular expressions.

. Use a regular expression to validate the field in the associated template:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: dashboard
data:
  bigTextBlock: |-
    This is a big text block with some static content, like this line.
    It also has a place where (?<username>[a-z0-9]+) would put in their own name. (?<username>[a-z0-9]+) would put in their own name.

== Configuring inline validation with the capturegroups function

Use the `capturegroups` inline function for more precise validation of fields featuring multi-line strings.

    This static content outside of a capture group should match exactly.
    Here is a username capture group: (?<username>[a-z0-9]+). 
    It should match this capture group: (?<username>[a-z0-9]+).
