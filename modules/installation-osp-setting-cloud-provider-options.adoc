= Setting cloud provider options

Optionally, you can edit the cloud provider configuration for your cluster. The cloud provider configuration controls how {product-title} interacts with {rh-openstack-first}.

For a complete list of cloud provider configuration parameters, see link:https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/#cloud-conf[the `cloud.conf` specification].

.Procedure

. If you have not already generated manifest files for your cluster, generate them by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install --dir <destination_directory> create manifests
----

. In a text editor, open the cloud-provider configuration manifest file. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vi openshift/manifests/cloud-provider-config.yaml
----

. Modify the options based on link:https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/#cloud-conf[the `cloud.conf` specification].
+
Configuring Octavia for load balancing is a common case. For example:
+
[source,text]
----
#...
[LoadBalancer]
use-octavia=true <1>
lb-provider = "amphora" <2>
floating-network-id="d3deb660-4190-40a3-91f1-37326fe6ec4a"<3>
#...
----
<1> This property enables Octavia integration.
<2> This property sets the Octavia provider that your load balancer uses. It accepts `"ovn"` or `"amphora"` as values. If you choose to use OVN, you must also set `lb-method` to `SOURCE_IP_PORT`.
<3> This property is required if you want to use multiple external networks with your cluster. The cloud provider creates floating IP addresses on the network that is specified here.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Prior to saving your changes, verify that the file is structured correctly. Clusters might fail if properties are not placed in the appropriate section.
====

. Save the changes to the file and proceed with installation.
+
[TIP]
====
You can update your cloud provider configuration after you run the installer. On a command line, run:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configmap -n openshift-config cloud-provider-config
----

After you save your changes, your cluster will take some time to reconfigure itself. The process is complete if none of your nodes have a `SchedulingDisabled` status.
