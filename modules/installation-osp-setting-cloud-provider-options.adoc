= Setting cloud provider options

Optionally, you can edit the cloud provider configuration for your cluster. The cloud provider configuration controls how {product-title} interacts with {rh-openstack-first}.

For a complete list of cloud provider configuration parameters, see link:https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/#cloud-conf[the `cloud.conf` specification].

.Procedure

. If you have not already generated manifest files for your cluster, generate them by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install --dir <destination_directory> create manifests
----

. In a text editor, open the cloud-provider configuration manifest file. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vi openshift/manifests/cloud-provider-config.yaml
----

. Modify the options based on link:https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/#cloud-conf[the `cloud.conf` specification].

Configuring Octavia for load balancing is a common case for clusters that do not use Kuryr. For example:
+
[source,text]
----
#...
[LoadBalancer]
use-octavia=true <1>
lb-provider = "amphora" <2>
floating-network-id="d3deb660-4190-40a3-91f1-37326fe6ec4a" <3>
create-monitor = True <4>
monitor-delay = 10s <5>
monitor-timeout = 10s <6>
monitor-max-retries = 1 <7>
#...
----
<1> This property enables Octavia integration.
<2> This property sets the Octavia provider that your load balancer uses. It accepts `"ovn"` or `"amphora"` as values. If you choose to use OVN, you must also set `lb-method` to `SOURCE_IP_PORT`.
<3> This property is required if you want to use multiple external networks with your cluster. The cloud provider creates floating IP addresses on the network that is specified here.
<4> This property controls whether the cloud provider creates health monitors for Octavia load balancers. Set the value to `True` to create health monitors. As of {rh-openstack} 16.1 and 16.2, this feature is only available for the Amphora provider.
<5> This property sets the frequency with which endpoints are monitored. The value must be in the `time.ParseDuration()` format. This property is required if the value of the `create-monitor` property is `True`.
<6> This property sets the time that monitoring requests are open before timing out. The value must be in the `time.ParseDuration()` format. This property is required if the value of the `create-monitor` property is `True`.
<7> This property defines how many successful monitoring requests are required before a load balancer is marked as online. The value must be an integer. This property is required if the value of the `create-monitor` property is `True`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Prior to saving your changes, verify that the file is structured correctly. Clusters might fail if properties are not placed in the appropriate section.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must set the value of the `create-monitor` property to `True` if you use services that have the value of the `.spec.externalTrafficPolicy` property set to `Local`. The OVN Octavia provider in {rh-openstack} 16.1 and 16.2 does not support health monitors. Therefore, services that have `ETP` parameter values set to `Local` might not respond when the `lb-provider` value is set to `"ovn"`.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For installations that use Kuryr, Kuryr handles relevant services. There is no need to configure Octavia load balancing in the cloud provider.
====

. Save the changes to the file and proceed with installation.
+
[TIP]
====
You can update your cloud provider configuration after you run the installer. On a command line, run:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configmap -n openshift-config cloud-provider-config
----

After you save your changes, your cluster will take some time to reconfigure itself. The process is complete if none of your nodes have a `SchedulingDisabled` status.
