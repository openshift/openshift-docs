= Installing shp on Linux

For Linux distributions, you can download the `shp` CLI as a `tar.gz` archive.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the Go programming language and added GOPATH to the PATH environment variable on your system.

.Procedure

Choose one of the following methods to install `shp` on your system.

.Install `shp` using `go get`

Enter:
[source,terminal]
----
$ go get -u github.com/shipwright-io/cli/cmd/shp
----

.Build and install `shp` from the source

Clone the `cli` repository, build the `shp` binary and move it to a directory on your PATH environment variable. For example:
[source,terminal]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:shipwright-io/cli.git
$ cd cli
$ make
$ cp _output/shp $GOPATH/bin/shp
----

.Install `shp` as a `kubectl` plugin

To compile the project as a kubectl plugin, run:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:shipwright-io/cli.git
$ cd cli
$ make
$make kubectl-install
----

By having a `kubectl` named binary in `$PATH`, `shp` behaves a plugin. So, run `kubectl shp` in your terminal afterwards.
