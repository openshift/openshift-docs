= About Telemetry

Telemetry sends a carefully chosen subset of the cluster monitoring metrics to Red Hat. These metrics are sent continuously and describe:

* The size of an {product-title} cluster
* The health and status of {product-title} components
* The health and status of any upgrade being performed
* Limited usage information about {product-title} components and features
* Summary info about alerts reported by the cluster monitoring component

This continuous stream of data is used by Red Hat to monitor the health of clusters in real time and to react as necessary to problems that impact our customers. It also allows Red Hat to roll out {product-title} upgrades to customers so as to minimize service impact and continuously improve the upgrade experience.

This debugging information is available to Red Hat Support and engineering teams with the same restrictions as accessing data reported via support cases. All connected cluster information is used by Red Hat to help make {product-title} better and more intuitive to use. None of the information is shared with third parties.
