== Bug fixes
* Before this update, deploying LokiStack on IPv6-only or dual-stack OCP clusters caused the LokiStack memberlist registration to fail. As a result, the distributor pods went into a crash loop. With this update, the administrator can enable IPv6 using `lokistack.spec.hashRing.memberlist.enableIPv6: true` which resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4570[LOG-4570])
