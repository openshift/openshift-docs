= Cluster configuration reference

When creating the ISO image, configurations are retrieved from the target cluster and are applied to the new nodes.
Any configurations for your cluster are applied to the nodes unless you override the configurations in either the `nodes-config.yaml` file or any flags you add to the `oc adm node-image create` command.

[id="adding-node-iso-yaml-config_{context}"]
== YAML file parameters

Configuration parameters that can be specified in the `nodes-config.yaml` file are described in the following table:

.`nodes-config.yaml` parameters
[cols=".^4l,.^3,.^2",options="header"]
|====
|Parameter|Description|Values

|hosts:
|Host configuration.
|An array of host configuration objects.

|hosts:
  hostname:
|Hostname.
Overrides the hostname obtained from either the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or a reverse DNS lookup.
Each host must have a unique hostname supplied by one of these methods, although configuring a hostname through this parameter is optional.
|String.

|hosts:
  interfaces:
|Provides a table of the name and MAC address mappings for the interfaces on the host.
If a `NetworkConfig` section is provided in the `nodes-config.yaml` file, this table must be included and the values must match the mappings provided in the `NetworkConfig` section.
|An array of host configuration objects.

|hosts:
  interfaces:
    name:
|The name of an interface on the host.
|String.

|hosts:
  interfaces:
    macAddress:
|The MAC address of an interface on the host.
|A MAC address such as the following example: `00-B0-D0-63-C2-26`.

|hosts:
  rootDeviceHints:
|Enables provisioning of the {op-system-first} image to a particular device.
The node-adding tool examines the devices in the order it discovers them, and compares the discovered values with the hint values.
It uses the first discovered device that matches the hint value.
|A dictionary of key-value pairs.
For more information, see "Root device hints" in the "Setting up the environment for an OpenShift installation" page.

|hosts:
  rootDeviceHints:
    deviceName:
|The name of the device the {op-system} image is provisioned to.
|String.

|hosts:
  networkConfig:
|The host network definition.
The configuration must match the Host Network Management API defined in the link:https://nmstate.io/[nmstate documentation].
|A dictionary of host network configuration objects.

== Command flag options

You can use command flags with the `oc adm node-image create` command to configure the nodes you are creating.

The following table describes command flags that are not limited to the single-node use case:

.General command flags
[cols=".^4,.^3,.^2",options="header"]
|====
|Flag|Description|Values

|`--certificate-authority`
|The path to a certificate authority bundle to use when communicating with the managed container image registries.
If the `--insecure` flag is used, this flag is ignored.
|String

|`--dir`
|The path containing the configuration file, if provided.
This path is also used to store the generated artifacts.
|String

|`--insecure`
|Allows push and pull operations to registries to be made over HTTP.
|Boolean

|`-o`, `--output-name`
|The name of the generated output image.
|String

|`-a`, `--registry-config`
|The path to your registry credentials.
Alternatively, you can specify the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable.
The default paths are `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json`, `/run/containers/${UID}/auth.json`, `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/containers/auth.json`, `${DOCKER_CONFIG}`, `~/.docker/config.json`, `~/.dockercfg.`
The order can be changed through the deprecated `REGISTRY_AUTH_PREFERENCE` environment variable to a "docker" value, in order to prioritize Docker credentials over Podman.
|String

|`--skip-verification`
|An option to skip verifying the integrity of the retrieved content.
This is not recommended, but might be necessary when importing images from older image registries.
Bypass verification only if the registry is known to be trustworthy.
|Boolean

|====

The following table describes command flags that can be used only when creating a single node:

.Single-node only command flags
[cols=".^4,.^3,.^2",options="header"]
|====
|Flag|Description|Values

|`-c`, `--cpu-architecture`
|The CPU architecture to be used to install the node.
This flag can be used to create only a single node, and the `--mac-address` flag must be defined.
|String

|`--hostname`
|The hostname to be set for the node.
This flag can be used to create only a single node, and the `--mac-address` flag must be defined.
|String

|`-m`, `--mac-address`
|The MAC address used to identify the host to apply configurations to.
This flag can be used to create only a single node, and the `--mac-address` flag must be defined.
|String

|`--network-config-path`
|The path to a YAML file containing NMState configurations to be applied to the node.
This flag can be used to create only a single node, and the `--mac-address` flag must be defined.
|String

|`--root-device-hint`
|A hint for specifying the storage location for the image root filesystem. The accepted format is `<hint_name>:<value>`.
This flag can be used to create only a single node, and the `--mac-address` flag must be defined.
|String

|`-k`, `--ssh-key-path`
|The path to the SSH key used to access the node.
This flag can be used to create only a single node, and the `--mac-address` flag must be defined.
|String

Content to be added here. If the nodes-config.yaml has similar configuration options to the agent-config.yaml, is there a chance that we can duplicate or reuse some of the configuration reference we have for the Agent Installer?

Here's the reference doc for agent-config.yaml: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/installation-config-parameters-agent.html#agent-configuration-parameters_installation-config-parameters-agent
