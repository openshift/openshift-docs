1. The pod count displayed here is the number of test pods. The actual number of pods depends on the applicationâ€™s memory, CPU, and storage requirements.
2. When there are a large number of active projects, etcd might suffer from poor performance if the keyspace grows excessively large and exceeds the space quota. Periodic maintenance of etcd, including defragmentaion, is highly recommended to free etcd storage.
3. There are a number of control loops in the system that must iterate over all objects in a given namespace as a reaction to some changes in state. Having a large number of objects of a given type in a single namespace can make those loops expensive and slow down processing given state changes. The limit assumes that the system has enough CPU, memory, and disk to satisfy the application requirements.
4. Each service port and each service back end has a corresponding entry in iptables. The number of back ends of a given service impact the size of the endpoints objects, which impacts the size of data that is being sent all over the system.

In {product-title} {product-version}, half of a CPU core (500 millicore) is reserved by the system compared to {product-title} 3.11 and previous versions.
