= Changes from OADP 1.2 to 1.3

[role="_abstract"]
The Velero server has been updated from version 1.11 to 1.12. {oadp-first} 1.3 uses the Velero built-in Data Mover instead of the VolumeSnapshotMover (VSM) or the Volsync Data Mover. To ensure your upgrade succeeds, update your `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) to align with these changes.

The changes are as follows:

* The `spec.features.dataMover` field and the VSM plugin are not compatible with OADP 1.3, and you must remove the configuration from the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) configuration.

* The Volsync Operator is no longer required for Data Mover functionality, and you can remove it.

* The custom resource definitions `volumesnapshotbackups.datamover.oadp.openshift.io` and `volumesnapshotrestores.datamover.oadp.openshift.io` are no longer required, and you can remove them.

* The secrets used for the OADP-1.2 Data Mover are no longer required, and you can remove them.

OADP 1.3 supports Kopia, which is an alternative file system backup tool to Restic.

* To employ Kopia, use the new `spec.configuration.nodeAgent` field as shown in the following example:
+
.Example
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
# ...
----

* The `spec.configuration.restic` field is deprecated in OADP 1.3 and will be removed in a future version of OADP. To avoid seeing deprecation warnings, remove the `restic` key and its values, and use the following new syntax:
+
.Example
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: restic
# ...
----

[NOTE]
====
In a future OADP release, it is planned that the `kopia` tool will become the default `uploaderType` value.
