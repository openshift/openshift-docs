= Service accounts in {product-title}

As an {product-title} administrator, you can use service accounts to perform any
actions that require {product-title} `admin` roles.

The `dedicated-admin` service creates the `dedicated-admins` group. This group
is granted the roles at the cluster or individual project
level. Users can be assigned to this group, and group membership defines who has
{product-title} administrator access. However, by design, service accounts
cannot be added to regular groups.

Instead, the `dedicated-admin` service creates a special project for this
purpose named `dedicated-admin`. The service account group for this project is
granted {product-title} `admin` roles, which grants {product-title} administrator
access to all service accounts within the `dedicated-admin` project. You can
then use these service accounts to perform any actions that require
{product-title} administrator access.

Users that are members of the `dedicated-admins` group are granted the
`dedicated-admin` role permissions and have `edit` access to the `dedicated-admin`
project. These users can manage the service accounts in this project
and create new ones as needed.

Users with a `dedicated-reader` role are granted edit and view access to the
`dedicated-reader` project and view-only access to the other projects.
