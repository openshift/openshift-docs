[id="registry-removed_{context}"]
= Image registry removed during installation

On platforms that do not provide shareable object storage, the OpenShift Image
Registry Operator bootstraps itself as `Removed`. This allows
`openshift-installer` to complete installations on these platform types.

After installation, you must edit the Image Registry Operator configuration to
switch the `ManagementState` from `Removed` to `Managed`.

[NOTE]
====
The Prometheus console provides an `ImageRegistryRemoved` alert, for example:

"Image Registry has been removed. `ImageStreamTags`, `BuildConfigs` and
`DeploymentConfigs` which reference `ImageStreamTags` may not work as
expected. Please configure storage and update the config to `Managed`
state by editing configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io."
