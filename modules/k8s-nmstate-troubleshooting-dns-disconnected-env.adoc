= Troubleshooting DNS connectivity issues in a disconnected environment

If you experience DNS connectivity issues when configuring `nmstate` in a disconnected environment, you can configure the DNS server to resolve the list of name servers for the domain `root-servers.net`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the DNS server includes a name server (NS) entry for the `root-servers.net` zone. The DNS server does not need to forward a query to an upstream resolver, but the server must return a correct answer for the NS query.
====

== Configuring the bind9 DNS named server  

For a cluster configured to query a `bind9` DNS server, you can add the `root-servers.net` zone to a configuration file that contains at least one NS record.
For example you can use the `/var/named/named.localhost` as a zone file that already matches this criteria.

.Procedure

. Add the `root-servers.net` zone at the end of the `/etc/named.conf` configuration file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat >> /etc/named.conf <<EOF
zone "root-servers.net" IN {
    	type master;
    	file "named.localhost";
};
EOF
----

. Restart the `named` service by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ systemctl restart named
----

. Confirm that the `root-servers.net` zone is present by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ journalctl -u named|grep root-servers.net
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Jul 03 15:16:26 rhel-8-10 bash[xxxx]: zone root-servers.net/IN: loaded serial 0
Jul 03 15:16:26 rhel-8-10 named[xxxx]: zone root-servers.net/IN: loaded serial 0
----

. Verify that the DNS server can resolve the NS record for the `root-servers.net` domain by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ host -t NS root-servers.net. 127.0.0.1
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
Using domain server:
Name: 127.0.0.1
Address: 127.0.0.53
Aliases:
root-servers.net name server root-servers.net.
