= Preparing to deploy {hcp} on {aws-short}

As you prepare to deploy {hcp} on {aws-first}, consider the following information:

- Each hosted cluster must have a cluster-wide unique name. A hosted cluster name cannot be the same as any existing managed cluster in order for {mce-short} to manage it.

- Do not use `clusters` as a hosted cluster name.

- Run the hub cluster and workers on the same platform for {hcp}.

- A hosted cluster cannot be created in the namespace of a {mce-short} managed cluster.
