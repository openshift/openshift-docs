= Getting the DPLL firmware version for the CGU in an Intel 800 series NIC

You can get the digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) firmware version for the Clock Generation Unit (CGU) in an Intel 800 series NIC by opening a debug shell to the cluster node and querying the NIC hardware.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have installed an Intel 800 series NIC in the cluster host.

* You have installed the PTP Operator on a bare-metal cluster with hosts that support PTP.

.Procedure

. Start a debug pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----
+
where:
+
--
<node_name>:: Is the node where you have installed the Intel 800 series NIC.
--

. Check the CGU firmware version in the NIC by using the `devlink` tool and the bus and device name where the NIC is installed.
For example, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# devlink dev info <bus_name>/<device_name> | grep cgu
----
+
where:
+
--
<bus_name> :: Is the bus where the NIC is installed. For example, `pci`.
<device_name> :: Is the NIC device name. For example, `0000:51:00.0`.
--
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
cgu.id 36 <1>
fw.cgu 8032.16973825.6021 <2>
----
<1> CGU hardware revision number
<2> The DPLL firmware version running in the CGU, where the DPLL firmware version is `6201`, and the DPLL model is `8032`.
The string `16973825` is a shorthand representation of the binary version of the DPLL firmware version (`1.3.0.1`).

+
[NOTE]
====
The firmware version has a leading nibble and 3 octets for each part of the version number.
The number `16973825` in binary is `0001 0000 0011 0000 0000 0000 0001`.
Use the binary value to decode the firmware version.
For example:

.DPLL firmware version
