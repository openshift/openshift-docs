= Optional: Configuring storage on nodes

You can make changes to operating systems on {product-title} nodes by creating `MachineConfig` objects that are managed by the Machine Config Operator (MCO).

The `MachineConfig` specification includes an ignition config for configuring the machines at first boot. This config object can be used to modify files, systemd services, and other operating system features running on {product-title} machines.

.Procedure

Use the ignition config to configure storage on nodes. The following `MachineSet` manifest example demonstrates how to add a partition to a device on a primary node. In this example, apply the manifest before installation to have a partition named `recovery` with a size of 16 GiB on the primary node.

. Create a `custom-partitions.yaml` file and include a `MachineConfig` object that contains your partition layout:
