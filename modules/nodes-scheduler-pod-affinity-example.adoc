= Sample pod affinity and anti-affinity rules

The following examples demonstrate pod affinity and pod anti-affinity.

[id="nodes-scheduler-pod-affinity-example-affinity_{context}"]
== Pod Affinity

The following example demonstrates pod affinity for pods with matching labels and label selectors.

* The pod *team4* has the label `team:4`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ cat team4.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: team4
  labels:
     team: "4"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ocp
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

* The pod *team4a* has the label selector `team:4` under `podAffinity`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ cat pod-team4a.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: team4a
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: team
            operator: In
            values:
            - "4"
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  containers:
  - name: pod-affinity
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

* The *team4a* pod is scheduled on the same node as the *team4* pod.

[id="nodes-scheduler-pod-affinity-example-antiaffinity_{context}"]
== Pod Anti-affinity

The following example demonstrates pod anti-affinity for pods with matching labels and label selectors.

* The pod *pod-s1* has the label `security:s1`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
cat pod-s1.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-s1
  labels:
    security: s1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ocp
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

* The pod *pod-s2* has the label selector `security:s1` under `podAntiAffinity`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
cat pod-s2.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-s2
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: security
            operator: In
            values:
            - s1
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  containers:
  - name: pod-antiaffinity
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

* The pod *pod-s2* cannot be scheduled on the same node as `pod-s1`.

[id="nodes-scheduler-pod-affinity-example-no-labels_{context}"]
== Pod Affinity with no Matching Labels

The following example demonstrates pod affinity for pods without matching labels and label selectors.

* The pod *pod-s1* has the label `security:s1`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ cat pod-s1.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-s1
  labels:
    security: s1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ocp
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

* The pod *pod-s2* has the label selector `security:s2`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ cat pod-s2.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-s2
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: security
            operator: In
            values:
            - s2
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  containers:
  - name: pod-affinity
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

* The pod *pod-s2* is not scheduled unless there is a node with a pod that has the `security:s2` label. If there is no other pod with that label, the new pod remains in a pending state:
