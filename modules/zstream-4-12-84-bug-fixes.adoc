The following issue is fixed with this release:

* Before this update, a recent regression in `runc` prevented the successful start of pods when the `shareProcessNamespace` parameter was set to `true`. With this release, a subsequent update to `runc` corrects the regression. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65982[OCPBUGS-65982])
