= Disabling fencing on a node

You can disable fencing on a node so that you can perform upgrade or maintenance on the node. This will prevent it from being detected by the `MachineHealthCheck` controller.

.Procedure

* Disable fencing by editing the `healthchecking.openshift.io` annotation to `true`:
+
----
$ oc -n openshift-machine-api annotate machines <node-name>/healthchecking.openshift.io/disabled=true --overwrite
----

The node will no longer be detected as a candidate for fencing.
