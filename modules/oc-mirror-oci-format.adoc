= Mirroring file-based catalog Operator images in OCI format

You can use the oc-mirror plug-in to mirror Operators in the Open Container Initiative (OCI) image format, instead of Docker v2 format. You can copy Operator images to a file-based catalog on disk in OCI format. Then you can copy local OCI images to your target mirror registry.

:FeatureName: Using the oc-mirror plug-in to mirror Operator images in OCI format
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have installed the `oc-mirror` CLI plug-in.

.Procedure

. Optional: Retrieve the catalogs and images that you require and save them to disk. If you already have the catalog image in OCI format on disk, you can skip this step.

.. Create the image set configuration file:
+
.Example image set configuration file for copying to disk
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
mirror:
 operators:
 - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.12
   packages:
   - name: aws-load-balancer-operator
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When using the OCI feature, only the `mirror.operators.catalog` setting is available for use.

The `storageConfig` setting is ignored in favor of the location passed in to the `oc mirror` command.
====

.. Run the `oc mirror` command to mirror the images from the specified image set configuration to disk:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror --config=./imageset-config.yaml \ <1>
  --use-oci-feature \                         <2>
  --oci-feature-action=copy \                 <3>
  oci://my-oci-catalog                        <4>
----
<1> Pass in the image set configuration file. This procedure assumes that it is named `imageset-config.yaml`.
<2> Use the `--use-oci-feature` flag to enable the OCI feature.
<3> To copy the catalog to disk, set the `--oci-feature-action` flag to `copy`.
<4> Specify a directory on disk where you want to output the catalog. This procedure assumes that it is named `my-oci-catalog`. The path must start with `oci://`. If the specified directory is not a full path, the directory is created in the current working directory where the `oc mirror` command is run.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can optionally use the `--oci-registries-config` flag to specify the path to a TOML-formatted `registries.conf` file. You can use this to mirror from a different registry, such as a pre-production location for testing, without having to change the image set configuration file.

.Example registries.conf file
[source,toml]
----
[[registry]]
 location = "registry.redhat.io:5000"
 insecure = false
 blocked = false
 mirror-by-digest-only = true
 prefix = ""
 [[registry.mirror]]
    location = "preprod-registry.example.com"
    insecure = false
----

Set the `location` field in the `registry.mirror` section to an alternative registry location that you want to pull images from. The `location` field in the `registry` section must be the same registry location as the one you specify in the image set configuration file.
====

.. List your directory contents and verify that the following directories were created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls -l
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
my-oci-catalog      <1>
oc-mirror-workspace <2>
olm_artifacts       <3>
----
<1> Directory that contains the OCI catalog. This procedure assumes that it is named `my-oci-catalog`.
<2> Directory that contains each image in the catalog in its original format.
<3> Directory that contains the files that describe the Operator bundles that this catalog references.

. Update the image set configuration file to specify the location of the catalog on disk to mirror to the target mirror registry:
+
.Example image set configuration file for mirroring to mirror registry
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
mirror:
 operators:
 - catalog: oci:///home/user/oc-mirror/my-oci-catalog/redhat-operator-index <1>
   packages:
   - name: aws-load-balancer-operator
----
<1> Specify the absolute path to the location of the OCI catalog on disk. This procedure assumes that you used `my-oci-catalog` as the directory and mirrored the `redhat-operator-index` catalog. The path must start with `oci://`.

. Run the oc mirror command to process the image set file on disk and mirror the contents to a target mirror registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror --config=./imageset-config.yaml \ <1>
  --use-oci-feature \                         <2>
  --oci-feature-action=mirror \               <3>
  docker://registry.example:5000              <4>
----
<1> Pass in the updated image set configuration file. This procedure assumes that it is named `imageset-config.yaml`.
<2> Use the `--use-oci-feature` flag to enable the OCI feature.
<3> To mirror the catalog to the target mirror registry, set the `--oci-feature-action` flag to `mirror`.
<4> Specify the registry to mirror the image set file to. The registry must start with `docker://`. If you specify a top-level namespace for the mirror registry, you must also use this same namespace on subsequent executions.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can optionally use the `--oci-insecure-signature-policy` flag to not push signatures to the target mirror registry.
