= Allowed CRD upgrade changes

The following changes to an existing custom resource definition (CRD) are safe for backwards compatibility and will not cause the CRD upgrade safety preflight check to halt the upgrade:

- Adding new enum values to the list of allowed enum values in a field
- An existing required field is changed to optional in an existing version
- The minimum value of an existing field is decreased in an existing version
- The maximum value of an existing field is increased in an existing version
- A new version of the CRD is added with no modifications to existing versions
