|Name |Description |Type

|`observedGeneration`
|The generation observed by the controller during the most recent reconciliation. The information in the status pertains to this particular generation of the object. The `status.conditions` are not up-to-date if the `status.observedGeneration` field doesn't match `metadata.generation`.
|integer

|`annotations`
|The `annotations` parameter stores additional, usually redundant status information, such as the number of components deployed by the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` object. These statuses are used by the command line tool, `oc`, which does not yet allow counting objects in JSONPath expressions.
|Not configurable

|`readiness`
|The readiness status of components and owned resources.
|string

|`operatorVersion`
|The version of the Operator that last processed this resource.
|string

|`components`
|Shows the status of each deployed control plane component.
|string

|`appliedSpec`
|The resulting specification of the configuration options after all profiles have been applied.
|`ControlPlaneSpec`

|`conditions`
|Represents the latest available observations of the object's current state. `Reconciled` indicates that the Operator has finished reconciling the actual state of deployed components with the configuration in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. `Installed` indicates that the control plane has been installed. `Ready` indicates that all control plane components are ready.
|string

|`chartVersion`
|The version of the charts that were last processed for this resource.
