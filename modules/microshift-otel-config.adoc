= Configuring {microshift-short} Observability

You must configure {microshift-short} Observability after it is installed by specifying a valid endpoint. If an endpoint is not specified, {microshift-short} Observability does not start.

You can specify any OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)-compatible endpoint for each configuration before starting {microshift-short}. 

.Procedure

. Update the `/etc/microshift/observability/opentelemetry-collector.yaml` file to specify an OTLP-compatible endpoint with the following information. The endpoint must link to an IP address or host name, and port number of an OTLP service.

# ...                
----  
<1> Replace `${env:OTEL_BACKEND}` with the IP address or host name of the remote back end. This IP address resolves to the local node's host name. An unreachable endpoint is reported in the {microshift-short} service logs.    

. Each time that you update the `opentelemetry-collector.yaml` file, you must restart {microshift-short} Observability to apply the updates.

Restart {microshift-short} Observability by entering the following command:

$ sudo systemctl restart microshift-observability
