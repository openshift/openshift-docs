= Getting debug information for installation failures

To get debug information about a failed installation, you can perform any of the following tasks.

* Run the installation program with `--log-level=debug`:
+
----
$ sudo ./openshift-install create cluster --dir=assets-dir --log-level=debug
----
+
* Inspect the debug messages. To see the log from a past installation, look in the assets directory for the hidden file, `.openshift_install.log`. For example, enter:
+
----
$ cat ~/assets-dir/.openshift_install.log
----
+
* Gather the most relevant error messages from the installation program. For example:
+
----
$ sudo ./openshift-install gather bootstrap
FATAL bootstrap host address and at least one control plane host address must be provided
----

* Check for timeout errors.
+
Sometimes, the installation program times out while the {product-title} cluster is spinning up in the background. The installation program has three stages where it waits for cluster events. As the events happen, the installation program displays status messages:
+
** After 20 minutes,  `Waiting up to %v for bootstrapping to complete...`
** After 30 minutes, `Waiting up to %v for the cluster at %s to initialize...`
** After 10 minutes, `Waiting up to %v for the openshift-console route to be created...`

* Then use the `wait-for` subcommands to troubleshoot issues related to these stages.
+
To wait until cluster bootstrapping has completed, run the following command:
+
----
$ sudo ./openshift-install wait-for bootstrap-complete
----
+
To wait until the cluster is ready, run the following command:
+
----
$ sudo ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete
----
