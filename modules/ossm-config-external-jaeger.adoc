= Connecting an existing distributed tracing Jaeger instance

If you already have an existing {JaegerName} instance in {product-title}, you can configure your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to use that instance for {DTShortName}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting with {SMProductName} 2.5, {JaegerName} and {es-op} are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Red{nbsp}Hat will provide bug fixes and support for these features during the current release lifecycle, but these features will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed. As an alternative to {JaegerName}, you can use {TempoName} instead.
