= Argo CD Agent Managed mode

In the Argo CD Agent Managed mode, application resources originate on the control plane and are distributed to managed mode clusters.

In the Managed mode, changes on the control plane propagate to workload clusters. Also, direct changes on workload clusters revert to match the control plane definition. With this mode, the control plane is the source of truth for Argo CD application state.

The following list shows the direction of synchronization between the control plane and workload clusters:

* `.spec`- from control plane to workload cluster  
* `.status` - from workload cluster to control plane

The following list highlights the key advantages of using this configuration:

* Provides a familiar, centralized Argo CD experience.  
* Allows creation and management of applications using the control plane Argo CD console, CLI, or API.
* Managed mode is an improvement over traditional Argo CD by eliminating the need for centralized cluster credentials and cluster API access.
* Managed mode improves security by removing the need to centralize cluster credentials.

Consider the following limitations when using this configuration:

* Provides limited support for the app-of-apps pattern.
* Exposes workload clusters to risk if the control plane cluster is compromised, because it changes sync downstream.
* Creates a single point of failure in the control plane, preventing synchronization of application changes to workload clusters if the control plane is non-functional.
