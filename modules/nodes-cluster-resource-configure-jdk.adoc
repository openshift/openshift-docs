= Understanding OpenJDK settings for {product-title}

The default OpenJDK settings do not work well with containerized
environments. As a result, some additional Java memory
settings must always be provided whenever running the OpenJDK in a container.

The JVM memory layout is complex, version dependent, and describing it in detail
is beyond the scope of this documentation. However, as a starting point for
running OpenJDK in a container, at least the following three memory-related
tasks are key:

. Overriding the JVM maximum heap size.

. Encouraging the JVM to release unused memory to the operating system, if
   appropriate.

. Ensuring all JVM processes within a container are appropriately configured.

Optimally tuning JVM workloads for running in a container is beyond the scope of
this documentation, and may involve setting multiple additional JVM options.

== Understanding how to override the JVM maximum heap size

For many Java workloads, the JVM heap is the largest single consumer of memory.
Currently, the OpenJDK defaults to allowing up to 1/4 (1/`-XX:MaxRAMFraction`)
of the compute node's memory to be used for the heap, regardless of whether the
OpenJDK is running in a container or not. It is therefore *essential* to
override this behavior, especially if a container memory limit is also set.

There are at least two ways the above can be achieved:

* If the container memory limit is set and the experimental options are
   supported by the JVM, set `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
   -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap` option has been removed in JDK 11. Use `-XX:+UseContainerSupport` instead.
====
+
This sets `-XX:MaxRAM` to the container memory limit, and the maximum heap size
(`-XX:MaxHeapSize` / `-Xmx`) to 1/`-XX:MaxRAMFraction` (1/4 by default).

* Directly override one of `-XX:MaxRAM`, `-XX:MaxHeapSize` or `-Xmx`.
+
This option involves hard-coding a value, but has the advantage of allowing a
safety margin to be calculated.

[id="nodes-cluster-resource-configure-jdk-unused_{context}"]
== Understanding how to encourage the JVM to release unused memory to the operating system

By default, the OpenJDK does not aggressively return unused memory to the
operating system. This may be appropriate for many containerized Java
workloads, but notable exceptions include workloads where additional active
processes co-exist with a JVM within a container, whether those additional
processes are native, additional JVMs, or a combination of the two.

Java-based agents can use the following JVM arguments to encourage the JVM
to release unused memory to the operating system:

[source,terminal]
----
-XX:+UseParallelGC
-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=5 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=10 -XX:GCTimeRatio=4
-XX:AdaptiveSizePolicyWeight=90.
----

These arguments are intended to return heap
memory to the operating system whenever allocated memory exceeds 110% of in-use
memory (`-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio`), spending up to 20% of CPU time in the garbage
collector (`-XX:GCTimeRatio`). At no time will the application heap allocation
be less than the initial heap allocation (overridden by `-XX:InitialHeapSize` /
`-Xms`). Detailed additional information is available

[id="nodes-cluster-resource-configure-jdk-proc_{context}"]
== Understanding how to ensure all JVM processes within a container are appropriately configured

In the case that multiple JVMs run in the same container, it is essential to
ensure that they are all configured appropriately. For many workloads it will
be necessary to grant each JVM a percentage memory budget, leaving a perhaps
substantial additional safety margin.

Many Java tools use different environment variables (`JAVA_OPTS`, `GRADLE_OPTS`, and so on) to configure their JVMs and it can be challenging to ensure that the right settings are being passed to the right JVM.

The `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable is always respected by the OpenJDK,
and values specified in `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` will be overridden by other options
specified on the JVM command line. By default, to ensure that these options are
used by default for all JVM workloads run in the Java-based agent image, the {product-title} Jenkins Maven agent image sets:

[source,terminal]
----
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
-XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap -Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true"
----

[NOTE]
====
The `UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap` option has been removed in JDK 11. Use `-XX:+UseContainerSupport` instead.
====

This does not guarantee that additional options are not required, but is
intended to be a helpful starting point.
