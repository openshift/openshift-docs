= Understanding OpenJDK settings for {product-title}

The default OpenJDK settings do not work well with containerized
environments. As a result, some additional Java memory settings must always be provided whenever running the OpenJDK in a container.

The JVM memory layout is complex, version dependent, and describing it in detail is beyond the scope of this documentation. However, as a starting point for running OpenJDK in a container, at least the following three memory-related tasks are key:

. Overriding the JVM maximum heap size.

. Encouraging the JVM to release unused memory to the operating system, if appropriate.

. Ensuring all JVM processes within a container are appropriately configured.

Optimally tuning JVM workloads for running in a container is beyond the scope of this documentation, and may involve setting multiple additional JVM options.

== Understanding how to override the JVM maximum heap size

OpenJDK defaults to using a maximum of 25% of available memory (recognising any container memory limits in place) for "heap" memory. This default value is conservative, and in a properly-configured container environment, this value would result in 75% of the memory assigned to a container being mostly unused. A much higher percentage for the JVM to use for heap memory, such as 80%, is more suitable in a container context where memory limits are imposed on the container level.

Most of the Red Hat containers replace the OpenJDK default by means of a startup script - included in those containers - that set updated values when the JVM launches.

For example, the Red Hat build of OpenJDK containers have a default value of 80%. This value can be set to a different percentage by defining the following environment variable:

[source,terminal]
----
JAVA_MAX_RAM_RATIO
----

For other OpenJDK deployements, the default value of 25% can be changed using the following command:

.Example
[source,terminal]
----
java -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80.0
----


[id="nodes-cluster-resource-configure-jdk-unused_{context}"]
== Understanding how to encourage the JVM to release unused memory to the operating system

By default, OpenJDK does not aggressively return unused memory to the operating system. This may be appropriate for many containerized Java workloads, but notable exceptions include workloads where additional active processes co-exist with a JVM within a container, whether those additional processes are native, additional JVMs, or a combination of the two.

Java-based workloads can use the following JVM arguments to encourage the JVM to release unused memory to the operating system:

[source,terminal]
----
-XX:+UseParallelGC
-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=5 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=10 -XX:GCTimeRatio=4
-XX:AdaptiveSizePolicyWeight=90
----

These arguments are intended to return heap memory to the operating system whenever allocated memory exceeds 110% of in-use memory (`-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio`), spending up to 20% of CPU time in the garbage collector (`-XX:GCTimeRatio`). At no time will the application heap allocation be less than the initial heap allocation (overridden by `-XX:InitialHeapSize` /
`-Xms`).

[id="nodes-cluster-resource-configure-jdk-proc_{context}"]
== Understanding how to ensure all JVM processes within a container are appropriately configured

In the case that multiple JVMs run in the same container, it is essential to ensure that they are all configured appropriately. For many workloads it will be necessary to grant each JVM a percentage memory budget, leaving a perhaps substantial additional safety margin.

Many Java tools use different environment variables (`JAVA_OPTS`, `GRADLE_OPTS`, and so on) to configure their JVMs and it can be challenging to ensure that the right settings are being passed to the right JVM.

The `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable is always respected by the OpenJDK, and values specified in `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` will be overridden by other options specified on the JVM command line. By default, to ensure that these options are used by default for all JVM workloads run in the Java-based agent image, the {product-title} Jenkins Maven agent image sets:

[source,terminal]
----
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true"
----

This does not guarantee that additional options are not required, but is intended to be a helpful starting point.
