= Verifying installation of {hcp-title} clusters

If the {hcp-title} cluster is in the installing state for over 30 minutes and has not become ready, ensure the AWS account environment is prepared for the required cluster configurations. If the AWS account environment is prepared for the required cluster configurations correctly, try to delete and recreate the cluster. If the problem persists, contact support.
