= Troubleshooting {ztp} virtual media booting on Supermicro servers

SuperMicro X11 servers do not support virtual media installations when the image is served using the `https` protocol. As a result, {sno} deployments for this environment fail to boot on the target node. To avoid this issue, log in to the hub cluster and disable Transport Layer Security (TLS) in the `Provisioning` resource. This ensures the image is not served with TLS even though the image address uses the `https` scheme. 

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Disable TLS in the `Provisioning` resource by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch provisioning provisioning-configuration --type merge -p '{"spec":{"disableVirtualMediaTLS": true}}'
----

. Continue the steps to deploy your {sno} cluster.
