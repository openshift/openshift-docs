[id="nw-multus-ipam-object_{context}"]
= Configuration of IP address assignment for an additional network

The IP address management (IPAM) Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin provides IP addresses for other CNI plugins.

You can use the following IP address assignment types:

- Static assignment.
- Dynamic assignment through a DHCP server. The DHCP server you specify must be reachable from the additional network.
- Dynamic assignment through the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin.

////
IMPORTANT: If you set the `type` parameter to the `DHCP` value, you cannot set
any other parameters.

[id="nw-multus-static_{context}"]
== Static IP address assignment configuration

The following table describes the configuration for static IP address assignment:

.`ipam` static configuration object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`type`
|`string`
|The IPAM address type. The value `static` is required.

|`addresses`
|`array`
|An array of objects specifying IP addresses to assign to the virtual interface. Both IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses are supported.

|`routes`
|`array`
|An array of objects specifying routes to configure inside the pod.

|`dns`
|`array`
|Optional: An array of objects specifying the DNS configuration.

|====

The `addresses` array requires objects with the following fields:

.`ipam.addresses[]` array
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`address`
|`string`
|An IP address and network prefix that you specify. For example, if you specify `10.10.21.10/24`, then the additional network is assigned an IP address of `10.10.21.10` and the netmask is `255.255.255.0`.

|`gateway`
|`string`
|The default gateway to route egress network traffic to.

|====

.`ipam.routes[]` array
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`dst`
|`string`
|The IP address range in CIDR format, such as `192.168.17.0/24` or `0.0.0.0/0` for the default route.

|`gw`
|`string`
|The gateway where network traffic is routed.

|====

.`ipam.dns` object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`nameservers`
|`array`
|An array of one or more IP addresses for to send DNS queries to.

|`domain`
|`array`
|The default domain to append to a hostname. For example, if the
domain is set to `example.com`, a DNS lookup query for `example-host` is
rewritten as `example-host.example.com`.

|`search`
|`array`
|An array of domain names to append to an unqualified hostname,
such as `example-host`, during a DNS lookup query.

[id="nw-multus-dhcp_{context}"]
== Dynamic IP address (DHCP) assignment configuration

The following JSON describes the configuration for dynamic IP address address assignment with DHCP.

.Renewal of DHCP leases
[IMPORTANT]
====
A pod obtains its original DHCP lease when it is created. The lease must be periodically renewed by a minimal DHCP server deployment running on the cluster.

ifdef::sr-iov[]
The SR-IOV Network Operator does not create a DHCP server deployment; The Cluster Network Operator is responsible for creating the minimal DHCP server deployment.
endif::sr-iov[]

To trigger the deployment of the DHCP server, you must create a shim network attachment by editing the Cluster Network Operator configuration, as in the following example:

[id="nw-multus-whereabouts_{context}"]
== Dynamic IP address assignment configuration with Whereabouts

The Whereabouts CNI plugin allows the dynamic assignment of an IP address to an additional network without the use of a DHCP server.

The following table describes the configuration for dynamic IP address assignment with Whereabouts:

.`ipam` whereabouts configuration object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`type`
|`string`
|The IPAM address type. The value `whereabouts` is required.

|`range`
|`string`
|An IP address and range in CIDR notation. IP addresses are assigned from within this range of addresses.

|`exclude`
|`array`
|Optional: A list of zero or more IP addresses and ranges in CIDR notation. IP addresses within an excluded address range are not assigned.

|====

////
[NOTE]
=====
Whereabouts can be used for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
