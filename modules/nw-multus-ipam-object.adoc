= Configuration of IP address assignment for an additional network

The IP address management (IPAM) Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin provides IP addresses for other CNI plugins.

You can use the following IP address assignment types:

- Static assignment.
- Dynamic assignment through a DHCP server. The DHCP server you specify must be reachable from the additional network.
- Dynamic assignment through the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin.

////
IMPORTANT: If you set the `type` parameter to the `DHCP` value, you cannot set
any other parameters.

== Static IP address assignment configuration

The following table describes the configuration for static IP address assignment:

.`ipam` static configuration object

|Field|Type|Description

|`type`
|`string`
|The IPAM address type. The value `static` is required.

[id="nw-multus-dhcp_{context}"]
== Dynamic IP address (DHCP) assignment configuration

The following JSON describes the configuration for dynamic IP address address assignment with DHCP.

.Renewal of DHCP leases
[IMPORTANT]
====
A pod obtains its original DHCP lease when it is created. The lease must be periodically renewed by a minimal DHCP server deployment running on the cluster.

ifdef::sr-iov[]
The SR-IOV Network Operator does not create a DHCP server deployment; The Cluster Network Operator is responsible for creating the minimal DHCP server deployment.
endif::sr-iov[]

To trigger the deployment of the DHCP server, you must create a shim network attachment by editing the Cluster Network Operator configuration, as in the following example:

== Dynamic IP address assignment configuration with Whereabouts

The Whereabouts CNI plugin allows the dynamic assignment of an IP address to an additional network without the use of a DHCP server.

The following table describes the configuration for dynamic IP address assignment with Whereabouts:

.`ipam` whereabouts configuration object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`type`
|`string`
|The IPAM address type. The value `whereabouts` is required.

|`range`
|`string`
|An IP address and range in CIDR notation. IP addresses are assigned from within this range of addresses.

|`exclude`
|`array`
|Optional: A list of zero or more IP addresses and ranges in CIDR notation. IP addresses within an excluded address range are not assigned.

|====

////
[NOTE]
=====
Whereabouts can be used for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

[id="nw-multus-creating-whereabouts-reconciler-daemon-set_{context}"]
== Creating a Whereabouts reconciler daemon set

The Whereabouts reconciler is responsible for managing dynamic IP address assignments for the pods within a cluster using the Whereabouts IP Address Management (IPAM) solution. It ensures that each pods gets a unique IP address from the specified IP address range. It also handles IP address releases when pods are deleted or scaled down.

[NOTE]
====
You can also use a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resource for dynamic IP address assignment.
====

The Whereabouts reconciler daemon set is automatically created when you configure an additional network through the Cluster Network Operator. It is not automatically created when you configure an additional network from a YAML manifest.

To trigger the deployment of the Whereabouts reconciler daemonset, you must manually create a `whereabouts-shim` network attachment by editing the Cluster Network Operator custom resource file.

Use the following procedure to deploy the Whereabouts reconciler daemonset.

.Procedure

. Edit the `Network.operator.openshift.io` custom resource (CR) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit network.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. Modify the `additionalNetworks` parameter in the CR to add the `whereabouts-shim` network attachment definition. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks:
  - name: whereabouts-shim
    namespace: default
    rawCNIConfig: |-
      {
       "name": "whereabouts-shim",
       "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
       "type": "bridge",
       "ipam": {
         "type": "whereabouts"
       }
      }
    type: Raw
----

. Save the file and exit the text editor.

. Verify that the `whereabouts-reconciler` daemon set deployed successfully by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get all -n openshift-multus | grep whereabouts-reconciler
----
+
