[id="nw-multus-ipam-object_{context}"]
= Configuration for ipam CNI plug-in

The ipam Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in provides IP address management (IPAM) for other CNI plug-ins.

ifdef::json[]
You can use the following methods for IP address assignment:

- Static assignment.
- Dynamic assignment through a DHCP server. The DHCP server you specify must be reachable from the additional network.
- Dynamic assignment through the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plug-in.
endif::json[]

ifdef::yaml[]
The following YAML configuration describes the parameters that you can set.
endif::yaml[]

////
IMPORTANT: If you set the `type` parameter to the `DHCP` value, you cannot set
any other parameters.

<1> An array describing IP addresses to assign to the virtual interface. Both
IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses are supported.

<2> An IP address and network prefix that you specify. For example, if you specify `10.10.21.10/24`, then the additional network is assigned an IP address of `10.10.21.10` and the netmask is `255.255.255.0`.

<3> The default gateway to route egress network traffic to.

<4> An array describing routes to configure inside the pod.

<5> The IP address range in CIDR format, such as `192.168.17.0/24`, or `0.0.0.0/0` for the default route.

<6> The gateway where network traffic is routed.

<7> Optional: DNS configuration.

<8> An of array of one or more IP addresses for to send DNS queries to.

<9> The default domain to append to a hostname. For example, if the
domain is set to `example.com`, a DNS lookup query for `example-host` is
rewritten as `example-host.example.com`.

<10> An array of domain names to append to an unqualified hostname,
such as `example-host`, during a DNS lookup query.

[id="nw-multus-dhcp_{context}"]
== Dynamic IP address assignment configuration

The following JSON describes the configuration for dynamic IP address address assignment with DHCP.

.Renewal of DHCP leases
[IMPORTANT]
====
A pod obtains its original DHCP lease when it is created. The lease must be periodically renewed by a minimal DHCP server deployment running on the cluster.

ifdef::sr-iov[]
The SR-IOV Network Operator does not create a DHCP server deployment; The Cluster Network Operator is responsible for creating the minimal DHCP server deployment.
endif::sr-iov[]

To trigger the deployment of the DHCP server, you must create a shim network attachment by editing the Cluster Network Operator configuration, as in the following example:

[id="nw-multus-whereabouts_{context}"]
== Dynamic IP address assignment configuration with Whereabouts

The Whereabouts CNI plug-in allows the dynamic assignment of an IP address to an additional network without the use of a DHCP server.

[NOTE]
=====
Whereabouts can be used for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
