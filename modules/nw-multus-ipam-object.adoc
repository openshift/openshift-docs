= Configuration of IP address assignment for a network attachment

For additional networks, IP addresses can be assigned using an IP Address Management (IPAM) CNI plugin, which supports various assignment methods, including Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and static assignment.

The DHCP IPAM CNI plugin responsible for dynamic assignment of IP addresses operates with two distinct components:

* *CNI Plugin*: Responsible for integrating with the Kubernetes networking stack to request and release IP addresses.
* *DHCP IPAM CNI Daemon*: A listener for DHCP events that coordinates with existing DHCP servers in the environment to handle IP address assignment requests. This daemon is _not_ a DHCP server itself.

For networks requiring `type: dhcp` in their IPAM configuration, ensure the following:

* A DHCP server is available and running in the environment. The DHCP server is external to the cluster and is expected to be part of the customer's existing network infrastructure.
* The DHCP server is appropriately configured to serve IP addresses to the nodes.

In cases where a DHCP server is unavailable in the environment, it is recommended to use the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin instead. The Whereabouts CNI provides similar IP address management capabilities without the need for an external DHCP server.

[NOTE]
====
Use the Whereabouts CNI plugin when there is no external DHCP server or where static IP address management is preferred. The Whereabouts plugin includes a reconciler daemon to manage stale IP address allocations.
====

A DHCP lease must be periodically renewed throughout the container's lifetime, so a separate daemon, the DHCP IPAM CNI Daemon, is required. To deploy the DHCP IPAM CNI daemon, modify the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration to trigger the deployment of this daemon as part of the additional network setup.

////
IMPORTANT: If you set the `type` parameter to the `DHCP` value, you cannot set any other parameters.

|Field|Type|Description

|`type`
|`string`

|`array`
|An array of objects specifying routes to configure inside the pod.

The `addresses` array requires objects with the following fields:

.`ipam.addresses[]` array
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`address`
|`string`
|An IP address and network prefix that you specify. For example, if you specify `10.10.21.10/24`, then the additional network is assigned an IP address of `10.10.21.10` and the netmask is `255.255.255.0`.

|`gateway`
|`string`
|The default gateway to route egress network traffic to.

|====

.`ipam.routes[]` array
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`dst`
|`string`
|The IP address range in CIDR format, such as `192.168.17.0/24` or `0.0.0.0/0` for the default route.

|`gw`
|`string`
|The gateway where network traffic is routed.

|====

.`ipam.dns` object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`nameservers`
|`array`
|An array of one or more IP addresses for to send DNS queries to.

|`domain`
|`array`
|The default domain to append to a hostname. For example, if the
domain is set to `example.com`, a DNS lookup query for `example-host` is
rewritten as `example-host.example.com`.

|`search`
|`array`
|An array of domain names to append to an unqualified hostname,
such as `example-host`, during a DNS lookup query.

[id="nw-multus-dhcp_{context}"]
== Dynamic IP address (DHCP) assignment configuration

A pod obtains its original DHCP lease when it is created. The lease must be periodically renewed by a minimal DHCP server deployment running on the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For an Ethernet network attachment, the SR-IOV Network Operator does not create a DHCP server deployment; the Cluster Network Operator is responsible for creating the minimal DHCP server deployment.
====

To trigger the deployment of the DHCP server, you must create a shim network attachment by editing the Cluster Network Operator configuration, as in the following example:

.Example shim network attachment definition
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster

[id="nw-multus-whereabouts_{context}"]
== Dynamic IP address assignment configuration with Whereabouts

The Whereabouts CNI plugin allows the dynamic assignment of an IP address to an additional network without the use of a DHCP server. 

The Whereabouts CNI plugin also supports overlapping IP address ranges and configuration of the same CIDR range multiple times within separate `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRDs. This provides greater flexibility and management capabilities in multi-tenant environments.

[id="dynamic-ip-address-assignment-objects_{context}"]
=== Dynamic IP address configuration objects

The following table describes the configuration objects for dynamic IP address assignment with Whereabouts:

.`ipam` whereabouts configuration object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`type`
|`string`
|The IPAM address type. The value `whereabouts` is required.

|`range`
|`string`
|An IP address and range in CIDR notation. IP addresses are assigned from within this range of addresses.

|`exclude`
|`array`
|Optional: A list of zero or more IP addresses and ranges in CIDR notation. IP addresses within an excluded address range are not assigned.

|`network_name`
|`string`
| Optional: Helps ensure that each group or domain of pods gets its own set of IP addresses, even if they share the same range of IP addresses. Setting this field is important for keeping networks separate and organized, notably in multi-tenant environments.
