[id="nw-multus-ipam-object_{context}"]
= Configuration of IP address assignment for an additional network

The IP address management (IPAM) Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in provides IP addresses for other CNI plug-ins.

You can use the following IP address assignment types:

- Static assignment.
- Dynamic assignment through a DHCP server. The DHCP server you specify must be reachable from the additional network.
- Dynamic assignment through the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plug-in.

////
IMPORTANT: If you set the `type` parameter to the `DHCP` value, you cannot set
any other parameters.

== Static IP address assignment configuration

The following table describes the configuration for static IP address assignment:

.`ipam` static configuration object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`type`
|`string`
|The IPAM address type. The value `static` is required.

|`addresses`
|`array`
|An array of objects specifying IP addresses to assign to the virtual interface. Both IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses are supported.

|`routes`
|`array`
|An array of objects specifying routes to configure inside the pod.

|`dns`
|`array`
|Optional: An array of objects specifying the DNS configuration.

|====

The `adddresses` array requires objects with the following fields:

.`ipam.addresses[]` array
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`address`
|`string`
|An IP address and network prefix that you specify. For example, if you specify `10.10.21.10/24`, then the additional network is assigned an IP address of `10.10.21.10` and the netmask is `255.255.255.0`.

|`gateway`
|`string`
|The default gateway to route egress network traffic to.

|====

.`ipam.routes[]` array
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`dst`
|`string`
|The IP address range in CIDR format, such as `192.168.17.0/24` or `0.0.0.0/0` for the default route.

|`gw`
|`string`
|The gateway where network traffic is routed.

|====

.`ipam.dns` object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`nameservers`
|`array`
|An of array of one or more IP addresses for to send DNS queries to.

|`domain`
|`array`
|The default domain to append to a hostname. For example, if the
domain is set to `example.com`, a DNS lookup query for `example-host` is
rewritten as `example-host.example.com`.

|`search`
|`array`
|An array of domain names to append to an unqualified hostname,
such as `example-host`, during a DNS lookup query.

[id="nw-multus-dhcp_{context}"]
== Dynamic IP address (DHCP) assignment configuration

The following JSON describes the configuration for dynamic IP address address assignment with DHCP.

.Renewal of DHCP leases
[IMPORTANT]
====
A pod obtains its original DHCP lease when it is created. The lease must be periodically renewed by a minimal DHCP server deployment running on the cluster.

ifdef::sr-iov[]
The SR-IOV Network Operator does not create a DHCP server deployment; The Cluster Network Operator is responsible for creating the minimal DHCP server deployment.
endif::sr-iov[]

To trigger the deployment of the DHCP server, you must create a shim network attachment by editing the Cluster Network Operator configuration, as in the following example:

[id="nw-multus-whereabouts_{context}"]
== Dynamic IP address assignment configuration with Whereabouts

The Whereabouts CNI plug-in allows the dynamic assignment of an IP address to an additional network without the use of a DHCP server.

The following table describes the configuration for dynamic IP address assignment with Whereabouts:

.`ipam` whereabouts configuration object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`type`
|`string`
|The IPAM address type. The value `whereabouts` is required.

|`range`
|`string`
|An IP address and range in CIDR notation. IP addresses are assigned from within this range of addresses.

|`exclude`
|`array`
|Optional: A list of zero ore more IP addresses and ranges in CIDR notation. IP addresses within an excluded address range are not assigned.

|====

////
[NOTE]
=====
Whereabouts can be used for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
