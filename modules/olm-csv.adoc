= ClusterServiceVersion

A _ClusterServiceVersion_ (CSV) represents a specific version of a running
Operator on an {product-title} cluster. It is a YAML manifest created from
Operator metadata that assists Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) in running the
Operator in the cluster.

OLM requires this metadata about an Operator to ensure that it can be kept
running safely on a cluster, and to provide information about how updates should
be applied as new versions of the Operator are published. This is similar to
packaging software for a traditional operating system; think of the packaging
step for OLM as the stage at which you make your `rpm`, `dep`, or `apk` bundle.

A CSV includes the metadata that accompanies an Operator container image, used
to populate user interfaces with information such as its name, version, description, labels, repository link, and logo.

A CSV is also a source of technical information required to run the Operator,
such as which Custom Resources (CRs) it manages or depends on, RBAC rules,
cluster requirements, and install strategies. This information tells OLM how to
create required resources and set up the Operator as a Deployment.
