= ClusterServiceVersions (CSVs)

A _ClusterServiceVersion_ (CSV) is a YAML manifest created from Operator
metadata that assists the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) in running the
Operator in a cluster.

A CSV is the metadata that accompanies an Operator container image, used to
populate user interfaces with information like its logo, description, and
version. It is also a source of technical information needed to run the
Operator, like the RBAC rules it requires and which Custom Resources (CRs) it
manages or depends on.

A CSV is composed of:

Metadata::
* Application metadata:
** Name, description, version (semver compliant), links, labels, icon, etc.

Install strategy::
* Type: Deployment
** Set of service accounts and required permissions
** Set of Deployments.

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)::
* Type
* Owned: Managed by this service
* Required: Must exist in the cluster for this service to run
* Resources: A list of resources that the Operator interacts with
* Descriptors: Annotate CRD spec and status fields to provide semantic information
