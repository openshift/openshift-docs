|===

. The `WasmPlugin` API for extending Istio using Web Assembly extensions is supported, but support is not provided for any Web Assembly extension modules unless explicitly documented.

. The `EnvoyFilter` API is available for use with {SMProductName}, but is not supported, except where explicitly documented. Due to tight coupling with the underlying Envoy APIs, backward compatibility cannot be maintained. Note that `EnvoyFilter` patches are very sensitive to the format of the Envoy configuration that is generated by Istio. If the configuration generated by Istio changes, it has the potential to break the application of the `EnvoyFilter` configuration. Any configuration provided through this API should be carefully monitored across Istio proxy version upgrades to ensure that deprecated fields are removed and replaced appropriately. If a support case is raised where an `EnvoyFilter` configuration is used, Red Hat might request that the issue be reproduced with the `EnvoyFilter` configuration removed.
