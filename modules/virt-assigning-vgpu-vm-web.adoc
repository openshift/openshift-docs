= Assigning a vGPU to a VM by using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can assign virtual GPUs to virtual machines by using the {product-title} web console.

[NOTE]
====
You can add hardware devices to virtual machines created from customized templates or a YAML file. You cannot add devices to pre-supplied boot source templates for specific operating systems.
====

.Prerequisites

* The vGPU is configured as a mediated device in your cluster.
** To view the devices that are connected to your cluster, click *Compute* -> *Hardware Devices* from the side menu.
* The VM is stopped.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, click *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines* from the side menu.
. Select the VM that you want to assign the device to.
. On the *Details* tab, click *GPU devices*.
. Click *Add GPU device*.
. Enter an identifying value in the *Name* field.
. From the *Device name* list, select the device that you want to add to the VM.
. Click *Save*.

.Verification
* To confirm that the devices were added to the VM, click the *YAML* tab and review the `VirtualMachine` configuration. Mediated devices are added to the `spec.domain.devices` stanza.
