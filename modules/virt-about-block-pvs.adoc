= About block persistent volumes

A block persistent volume (PV) is a PV that is backed by a raw block device. These volumes
do not have a file system and can provide performance benefits for
virtual machines by reducing overhead.

Raw block volumes are provisioned by specifying `volumeMode: Block` in the
PV and persistent volume claim (PVC) specification.
