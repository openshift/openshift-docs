= Running a migration plan in the {mtc-short} web console

You can stage or migrate applications and data with the migration plan you created in the {mtc-short} web console.

.Prerequisites

The {mtc-short} web console must contain the following:

* Source cluster
* Target cluster
* Replication repository
* Valid migration plan

.Procedure

. Log in to the source cluster.
. Delete old images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune images
----

. Log in to the {mtc-short} web console.
. Select a migration plan.
. Click *Stage* to copy data from the source cluster to the target cluster without stopping the application.
+
You can run *Stage* multiple times to reduce the actual migration time.

. When you are ready to migrate the application workload, click *Migrate*.
+
*Migrate* stops the application workload on the source cluster and recreates its resources on the target cluster.

. Optional: In the *Migrate* window, you can select *Do not stop applications on the source cluster during migration*.
. Click *Migrate*.
. Optional: To stop a migration in progress, click the Options menu {kebab} and select *Cancel*.
. When the migration is complete, verify that the application migrated successfully in the {product-title} web console:

.. Click *Home* -> *Projects*.
.. Click the migrated project to view its status.
.. In the *Routes* section, click *Location* to verify that the application is functioning, if applicable.
.. Click *Workloads* -> *Pods* to verify that the pods are running in the migrated namespace.
.. Click *Storage* -> *Persistent volumes* to verify that the migrated persistent volume is correctly provisioned.
