= Running a migration plan in the CAM web console

You can stage or migrate applications and data with the migration plan you created in the CAM web console.

.Prerequisites

The CAM web console must contain the following:

* Source cluster
* Target cluster, which is added automatically during the CAM tool installation
* Replication repository
* Valid migration plan

.Procedure

. Log in to the CAM web console on the target cluster.
. Select a migration plan.
. Click *Stage* to copy data from the source cluster to the target cluster without stopping the application.
+
You can run *Stage* multiple times to reduce the actual migration time.

. When you are ready to migrate the application workload, click *Migrate*.
+
*Migrate* stops the application workload on the source cluster and recreates its resources on the target cluster.

. Optionally, in the *Migrate* window, you can select *Do not stop applications on the source cluster during migration*.
. Click *Migrate*.
. When the migration is complete, verify that the application migrated successfully in the {product-title} web console:

.. Click *Home* -> *Projects*.
.. Click the migrated project to view its status.
.. In the *Routes* section, click *Location* to verify that the application is functioning, if applicable.
.. Click *Workloads* -> *Pods* to verify that the Pods are running in the migrated namespace.
.. Click *Storage* -> *Persistent volumes* to verify that the migrated persistent volume is correctly provisioned.
