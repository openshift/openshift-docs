[id="migration-running-migration-plan-cam_{context}"]
= Running a migration plan in the {mtc-short} web console

You can stage or migrate applications and data with the migration plan you created in the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) web console.

[NOTE]
====
During migration, {mtc-short} sets the reclaim policy of migrated persistent volumes (PVs) to `Retain` on the target cluster.

The `Backup` custom resource contains a `PVOriginalReclaimPolicy` annotation that indicates the original reclaim policy. You can manually restore the reclaim policy of the migrated PVs.
====

.Prerequisites

The {mtc-short} web console must contain the following:

* Source cluster in a `Ready` state
* Target cluster in a `Ready` state
* Replication repository
* Valid migration plan

.Procedure

. Log in to the source cluster.
. Delete old images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune images
----

. Log in to the {mtc-short} web console and click *Migration plans*.
. Click the *Options* menu {kebab} next to a migration plan and select *Stage* to copy data from the source cluster to the target cluster without stopping the application.
+
You can run *Stage* multiple times to reduce the actual migration time.

. When you are ready to migrate the application workload, the *Options* menu {kebab} beside a migration plan and select *Migrate*.

. Optional: In the *Migrate* window, you can select *Do not stop applications on the source cluster during migration*.
. Click *Migrate*.
. When the migration is complete, verify that the application migrated successfully in the {product-title} web console:

.. Click *Home* -> *Projects*.
.. Click the migrated project to view its status.
.. In the *Routes* section, click *Location* to verify that the application is functioning, if applicable.
.. Click *Workloads* -> *Pods* to verify that the pods are running in the migrated namespace.
.. Click *Storage* -> *Persistent volumes* to verify that the migrated persistent volumes are correctly provisioned.
