= Running a migration plan in the {mtc-short} web console

You can migrate applications and data with the migration plan you created in the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) web console.

[NOTE]
====
During migration, {mtc-short} sets the reclaim policy of migrated persistent volumes (PVs) to `Retain` on the target cluster.

The `Backup` custom resource contains a `PVOriginalReclaimPolicy` annotation that indicates the original reclaim policy. You can manually restore the reclaim policy of the migrated PVs.
====

.Prerequisites

The {mtc-short} web console must contain the following:

* Source cluster in a `Ready` state
* Target cluster in a `Ready` state
* Replication repository
* Valid migration plan

.Procedure

. Log in to the {mtc-short} web console and click *Migration plans*.
. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to a migration plan and select one of the following options under *Migration*:

* *Stage* copies data from the source cluster to the target cluster without stopping the application.
* *Cutover* stops the transactions on the source cluster and moves the resources to the target cluster.
+
Optional: In the *Cutover migration* dialog, you can clear the *Halt transactions on the source cluster during migration* checkbox.

* *State* copies selected persistent volume claims (PVCs).
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use state migration to migrate a namespace between clusters. Use stage or cutover migration instead.
====

** Select one or more PVCs in the *State migration* dialog and click *Migrate*.

. When the migration is complete, verify that the application migrated successfully in the {product-title} web console:

.. Click *Home* -> *Projects*.
.. Click the migrated project to view its status.
.. In the *Routes* section, click *Location* to verify that the application is functioning, if applicable.
.. Click *Workloads* -> *Pods* to verify that the pods are running in the migrated namespace.
.. Click *Storage* -> *Persistent volumes* to verify that the migrated persistent volumes are correctly provisioned.
