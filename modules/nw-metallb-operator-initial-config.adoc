= Starting MetalLB on your cluster

After you install the Operator, you need to configure a single instance of a MetalLB custom resource. After you configure the custom resource, the Operator starts MetalLB on your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* Install the MetalLB Operator.

.Procedure

. Create a single instance of a MetalLB custom resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: MetalLB
metadata:
  name: metallb
  namespace: metallb-system
EOF
----

.Verification

Confirm that the deployment for the MetalLB controller and the daemon set for the MetalLB speaker are running.

. Check that the deployment for the controller is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment -n metallb-system controller
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
controller   1/1     1            1           11m
----

. Check that the daemon set for the speaker is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get daemonset -n metallb-system speaker
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR            AGE
speaker   6         6         6       6            6           kubernetes.io/os=linux   18m
----

The example output indicates 6 speaker pods. The number of speaker pods in your cluster might differ from the example output. Make sure the output indicates one pod for each node in your cluster.
