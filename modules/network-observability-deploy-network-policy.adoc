[id="network-observability-deploy-network-policy_{context}"]
= Configuring an ingress network policy by using the FlowCollector custom resource
You can configure the `FlowCollector` custom resource (CR) to deploy an ingress network policy for Network Observability by setting the `spec.NetworkPolicy.enable` specification to `true`. By default, the specification is `false`.

If you have installed Loki, Kafka or any exporter in a different namespace that also has a network policy, you must ensure that the Network Observability components can communicate with them. Consider the following about your setup:

   * Connection to Loki (as defined in the `FlowCollector` CR `spec.loki` parameter)
   * Connection to Kafka (as defined in the `FlowCollector` CR `spec.kafka` parameter)
   * Connection to any exporter (as defined in FlowCollector CR `spec.exporters` parameter)
   * If you are using Loki and including it in the policy target, connection to an external object storage (as defined in your `LokiStack` related secret)

.Procedure
. . In the web console, go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.
. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for *Network Observability*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster* then select the *YAML* tab.
. Configure the `FlowCollector` CR. A sample configuration is as follows:
