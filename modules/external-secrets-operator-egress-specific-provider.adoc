= Adding a custom network policy to allow egress to a specific provider

You must configure custom policies through the `ExternalSecretsConfig` custom resource to allow all egress to a specific provider.

.Prerequisites

* An `ExternalSecretsConfig` must be predefined.

* You must be able to define specific egress rules, including desitination ports and protocols

.Procedure

. Edit the `ExternalSecretsConfig` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit externalsecretsconfigs.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. Set the policy by editing the `networkPolicies` section. The following example shows how to allow egress to {aws-first} endpoints.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ExternalSecretsConfig
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  controllerConfig:
    networkPolicies:
      - componentName: ExternalSecretsCoreController
        egress:
          # Allow egress to Kubernetes API server, AWS endpoints, and DNS
          - ports:
              - port: 443   # HTTPS (AWS Secrets Manager)
                protocol: TCP
      - name: allow-external-secrets-egress
----

componentName:: name for the core controller specified as `ExternalSecretsCoreController`.

Egress rules must include the necessary ports, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 443 for services like the {aws-short} Secrets Manager.
