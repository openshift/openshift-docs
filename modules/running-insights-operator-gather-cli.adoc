= Running an Insights Operator gather operation from the OpenShift CLI
You can run an Insights Operator gather operation by using the {product-title} command line interface.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to {product-title} as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure
* Enter the following command to run the gather operation:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <your_datagather_definition>.yaml
----
+
Replace `<your_datagather_definition>.yaml` with a configuration file that contains the following parameters:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather> <1>
spec:
 gatherers: <2>
   - name: workloads
     state: Disabled
----
+
--
<1> Under *metadata*, replace `<your_data_gather>` with a unique name for the gather operation.
<2> Under *gatherers*, specify any individual gather operations that you intend to disable. In the example provided, `workloads` is the only data gather operation that is disabled and all of the other default operations are set to run.
When the `spec` parameter is empty, all of the default gather operations run.
--

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not add a prefix of `periodic-gathering-` to the name of your gather operation because this string is reserved for other administrative operations and might impact the intended gather operation.
====

.Verification

* Check that your new gather operation is prefixed with your chosen name under the list of pods in the `openshift-insights` project. Upon completion, the Insights Operator automatically uploads the data to Red Hat for processing.
