= Version comparison strings

You can define a version range by adding a comparison string to the `spec.version` field in an Operator or extension's custom resource (CR). A comparison string is a list of space- or comma-separated values and one or more comparison operators. You can add another comparison string by including an `OR`, or double vertical bar (`||`), comparison operator between the strings.

.Basic comparisons
[options="header"]
|===

|Comparison operator |Definition

|`=`
|Equal to

|`!=`
|Not equal to

|`>`
|Greater than

| `<`
|Less than

|`>=`
|Greater than or equal to

|`\<=`
|Less than or equal to

|===

You can specify a version range in an Operator or extension's CR by using a range comparison similar to the following example:

.Example version range comparison
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Operator
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  version: >=1.11, <1.13
----

You can use wildcard characters in all types of comparison strings. {olmv1} accepts `x`, `X`, and asterisks (`*`) as wildcard characters. When you use a wildcard character with the equal sign (`=`) comparison operator, you define a comparison at the patch or minor version level.

|Wildcard comparison |Matching string

|`1.11.x`
|`>=1.11.0, <1.12.0`

|`>=1.12.X`
|`>=1.12.0`

|`\<=2.x`
|`<3`

|`*`
|`>=0.0.0`

|===

You can make patch release comparisons by using the tilde (`~`) comparison operator. Patch release comparisons specify a minor version up to the next major version.

.Example patch release comparisons
[options="header"]
|===

|Patch release comparison |Matching string

|`~1.11.0`
|`>=1.11.0, <1.12.0`

|`~1`
|`>=1, <2`

|`~1.12`
|`>=1.12, <1.13`

|`~1.12.x`
|`>=1.12.0, <1.13.0`

|`~1.x`
|`>=1, <2`

|===

You can use the caret (`^`) comparison operator to make a comparison for a major release. If you use a major release comparison before the first stable release is published, the minor versions define the API's level of stability. In the semantic versioning (SemVer) specification, the first stable release is published as the `1.0.0` version.

|Major release comparison |Matching string

|`^0`
|`>=0.0.0, <1.0.0`

|`^0.0`
|`>=0.0.0, <0.1.0`

|`^0.0.3`
|`>=0.0.3, <0.0.4`

|`^0.2`
|`>=0.2.0, <0.3.0`

|`^0.2.3`
|`>=0.2.3, <0.3.0`

|`^1.2.x`
|`>= 1.2.0, < 2.0.0`

|`^1.2.3`
|`>= 1.2.3, < 2.0.0`

|`^2.x`
|`>= 2.0.0, < 3`

|`^2.3`
|`>= 2.3, < 3`
