= {rh-rhacm} generated cluster installation CRs reference

{rh-rhacm-first} supports deploying {product-title} on single-node clusters, three-node clusters, and standard clusters with a specific set of installation custom resources (CRs) that you generate using `ClusterInstance` CRs for each cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Every managed cluster has its own namespace, and all of the installation CRs except for `ManagedCluster` and `ClusterImageSet` are under that namespace. `ManagedCluster` and `ClusterImageSet` are cluster-scoped, not namespace-scoped. The namespace and the CR names match the cluster name.
====

The following table lists the installation CRs that are automatically applied by the {rh-rhacm} assisted service when it installs clusters using the `ClusterInstance` CRs that you configure.

|CR |Description |Usage

|`BareMetalHost`
|Contains the connection information for the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) of the target bare-metal host.
|Provides access to the BMC to load and start the discovery image on the target server by using the Redfish protocol.

|`InfraEnv`
|Contains information for installing {product-title} on the target bare-metal host.
|Used with `ClusterDeployment` to generate the discovery ISO for the managed cluster.

|`AgentClusterInstall`
|Specifies details of the managed cluster configuration such as networking and the number of control plane nodes. Displays the cluster `kubeconfig` and credentials when the installation is complete.
|Specifies the managed cluster configuration information and provides status during the installation of the cluster.

|`ClusterDeployment`
|References the `AgentClusterInstall` CR to use.
|Used with `InfraEnv` to generate the discovery ISO for the managed cluster.

|`NMStateConfig`
|Provides network configuration information such as `MAC` address to `IP` mapping, DNS server, default route, and other network settings.
|Sets up a static IP address for the managed cluster’s Kube API server.

|`Agent`
|Contains hardware information about the target bare-metal host.
|Created automatically on the hub when the target machine's discovery image boots.

|`ManagedCluster`
|When a cluster is managed by the hub, it must be imported and known. This Kubernetes object provides that interface.
|The hub uses this resource to manage and show the status of managed clusters.

|`KlusterletAddonConfig`
|Contains the list of services provided by the hub to be deployed to the `ManagedCluster` resource.
|Tells the hub which addon services to deploy to the `ManagedCluster` resource.

|`Namespace`
|Logical space for `ManagedCluster` resources existing on the hub. Unique per site.
|Propagates resources to the `ManagedCluster`.

| `Secret`
|Two CRs are created: `BMC Secret` and `Image Pull Secret`.
a| * `BMC Secret` authenticates into the target bare-metal host using its username and password.
* `Image Pull Secret` contains authentication information for the {product-title} image installed on the target bare-metal host.

|`ClusterImageSet`
|Contains {product-title} image information such as the repository and image name.
|Passed into resources to provide {product-title} images.
