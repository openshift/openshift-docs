You can review the known issues for the Network Observability Operator 1.8.0 release.

* If there is traffic that uses overlapping subnets in your cluster, there is a small risk that the eBPF Agent mixes up the flows from overlapped IPs. This can happen if different connections happen to have the exact same source and destination IPs and if ports and protocol are within a 5 seconds time frame and happening on the same node. This should not be possible unless you configured secondary networks or UDN. Even in that case, it is still very unlikely in usual traffic, as source ports are usually a good differentiator. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-2115[*NETOBSERV-2115*])

* After selecting a type of exporter to configure in the `FlowCollector` resource `spec.exporters` section from the {product-title} web console form view, the detailed configuration for that type does not show up in the form. The workaround is to configure directly the YAML. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1981[*NETOBSERV-1981*])
