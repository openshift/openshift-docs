= Creating a {name} policy to allow traffic from external clients

With the `deny-by-default` policy in place you can proceed to configure a policy that allows traffic from external clients to a pod with the label `app=web`.

[NOTE]
====
If you log in with a user with the `cluster-admin` role, then you can create a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
====

Follow this procedure to configure a policy that allows external service from the public Internet directly or by using a Load Balancer to access the pod. Traffic is only allowed to a pod with the label `app=web`.

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports `NetworkPolicy` objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin or the OpenShift SDN network plugin with `mode: NetworkPolicy` set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `{role}` privileges.
* You are working in the namespace that the {name} policy applies to.

.Procedure

. Create a policy that allows traffic from the public Internet directly or by using a load balancer to access the pod. Save the YAML in the `web-allow-external.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ifndef::multi[]
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
endif::multi[]
ifdef::multi[]
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiNetworkPolicy
endif::multi[]
metadata:
  name: web-allow-external
  namespace: default
ifdef::multi[]
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/policy-for: <network_name>
endif::multi[]
spec:
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  ingress:
    - {}
----

. Apply the policy by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f web-allow-external.yaml
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
ifndef::multi[]
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/web-allow-external created
endif::multi[]
ifdef::multi[]
multinetworkpolicy.k8s.cni.cncf.io/web-allow-external created
endif::multi[]
----

This policy allows traffic from all resources, including external traffic as illustrated in the following diagram:
