= Testing generated policies in the network graph (2.0 preview)

After you download the network policies that {product-title-short} generates, you can test them by applying them to your cluster.

.Procedure
. To create policies using the saved YAML file, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f "<generated_file>.yml" <1>
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.
. If the generated policies cause problems, you can remove them by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f "<generated_file>.yml" <1>
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.

[WARNING]
====
Directly applying network policies might cause problems for running applications.
Always download and test the network policies in a development environment or test clusters before applying them to production workloads.
