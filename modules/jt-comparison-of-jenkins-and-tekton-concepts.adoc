This section summarizes the basic terms used in Jenkins and Tekton, and compares the equivalent terms.

== Jenkins terminology
Jenkins offers declarative and scripted pipelines that are extensible using shared libraries and plugins. Some basic terms in Jenkins are as follows:

* *Pipeline*: Automates the entire process of building, testing, and deploying applications, using the link:https://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] syntax.
* *Node*: A machine capable of either orchestrating or executing a scripted pipeline.
* *Stage*: A conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed in a pipeline. Plugins or user interfaces often use this block to display status or progress of tasks.
* **Step**: A single task that specifies the exact action to be taken, either by using a command or a script.

== Tekton terminology
Tekton uses the link:https://yaml.org/[YAML] syntax for declarative pipelines and consists of tasks. Some basic terms in Tekton are as follows:

* **Pipeline**: A set of tasks in a series, in parallel, or both.
* **Task**: A sequence of steps as commands, binaries, or scripts.
* **PipelineRun**: Execution of a pipeline with one or more tasks.
* **TaskRun**: Execution of a task with one or more steps.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can initiate a PipelineRun or a TaskRun with a set of inputs such as parameters and workspaces, and the execution results in a set of outputs and artifacts.
====
* **Workspace**: In Tekton, workspaces are conceptual blocks that serve the following purposes:

** Storage of inputs, outputs, and build artifacts.

** Common space to share data among tasks.

** Mount points for credentials held in secrets, configurations held in config maps, and common tools shared by an organization.

+
[NOTE]
====
In Jenkins, there is no direct equivalent of Tekton workspaces. You can think of the control node as a workspace, as it stores the cloned code repository, build history, and artifacts. In situations where a job is assigned to a different node, the cloned code and the generated artifacts are stored in that node, but the build history is maintained by the control node.

== Mapping of concepts
The building blocks of Jenkins and Tekton are not equivalent, and a comparison does not provide a technically accurate mapping. The following terms and concepts in Jenkins and Tekton correlate in general:
