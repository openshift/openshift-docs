= Managing traffic between revisions by using the {product-title} web console

After you create a serverless application, the application is displayed in the *Topology* view of the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console. The application revision is represented by the node, and the Knative service is indicated by a quadrilateral around the node.

Any new change in the code or the service configuration creates a new revision, which is a snapshot of the code at a given time. For a service, you can manage the traffic between the revisions of the service by splitting and routing it to the different revisions as required.

.Procedure

To split traffic between multiple revisions of an application in the *Topology* view:

. Click the Knative service to see its overview in the side panel.
. Click the *Resources* tab, to see a list of *Revisions* and *Routes* for the service.

. Click the service, indicated by the *S* icon at the top of the side panel, to see an overview of the service details.
. Click the *YAML* tab and modify the service configuration in the YAML editor, and click *Save*. For example, change the `timeoutseconds` from 300 to 301 . This change in the configuration triggers a new revision. In the *Topology* view, the latest revision is displayed and the *Resources* tab for the service now displays the two revisions.
. In the *Resources* tab, click btn:[Set Traffic Distribution] to see the traffic distribution dialog box:
.. Add the split traffic percentage portion for the two revisions in the *Splits* field.
.. Add tags to create custom URLs for the two revisions.
.. Click *Save* to see two nodes representing the two revisions in the Topology view.
