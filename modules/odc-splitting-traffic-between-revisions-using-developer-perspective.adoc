= Splitting traffic between revisions using the Developer perspective

After you create a serverless application, the serverless application is displayed in the *Topology* view of the *Developer* perspective. The application revision is represented by the node and the serverless resource service is indicated by a quadrilateral around the node.

Any new change in the code or the service configuration triggers a revision, a snapshot of the code at a given time. For a service, you can manage the traffic between the revisions of the service by splitting and routing it to the different revisions as required.

.Procedure
To split traffic between multiple revisions of an application in the *Topology* view:

. Click the serverless resource service, indicated by the quadrilateral, to see its overview in the side panel.
. Click the *Resources* tab, to see a list of *Revisions* and *Routes* for the service.

. Click the service, indicated by the *S* icon at the top of the side panel, to see an overview of the service details.
. Click the *YAML* tab and modify the service configuration in the YAML editor, and click *Save*. For example, change the `timeoutseconds` from 300 to 301 . This change in the configuration triggers a new revision. In the *Topology* view, the latest revision is displayed and the *Resources* tab for the service now displays the two revisions.
. In the *Resources* tab, click the btn:[Set Traffic Distribution] button to see the traffic distribution dialog box:
.. Add the split traffic percentage portion for the two revisions in the *Splits* field.
.. Add tags to create custom URLs for the two revisions.
.. Click *Save* to see two nodes representing the two revisions in the Topology view.
