= Preferred {ibm-z-title} system environment

The preferred system environment for running {product-title} version {product-version} on {ibm-z-name} hardware is as follows:

[discrete]
[id="preferred-ibm-z-hardware-requirements_{context}"]
== Hardware requirements

* Three logical partitions (LPARs) that each have the equivalent of six Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFLs), which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* Two network connections to both connect to the `LoadBalancer` service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.
* HiperSockets that are attached to a node directly as a device. To directly connect HiperSockets to a node, you must set up a gateway to the external network via a {op-system-base} 8 guest to bridge to the HiperSockets network.

[NOTE]
====
When installing in a z/VM environment, you can also bridge HiperSockets with one z/VM VSWITCH to be transparent to the z/VM guest.

1. To ensure the availability of integral components in an overcommitted environment, increase the priority of the control plane by using the CP command `SET SHARE`. Do the same for infrastructure nodes, if they exist. See link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zvm/latest?topic=commands-set-share[SET SHARE] ({ibm-name} Documentation).
