== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the log collector was configured to find the event timestamp at the root of the log record. When forwarding logs to Splunk with a `payloadKey` value specified, the `timestamp` field was omitted causing timestamp-related warnings. As a consequence, timestamp warnings flooded collector pods, disrupting log forwarding to Splunk. With this update, the log collector uses an internal timestamp field when forwarding logs. This ensures that the correct timestamp is used when forwarding logs to Splunk, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7311[LOG-7311])

* Before this update, using the prune filter to remove Kubernetes metadata fields such as `.kubernetes.namespace_name` caused a remapping error during Syslog output generation. This prevented the `appname` and `tag` fields from being correctly initialized and could prevent forwarding of logs. With this update, this issue is fixed. Improved error handling initializes these fields with an empty string if the source metadata is missing, ensuring successful log processing. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7355[LOG-7355])

* Before this update, a log record with a malformed timestamp could cause the Vector agent to panic when attempting to forward logs to Loki. With this update, error handling for out-of-range timestamp values has been improved resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7417[LOG-7417])

* Before this update, the loki-gateway did not apply the `OR` expression for `openshift-network` tenants in LokiStack. With this update, the loki-gateway correctly applies the `OR` expression for the `openshift-network` tenants in LokiStack. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7421[LOG-7421])

* Before this update, the `vector_buffer_byte_size` and `vector_buffer_events` metrics incorrectly reported negative values under certain system load and timing conditions. This led to unreliable monitoring, potentially masking buffer issues. With this update, a concurrent, centralized state tracker ensures that these metrics are always reported as non-negative values. This ensures that the metrics correctly report buffer sizes helping with accurate monitoring.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7592[LOG-7592])

* Before this update, a change to the container image format caused issues when mirroring the images to image registries that do not support the new format. With this update, the container images are published using the older format again resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7699[LOG-7699])
