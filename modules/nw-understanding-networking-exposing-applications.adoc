ClusterIP exposes services on an internal IP within the cluster to make the cluster accessible only to other services within the cluster. The NodePort service type exposes the service on a static port on each node's IP. This service type allows external traffic to access the service. Load balancers are typically used in cloud or bare-metal environments that use MetalLB. This service type provisions an external load balancer that routes external traffic to the service. On bare-metal environments, MetalLB uses VIPs and ARP announcements or BGP announcements.

Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services, such as load balancing, SSL/TLS termination, and name-based virtual hosting. An Ingress Controller, such as NGINX or HAProxy, implements the Ingress API and handles traffic routing based on user-defined rules.
