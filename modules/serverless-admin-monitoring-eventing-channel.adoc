You can use the {product-title} monitoring dashboards to view metrics for channels in your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions, and access to the *Administrator* perspective in the {product-title} web console.
* You installed the {ServerlessOperatorName}, the Knative Eventing component, and the `KnativeKafka` custom resource.
* The {product-title} monitoring stack is enabled on your cluster. You can enable monitoring for {ServerlessProductName} during installation by checking the box to *Enable operator recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace* when installing the {ServerlessOperatorName}.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Monitoring* -> *Dashboards*.
. Select the *Knative Eventing - Channel* dashboard in the *Dashboard* drop-down list.
. You can now view the following metrics:
.. For in-memory channels:
*** Event Count (avg/sec, over 1m window)
*** Success Rate (2xx Event, fraction rate, over 1m window)
*** Event Count by Response Code Class (avg/sec, over 1m window)
*** Failure Rate (non-2xx Event, fraction rate, over 1m window)
*** Event Dispatch Latency (ms)
.. For Kafka channels:
*** Event Count (avg/sec, over 1m window)
*** Success Rate (2xx Event, fraction rate, over 1m window)
*** Event Count by Response Code Class (avg/sec, over 1m window)
*** Failure Rate (non-2xx Event, fraction rate, over 1m window)
