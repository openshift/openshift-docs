= Configuring performance multicast

Openshift SDN supports multicast between Pods on the default network. This is best used for low-bandwidth coordination or service discovery, and not a high-bandwidth solution. For applications of streaming media, such as IPTV and
multipoint videoconferencing, you can utilize SR-IOV to provide near-native 
performance.

When using additional SR-IOV interfaces for multicast:

* Multicast packages must be sent or received by a Pod through the additional SR-IOV
interface.
* The physical network which connects the SR-IOV interfaces decides the
multicast routing and topology, which is not controlled by Openshift.

= Using an SR-IOV interface for multicast

The follow procedure creates an example SR-IOV interface for multicast.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* You must log in to the cluster with a user that has the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure
. Create a SriovNetworkNodePolicy CR

<1> Make sure to provision the following default routes through your DHCP server
224.0.0.0/5, 232.0.0.0/5, if you choose to use DHCP as IPAM. This is to override
the static multicast route set by Openshift-SDN.

. User can now create a Pod with multicast application

----
<1> The NET_ADMIN capability is only required if your application needs to 
assign the multicast IP address to the SR-IOV interface. Otherwise, it can be
omitted.
