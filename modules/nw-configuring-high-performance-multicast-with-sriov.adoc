= Configuring high performance multicast

Openshift SDN supports multicast between Pods on the default network. This is best used for low-bandwidth coordination or service discovery, and not a high-bandwidth solution. For applications of streaming media, such as IPTV and
multipoint videoconferencing, you can utilize SR-IOV to provide near-native 
performance.

When using additional SR-IOV interfaces for multicast:

* Multicast packages must be sent or received by a Pod through the additional SR-IOV interface.
* The physical network which connects the SR-IOV interfaces decides the
multicast routing and topology, which is not controlled by Openshift.

= Using an SR-IOV interface for multicast

The follow procedure creates an example SR-IOV interface for multicast.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* You must log in to the cluster with a user that has the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure
. Create a SriovNetworkNodePolicy CR:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-example
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  resourceName: example
  nodeSelector:
    feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: "true"
  numVfs: 4
  nicSelector:
    vendor: "8086"
    pfNames: ['ens803f0']
    rootDevices: ['0000:86:00.0']
----

. Create a SriovNetwork CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetwork
metadata:
  name: net-example
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  networkNamespace: default
  ipam: |
    {
      "type": "host-local", <1>
      "subnet": "10.56.217.0/24",
      "rangeStart": "10.56.217.171",
      "rangeEnd": "10.56.217.181",
      "routes": [
        {"dst": "224.0.0.0/5"},
        {"dst": "232.0.0.0/5"}
      ],
      "gateway": "10.56.217.1"
    } 
  resourceName: example
----
<1> Make sure to provision the following default routes through your DHCP server
224.0.0.0/5, 232.0.0.0/5, if you choose to use DHCP as IPAM. This is to override
the static multicast route set by Openshift SDN.

. Create a Pod with multicast application:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: testpmd
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: nic1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example 
    image: rhel7:latest
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN"] <1>
    command: [ "sleep", "infinity"]
----
<1> The NET_ADMIN capability is only required if your application needs to 
assign the multicast IP address to the SR-IOV interface. Otherwise, it can be
omitted.
