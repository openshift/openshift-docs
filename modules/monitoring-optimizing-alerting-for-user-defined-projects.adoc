= Optimizing alerting for user-defined projects

You can optimize alerting for your own projects by considering the following recommendations when creating alerting rules:

* *Minimize the number of alerting rules that you create for your project*. Create alerting rules that notify you of conditions that impact you. It is more difficult to notice relevant alerts if you generate many alerts for conditions that do not impact you.

* *Create alerting rules for symptoms instead of causes*. Create alerting rules that notify you of conditions regardless of the underlying cause. The cause can then be investigated. You will need many more alerting rules if each relates only to a specific cause. Some causes are then likely to be missed.

* *Plan before you write your alerting rules*. Determine what symptoms are important to you and what actions you want to take if they occur. Then build an alerting rule for each symptom.

* *Provide clear alert messaging*. State the symptom and recommended actions in the alert message.

* *Include severity levels in your alerting rules*. The severity of an alert depends on how you need to react if the reported symptom occurs. For example, a critical alert should be triggered if a symptom requires immediate attention by an individual or a critical response team.
