= Gathering data about your cluster using the must-gather command

The Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool requires `must-gather` data. As a cluster administrator, run the must-gather command to capture information about your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* The OpenShift CLI installed.

.Procedure

. Optional: Verify that a matching machine config pool exists with a label:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc describe mcp/worker-rt
----
+
[source,bash]
----
Name:         worker-rt
Namespace:
Labels:       machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role=worker-rt
----

. If a matching label does not exist add a label for a machine config pool (MCP) that matches with the MCP name:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc label mcp _<mcp-name>_ _<mcp_name>_=""
----

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.

. Collect cluster information by running the following command.
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc adm must-gather
----

. (Optional)- Create a compressed file from the must-gather directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather/
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Compressed output is required if you are running the Performance Profile Creator wrapper script.
