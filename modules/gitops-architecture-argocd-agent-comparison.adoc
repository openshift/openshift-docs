= Comparing Argo CD Agent with traditional Argo CD architecture

The Argo CD Agent architecture offers several advantages and tradeoffs compared to the traditional push-based hub-and-spoke model.

[cols="2a,2a,2a",options="header"]
|===
| Capability
| Traditional push-based Argo CD
| Argo CD Agent pull-based

| Single pane of glass
| Does not provide a `single pane of glass` to monitor Argo CD application resources across multiple Argo CD instances. With traditional Argo CD, an instance only shows applications managed by that instance.
| Provides a `single pane of glass` to monitor all Argo CD application resources across all managed Argo CD instances.

| Network connectivity
| The `hub` (Argo CD) must connect directly to the destination cluster Kubernetes APIs. Firewalled clusters cannot be managed.
| The `hub` (Argo CD) enables deployments to firewalled clusters through pull-based synchronization.

| Scalability
| A single Argo CD instance manages multiple destination clusters, which may lead to CPU and memory bottlenecks when scaling to a large number of deployed resources.
| Cluster management is not performed centrally by the `hub` (Argo CD); each child cluster is managed by its own dedicated Argo CD deployment. As it is much easier to scale up a single Argo CD instance deploying to a single cluster, this avoids scalability challenges with the traditional Argo CD configuration.

| Security
| The `hub` (Argo CD) stores credentials for all workload clusters, increasing the attack surface. Additionally, workload clusters must expose their Kubernetes API endpoints to the control plane, increasing the attack surface on that cluster.
| The control plane does not require workload cluster credentials or API access, reducing risk.

| Local reconciliation
| The traditional hub-spoke configuration of Argo CD modifies and deletes resources across cluster boundaries, introducing the potential for network latency, network bottlenecks, network egress charges, and network instability.
| In an Argo CD Agent-based configuration, each cluster deploys only to itself using its local Argo CD instance, avoiding network-related restrictions, costs, and instability.

| Single point of failure
| A single `hub` (Argo CD) instance outage prevents synchronization to all spoke clusters.
| Each cluster operates independently, so a failure affects only that cluster.

| Complexity
| Is easier to configure initially but becomes more complex at scale.
| Is slightly more complex to set up but scales consistently.

| Maturity
| Is fully mature and supported.
| Is an emerging configuration; not all features are currently supported.
