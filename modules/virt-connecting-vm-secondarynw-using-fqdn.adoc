[id="virt-connecting-vm-secondarynw-fqdn_{context}"]
= Connecting to a virtual machine on a secondary network by using the cluster FQDN

You can access a virtual machine (VM) that is attached to a secondary network interface from outside the cluster by using the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the cluster.

.Prerequisites
* The QEMU guest agent must be running on the virtual machine.
* The IP address of the VM that you want to connect to, by using a DNS client, must be public.
* You have configured the DNS server for secondary networks.
* You have retrieved the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the cluster.

.Procedure
. Retrieve the VM configuration by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vm -n secondary-test vm-test-sec-dns -o yaml
----

<1> The name of the `VirtualMachine` object.
<2> The namespace in which the `VirtualMachine` object is defined.
<3> The name of the secondary network interface.

. Connect to the VM by using the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
<interface_name>.<vm_name>.<namespace>.vm.<FQDN>
----

where:

* `<interface_name>` specifies the name of the secondary network interface.
* `<vm_name>` specifies the name of the `VirtualMachine` object.
* `<namespace>` specifies the namespace in which the `VirtualMachine` object is defined.
* `<FQDN>` specifies the fully qualified domain name of the cluster.
