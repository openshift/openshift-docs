* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-2057[TRACING-2057] The Kafka API has been updated to `v1beta2` to support the Strimzi Kafka Operator 0.23.0. However, this API version is not supported by AMQ Streams 1.6.3. If you have the following environment, your Jaeger services will not be upgraded, and you cannot create new Jaeger services or modify existing Jaeger services:

** Jaeger Operator channel: *1.17.x stable* or *1.20.x stable*
** AMQ Streams Operator channel: *amq-streams-1.6.x*
+
To resolve this issue, switch the subscription channel for your AMQ Streams Operator to either *amq-streams-1.7.x* or *stable*.
