= Example pod topology spread constraints

The following examples demonstrate pod topology spread constraint configurations.

[id="nodes-scheduler-pod-topology-spread-constraints-example-single_{context}"]
== Single pod topology spread constraint example

// TODO: Add a diagram?

This example `Pod` spec defines one pod topology spread constraint. It matches on pods labeled `region: us-east`, distributes among zones, specifies a skew of `1`, and does not schedule the pod if it does not meet these requirements.

[id="nodes-scheduler-pod-topology-spread-constraints-example-multiple_{context}"]
== Multiple pod topology spread constraints example

// TODO: Add a diagram?

This example `Pod` spec defines two pod topology spread constraints. Both match on pods labeled `region: us-east`, specify a skew of `1`, and do not schedule the pod if it does not meet these requirements.

The first constraint distributes pods based on a user-defined label `node`, and the second constraint distributes pods based on a user-defined label `rack`. Both constraints must be met for the pod to be scheduled.
