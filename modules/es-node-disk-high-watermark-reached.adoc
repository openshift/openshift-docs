= Elasticsearch node disk high watermark reached

Elasticsearch attempts to relocate shards away from a node that has reached the high watermark to a node with low disk usage that has not crossed any watermark threshold limits.

To allocate shards to a particular node, you must free up some space on that node. If increasing the disk space is not possible, try adding a new data node to the cluster, or decrease the total cluster redundancy policy.

.Procedure

. Identify the node on which Elasticsearch is deployed by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-logging get po -o wide
----

. Check the disk space on each node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ for pod in `oc -n openshift-logging get po -l component=elasticsearch -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'`; \
  do echo $pod; oc -n openshift-logging exec -c elasticsearch $pod \
  -- df -h /elasticsearch/persistent; done
----

. Check if the cluster is rebalancing:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -n openshift-logging -c elasticsearch $ES_POD_NAME \
  -- es_util --query=_cluster/health?pretty | grep relocating_shards
----
+
If the command output shows relocating shards, the high watermark has been exceeded. The default value of the high watermark is 90%.

. Increase the disk space on all nodes. If increasing the disk space is not possible, try adding a new data node to the cluster, or decrease the total cluster redundancy policy.

. To check the current `redundancyPolicy`, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-logging get es elasticsearch \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.redundancyPolicy}'
----
+
If you are using a `ClusterLogging` resource on your cluster, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-logging get cl \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[*].spec.logStore.elasticsearch.redundancyPolicy}'
----
+
If the cluster `redundancyPolicy` value is higher than the `SingleRedundancy` value, set it to the `SingleRedundancy` value and save this change.

. If the preceding steps do not fix the issue, delete the old indices.
.. Check the status of all indices on Elasticsearch by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -n openshift-logging -c elasticsearch $ES_POD_NAME -- indices
----

.. Identify an old index that can be deleted.
.. Delete the index by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -n openshift-logging -c elasticsearch $ES_POD_NAME \
  -- es_util --query=<elasticsearch_index_name> -X DELETE
----
