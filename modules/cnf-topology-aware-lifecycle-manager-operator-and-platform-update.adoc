= Performing a platform and an Operator update together

You can perform a platform and an Operator update at the same time.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {cgu-operator-first}.
* Update {ztp-first} to the latest version.
* Provision one or more managed clusters with {ztp}.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Create {rh-rhacm} policies in the hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Create the `{policy-gen-cr}` CR for the updates by following the steps described in the "Performing a platform update" and "Performing an Operator update" sections.

. Apply the prep work for the platform and the Operator update.

.. Save the content of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the policies for platform update preparation work, catalog source updates, and target clusters to the `cgu-platform-operator-upgrade-prep.yml` file, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: cgu-platform-operator-upgrade-prep
  namespace: default
spec:
  managedPolicies:
  - du-upgrade-platform-upgrade-prep
  - du-upgrade-operator-catsrc-policy
  clusterSelector:
  - group-du-sno
  remediationStrategy:
    maxConcurrency: 10
  enable: true
----

.. Apply the `cgu-platform-operator-upgrade-prep.yml` file to the hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cgu-platform-operator-upgrade-prep.yml
----

.. Monitor the process. Upon completion, ensure that the policy is compliant by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies --all-namespaces
----

. Create the `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR for the platform and the Operator update with the `spec.enable` field set to `false`.
.. Save the contents of the platform and Operator update `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR with the policies and the target clusters to the `cgu-platform-operator-upgrade.yml` file, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: cgu-du-upgrade
  namespace: default
spec:
  managedPolicies:
  - du-upgrade-platform-upgrade <1>
  - du-upgrade-operator-catsrc-policy <2>
  - common-subscriptions-policy <3>
  preCaching: true
  clusterSelector:
  - group-du-sno
  remediationStrategy:
    maxConcurrency: 1
  enable: false
----
<1> This is the platform update policy.
<2> This is the policy containing the catalog source information for the Operators to be updated. It is needed for the pre-caching feature to determine which Operator images to download to the managed cluster.
<3> This is the policy to update the Operators.

.. Apply the `cgu-platform-operator-upgrade.yml` file to the hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cgu-platform-operator-upgrade.yml
----

. Optional: Pre-cache the images for the platform and the Operator update.
.. Enable pre-caching in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --namespace=default patch clustergroupupgrade.ran.openshift.io/cgu-du-upgrade \
--patch '{"spec":{"preCaching": true}}' --type=merge
----

.. Monitor the update process and wait for the pre-caching to complete. Check the status of pre-caching by running the following command on the managed cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get jobs,pods -n openshift-talm-pre-cache
----

.. Check if the pre-caching is completed before starting the update by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu cgu-du-upgrade -ojsonpath='{.status.conditions}'
----

. Start the platform and Operator update.
.. Enable the `cgu-du-upgrade` `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR to start the platform and the Operator update by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --namespace=default patch clustergroupupgrade.ran.openshift.io/cgu-du-upgrade \
--patch '{"spec":{"enable":true, "preCaching": false}}' --type=merge
----

.. Monitor the process. Upon completion, ensure that the policy is compliant by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies --all-namespaces
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The CRs for the platform and Operator updates can be created from the beginning by configuring the setting to `spec.enable: true`. In this case, the update starts immediately after pre-caching completes and there is no need to manually enable the CR.

Both pre-caching and the update create extra resources, such as policies, placement bindings, placement rules, managed cluster actions, and managed cluster view, to help complete the procedures. Setting the `afterCompletion.deleteObjects` field to `true` deletes all these resources after the updates complete.
