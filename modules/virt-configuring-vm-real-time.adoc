[id="virt-configuring-vm-real-time_{context}"]
= Configuring a virtual machine for real-time workloads

You can configure a virtual machines (VM) to run real-time workloads.

.Prerequisites
* Your cluster is configured to run real-time workloads.
* You have installed the `virtctl` tool.

.Procedure
. Create a `VirtualMachine` manifest to include information about CPU topology, CRI-O annotations, and huge pages:
+
.Example `VirtualMachine` manifest
[source,yaml]

        cpu-load-balancing.crio.io: disable <1>
        cpu-quota.crio.io: disable <2>

----
<1> This annotation specifies that load balancing is disabled for CPUs that are used by the container.
<2> This annotation specifies that the CPU quota is disabled for CPUs that are used by the container.
<3> This annotation specifies that interrupt request (IRQ) load balancing is disabled for CPUs that are used by the container.
<4> The number of sockets inside the VM. 
<5> The number of cores inside the VM. This must be a value greater than or equal to `1`.
<6> The size of the huge pages. The possible values for x86-64 architectures are `1Gi` and `2Mi`. In this example, the request is for 4 huge pages of size 1 Gi.

. Apply the `VirtualMachine` manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <file_name>.yaml
----

. Configure the guest operating system. The following example shows the configuration steps for a {op-system-base} 8 operating system:
.. Run the following command to connect to the VM console:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl console <vm_name>
----

.. Configure huge pages by using the GRUB boot loader command-line interface. In the following example, 8 1G huge pages are specified.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="default_hugepagesz=1GB hugepagesz=1G hugepages=8"
----

.. To achieve low-latency tuning by using the `cpu-partitioning` profile in the TuneD application, run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ dnf install -y tuned-profiles-cpu-partitioning
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo isolated_cores=2-9 > /etc/tuned/cpu-partitioning-variables.conf
----
The first two CPUs (0 and 1) are set aside for house keeping tasks and the rest are isolated for the real-time application.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tuned-adm profile cpu-partitioning
----

. Restart the VM to apply the changes.
