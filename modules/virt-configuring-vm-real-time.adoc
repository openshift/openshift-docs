[id="virt-configuring-vm-real-time_{context}"]
= Configuring a virtual machine for real-time workloads

You can configure a virtual machine (VM) to run real-time workloads.

.Prerequisites
* Your cluster is configured to run real-time workloads.
* You have installed the `virtctl` tool.

.Procedure
. Create a `VirtualMachine` manifest to include information about CPU topology, CRI-O annotations, and huge pages:
+
.Example `VirtualMachine` manifest
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: realtime-vm
spec:
  running: true
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        cpu-load-balancing.crio.io: disable # <1>
        cpu-quota.crio.io: disable # <2>
        irq-load-balancing.crio.io: disable # <3>
    spec:

        cpu:
          dedicatedCpuPlacement: true
          isolateEmulatorThread: true
          model: host-passthrough
          numa:
            guestMappingPassthrough: {}
          realtime: {}
          sockets: 1 # <4>
          cores: 4 # <5>
          threads: 1
        devices:
          autoattachGraphicsDevice: false
          autoattachMemBalloon: false
          autoattachSerialConsole: true
        ioThreadsPolicy: auto
        memory:
          guest: 4Gi
          hugepages:
            pageSize: 1Gi # <6>
        terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
# ...
----
<1> This annotation specifies that load balancing is disabled for CPUs that are used by the container.
<2> This annotation specifies that the CPU quota is disabled for CPUs that are used by the container.
<3> This annotation specifies that interrupt request (IRQ) load balancing is disabled for CPUs that are used by the container.
<4> The number of sockets inside the VM.
<5> The number of cores inside the VM. This must be a value greater than or equal to `1`.
<6> The size of the huge pages. The possible values for x86-64 architectures are `1Gi` and `2Mi`. In this example, the request is for 4 huge pages of size 1 Gi.
. Apply the `VirtualMachine` manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <file_name>.yaml
----
. Configure the guest operating system. The following example shows the configuration steps for a {op-system-base} 9 operating system:
.. Run the following command to connect to the VM console:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl console <vm_name>
----
.. If you are not already logged in as a root user, switch to the root user account to execute the remaining configuration steps.
.. Disable the `irqbalance` service by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl disable irqbalance && systemctl stop irqbalance
----
.. Enable the real-time and network function virtualization (NFV) repositories:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-9-for-x86_64-rt-rpms --enable rhel-9-for-x86_64-nfv-rpms
----
.. Install the necessary packages by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf install tuned cloud-init
----
.. To achieve low-latency tuning by using the `realtime-virtual-guest` profile in the TuneD application, run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf install kernel-rt realtime-tests tuned-profiles-realtime
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf install tuned-profiles-nfv-guest
----
.. Edit the `/etc/tuned/realtime-virtual-guest-variables.conf` file:
+
[source,conf]
----
#
# Variable settings below override the definitions from the
# /etc/tuned/realtime-variables.conf file.

#
# Core isolation
#
# The 'isolated_cores=' variable below controls which cores should be
# isolated. By default we reserve 1 core per socket for housekeeping
# and isolate the rest. But you can isolate any range as shown in the
# examples below. Just remember to keep only one isolated_cores= line.
#
# Examples:
# isolated_cores=2,4-7
# isolated_cores=2-23
#
# Reserve 1 core per socket for housekeeping, isolate the rest.
# Change this for a core list or range as shown above.
isolated_cores=2-3 <1>

#
# Uncomment the 'isolate_managed_irq=Y' bellow if you want to move kernel
# managed IRQs out of isolated cores. Note that this requires kernel
# support. Please only specify this parameter if you are sure that the
# kernel supports it.
#
isolate_managed_irq=Y <2>

#
# Set the desired combined queue count value using the parameter provided
# below. Ideally this should be set to the number of housekeeping CPUs i.e.,
# in the example given below it is assumed that the system has 4 housekeeping
# (non-isolated) CPUs.
#
# netdev_queue_count=4
----
<1> The first two CPUs (0 and 1) are set aside for house keeping tasks and the rest are isolated for the real-time application.
<2> Set the `isolate_managed_irq` parameter to `Y` to move kernel-managed interrupt requests out of isolated cores.
.. Activate the TuneD profile:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# tuned-adm profile realtime-virtual-guest
----
.. Set the real-time kernel as the default by using the GRUB boot loader command-line interface:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# grubby --set-default=/boot/vmlinuz-<installed_rt_kernel_version>
----
.. Set the kernel arguments by using the GRUB boot loader command-line interface:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# grubby --args="iommu=pt intel_iommu=on default_hugepagesz=1G idle=poll" --update-kernel=$(grubby --default-kernel)
----
. Restart the VM to apply the changes.

.Verification
* Use the `cyclictest` tool to verify that the real-time guest is configured properly:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# cyclictest --priority 1 --policy fifo -h 50 -a 2-3 --mainaffinity 0,1 -t 2 -m -q -i 200 -D 12h
----
where:
`-a`:: Specifies the CPU set on which the test runs. This is the same as the isolated CPUs that you configured in the `realtime-variables.conf` file.
`-D`:: Specifies the test duration. Append `m`, `h`, or `d` to specify minutes, hours or days.

+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
# Min Latencies: 00004 00004
# Avg Latencies: 00004 00004
# Max Latencies: 00014 00013 <1>
----
<1> The `Max Latencies` value in the output must be less than 40 micro seconds.
