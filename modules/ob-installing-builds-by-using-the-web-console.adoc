= Installing {builds-shortname} by using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
Use the {ocp-product-title} web console to install the {builds-title} components. The graphical interface simplifies setting up the build infrastructure, allowing you to compile source code and create container images directly within your OpenShift cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {ocp-product-title} web console.
* You are logged in to the {ocp-product-title} cluster as an administrator.
* Your cluster has the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/overview/cluster-capabilities.html#marketplace-operator_cluster-capabilities[Marketplace capability] enabled or the Red Hat Operator catalog source configured manually.
* You have installed the {pipelines-operator}.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* page.

. Use the *Filter by keyword* box to search for {builds-operator} in the catalog.

. Click the *{builds-operator}* tile.

. Read the brief description about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

.. Check that the *Installation Mode* is set to *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This mode installs the Operator in the default `openshift-builds` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster.

.. Check that the *Installed Namespace* is set to `openshift-builds` by default.

.. Select *Automatic* for the *Approval Strategy*. This ensures that the future upgrades to the Operator are handled automatically by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). If you select the *Manual* approval strategy, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve the OLM update request to update the Operator to the new version.

.. Select *Update Channel*:

** The *Update Channel* is set to *latest* by default. The latest channel enables installation of the most recent stable version of the {builds-operator}.
** To install a specific version of the {builds-operator}, cluster administrators can use the corresponding `builds-<version>` channel. For example, to install the {builds-operator} version `1.3`, you can use the `builds-1.3` channel.

. Click *Install*.

.Verification

After installing the {builds-title}, perform the following steps to verify that the required resources are created to ensure proper functioning of the controllers.

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, select the project as openshift-builds.

. Go to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page. 

. On the *Installed Operators* page, set the namespace to `All Projects`.

. Verify that the status of {builds-operator} and {pipelines-title} is displayed as Succeeded Up to date.

. Go to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page. 

. On the *Pods* page, set the namespace to `openshift-builds`.

. Verify that the following pods are listed:
* `openshift-builds-operator` pod
* `shipwright-build-controller` and `shipwright-build-webhook` pods
* `shared-resource-csi-driver` node and `shared-resource-csi-driver-webhook` pod

. Set the namespace to `openshift-operators`.

. Verify that the following pods are listed:
* `openshift-pipelines-operator` pod
* `tekton-operator-webhook` pod
