== Bug fixes

+
** `classification_banner`
** `oauth_login_template_set`
** `oauth_logout_url_set`
** `oauth_provider_selection_set`
** `ocp_allowed_registries`
** `ocp_allowed_registries_for_import`
+
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-10473[*OCPBUGS-10473*])

* Before this update, check accuracy and rule instructions were unclear. After this update, the check accuracy and instructions are improved for the following `sysctl` rules:
+
** `kubelet-enable-protect-kernel-sysctl`
** `kubelet-enable-protect-kernel-sysctl-kernel-keys-root-maxbytes`
** `kubelet-enable-protect-kernel-sysctl-kernel-keys-root-maxkeys`
** `kubelet-enable-protect-kernel-sysctl-kernel-panic`
** `kubelet-enable-protect-kernel-sysctl-kernel-panic-on-oops`

(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11334[*OCPBUGS-11334*])

* Before this update, the `ocp4-alert-receiver-configured` rule did not include instructions. With this update, the `ocp4-alert-receiver-configured` rule now includes improved instructions. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-7307[*OCPBUGS-7307*])

* Before this update, the `rhcos4-sshd-set-loglevel-info` rule would fail for the `rhcos4-e8` profile. With this update, the remediation for the `sshd-set-loglevel-info` rule was updated to apply the correct configuration changes, allowing subsequent scans to pass after the remediation is applied. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-7816[*OCPBUGS-7816*])

* Before this update, a new installation of {product-title} with the latest Compliance Operator install failed on the `scheduler-no-bind-address` rule. With this update, the `scheduler-no-bind-address` rule has been disabled on newer versions of {product-title} since the parameter was removed.
