= Configuring a single NUMA node policy

The NUMA Resources Operator requires a single NUMA node policy to be configured on the cluster. This can be achieved in two ways: by creating and applying a performance profile, or by configuring a KubeletConfig. 

[NOTE]
====
The preferred way to configure a single NUMA node policy is to apply a performance profile. You can use the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool to create the performance profile. If a performance profile is created on the cluster, it automatically creates other tuning components like `KubeletConfig` and the `tuned` profile.

For more information about creating a performance profile, see "About the Performance Profile Creator" in the "Additional resources" section.
