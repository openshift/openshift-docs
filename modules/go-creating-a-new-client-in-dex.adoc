= Creating a new client in Dex

Dex is used to delegate authentication to external identity providers like GitHub, SAML and others. To configure the SSO of Argo CD update the Argo CD CR with Dex link:https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/[connector] settings.

= Updating the Dex openshift OAuth Connector

Dex uses the users and groups defined within OpenShift by querying the platform provided `OAuth` server.

. The `openShiftOAuth` property is used to trigger the Operator to auto configure the built-in OpenShift `OAuth` server.
. The `groups` property is used to mandate the users to be part of one or all the groups in the groups list.
. The `RBAC Policy` property is used to give the admin role in the Argo CD cluster to users in the OpenShift cluster-admins group.
