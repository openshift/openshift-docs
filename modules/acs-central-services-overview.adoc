You install Central services on a single cluster.
These services include the following components:

* *Central*: Central is the {product-title-short} application management interface and services.
It handles API interactions and user interface ({product-title-short} Portal) access.
You can use the same Central instance to secure multiple {ocp} or Kubernetes clusters.
* *Central DB*: Central DB is the database for {product-title-short} and handles all data persistence. It is currently based on PostgreSQL 13.
* *Scanner V4*: Beginning with version 4.4, {product-title-short} contains the Scanner V4 vulnerability scanner for scanning container images. Scanner V4 is built on link:https://github.com/quay/claircore[ClairCore], which also powers the link:https://github.com/quay/clair[Clair] scanner. Scanner V4 supports scanning of language and OS-specific image components. For version 4.4, you must use this scanner in conjunction with the StackRox Scanner to provide node and platform scanning capabilities until Scanner V4 support those capabilities. Scanner V4 contains the Indexer, Matcher, and DB components.
** *Scanner V4 Indexer*: The Scanner V4 Indexer performs image indexing, previously known as image analysis. Given an image and registry credentials, the Indexer pulls the image from the registry. It finds the base operating system, if it exists, and looks for packages. It stores and outputs an index report, which contains the findings for the given image.
** *Scanner V4 Matcher*: The Scanner V4 Matcher performs vulnerability matching. If the Central services Scanner V4 Indexer indexed the image, then the Matcher fetches the index report from the Indexer and matches the report with the vulnerabilities stored in the Scanner V4 database. If a Secured Cluster services Scanner V4 Indexer performed the indexing, then the Matcher uses the index report that was sent from that Indexer, and then matches against vulnerabilities. The Matcher also fetches vulnerability data and updates the Scanner V4 database with the latest vulnerability data. The Scanner V4 Matcher outputs a vulnerability report, which contains the final results of an image.
** *Scanner V4 DB*: This database stores information for Scanner V4, including all vulnerability data and index reports. A persistent volume claim (PVC) is required for Scanner V4 DB on the cluster where Central is installed.
* *StackRox Scanner*: The StackRox Scanner is the default scanner in {product-title-short}. Version 4.4 adds a new scanner, Scanner V4. The StackRox Scanner originates from a fork of the Clair v2 open source scanner. You must continue using this scanner for RHCOS node scanning and platform scanning.
* *Scanner-DB*: This database contains data for the StackRox Scanner.

{product-title-short} scanners analyze each image layer to determine the base operating system and identify programming language packages and packages that were installed by the operating system package manager. They match the findings against known vulnerabilities from various vulnerability sources. In addition, the StackRox Scanner identifies vulnerabilities in the node's operating system and platform. These capabilities are planned for Scanner V4 in a future release.
