= Creating an offline virtual machine snapshot in the web console

You can create a virtual machine (VM) snapshot by using the web console.

[NOTE]
====
The VM snapshot only includes disks that meet the following requirements:

* Must be either a data volume or persistent volume claim
* Belong to a storage class that supports Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots

If your VM storage includes disks that do not support snapshots, you can either edit them or contact your cluster administrator.
