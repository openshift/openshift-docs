= Initiating the VPC peer request

You can send a VPC peering connection request from the OSD AWS Account to the
Customer AWS Account.

.Prerequisites

* Gather the following information about the Customer VPC required to initiate the
peering request:
** Customer AWS account number
** Customer VPC ID
** Customer VPC Region
** Customer VPC CIDR
* Check the CIDR block used by the {product-title} Cluster VPC. If it overlaps or
matches the CIDR block for the Customer VPC, then peering between these two VPCs
is not possible; see the Amazon VPC
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/invalid-peering-configurations.html[Unsupported VPC Peering Configurations]
documentation for details. If the CIDR blocks do not overlap, you can procedure
with the procedure.

.Procedure

. Log in to the Web Console for the OSD AWS Account and navigate to the
*VPC Dashboard* in the region where the cluster is being hosted.
. Go to the *Peering Connections* page and click the *Create Peering Connection*
button.
. Verify the details of the account you are logged in to and the details of the
account and VPC you are connecting to:
.. *Peering connection name tag*: Set a descriptive name for the VPC Peering Connection.
.. *VPC (Requester)*: Select the {product-title} Cluster VPC ID from the dropdown
*list.
.. *Account*: Select *Another account* and provide the Customer AWS Account number
*(without dashes).
.. *Region*: If the Customer VPC Region differs from the current region, select
*Another Region* and select the customer VPC Region from the dropdown list.
.. *VPC (Accepter)*: Set the Customer VPC ID.
. Click *Create Peering Connection*.
. Confirm that the request enters a *Pending* state. If it enters a *Failed*
state, confirm the details and repeat the process.
