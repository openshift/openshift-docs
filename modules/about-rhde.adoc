= About {product-title}

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} is for organizations that need small-form-factor edge devices and support for bare metal, virtualized, or containerized applications. {product-title} is a solution for large-scale computing at the device edge that combines {microshift-short} and an edge-optimized {op-system-first} operating system. {microshift-short} is a Kubernetes orchestration in a smaller, lighter-weight footprint. Together, these components of {product-title} provide all of the benefits of containers deployed to the edge. You can manage {product-title} by using {ansible}.
