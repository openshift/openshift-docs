= About {product-title}

{product-title} is for organizations that need small-form-factor edge devices and support for bare metal, virtualized, or containerized applications. {product-title} is a solution for large-scale computing at the device edge that combines {microshift-short} and an edge-optimized {op-system-first} operating system. {microshift-short} is a Kubernetes orchestration in a smaller, lighter-weight footprint. Together, these components of {product-title} provide all of the benefits of containers deployed to the edge. You can manage {product-title} by using {ansible}.

[id="device-edge-compatibility_{context}"]
== {product-title} product release compatibility matrix

{op-system-base} and {microshift-short} work together as a single solution for device-edge computing. You can update each component separately, but the product versions must be compatible. For example, an update of {microshift-short} from 4.18 to 4.20 requires a {op-system-base} update. Supported configurations of {product-title} use verified releases for each together as listed in the following table:
