= Creating an IntegrationSource for DynamoDB Streams

To create an `IntegrationSource` API that receives events from Amazon DynamoDB Streams, apply a YAML manifest.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a Kubernetes Secret containing valid Amazon Web Services (AWS) credentials with access to Amazon DynamoDB Streams.
* You have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed and are logged in to the target cluster.
* You know the namespace where the `IntegrationSource` resource will be created.
* A Knative broker or another valid event sink already exists in the same namespace to receive the events.

.Procedure

. Save the following YAML manifest as `integration-source-aws-ddb.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationSource
metadata:
  name: integration-source-aws-ddb
  namespace: knative-samples
spec:
  aws:
    ddbStreams:
      table: "my-table"
      region: "eu-north-1"
    auth:
      secret:
        ref:
          name: "my-secret"
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Broker
      name: default
----

. Apply the manifest by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f integration-source-aws-ddb.yaml
----
+
This manifest configures the `IntegrationSource` API to read change events from the DynamoDB table `my-table` in the `eu-north-1` region. The `auth.secret.ref.name` field references the Kubernetes Secret (`my-secret`) that stores your AWS credentials. The events are sent to the `default` Knative broker defined in the sink section.
