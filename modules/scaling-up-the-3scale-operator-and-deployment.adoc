= Scaling up the 3scale Operator and deployment

You can scale up the 3scale Operator and any deployment that was manually scaled down. After a few minutes, 3scale installation should be fully functional, and its state should match the backed-up state.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that there are no scaled up deployments or no extra pods running.
There might be some `system-mysql` or `backend-redis` pods running detached from deployments after restoration, which can be removed after the restoration is successful.


.Procedure

. Scale up the 3scale Operator by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deployment threescale-operator-controller-manager-v2 --replicas=1 -n threescale
----

. Ensure that the 3scale Operator was deployed by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment -n threescale
----

. Scale up the deployments by executing the following script:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./scaledeployment.sh
----

. Get the `3scale-admin` route to log in to the 3scale UI by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get routes -n threescale
----
+

In this example, `3scale-admin.apps.custom-cluster-name.openshift.com` is the 3scale-admin URL.

. Use the URL from this output to log in to the 3scale Operator as an administrator. You can verify that the existing data is available before trying to create a backup.
