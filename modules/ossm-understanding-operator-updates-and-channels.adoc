= Understanding Operator updates and channels

The {olm-first} manages Operators and their associated services by using channels to organize and distribute updates. Channels are a way to group related updates.

To ensure that your {SMProduct} stays current with the latest security patches, bug fixes, and software updates, keep the {SMProduct} Operator up to date. The upgrade process depends on the configured channel and approval strategy.

OLM provides the following channels for the {SMProduct} Operator:

* *Stable* channel: tracks the most recent version of the {SMProduct} 3 Operator and the latest supported version of {istio}. This channel enables upgrades to new operator versions and corresponding {istio} updates as soon as they are released. Use the stable channel to stay current with the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates.

* *Versioned* channel: restricts updates to patch-level releases within a specific minor version. For example, `stable-3.0` provides access to the latest `{SMProductVersion}` patch version. When a new patch release becomes available, you can upgrade the Operator to the newer patch version. To move to a newer minor release, you must manually switch to a different channel. You can use a versioned channel to maintain a consistent minor version while applying only patch updates.

[NOTE]
====
You can find the *update strategy* field in the *Install Operator* section and under the sub-section *update approval*. The default value for the *update strategy* is `Automatic`.
