= Deleting bootstrap resources

Delete the bootstrap resources that you no longer need.

.Prerequisites
* The `inventory.yaml` and `common.yaml` Ansible playbooks in a common directory
** If you need these files, copy them from *Creating network resources*
* The control plane machines are running
** If you don't know the machines' status, see *Verifying cluster status*

.Procedure

. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `down-03_bootstrap.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# Required Python packages:
#
# ansible
# openstacksdk

- import_playbook: common.yaml

- hosts: all
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
  - name: 'Remove the bootstrap server'
    os_server:
      name: "{{ os_bootstrap_server_name }}"
      state: absent
      delete_fip: yes

  - name: 'Remove the bootstrap server port'
    os_port:
      name: "{{ os_port_bootstrap }}"
      state: absent
----

. On a command line, run the playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml down-03_bootstrap.yaml
----

The bootstrap port, server, and floating IP address are deleted.
