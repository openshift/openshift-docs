= Deleting bootstrap resources

Delete the bootstrap resources that you no longer need.

.Prerequisites
* The `inventory.yaml` and `common.yaml` Ansible playbooks in a common directory
** If you need these files, copy them from *Creating network resources*
* The control plane machines are running
** If you don't know the machines' status, see *Verifying cluster status*

.Procedure

. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `down-03_bootstrap.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.6/upi/openstack/down-bootstrap.yaml[]
----

. On a command line, run the playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml down-03_bootstrap.yaml
----

The bootstrap port, server, and floating IP address are deleted.

[WARNING]
If you did not disable the bootstrap Ignition file URL earlier,, do so now.
