= Upgrading to RHACS version 3.71

If you are upgrading to RHACS 3.71 using the `roxctl` CLI and YAML files, you need to perform some additional steps. The Scanner DB image no longer mounts the `scanner-db-password` Kubernetes Secret into the `db` Scanner DB container. Instead, `scanner-db-password` is only used in the init container, `init-db`. Therefore, you must add the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE` environment variable to the init container configuration. The init container must also mount the `scanner-db-tls-volume` and `scanner-db-password` volumes. The following section provides the upgrade steps for {product-title-short} if you are using {ocp} or Kubernetes. For more information about init containers, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/[Kubernetes documentation].

.Prerequisites

* This procedure assumes the `db` container in the Scanner DB configuration is at `index 0`, which is the first entry in the `containers` list; and the `scanner-db-password` volume mount is at `index 2`, which is the third entry.

While this scenario applies to most deployments, check the configuration for Scanner DB before entering these commands. If your values differ, you must adjust the `.../containers/x/volumeMounts/y` value in the following commands.

.Procedure

. Apply the patch:
* If you use {ocp}, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox patch deployment.apps/scanner-db --patch '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"initContainers":[{"name":"init-db","env":[{"name":"POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE","value":"/run/secrets/stackrox.io/secrets/password"}],"command":["/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh","postgres","-c","config_file=/etc/postgresql.conf"],"volumeMounts":[{"name":"db-data","mountPath":"/var/lib/postgresql/data"},{"name":"scanner-db-tls-volume","mountPath":"/run/secrets/stackrox.io/certs","readOnly":true},{"name":"scanner-db-password","mountPath":"/run/secrets/stackrox.io/secrets","readOnly":true}],"securityContext":{"runAsGroup":70,"runAsNonRoot":true,"runAsUser":70}}]}}}}'
----
* If you use Kubernetes, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl -n stackrox patch deployment.apps/scanner-db --patch '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"initContainers":[{"name":"init-db","env":[{"name":"POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE","value":"/run/secrets/stackrox.io/secrets/password"}],"command":["/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh","postgres","-c","config_file=/etc/postgresql.conf"],"volumeMounts":[{"name":"db-data","mountPath":"/var/lib/postgresql/data"},{"name":"scanner-db-tls-volume","mountPath":"/run/secrets/stackrox.io/certs","readOnly":true},{"name":"scanner-db-password","mountPath":"/run/secrets/stackrox.io/secrets","readOnly":true}],"securityContext":{"runAsGroup":70,"runAsNonRoot":true,"runAsUser":70}}]}}}}'
----
. Remove the path:
* If you use {ocp}, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox patch deployment.apps/scanner-db --type json --patch '[{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/volumeMounts/2"}]'
----
* If you use Kubernetes, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl -n stackrox patch deployment.apps/scanner-db --type json --patch '[{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/volumeMounts/2"}]'
