== Creating a single etcd backup

Follow these steps to create a single etcd backup by creating and applying a custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* If dynamically-provisioned storage is available, complete the following steps to create a single automated etcd backup:
+
.. Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) named `etcd-backup-pvc.yaml` with contents such as the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: etcd-backup-pvc
  namespace: openshift-etcd
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 200Gi <1>
  volumeMode: Filesystem
----
<1> The amount of storage available to the PVC. Adjust this value for your requirements.
+
.. Apply the PVC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f etcd-backup-pvc.yaml
----
+
.. Verify the creation of the PVC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pvc
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME              STATUS    VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
etcd-backup-pvc   Bound                                                       51s
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Dynamic PVCs stay in the `Pending` state until they are mounted.
====
+
.. Create a CR file named `etcd-single-backup.yaml` with contents such as the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: EtcdBackup
metadata:
  name: etcd-single-backup
  namespace: openshift-etcd
spec:
  pvcName: etcd-backup-pvc <1>
----
<1> The name of the PVC to save the backup to. Adjust this value according to your environment.
+
.. Apply the CR to start a single backup:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f etcd-single-backup.yaml
----

* If dynamically-provisioned storage is not available, complete the following steps to create a single automated etcd backup:
+
.. Create a `StorageClass` CR file named `etcd-backup-local-storage.yaml` with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: etcd-backup-local-storage
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
----
+
.. Apply the `StorageClass` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f etcd-backup-local-storage.yaml
----
+
.. Create a PV named `etcd-backup-pv-fs.yaml` with contents such as the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: etcd-backup-pv-fs
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 100Gi <1>
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: etcd-backup-local-storage
  local:
    path: /mnt
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
      - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
         operator: In
         values:
         - <example_master_node> <2>
----
<1> The amount of storage available to the PV. Adjust this value for your requirements.
<2> Replace this value with the node to attach this PV to.
+
.. Verify the creation of the PV by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pv
