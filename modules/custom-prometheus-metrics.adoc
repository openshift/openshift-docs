= Custom Prometheus metrics

[role="_abstract"]
You can enable some {rh-rhacs-first} product metrics and scrape them with a dedicated Prometheus server in order to display them in a visualization application such as Perses or Grafana.

You can use a tool such as link:https://perses.dev/perses/docs/overview/[Perses] to display charts based on these metrics. For example, you can create a Perses dashboard to use in the {ocp} console that displays {product-title-short} data.
