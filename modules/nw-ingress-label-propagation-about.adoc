= About label propagation from Ingress to Route resources

By default, the managed `Route` object described in the previous section does not inherit labels from the `Ingress` resource.

You can opt-in to a feature that enables the Ingress Operator to automatically propagate labels. When enabled, the operator actively reconciles the labels on the generated `Route` resource to match the labels on the parent `Ingress` resource. This is useful for adding metadata that helps you track or manage resources, or to control specific behaviors that depend on labels.

[NOTE]
====
When label propagation is enabled, the Ingress Operator replaces all labels on the managed `Route` resource with the exact set of labels from the parent `Ingress` resource. Any labels that were manually added to the `Route` resource are removed.

.Understanding the label reconciliation lifecycle
The propagation behavior is controlled by the `route.openshift.io/reconcile-labels` annotation on the `Ingress` resource. The operator's behavior changes depending on the state of this annotation:

* Annotation not present (default): The operator does not sync labels from the `Ingress` resource to the `Route` resource. Any existing labels on the `Route` are preserved.
* Annotation enabled (`route.openshift.io/reconcile-labels: "true"`): The operator enables label propagation. On the next reconciliation (triggered by the `Ingress` create or update event), the operator replaces all labels on the generated `Route` resource with the labels from the `Ingress` resource.
* Annotation disabled (removed or value set to non-"true"): The operator disables label propagation. The labels that currently exist on the `Route` resource are kept as-is, but the operator no longer syncs them with the `Ingress` resource.
* Annotation re-enabled: The operator resumes propagation. It will again replace all labels on the `Route` resource with the current labels from the `Ingress` resource.
