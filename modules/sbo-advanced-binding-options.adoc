= Advanced binding options

[role="_abstract"]
Advanced binding options are available only for the `binding.operators.coreos.com` API group.

== Changing the binding names before projecting them into the workload
You can specify the rules to change the binding names in the .spec.namingStrategy attribute of the `ServiceBinding` custom resource (CR). For example, consider a Spring PetClinic sample application that connects to the PostgreSQL database. In this case, the PostgreSQL database service exposes the host and port fields of the database to use for binding. The Spring PetClinic sample application can access this exposed binding data through the binding names.

.Example: Spring PetClinic sample application in the `ServiceBinding` CR
[source,yaml]
----
...
    application:
      name: spring-petclinic
      group: apps
      version: v1
      resource: deployments
...
----

.Example: PostgreSQL database service in the `ServiceBinding` CR
[source,yaml]
----
...
    services:
    - group: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com
      version: v1beta1
      kind: PostgresCluster
      name: hippo
...
----

If `namingStrategy` is not defined and the binding names are projected as environment variables, then the `host: hippo-pgbouncer` value in the backing service and the projected environment variable would appear as shown in the following example:

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
DATABASE_HOST: hippo-pgbouncer
----
where:
[horizontal]
`DATABASE`:: Specifies the `kind` backend service.
`HOST`:: Specifies the binding name.

After applying the `POSTGRESQL_{{ .service.kind | upper }}_{{ .name | upper }}_ENV` naming strategy, the  list of custom binding names prepared by the service binding request appears as shown in the following example:

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
POSTGRESQL_DATABASE_HOST_ENV: hippo-pgbouncer
POSTGRESQL_DATABASE_PORT_ENV: 5432
----

The following items describe the expressions defined in the `POSTGRESQL_{{ .service.kind | upper }}_{{ .name | upper }}_ENV` naming strategy:

* `.name`: Refers to the binding name exposed by the backing service. In the previous example, the binding names are `HOST` and `PORT`.
* `.service.kind`: Refers to the kind of service resource whose binding names are changed with the naming strategy.
* `upper`: String function used to post-process the character string while compiling the Go template string.
* `POSTGRESQL`: Prefix of the custom binding name.
* `ENV`: Suffix of the custom binding name.

Similar to the previous example, you can define the string templates in `namingStrategy` to define how each key of the binding names should be prepared by the service binding request.

== Composing custom binding data
As an application developer, you can compose custom binding data under the following circumstances:

* The backing service does not expose binding data.
* The values exposed are not available in the required format as expected by the workload.

For example, consider a case where the backing service CR exposes the host, port, and database user as binding data, but the workload requires that the binding data be consumed as a connection string.
You can compose custom binding data using attributes in the Kubernetes resource representing the backing service.

.Example
[source,yaml]
