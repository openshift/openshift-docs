= Building a simple container

You have an idea for an application and you want to containerize it. All you need to get started is a tool for building a container (buildah or docker) and a file that describes what will go into your container (typically, a https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/&sa=D&ust=1557950770705000[Dockerfile]). Next you will want a place to push the resulting container image (a container registry) so you can pull it to run anywhere you want it to run.

Some examples of each of those components just described come with most Linux systems, except for the Dockerfile which you provide yourself. The following diagram shows what the process of building and pushing an image entails:

Using a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system as an example, here’s what the process of creating a containerized application might look like:

* Install container build tools: RHEL contains a set of tools (podman, buildah, skopeo and others) for building and managing containers. In particular, the command line buildah build-using-dockerfile can replace the common docker build command for turning your Dockerfile and software into a container image. You can also build container without a Dockerfile using buildah.
* Create Dockerfile to combine base image and software: Information about building your container goes into a file named Dockerfile. In that file you identify the base image you build from, the software package you install, and the software you copy into the container. You also identify things like network ports you expose outside the container and volumes you mount inside the container. Put your Dockerfile and the software you want to containerized in a directory on your RHEL system.
* Run buildah or docker build: Running buildah or docker build pulls your chosen base image to the local system and creates a container image that is stored locally.
* Tag and push to a registry: Add a tag to your new container image that identifies the location of the registry in which you want to store and share your container. Then push that image, podman push or docker push, to the registry.
* Pull and run the image: From any system that has a container client tool, such as podman or docker, run a command line that identifies your new image. For example, run podman run or docker run, followed by the name of your new container image (for example, quay.io/myrepo/myapp:latest). The registry might require credentials to push and pull images.

Along this process, you needed to make some decisions about the tools and features you use. Some of those choices are detailed here.
