= Secure, protect, and connect APIs on {ocp} with {prodname}

[role="_abstract"]
This guide shows how you can use {prodname} on {ocp} to secure, protect, and connect an API exposed by a Gateway that uses Kubernetes Gateway API. This guide applies to the platform engineer and application developer user roles in {prodname}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In multi-cluster environments, you must perform the following steps in each cluster individually, unless specifically excluded.

== {prodname} capabilities in multicluster environments

You can use {prodname} capabilities in single or multiple {ocp} clusters. The following features are designed to work across multiple clusters and in a single-cluster environment:

* Multicluster ingress: {prodname} provides multicluster ingress connectivity using DNS to bring traffic to your gateways by using a strategy defined in a `DNSPolicy`.
* Global rate limiting: {prodname} can enable global rate limiting use cases when configured to use a shared Redis-based store for counters based on limits defined by a `RateLimitPolicy`.
* Global auth: You can configure a {prodname} `AuthPolicy` to use external auth providers to ensure that different clusters exposing the same API can authenticate and allow in the same way.
* Automatic TLS certificate generation: You can configure a `TLSPolicy` to automatically provision TLS certificates based on Gateway listener hosts by using integration with cert-manager and ACME providers such as Let's Encrypt.
* Integration with federated metrics stores:  {prodname} has example dashboards and metrics for visualizing your gateways and observing traffic hitting those gateways across multiple clusters.

[id="rhcl-multicluster-user-workflow_{context}"]
== {prodname} user role workflows

* *Platform engineer*: This guide shows how platform engineers can deploy gateways that provide secure communication and are protected and ready for use by application development teams to deploy APIs.
+
Platform engineers can use {prodname} in clusters in different geographic regions to bring specific traffic to geo-located gateways. This approach reduces latency, distributes load, and protects and secures with global rate limiting and auth policies.
* *Application developer*: This guide shows how application developers can override the Gateway-level global auth and rate limiting policies to configure application-level auth and rate limiting requirements for specific users.

[id="rhcl-deployment-management_{context}"]
== Deployment management

The examples in this guide use `kubectl` commands for simplicity. However, working with multiple clusters is complex, and it is best to use a tool such as {ocp} GitOps, based on Argo CD, to manage the deployment of resources to multiple clusters.
//TODO: then we should show gitops or link to it; what is used in production?
