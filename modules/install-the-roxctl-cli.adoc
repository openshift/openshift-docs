= Install the roxctl CLI

[role="_abstract"]
To manage the {rh-rhacs-first} resources, you can install the `roxctl` CLI binary directly. Download the executable file compatible with your operating system architecture and configure the necessary permissions to run commands from your system path. This manual installation method allows you to set up the CLI on Linux, macOS, or Windows environments without relying on external package managers.
