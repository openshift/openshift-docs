= Running hosted clusters on AMD64 and AMD64 architectures

By default for {hcp} on {aws-first}, you use an AMD64 hosted cluster. However, you can enable {hcp} to run on an ARM64 hosted cluster.

For compatible combinations of node pools and hosted clusters, see the following table:

.Compatible architectures for node pools and hosted clusters
[cols="2,2",options="header"]

| Hosted cluster | Node pools
| AMD64 | AMD64 or ARM64
| ARM64 | ARM64 or AMD64
