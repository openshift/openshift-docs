You must retrieve the Multicloud Object Gateway (MCG) credentials and S3 endpoint, which you need to configure MCG as a replication repository for the {mtc-first}.

You must retrieve the Multicloud Object Gateway (MCG) credentials, which you need to create a `Secret` custom resource (CR) for {mtc-short}.

.Prerequisites
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* Ensure that you have downloaded the {cluster-manager-url-pull} as shown in _Obtaining the installation program_ in the installation documentation for your platform.
+
If you have the pull secret, add the `redhat-operators` catalog to the OperatorHub custom resource (CR) as shown in _Configuring {product-title} to use Red Hat Operators_.
endif::[]
* You must deploy {rh-storage} by using the appropriate link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.15[{rh-storage-first} deployment guide].

.Procedure
ifdef::installing-3-4,installing-mtc[]
* Obtain the S3 endpoint, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` value by running the `oc describe` command for the `NooBaa` CR.
+
You use these credentials to add MCG as a replication repository.
endif::[]
ifdef::installing-oadp-mcg[]
. Create an MCG bucket. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/latest/html-single/managing_hybrid_and_multicloud_resources/index[Managing hybrid and multicloud resources].

. Obtain the S3 endpoint, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and the bucket name by running the `oc describe` command on the bucket resource.

. Create a `credentials-velero` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF > ./credentials-velero
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
EOF
----
+
You can use the `credentials-velero` file to create a `Secret` object when you install the Data Protection Application.
