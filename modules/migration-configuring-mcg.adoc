.Prerequisites
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* Ensure that you have downloaded the {cluster-manager-url-pull} as shown in _Obtaining the installation program_ in the installation documentation for your platform.
+
If you have the pull secret, add the `redhat-operators` catalog to the OperatorHub custom resource (CR) as shown in _Configuring {product-title} to use Red Hat Operators_.
endif::[]
* You must deploy {rh-storage} by using the appropriate link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.15[{rh-storage-first} deployment guide].

.Procedure
ifdef::installing-3-4,installing-mtc[]
* Obtain the S3 endpoint, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` by running the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.15/html/managing_hybrid_and_multicloud_resources/accessing-the-multicloud-object-gateway-with-your-applications_rhodf#accessing-the-Multicloud-object-gateway-from-the-terminal_rhodf[`describe` command] on the `NooBaa` custom resource.
+
You use these credentials to add MCG as a replication repository.
endif::[]
ifdef::installing-oadp-mcg[]
. Obtain the S3 endpoint, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` by running the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation//red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.15/html/managing_hybrid_and_multicloud_resources/accessing-the-multicloud-object-gateway-with-your-applications_rhodf#accessing-the-Multicloud-object-gateway-from-the-terminal_rhodf[`describe` command] on the `NooBaa` custom resource.
. Create a `credentials-velero` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF > ./credentials-velero
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
EOF
----
+
You use the `credentials-velero` file to create a `Secret` object when you install the Data Protection Application.
