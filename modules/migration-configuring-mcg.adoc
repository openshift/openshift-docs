= Retrieving Multicloud Object Gateway credentials

ifdef::installing-3-4,installing-mtc[]
You must retrieve the Multicloud Object Gateway (MCG) credentials and S3 endpoint in order to configure MCG as a replication repository for the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}).
endif::[]
You must retrieve the Multicloud Object Gateway (MCG) bucket credentials in order to create a `Secret` custom resource (CR) for the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).
//ifdef::installing-oadp-mcg[]
//endif::[]

MCG is a component of {rh-storage}.

.Prerequisites
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* Ensure that you have downloaded the {cluster-manager-url-pull} as shown in _Obtaining the installation program_ in the installation documentation for your platform.
+
If you have the pull secret, add the `redhat-operators` catalog to the OperatorHub custom resource (CR) as shown in _Configuring {product-title} to use Red Hat Operators_.
endif::[]
* You must deploy {rh-storage} by using the appropriate link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.12[OpenShift Data Foundation deployment guide].

.Procedure

. Create a bucket using MCG resources according to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.12/html-single/managing_hybrid_and_multicloud_resources/index#doc-wrapper[Managing hybrid and multicloud resources guide].

. Obtain the S3 endpoint, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `bucket name` by running the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.9/html/managing_hybrid_and_multicloud_resources/accessing-the-multicloud-object-gateway-with-your-applications_rhodf#accessing-the-Multicloud-object-gateway-from-the-terminal_rhodf[`describe` command] to the bucket resource created.

. Create a `credentials-velero` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF > ./credentials-velero
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
EOF
----
+
You use the `credentials-velero` file to create a `Secret` object when you install the Data Protection Application. To know more about the specifics of creating the appropriate secrets see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html-single/backup_and_restore/index#oadp-about-backup-snapshot-locations_installing-oadp-mcg[About backup and snapshot locations and their secrets].
