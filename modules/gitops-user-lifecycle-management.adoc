= User lifecycle management

The Argo CD Operator also manages the lifecycle of local user accounts. You can temporarily disable users without removing them from the configuration, or permanently remove them when they are no longer required.

Disable users::

You can disable a user by setting the `enabled` field to `false`. When a user is disabled, the following behaviors apply:

* The user account remains in the Argo CD configuration, but it is set to disabled.  
* The user secret and tokens are preserved.  
* The user cannot authenticate by using the UI or by the API tokens.  
* Token renewal timers continue to run, if configured.  
* Re-enabling the user (`enabled: true`) immediately restores access.  

User removal::

You can remove a user completely by deleting the entry from the `localUsers` list in the Argo CD CR. When a user is removed, the following behaviors apply:

* The user secret is deleted.  
* The token is removed from the Argo CD configuration.  
* Any scheduled token renewal timers are canceled.  
* The user account is removed from Argo CD.
