[id="sending-traces-and-metrics-to-otel-collector-with-sidecar_{context}"]
= Sending traces and metrics to the OpenTelemetry Collector with sidecar injection

You can set up sending telemetry data to an OpenTelemetry Collector instance with sidecar injection.

The {OTELOperator} allows sidecar injection into deployment workloads and automatic configuration of your instrumentation to send telemetry data to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

.Prerequisites

* The {TempoName} is installed, and a TempoStack instance is deployed.

* You have access to the cluster through the web console or the {oc-first}:

** You are logged in to the web console as a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

** An active {oc-first} session by a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

** For {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Create a project for an OpenTelemetry Collector instance.

. Create a service account.

. Grant the permissions to the service account for the `k8sattributes` and `resourcedetection` processors.

<1> This points to the Gateway of the TempoStack instance deployed by using the `<example>` {TempoOperator}.

. Create your deployment using the `otel-collector-sidecar` service account.

. Add the `sidecar.opentelemetry.io/inject: "true"` annotation to your `Deployment` object. This will inject all the needed environment variables to send data from your workloads to the OpenTelemetry Collector instance.
