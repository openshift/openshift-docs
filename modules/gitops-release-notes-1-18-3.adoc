== Fixed issues

Reconciliation timeout configuration mapping fix::
Before this update, reconciliation timeout values configured in `extraConfig` field were not correctly mapped to the Operator's environment variables. With this update, the `timeout.reconciliation` field is correctly mapped to the appropriate environment variable in the Operator's deployment logic. As a result, the Operator correctly applies user-defined timeouts for consistent control over sync cycles.

The `TargetDown` alert no longer triggers after upgrading to version 1.17.3::
Before this update, during an upgrade from version 1.17.2 to 1.17.3, the `TargetDown` alert was triggered because the metrics endpoint returned a `403 Forbidden` response. With this update, role-based access control (RBAC) permissions explicitly allow access to the `/metrics` non-resource URL by using `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects. As a result, Prometheus successfully scrapes metrics and resolves the `TargetDown` alert.

The `redis-ha-haproxy` deployment now automatically reflects the desired replica count::
Before this update, during Operator upgrades, the `redis-ha-haproxy` deployment kept outdated replica configurations. As a consequence, the deployment did not automatically reflect the desired state. With this update, the deployment synchronizes the replica count during the reconciliation process. As a result, `redis-ha-haproxy` replicas remain synchronized with the configuration across upgrades.
