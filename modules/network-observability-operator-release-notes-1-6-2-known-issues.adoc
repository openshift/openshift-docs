You can review the known issues for the Network Observability Operator 1.6.2 release.

* There was a compatibility issue with console plugins that would have prevented network observability from being installed on future versions of an {product-title} cluster. By upgrading to 1.6.2, the compatibility issue is resolved and network observability can be installed as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1737[*NETOBSERV-1737*])
