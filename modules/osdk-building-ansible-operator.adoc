= Building an Ansible-based Operator using the Operator SDK

This procedure walks through an example of building a simple Memcached Operator
powered by Ansible playbooks and modules using tools and libraries provided by
the Operator SDK.

.Prerequisites

- Operator SDK CLI installed on the development workstation
- Access to a Kubernetes-based cluster v1.11.3+ (for example {product-title} {product-version})
using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions
- OpenShift CLI (`oc`) v4.1+ installed
- link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html[`ansible`] v2.6.0+
- link:https://ansible-runner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html[`ansible-runner`] v1.1.0+
- link:https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner-http[`ansible-runner-http`] v1.0.0+

.Procedure

. *Create a new Operator project,* either namespace-scoped or cluster-scoped,
using the `operator-sdk new` command. Choose one of the following:

.. A _namespace-scoped Operator_ (the default) watches and manages resources in a
single namespace. Namespace-scoped operators are preferred because of their
flexibility. They enable decoupled upgrades, namespace isolation for failures
and monitoring, and differing API definitions.
+
To create a new Ansible-based, namespace-scoped `memcached-operator` project and
change to its directory, use the following commands:
+
----
$ operator-sdk new memcached-operator \
    --api-version=cache.example.com/v1alpha1 \
    --kind=Memcached \
    --type=ansible
$ cd memcached-operator
----
+
This creates the `memcached-operator` project specifically for watching the
Memcached resource with APIVersion `example.com/v1apha1` and Kind `Memcached`.

.. A _cluster-scoped Operator_ watches and manages resources cluster-wide, which
can be useful in certain cases. For example, the `cert-manager` operator is
often deployed with cluster-scoped permissions and watches so that it can manage
issuing certificates for an entire cluster.
+
To create your `memcached-operator` project to be cluster-scoped and change to
its directory, use the following commands:
+
----
$ operator-sdk new memcached-operator \
    --cluster-scoped \
    --api-version=cache.example.com/v1alpha1 \
    --kind=Memcached \
    --type=ansible
$ cd memcached-operator
----
+
Using the `--cluster-scoped` flag scaffolds the new Operator with the following
modifications:
+
--
* `deploy/operator.yaml`: Set `WATCH_NAMESPACE=""` instead of setting it to the
Pod's namespace.
* `deploy/role.yaml`: Use `ClusterRole` instead of `Role`.
* `deploy/role_binding.yaml`:
** Use `ClusterRoleBinding` instead of `RoleBinding`.
** Set the subject namespace to `REPLACE_NAMESPACE`. This must be changed to the
namespace in which the Operator is deployed.
--

. *Customize the Operator logic.*
+
For this example, the `memcached-operator` executes the following reconciliation
logic for each `Memcached` Custom Resource (CR):
+
--
* Create a `memcached` Deployment if it does not exist.
* Ensure that the Deployment size is the same as specified by the `Memcached` CR.
--
+
By default, the `memcached-operator` watches `Memcached` resource events as
shown in the `watches.yaml` file and executes the Ansible role `Memcached`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- version: v1alpha1
  group: cache.example.com
  kind: Memcached
----
+
You can optionally customize the following logic in the `watches.yaml` file:

.. Specifying a `role` option configures the Operator to use this specified path
when launching `ansible-runner` with an Ansible role. By default, the new
command fills in an absolute path to where your role should go:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- version: v1alpha1
  group: cache.example.com
  kind: Memcached
  role: /opt/ansible/roles/memcached
----

.. Specifying a `playbook` option in the `watches.yaml` file configures the
Operator to use this specified path when launching `ansible-runner` with an
Ansible playbook:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- version: v1alpha1
  group: cache.example.com
  kind: Memcached
  playbook: /opt/ansible/playbook.yaml
----

. *Build the Memcached Ansible role.*
+
Modify the generated Ansible role under the `roles/memcached/` directory. This
Ansible role controls the logic that is executed when a resource is modified.

.. *Define the `Memcached` spec.*
+
Defining the spec for an Ansible-based Operator can be done entirely in Ansible.
The Ansible Operator passes all key-value pairs listed in the CR spec field
along to Ansible as
link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#passing-variables-on-the-command-line[variables].
The names of all variables in the spec field are converted to snake case
(lowercase with an underscore) by the Operator before running Ansible. For
example, `serviceAccount` in the spec becomes `service_account` in Ansible.
+
[TIP]
====
You should perform some type validation in Ansible on the variables to ensure
that your application is receiving expected input.
====
+
In case the user does not set the `spec` field, set a default by modifying the
`roles/memcached/defaults/main.yml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
size: 1
----

.. *Define the `Memcached` Deployment.*
+
With the `Memcached` spec now defined, you can define what Ansible is actually
executed on resource changes. Because this is an Ansible role, the default
behavior executes the tasks in the `roles/memcached/tasks/main.yml` file.
+
The goal is for Ansible to create a Deployment if it does not exist, which runs
the `memcached:1.4.36-alpine` image. Ansible 2.7+ supports the
link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.7/modules/k8s_module.html[k8s Ansible module],
which this example leverages to control the Deployment definition.
+
Modify the `roles/memcached/tasks/main.yml` to match the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- name: start memcached
  k8s:
    definition:
      kind: Deployment
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      metadata:
        name: '{{ meta.name }}-memcached'
        namespace: '{{ meta.namespace }}'
      spec:
        replicas: "{{size}}"
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: memcached
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: memcached
          spec:
            containers:
            - name: memcached
              command:
              - memcached
              - -m=64
              - -o
              - modern
              - -v
              image: "docker.io/memcached:1.4.36-alpine"
              ports:
                - containerPort: 11211
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This example used the `size` variable to control the number of replicas of the
`Memcached` Deployment. This example sets the default to `1`, but any user can
create a CR that overwrites the default.
====

. *Deploy the CRD.*
+
Before running the Operator, Kubernetes needs to know about the new Custom
Resource Definition (CRD) the Operator will be watching. Deploy the `Memcached`
CRD:
+
----
$ oc create -f deploy/crds/cache.example.com_memcacheds_crd.yaml
----

. *Build and run the Operator.*
+
There are two ways to build and run the Operator:
+
--
* As a Pod inside a Kubernetes cluster.
* As a Go program outside the cluster using the `operator-sdk up` command.
--
+
Choose one of the following methods:

.. *Run as a Pod* inside a Kubernetes cluster. This is the preferred
method for production use.

... Build the `memcached-operator` image and push it to a registry:
+
----
$ operator-sdk build quay.io/example/memcached-operator:v0.0.1
$ podman push quay.io/example/memcached-operator:v0.0.1
----

... Deployment manifests are generated in the `deploy/operator.yaml` file. The
deployment image in this file needs to be modified from the placeholder
`REPLACE_IMAGE` to the previous built image. To do this, run:
+
----
$ sed -i 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|quay.io/example/memcached-operator:v0.0.1|g' deploy/operator.yaml
----

... If you created your Operator using the `--cluster-scoped=true` flag, update the
service account namespace in the generated `ClusterRoleBinding` to match where
you are deploying your Operator:
+
----
$ export OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=$(oc config view --minify -o jsonpath='{.contexts[0].context.namespace}')
$ sed -i "s|REPLACE_NAMESPACE|$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE|g" deploy/role_binding.yaml
----
+
If you are performing these steps on OSX, use the following commands instead:
+
----
$ sed -i "" 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|quay.io/example/memcached-operator:v0.0.1|g' deploy/operator.yaml
$ sed -i "" "s|REPLACE_NAMESPACE|$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE|g" deploy/role_binding.yaml
----

... Deploy the `memcached-operator`:
+
----
$ oc create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/role.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/operator.yaml
----

... Verify that the `memcached-operator` is up and running:
+
----
$ oc get deployment
NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
memcached-operator       1         1         1            1           1m
----

.. *Run outside the cluster.* This method is preferred during the
development cycle to speed up deployment and testing.
+
Ensure that Ansible Runner and Ansible Runner HTTP Plug-in are installed or else
you will see unexpected errors from Ansible Runner when a CR is created.
+
It is also important that the role path referenced in the `watches.yaml` file
exists on your machine. Because normally a container is used where the role is
put on disk, the role must be manually copied to the configured Ansible roles
path (for example `/etc/ansible/roles`).

... To run the Operator locally with the default Kubernetes configuration file
present at `$HOME/.kube/config`:
+
----
$ operator-sdk up local
----
+
To run the Operator locally with a provided Kubernetes configuration file:
+
----
$ operator-sdk up local --kubeconfig=config
----

. *Create a `Memcached` CR.*

.. Modify the `deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml` file as shown and
create a `Memcached` CR:
+
----
$ cat deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml
apiVersion: "cache.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Memcached"
metadata:
  name: "example-memcached"
spec:
  size: 3

$ oc apply -f deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml
----

.. Ensure that the `memcached-operator` creates the Deployment for the CR:
+
----
$ oc get deployment
NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
memcached-operator       1         1         1            1           2m
example-memcached        3         3         3            3           1m
----

.. Check the Pods to confirm three replicas were created:
+
----
$ oc get pods
NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-memcached-6fd7c98d8-7dqdr     1/1       Running   0          1m
example-memcached-6fd7c98d8-g5k7v     1/1       Running   0          1m
example-memcached-6fd7c98d8-m7vn7     1/1       Running   0          1m
memcached-operator-7cc7cfdf86-vvjqk   1/1       Running   0          2m
----

. *Update the size.*

.. Change the `spec.size` field in the `memcached` CR from `3` to `4` and apply the
change:
+
----
$ cat deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml
apiVersion: "cache.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Memcached"
metadata:
  name: "example-memcached"
spec:
  size: 4

$ oc apply -f deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml
----

.. Confirm that the Operator changes the Deployment size:
+
----
$ oc get deployment
NAME                 DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
example-memcached    4         4         4            4           5m
----

. *Clean up the resources:*
+
----
$ oc delete -f deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml
$ oc delete -f deploy/operator.yaml
$ oc delete -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
$ oc delete -f deploy/role.yaml
$ oc delete -f deploy/service_account.yaml
$ oc delete -f deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_crd.yaml
