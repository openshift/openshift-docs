== Adding the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) service to a blueprint 

When you install {microshift-short}, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) package is not installed by default. You can add the `microshift-olm` package in the ostree blueprint to enable OLM in {microshift-short}.

. Edit your ostree blueprint by running the following example command:
+
[source,terminal]
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ vi _<microshift_blueprint.toml>_ <1>
----
<1> Specify the name of the blueprint file you used when adding the MicroShift service.

. Add the following example text to your ostree blueprint:
+
[source,text]
----
[[packages]]
name = "microshift-olm"
version = "*"
----
. To apply the manifest from the package to an active cluster, you must build a new OSTree system then deploy it on the machine. To update your OSTree system, use the instruction's in "Applying updates on an OSTree system"
