= Seed image guidelines

The seed image targets a set of {sno} clusters with similar configuration.
This means that the seed cluster needs to have the same configuration as the target clusters for the following items:

* Performance profile
* `MachineConfig` resources for the target cluster
* IP version
+
[NOTE]
====
Dual-stack networking is not supported in this release.
====

* Set of Day 2 Operators, including the {lcao} and the OADP Operator
* Disconnected registry
* FIPS configuration
* If the target cluster has multiple IPs and one of them belongs to the subnet that was used for creating the seed image, the upgrade fails if the target cluster's node IP does not belong to that subnet.

The following configurations only have to partially match on the participating clusters:

* If the target cluster has a proxy configuration, the seed cluster must have a proxy configuration too but the configuration does not have to be the same.
* A dedicated partition on the primary disk for container storage is required on all participating clusters. However, the size and start of the partition does not have to be the same. Only the `spec.config.storage.disks.partitions.label: varlibcontainers` label in the `MachineConfig` CR must match on both the seed and target clusters.
For more information about how to create the disk partition, see _Configuring a shared container directory between ostree stateroots_ or _Configuring a shared container directory between ostree stateroots when using GitOps ZTP_.
