= Deploying a leader worker set

You can use the {lws-operator} to deploy a leader worker set to assist with managing distributed workloads across nodes.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {lws-operator}.

.Procedure

. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project my-namespace
----

. Create a file named `leader-worker-set.yaml`
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: leaderworkerset.x-k8s.io/v1
kind: LeaderWorkerSet

where:

metadata.name::
Specifies the name of the leader worker set resource.

metadata.namespace::
Specifies the namespace for the leader worker set to run in.

spec.leaderWorkerTemplate.leaderTemplate::
Specifies the pod template for the leader pods.

spec.leaderWorkerTemplate.restartPolicy::
Specifies the restart policy for when pod failures occur. Allowed values are `RecreateGroupOnPodRestart` to restart the whole group or `None` to not restart the group.

spec.leaderWorkerTemplate.size::
Specifies the number of pods to create for each group, including the leader pod. For example, a value of `3` creates 1 leader pod and 2 worker pods. The default value is `1`.

spec.leaderWorkerTemplate.workerTemplate::
Specifies the pod template for the worker pods.

spec.networkConfig.subdomainPolicy::
Specifies the policy to use when creating the headless service. Allowed values are `UniquePerReplica` or `Shared`. The default value is `Shared`.

spec.replicas::
Specifies the number of replicas, or leader-worker groups. The default value is `1`.

spec.rolloutStrategy.rollingUpdateConfiguration.maxSurge::
Specifies the maximum number of replicas that can be scheduled above the `replicas` value during rolling updates. The value can be specified as an integer or a percentage.

For more information on all available fields to configure, see link:https://lws.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/leaderworkerset.v1/[LeaderWorkerSet API] upstream documentation.

. Apply the leader worker set configuration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f leader-worker-set.yaml
----

.Verification

. Verify that pods were created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n my-namespace
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

. Review the stateful sets by running the following command:
