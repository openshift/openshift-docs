= Configuring live migration limits and timeouts

Configure live migration limits and timeouts for the cluster by updating the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR), which is located in the
`openshift-cnv` namespace.

.Procedure

* Edit the `HyperConverged` CR and add the necessary live migration parameters:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n {CNVNamespace}
----

.Example configuration file
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: {CNVNamespace}
spec:
  liveMigrationConfig:
    bandwidthPerMigration: 64Mi <1>
    completionTimeoutPerGiB: 800 <2>
    parallelMigrationsPerCluster: 5 <3>
    parallelOutboundMigrationsPerNode: 2 <4>
    progressTimeout: 150 <5>
----
<1> Bandwidth limit of each migration, in MiB/s or GiB/s. Default: `0`, which is unlimited.
<2> The migration is canceled if it has not completed in this time, in seconds per GiB of memory. For example, a VM with 6GiB memory times out if it has not completed migration in 4800 seconds. If the `Migration Method` is `BlockMigration`, the size of the migrating disks is included in the calculation.
<3> Number of migrations running in parallel in the cluster. Default: `5`.
<4> Maximum number of outbound migrations per node. Default: `2`.
<5> The migration is canceled if memory copy fails to make progress in this time, in seconds. Default: `150`.

[NOTE]
====
You can restore the default value for any `spec.liveMigrationConfig` field by deleting that key/value pair and saving the file. For example, delete `progressTimeout: <value>` to restore the default `progressTimeout: 150`.
