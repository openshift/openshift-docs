= Cluster notification policy

Cluster notifications are designed to keep you informed about the health of your cluster and high impact events that affect it.

Most cluster notifications are generated and sent automatically to ensure that you are immediately informed of problems or important changes to the state of your cluster.

In certain situations, Red{nbsp}Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) creates and sends cluster notifications to provide additional context and guidance for a complex issue.

Cluster notifications are not sent for low-impact events, low-risk security updates, routine operations and maintenance, or minor, transient issues that are quickly resolved by SRE.

Red{nbsp}Hat services automatically send notifications when:

* Remote health monitoring or environment verification checks detect an issue in your cluster, for example, when a worker node has low disk space.
* Significant cluster life cycle events occur, for example, when scheduled maintenance or upgrades begin, or cluster operations are impacted by an event, but do not require customer intervention.
* Significant cluster management changes occur, for example, when cluster ownership or administrative control is transferred from one user to another.
* Your cluster subscription is changed or updated, for example, when Red{nbsp}Hat makes updates to subscription terms or features available to your cluster.

SRE creates and sends notifications when:

* An incident results in a degradation or outage that impacts your cluster's availability or performance, for example, your cloud provider has a regional outage. SRE sends subsequent notifications to inform you of incident resolution progress, and when the incident is resolved.
* A security vulnerability, security breach, or unusual activity is detected on your cluster.
* Red{nbsp}Hat detects that changes you have made are creating or may result in cluster instability.
* Red{nbsp}Hat detects that your workloads are causing performance degradation or instability in your cluster.
