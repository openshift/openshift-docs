= Collecting PTP Operator data

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the `oc adm must-gather` command to collect information about your cluster, including features and objects associated with Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Operator.

[NOTE]
====
When you deploy the PTP Operator in a disconnected environment by using {ztp-first}, {ztp} mirrors the PTP `must-gather` image together with the PTP Operator images. You do not need to configure image mirroring for the PTP `must-gather` image to collect `must-gather` data.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

* You have installed the PTP Operator.

.Procedure

* To collect PTP Operator data with `must-gather`, you must specify the PTP Operator `must-gather` image.
