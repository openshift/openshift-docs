= Viewing Ignition configuration files

To see the Ignition config file used to deploy the bootstrap machine, run the
following command:

----
$ openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir $HOME/testconfig
----

After you answer a few questions, the `bootstrap.ign`, `master.ign`, and
`worker.ign` files appear in the directory you entered.

To see the contents of the `bootstrap.ign` file, pipe it through the `jq` filter.
Here’s a snippet from that file:

----
$ cat $HOME/testconfig/bootstrap.ign | jq
\\{
  "ignition": \\{
        "config": \\{},
  "storage": \\{
        "files": [
          \\{
            "filesystem": "root",
            "path": "/etc/motd",
            "user": \\{
              "name": "root"
            },
            "append": true,
            "contents": \\{
              "source": "data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,VGhpcyBpcyB0aGUgYm9vdHN0cmFwIG5vZGU7IGl0IHdpbGwgYmUgZGVzdHJveWVkIHdoZW4gdGhlIG1hc3RlciBpcyBmdWxseSB1cC4KClRoZSBwcmltYXJ5IHNlcnZpY2UgaXMgImJvb3RrdWJlLnNlcnZpY2UiLiBUbyB3YXRjaCBpdHMgc3RhdHVzLCBydW4gZS5nLgoKICBqb3VybmFsY3RsIC1iIC1mIC11IGJvb3RrdWJlLnNlcnZpY2UK",
----

To decode the contents of a file listed in the `bootstrap.ign` file, pipe the
base64-encoded data string representing the contents of that file to the `base64
-d` command. Here’s an example using the contents of the `/etc/motd` file added to
the bootstrap machine from the output shown above:

----
$ echo VGhpcyBpcyB0aGUgYm9vdHN0cmFwIG5vZGU7IGl0IHdpbGwgYmUgZGVzdHJveWVkIHdoZW4gdGhlIG1hc3RlciBpcyBmdWxseSB1cC4KClRoZSBwcmltYXJ5IHNlcnZpY2UgaXMgImJvb3RrdWJlLnNlcnZpY2UiLiBUbyB3YXRjaCBpdHMgc3RhdHVzLCBydW4gZS5nLgoKICBqb3VybmFsY3RsIC1iIC1mIC11IGJvb3RrdWJlLnNlcnZpY2UK | base64 -d

This is the bootstrap machine; it will be destroyed when the master is fully up.

The primary service is "bootkube.service". To watch its status, run, e.g.:

journalctl -b -f -u bootkube.service
----

Repeat those commands on the `master.ign` and `worker.ign` files to see the source
of Ignition config files for each of those machine types.  You should see a line
like the following for the `worker.ign`, identifying how it gets its Ignition
config from the bootstrap machine:

----
"source": "https://api.myign.develcluster.example.com:22623/config/worker",
----

Here are a few things you can learn from the `bootstrap.ign` file: +

* Format: The format of the file is defined in the
https://github.com/coreos/ignition/tree/spec2x[Ignition config spec].
Files of the same format are used later by the MCO to merge changes into a
machine’s configuration.
* Contents: Because the bootstrap machine serves the Ignition configs for other
machines, both master and worker machine Ignition config information is stored in the
`bootstrap.ign`, along with the bootstrap machine’s configuration.
* Size: The file is more than 1300 lines long, with path to various types of resources.
* The content of each file that will be copied to the machine is actually encoded
into data URLs, which tends to make the content a bit clumsy to read. (Use the
  jq and base64 commands shown previously to make the content more readable.)
* Configuration: The different sections of the Ignition config file are generally
 meant to contain files that are just dropped into a machine’s file system, rather
 than commands to modify existing files. For example, instead of having a section
 on NFS that configures that service, you would just add an NFS configuration
 file, which would then be started by the init process when the system comes up.
* users: A user named core is created, with your ssh key assigned to that user.
This allows you to log in to the cluster with that user name and your
credentials.
* storage: The storage section identifies files that are added to each machine. A
few notable files include `/root/.docker/config.json` (which provides credentials
  your cluster needs to pull from container image registries) and a bunch of
  manifest files in `/opt/openshift/manifests` that are used to configure your cluster.
* systemd: The systemd section holds content used to create systemd unit files.
Those files are used to start up services at boot time, as well as manage those
services on running systems.
* Primitives: Ignition also exposes low-level primitives that other tools can
build on.
