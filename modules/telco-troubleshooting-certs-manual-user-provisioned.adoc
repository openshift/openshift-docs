= User-provisioned API server certificates

The API server is accessible by clients that are external to the cluster at `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`.
You might want clients to access the API server at a different hostname or without the need to distribute the cluster-managed certificate authority (CA) certificates to the clients.
You must set a custom default certificate to be used by the API server when serving content.
