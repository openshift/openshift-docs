= Configuring a cluster-scoped Argo Rollouts instance to manage rollout resources

[role="_abstract"]
To configure a cluster-scoped Argo Rollouts instance for managing rollout resources, add the `CLUSTER_SCOPED_ARGO_ROLLOUTS_NAMESPACES` environment variable in the `Subscription` resource. This variable contains a list of user-defined namespaces which can be configured for a cluster-scoped Argo Rollouts installation. If the `CLUSTER_SCOPED_ARGO_ROLLOUTS_NAMESPACES` environment variable is empty, you can create cluster-scoped Argo Rollouts installation in the `openshift-gitops` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
You can only create a cluster-scoped Argo Rollouts instance if the `NAMESPACE_SCOPED_ARGO_ROLLOUTS` variable is set to `false`. By default, if the `NAMESPACE_SCOPED_ARGO_ROLLOUTS` variable is not defined, it is set to `false`.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators* → *Installed Operators* → *{gitops-title}* → *Subscription*.

. Click the *Actions* list and then click *Edit Subscription*.

. On the *openshift-gitops-operator* Subscription details page, under the *YAML* tab, edit the `Subscription` YAML file by adding the namespace of the Argo CD instance to the `CLUSTER_SCOPED_ARGO_ROLLOUTS_NAMESPACES` environment variable in the `spec` section:

<1> Specify this value to enable or disable the cluster-scoped installation. If the value is set to `'false'`, it means that the you have enabled cluster-scoped installation. If it is set to `'true'`, it means that you have enabled namespace-scoped installation. If the value is empty, it is set to `false`.
<2> Specifies a comma-separated list of namespaces that can host a cluster-scoped Argo Rollouts instance, for example `test-123-cluster-scoped,test-456-cluster-scoped`.
