[id="loki-network-policies_{context}"]
= Loki network policies

You can enable the {loki-op} to automatically create a `NetworkPolicy` resource that implements a "default deny" security model with explicit allow rules for required communications. 
Network policies provide network segmentation for your LokiStack deployment by controlling ingress and egress traffic between Loki components and external services.
The network policies in {loki-op} are designed to be secure by default while maintaining compatibility across diverse environments.

Network policies for Loki on {ocp-product-title} include the following additional integrations:

* Monitoring: Automatic integration with the {ocp-product-title} monitoring stack.
* DNS: Support for both standard and {ocp-product-title} DNS services (port 5353).
