= Collecting OVN network policy audit logs

You can collect the OVN network policy audit logs from the `/var/log/ovn/acl-audit-log.log` file on OVN-Kubernetes pods and forward them to logging servers.

.Prerequisites

* You are using {product-title} version 4.8 or later.
* You are using Cluster Logging 5.2 or later.
* You have already set up a `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR) object.
* The {product-title} cluster is configured for OVN-Kubernetes network policy audit logging. See the following "Additional resources" section.

[NOTE]
====
Often, logging servers that store audit data must meet organizational and governmental requirements for compliance and security.
====

.Procedure

. Create or edit a YAML file that defines the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR object as described in other topics on forwarding logs to third-party systems.

. In the YAML file, add the `audit` log type to the `inputRefs` element in a pipeline. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  pipelines:
   - name: audit-logs
     inputRefs:
      - audit <1>
     outputRefs:
      - secure-logging-server <2>
----
<1> Specify `audit` as one of the log types to input.
<2> Specify the output that connects to your logging server.

. Recreate the updated CR object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
----

.Verification

Verify that audit log entries from the nodes that you are monitoring are present among the log data gathered by the logging server.

Find an original audit log entry in `/var/log/ovn/acl-audit-log.log` and compare it with the corresponding log entry on the logging server.

For example, an original log entry in `/var/log/ovn/acl-audit-log.log` might look like this:

[source,txt]
----
2021-07-06T08:26:58.687Z|00004|acl_log(ovn_pinctrl0)|INFO|name="verify-audit-
logging_deny-all", verdict=drop, severity=alert:
icmp,vlan_tci=0x0000,dl_src=0a:58:0a:81:02:12,dl_dst=0a:58:0a:81:02:14,nw_src=10
.129.2.18,nw_dst=10.129.2.20,nw_tos=0,nw_ecn=0,nw_ttl=64,icmp_type=8,icmp_code=0
----

And the corresponding OVN audit log entry you find on the logging server might look like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "@timestamp" : "2021-07-06T08:26:58..687000+00:00",
  "hostname":"ip.abc.iternal",
  "level":"info",
  "message" : "2021-07-06T08:26:58.687Z|00004|acl_log(ovn_pinctrl0)|INFO|name=\"verify-audit-logging_deny-all\", verdict=drop, severity=alert: icmp,vlan_tci=0x0000,dl_src=0a:58:0a:81:02:12,dl_dst=0a:58:0a:81:02:14,nw_src=10.129.2.18,nw_dst=10.129.2.20,nw_tos=0,nw_ecn=0,nw_ttl=64,icmp_type=8,icmp_code=0"
}
----

Where:

* `@timestamp` is the timestamp of the log entry.
* `hostname` is the node from which the log originated.
* `level` is the log entry.
* `message` is the original audit log message.

[NOTE]
====
On an Elasticsearch server, look for log entries whose indices begin with `audit-00000`.
====

.Troubleshooting

. Verify that your {product-title} cluster meets all the prerequisites.
. Verify that you have completed the procedure.
. Verify that the nodes generating OVN logs are enabled and have `/var/log/ovn/acl-audit-log.log` files.
. Check the Fluentd pod logs for issues.
