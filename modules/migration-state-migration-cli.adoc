= State migration

You can perform repeatable, state-only migrations by using {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) to migrate persistent volume claims (PVCs) that constitute an application's state. You migrate specified PVCs by excluding other PVCs from the migration plan. Persistent volume (PV) data is copied to the target cluster. The PV references are not moved. The application pods continue to run on the source cluster. You can map the PVCs to ensure that the source and target PVCs are synchronized.

You can perform a one-time migration of Kubernetes objects that constitute an application's state.

If you have a CI/CD pipeline, you can migrate stateless components by deploying them on the target cluster. Then you can migrate stateful components by using {mtc-short}.

You can perform a state migration between clusters or within the same cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
State migration migrates only the components that constitute an application's state. If you want to migrate an entire namespace, use stage or cutover migration.
