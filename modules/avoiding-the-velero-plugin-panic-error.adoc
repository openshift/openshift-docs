= Avoiding the Velero plugin panic error

[role="_abstract"]
A missing secret can cause a panic error for the Velero plugin during image stream backups.

When the backup and the Backup Storage Location (BSL) are managed outside the scope of the Data Protection Application (DPA), the OADP controller does not create the relevant `oadp-<bsl_name>-<bsl_provider>-registry-secret` parameter.

During the backup operation, the OpenShift Velero plugin panics on the `imagestream` backup, with the following panic error:

[source,text]
----
024-02-27T10:46:50.028951744Z time="2024-02-27T10:46:50Z" level=error msg="Error backing up item"
backup=openshift-adp/<backup name> error="error executing custom action (groupResource=imagestreams.image.openshift.io,
namespace=<BSL Name>, name=postgres): rpc error: code = Aborted desc = plugin panicked:
runtime error: index out of range with length 1, stack trace: goroutine 94â€¦
----

Use the following workaround to avoid the Velero plugin panic error.

.Procedure

. Label the custom BSL with the relevant label by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label backupstoragelocations.velero.io <bsl_name> app.kubernetes.io/component=bsl
----

. After the BSL is labeled, wait until the DPA reconciles.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can force the reconciliation by making any minor change to the DPA itself.
====

.Verification

* After the DPA is reconciled, confirm that the parameter has been created and that the correct registry data has been populated into it by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-adp get secret/oadp-<bsl_name>-<bsl_provider>-registry-secret -o json | jq -r '.data'
