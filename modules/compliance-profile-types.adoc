= Compliance Operator profile types

Compliance Operator rules are organized into profiles. Profiles can target the Platform or Nodes for {product-title}, and some benchmarks include `rhcos4` Node profiles.

Platform:: Platform profiles evaluate your {product-title} cluster components. For example, a Platform-level rule can confirm whether APIServer configurations are using strong encryption cyphers.

Node:: Node profiles evaluate the OpenShift or {op-system} configuration of each host. You can use two Node profiles: `ocp4` Node profiles and `rhcos4` Node profiles. The `ocp4` Node profiles evaluate the OpenShift configuration of each host. For example, they can confirm whether `kubeconfig` files have the correct permissions to meet a compliance standard. The `rhcos4` Node profiles evaluate the {op-system-first} configuration of each host. For example, they can confirm whether the SSHD service is configured to disable password logins.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For benchmarks that have Node and Platform profiles, such as PCI-DSS, you must run both profiles in your {product-title} environment.

For benchmarks that have `ocp4` Platform, `ocp4` Node, and `rhcos4` Node profiles, such as FedRAMP High, you must run all three profiles in your {product-title} environment.

[NOTE]
====
In a cluster with many Nodes, both `ocp4` Node and `rhcos4` Node scans might take a long time to complete.
