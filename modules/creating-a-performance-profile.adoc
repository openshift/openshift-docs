= Creating a performance profile

[role="_abstract"]
You can create performance profiles to optimize node performance for low latency workloads by using the Performance Profile Creator tool, which generates profiles based on your hardware topology and use case requirements.

You can create a cluster performance profile by using the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool. The PPC is a function of the Node Tuning Operator.

The PPC combines information about your cluster with user-supplied configurations to generate a performance profile that is appropriate to your hardware, topology and use-case.

[NOTE]
====
Performance profiles are applicable only to bare-metal environments where the cluster has direct access to the underlying hardware resources. You can configure performances profiles for both {sno} and multi-node clusters.
====

The following is a high-level workflow for creating and applying a performance profile in your cluster:

* Create a machine config pool (MCP) for nodes that you want to target with performance configurations. In {sno} clusters, you must use the `master` MCP because there is only one node in the cluster.

* Gather information about your cluster using the `must-gather` command.

* Use the PPC tool to create a performance profile by using either of the following methods:

** Run the PPC tool by using Podman.

** Run the PPC tool by using a wrapper script.

* Configure the performance profile for your use case and apply the performance profile to your cluster.
