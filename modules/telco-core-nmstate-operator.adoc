= NMState Operator

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
The Kubernetes NMState Operator provides a Kubernetes API for performing state-driven network configuration across cluster nodes.
It enables network interface configurations, static IPs and DNS, VLANs, trunks, bonding, static routes, MTU, and enabling promiscuous mode on the secondary interfaces.
The cluster nodes periodically report on the state of each node's network interfaces to the API server.

Limits and requirements::
Not applicable

Engineering considerations::
* Initial networking configuration is applied using `NMStateConfig` content in the installation CRs.
The NMState Operator is used only when required for network updates.
* When SR-IOV virtual functions are used for host networking, the NMState Operator (via `nodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` CRs) is used to configure VF interfaces, such as VLANs and MTU.
