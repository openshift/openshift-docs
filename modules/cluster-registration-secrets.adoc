= Cluster registration secrets

[role="_abstract"]
A cluster registration secret (CRS) is a security artifact that allows a secured cluster to authenticate with Central.  You create a CRS by using the `roxctl` CLI.

The CRS ensures that the services on the secured cluster such as Sensor and Collector are authorized to communicate with your Central instance. Unlike init bundles, which can be created in the {rh-rhacs-first} portal, you must use the `roxctl` CLI to generate a CRS.

When you generate a CRS, the output is a standard Kubernetes Secret YAML file. You must apply this secret to the project namespace on the cluster where you intend to install the secured cluster services.

The following are the key characteristics of a CRS:

Security:: The generated file contains sensitive credentials and must be stored securely.
One-time generation:: You cannot retrieve a previously generated CRS from Central. If you lose the file, you must generate a new one.
Reusability:: You can use a single CRS to authenticate multiple secured clusters.
Expiration:: The secret includes an expiration date, after which it is no longer valid for registering new clusters.

[NOTE]
====
If you are installing secured cluster services by using Helm charts, you provide the CRS file during the `helm install` command execution rather than applying it as a separate step.
