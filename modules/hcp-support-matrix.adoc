[id="hcp-support-matrix_{context}"]
= Support matrix for {hcp}

Because {mce} includes the HyperShift Operator, releases of {hcp} align with releases of {mce-short}. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

[id="hcp-matrix-mgmt_{context}"]
== Management cluster support

Any supported standalone {product-title} cluster can be a management cluster.

[NOTE]
====
A single-node {product-title} cluster is not supported as a management cluster. If you have resource constraints, you can share infrastructure between a standalone {product-title} control plane and {hcp}. For more information, see "Shared infrastructure between hosted and standalone control planes".
====

The following table maps {mce-short} versions to the management cluster versions that support them:

.Supported {mce-short} versions for {product-title} management clusters
[cols="2",options="header"]
|===
|Management cluster version |Supported {mce-short} version

|4.14 - 4.15
|2.4

|4.14 - 4.16
|2.5

|4.14 - 4.17
|2.6

|4.15 - 4.17
|2.7
|===

[id="hcp-matrix-hc_{context}"]
== Hosted cluster support

For hosted clusters, no direct relationship exists between the management cluster version and the hosted cluster version. The hosted cluster version depends on the HyperShift Operator that is included with your {mce-short} version.

[NOTE]
====
Ensure a maximum latency of 200 ms between the management cluster and hosted clusters. This requirement is especially important for mixed infrastructure deployments, such as when your management cluster is on {aws-short} and your worker nodes are on-premise.
====

The following table maps {mce-short} versions to the hosted cluster versions that you can create by using the HyperShift Operator that is associated with that version of {mce-short}:

.Hosted cluster versions that can be created by {mce-short} versions
[cols="5",options="header"]
|===
|Hosted cluster version  |{mce-short} 2.4 |{mce-short} 2.5 |{mce-short} 2.6 |{mce-short} 2.7

[id="hcp-matrix-platform_{context}"]
== Hosted cluster platform support

The following table indicates which {product-title} versions are supported for each platform of {hcp}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For {ibm-power-title} and {ibm-z-title}, you must run the control plane on machine types based on 64-bit x86 architecture, and node pools on {ibm-power-title} or {ibm-z-title}.
====

In the following table, Management cluster version refers to the {product-title} version where the {mce-short} is enabled:

.Required {product-title} versions for platforms
[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
|Hosted cluster platform |Management cluster version |Hosted cluster version

|{aws-full}
|4.16 - 4.17
|4.16 - 4.17

|{ibm-power-title}
|4.17
|4.17

|{ibm-z-title}
|4.17
|4.17

|{VirtProductName}
|4.14 - 4.17
|4.14 - 4.17

|Bare metal
|4.14 - 4.17
|4.14 - 4.17

|Non-bare-metal agent machines (Technology Preview)
|4.16 - 4.17
|4.16 - 4.17
|===

[id="hcp-matrix-updates_{context}"]
== Updates of {mce-short}

When you update to another version of the {mce-short}, your hosted cluster can continue to run if the HyperShift Operator that is included in the version of {mce-short} supports the hosted cluster version. The following table shows which hosted cluster versions are supported on which updated {mce-short} versions:

.Updated {mce-short} version support for hosted clusters
[cols="2",options="header"]
|===
|Updated {mce-short} version |Supported hosted cluster version

|Updated from 2.4 to 2.5
|{product-title} 4.14

|Updated from 2.5 to 2.6
|{product-title} 4.14 - 4.15

|Updated from 2.6 to 2.7
|{product-title} 4.14 - 4.16
|===

For example, if you have an {product-title} 4.14 hosted cluster on the management cluster and you update from {mce-short} 2.4 to 2.5, the hosted cluster can continue to run.

[id="hcp-matrix-tp_{context}"]
== Technology Preview features

The following list indicates Technology Preview features for this release:

* {hcp-capital} on {ibm-z-title} in a disconnected environment
* Custom taints and tolerations for {hcp}
* NVIDIA GPU devices on {hcp} for {VirtProductName}
