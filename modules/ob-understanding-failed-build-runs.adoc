= Failed build runs

[role="_abstract"] 

When a build run fails, you can check the `status.failureDetails` field in your `BuildRun` CR to identify the exact point where the failure happened in the pod or container. The `status.failureDetails` field includes an error message and a reason for the failure. You only see the message and reason for failure if they are defined in your build strategy.

The following example shows a failed build run:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
status:
  # ...
  failureDetails:
    location:
      container: step-source-default
      pod: baran-build-buildrun-gzmv5-b7wbf-pod-bbpqr
    message: The source repository does not exist, or you have insufficient permission
      to access it.
    reason: GitRemotePrivate
----

[NOTE]
====
The `status.failureDetails` field also provides error details for all operations related to Git.
