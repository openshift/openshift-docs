= Release Notes for Red Hat {ServerlessProductName} Technology Preview 1.4.0

[id="new-features-1-4-0_{context}"]
== New features
* {ServerlessProductName} 1.4.0 is available on {product-title} 4.2 and newer versions.
* {ServerlessProductName} has been updated to use Knative Serving 0.11.1.
* {ServerlessProductName} has been updated to use Knative Client (`kn` CLI) 0.11.0.
* {ServerlessProductName} has been updated to use Knative Serving Operator 0.11.1.
* The `kn` CLI is now available for download through the *Command Line Tools* page in the {product-title} web console.
* The `KnativeServing` object's API group has changed in this release from `serving.knative.dev` to `operator.knative.dev`. You will need to adjust any of your scripts or applications that rely on the old API group to use the new API group. The {ServerlessProductName} installation instructions have been updated to use the new API group.
+
When upgrading from {ServerlessProductName} 1.3.0 to 1.4.0, the {ServerlessOperatorName} will create a `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR) in the new API group for you. This CR will be a mirror of the `KnativeServing` CR in the old group that was used in {ServerlessProductName} 1.3.0.
+
If you need to keep using the old group temporarily, you can use the old CR as before. However, this CR is deprecated and will eventually be removed.
+
Once you have updated references to the new API group, you can remove any older CR versions and use the newly deployed `KnativeServing` CR instead. To safely do this without downtime, remove the owner reference from the newly deployed `KnativeServing` CR using:
+
----
 $ oc edit knativeserving.operator.knative.dev knative-serving -n knative-serving
----
+
After the owner reference has been removed, you can safely remove any older CR versions and start using the new one.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If a previous version of the CR exists, changes to the new CR will be overwritten by the {ServerlessOperatorName}. While the old CR is still active, all changes need to be made to that CR.

[id="fixed-issues-1-4-0_{context}"]
== Fixed issues
* Connecting to a private, cluster local Knative Service from a namespace that was not part of the `knative-serving-ingress` Service Mesh was failing on `i/o timeout`. This issue is now fixed.

* The `container_name` and `pod_name` metric labels were removed in {product-title} 4.3. The documentation has been updated to use the new `container` and `pod` metric labels instead. If you are using metering with Serverless on {product-title} 4.3 or later, you must update your Prometheus queries according to the current version of the Serverless metering documentation.

[id="known-issues-1-4-0_{context}"]
== Known issues
* Unqualified usage of `knativeserving` in `oc` commands no longer works because of the migration to a new API group. For example, this command will not work:
+
----
$ oc get knativeserving -n knative-serving
----
+
Use the explicit fully-qualified format instead. For example:
+
----
$ oc get knativeserving.operator.knative.dev -n knative-serving
----

* {product-title} scale from zero latency causes a delay of approximately 10 seconds when creating pods. This is a current {product-title} limitation.
