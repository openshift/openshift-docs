= Using Docker environment variables

To make environment variables available to the Docker build
process and resulting image, you can add environment variables to the
`dockerStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig`.

The environment variables defined there are inserted as a single `ENV`
Dockerfile instruction right after the `FROM` instruction, so that it can be
referenced later on within the Dockerfile.

.Procedure

The variables are defined during build and stay in the output image, therefore
they will be present in any container that runs that image as well.

For example, defining a custom HTTP proxy to be used during build and runtime:

[source,yaml]
----
dockerStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "HTTP_PROXY"
      value: "http://myproxy.net:5187/"
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
Cluster administrators can also configure global build settings using Ansible.
endif::[]

You can also manage environment variables defined in the `BuildConfig` with the
`oc set env` command.
