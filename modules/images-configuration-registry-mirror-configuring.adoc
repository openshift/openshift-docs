= Configuring image registry repository mirroring

You can create postinstallation mirror configuration custom resources (CR) to redirect image pull requests from a source image registry to a mirrored image registry.

.Procedure

. Configure mirrored repositories, by either:
+
* Setting up a mirrored repository with Red Hat Quay, as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/manage_red_hat_quay/repo-mirroring-in-red-hat-quay[Red Hat Quay Repository Mirroring]. Using Red Hat Quay allows you to copy images from one repository to another and also automatically sync those repositories repeatedly over time.

* Using a tool such as `skopeo` to copy images manually from the source repository to the mirrored repository.
+
For example, after installing the skopeo RPM package on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 or RHEL 8 system, use the `skopeo` command as shown in this example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ skopeo copy \
docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal:latest@sha256:5cf... \
docker://example.io/example/ubi-minimal
----
+
In this example, you have a container image registry that is named `example.io` with an image repository named `example` to which you want to copy the `ubi9/ubi-minimal` image from `registry.access.redhat.com`. After you create the mirrored registry, you can configure your {product-title} cluster to redirect requests made of the source repository to the mirrored repository.

. Log in to your {product-title} cluster.

. Create a postinstallation mirror configuration CR, by using one of the following examples:

* Create an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` or `ImageTagMirrorSet` CR, as needed, replacing the source and mirrors with your own registry and repository pairs and images:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1 <1>
kind: ImageDigestMirrorSet <2>
metadata:
  name: ubi9repo
spec:
  imageDigestMirrors: <3>
  - mirrors:
    - example.io/example/ubi-minimal <4>
    - example.com/example/ubi-minimal <5>
    source: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal <6>
    mirrorSourcePolicy: AllowContactingSource <7>
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.com/redhat
    source: registry.redhat.io/openshift4 <8>
    mirrorSourcePolicy: AllowContactingSource
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.com
    source: registry.redhat.io <9>
    mirrorSourcePolicy: AllowContactingSource
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.net/image
    source: registry.example.com/example/myimage <10>
    mirrorSourcePolicy: AllowContactingSource
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.net
    source: registry.example.com/example <11>
    mirrorSourcePolicy: AllowContactingSource
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.net/registry-example-com
    source: registry.example.com <12>
    mirrorSourcePolicy: AllowContactingSource
----
<1> Indicates the API to use with this CR. This must be `config.openshift.io/v1`.
<2> Indicates the kind of object according to the pull type:
** `ImageDigestMirrorSet`: Pulls a digest reference image.
** `ImageTagMirrorSet`: Pulls a tag reference image.
<3> Indicates the type of image pull method, either:
** `imageDigestMirrors`: Use for an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` CR.
** `imageTagMirrors`: Use for an `ImageTagMirrorSet` CR.
<4> Indicates the name of the mirrored image registry and repository.
<5> Optional: Indicates a secondary mirror repository for each target repository. If one mirror is down, the target repository can use another mirror.
<6> Indicates the registry and repository source, which is the repository that is referred to in image pull specifications.
<7> Optional: Indicates the fallback policy if the image pull fails:
** `AllowContactingSource`: Allows continued attempts to pull the image from the source repository. This is the default.
** `NeverContactSource`: Prevents continued attempts to pull the image from the source repository.
<8> Optional: Indicates a namespace inside a registry, which allows you to use any image in that namespace. If you use a registry domain as a source, the object is applied to all repositories from the registry.
<9> Optional: Indicates a registry, which allows you to use any image in that registry. If you specify a registry name, the object is applied to all repositories from a source registry to a mirror registry.
<10> Pulls the image `registry.example.com/example/myimage@sha256:...` from the mirror `mirror.example.net/image@sha256:..`.
<11> Pulls the image `registry.example.com/example/image@sha256:...` in the source registry namespace from the mirror `mirror.example.net/image@sha256:...`.
<12> Pulls the image `registry.example.com/myimage@sha256` from the mirror registry `example.net/registry-example-com/myimage@sha256:...`. 

* Create an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` custom resource, replacing the source and mirrors with your own registry and repository pairs and images:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageContentSourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: mirror-ocp
spec:
  repositoryDigestMirrors:
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.registry.com:443/ocp/release <1>
    source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release <2>
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.registry.com:443/ocp/release
    source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev
----
<1> Specifies the name of the mirror image registry and repository.
<2> Specifies the online registry and repository containing the content that is mirrored.

. Create the new object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f registryrepomirror.yaml
----
+
After the object is created, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) drains the nodes for `ImageTagMirrorSet` objects only. The MCO does not drain the nodes for `ImageDigestMirrorSet` and `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects.

. To check that the mirrored configuration settings are applied, do the following on one of the nodes.

.. List your nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get node
----
+

.Troubleshooting repository mirroring

If the repository mirroring procedure does not work as described, use the following information about how repository mirroring works to help troubleshoot the problem.

* The first working mirror is used to supply the pulled image.
* The main registry is only used if no other mirror works.
* From the system context, the `Insecure` flags are used as fallback.
* The format of the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file has changed recently. It is now version 2 and in TOML format.
