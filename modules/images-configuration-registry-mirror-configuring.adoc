= Configuring image registry repository mirroring

You can create postinstallation mirror configuration custom resources (CR) to redirect image pull requests from a source image registry to a mirrored image registry.

ifdef::winc[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Windows images mirrored through `ImageDigestMirrorSet` and `ImageTagMirrorSet` objects have specific naming requirements. The final portion of the namespace and the image name of the mirror image must match the image being mirrored. For example, when mirroring the `mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/pause:3.9` image, the mirror image must have the `<mirror_registry>/<optional_namespaces>/oss/kubernetes/pause:3.9` format. The `optional_namespaces` can be any number of leading repository namespaces.

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Configure mirrored repositories, by either:
+
--
* Setting up a mirrored repository with Red Hat Quay, as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/manage_red_hat_quay/repo-mirroring-in-red-hat-quay[Red Hat Quay Repository Mirroring]. Using Red Hat Quay allows you to copy images from one repository to another and also automatically sync those repositories repeatedly over time.

* Using a tool such as `skopeo` to copy images manually from the source repository to the mirrored repository.
+
For example, after installing the skopeo RPM package on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 or RHEL 8 system, use the `skopeo` command as shown in this example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ skopeo copy --all \
docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal:latest@sha256:5cf... \
docker://example.io/example/ubi-minimal
----
+
In this example, you have a container image registry that is named `example.io` with an image repository named `example` to which you want to copy the `ubi9/ubi-minimal` image from `registry.access.redhat.com`. After you create the mirrored registry, you can configure your {product-title} cluster to redirect requests made of the source repository to the mirrored repository.
--
+
ifdef::winc[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must mirror the `mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/pause:3.9` image. For example, you could use the following `skopeo` command to mirror the image:

[source,terminal]
----
$ skopeo copy \
docker://mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/pause:3.9\
docker://example.io/oss/kubernetes/pause:3.9
----
====

. Log in to your {product-title} cluster.

ifndef::winc[]
. Create a postinstallation mirror configuration CR, by using one of the following examples:

* Create an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` or `ImageTagMirrorSet` CR, as needed, replacing the source and mirrors with your own registry and repository pairs and images:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1 <1>

<3> Indicates the type of image pull method, either:
** `imageDigestMirrors`: Use for an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` CR.
** `imageTagMirrors`: Use for an `ImageTagMirrorSet` CR.

<5> Optional: Indicates a secondary mirror repository for each target repository. If one mirror is down, the target repository can use the secondary mirror.
<6> Indicates the registry and repository source, which is the repository that is referred to in an image pull specification.
<7> Optional: Indicates the fallback policy if the image pull fails:
** `AllowContactingSource`: Allows continued attempts to pull the image from the source repository. This is the default.
** `NeverContactSource`: Prevents continued attempts to pull the image from the source repository.
<8> Optional: Indicates a namespace inside a registry, which allows you to use any image in that namespace. If you use a registry domain as a source, the object is applied to all repositories from the registry.
<9> Optional: Indicates a registry, which allows you to use any image in that registry. If you specify a registry name, the object is applied to all repositories from a source registry to a mirror registry.
<10> Pulls the image `registry.example.com/example/myimage@sha256:...` from the mirror `mirror.example.net/image@sha256:..`.
<11> Pulls the image `registry.example.com/example/image@sha256:...` in the source registry namespace from the mirror `mirror.example.net/image@sha256:...`.
<12> Pulls the image `registry.example.com/myimage@sha256` from the mirror registry `example.net/registry-example-com/myimage@sha256:...`.

* Create an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` custom resource, replacing the source and mirrors with your own registry and repository pairs and images:
+

.Troubleshooting repository mirroring

If the repository mirroring procedure does not work as described, use the following information about how repository mirroring works to help troubleshoot the problem.

* The first working mirror is used to supply the pulled image.
* The main registry is only used if no other mirror works.
* From the system context, the `Insecure` flags are used as fallback.
ifndef::winc[]
* The format of the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file has changed recently. It is now version 2 and in TOML format.
