= {product-title} network flow matrix

The network flow matrix describes the ingress flows to {product-title} services.
The network information in the matrix is accurate for both bare-metal and cloud environments.
Use the information in the network flow matrix to help you manage ingress traffic.
You can restrict ingress traffic to essential flows to improve network security.

To view or download the raw CSV content, see link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/openshift-docs/main/snippets/network-flow-matrix.csv[this resource].

Additionally, consider the following dynamic port ranges when managing ingress traffic:

* `9000-9999`: Host level services
* `30000-32767`: Kubernetes node ports
* `49152-65535`: Dynamic or private ports

[NOTE]
====
The network flow matrix describes ingress traffic flows for a base {product-title} installation. It does not describe network flows for additional components, such as optional Operators available from the Red Hat Marketplace. The matrix does not apply for Hosted-Control-Plane, MicroShift, or standalone clusters.
