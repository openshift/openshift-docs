= {product-title} network flow matrix

The following network flow matrixes describe the ingress flows to {product-title} services for the following environments:

* {product-title} on bare metal
* {sno-caps} with other platforms
* {product-title} on {aws-first}
* {sno-caps} on {aws-short}

Use the information in the appropriate network flow matrix to help you manage ingress traffic for your specific environment. You can restrict ingress traffic to essential flows to improve network security.

Additionally, consider the following dynamic port ranges when managing ingress traffic for both bare metal and cloud environments:

* `9000-9999`: Host level services
* `30000-32767`: Kubernetes node ports
* `49152-65535`: Dynamic or private ports

[NOTE]
====
The network flow matrixes describe ingress traffic flows for a base {product-title} or {sno} installation. The matrixes do not apply for {hcp}, Red{nbsp}Hat build of MicroShift, or standalone clusters.
