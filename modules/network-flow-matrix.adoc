= {product-title} network flow matrix

The following network flow matrixes describe the ingress flows to {product-title} services for the following environments:

* {product-title} on bare metal
* {sno-caps} on bare metal
* {product-title} on {aws-first}
* {sno-caps} on {aws-short}

Use the information in the appropriate network flow matrix to help you manage ingress traffic for your specific environment. You can restrict ingress traffic to essential flows to improve network security.

Additionally, consider the following dynamic port ranges when managing ingress traffic for both bare metal and cloud environments:

* `9000-9999`: Host level services
* `30000-32767`: Kubernetes node ports
* `49152-65535`: Dynamic or private ports

[NOTE]
====
The network flow matrixes describe ingress traffic flows for a base {product-title} or {sno} installation. It does not describe network flows for additional components, such as optional Operators available from the Red Hat Marketplace. The matrixes do not apply for {hcp}, Red{nbsp}Hat build of MicroShift, or standalone clusters.

[id="network-flow-matrix-common_{context}"]
== Base network flows

The following matrixes describe the base ingress flows to {product-title} services.

[NOTE]
====
For base ingress flows to {sno} clusters, see the _Control plane node base flows_ matrix only.
