= {product-title} network flow matrix

The following network flow matrixes describe the ingress flows to {product-title} services for the following environments:

* {product-title} on bare metal
* {sno-caps} with other platforms
* {product-title} on {aws-first}
* {sno-caps} on {aws-short}

[NOTE]
====
You can use the `commatrix` plugin for the `oc` command to generate local network flow data for your cluster. For more information see "Generating ingress network flow data using the `commatrix` plugin".
====

Use the information in the appropriate network flow matrix to help you manage ingress traffic for your specific environment. You can restrict ingress traffic to essential flows to improve network security.

Additionally, consider the following dynamic port ranges when managing ingress traffic for both bare metal and cloud environments:

* `9000-9999`: Reserved for internal {product-title} components. Do not assign user workloads or services to ports in this range.
* `30000-32767`: Kubernetes `NodePort` service ports. These ports are required only if you expose services by using the `NodePort` service type. If `NodePort` services are not used, you can block this port range.

[NOTE]
====
The network flow matrixes describe ingress traffic flows for a base {product-title} or {sno} installation. The matrixes do not apply for {hcp}, Red{nbsp}Hat build of MicroShift, or standalone clusters.
