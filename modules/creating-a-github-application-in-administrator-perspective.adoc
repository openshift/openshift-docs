= Creating a GitHub application in administrator perspective

As a cluster administrator, you can configure your GitHub application with the {product-title} cluster to use a pipeline as code. This configuration allows you to execute a set of tasks required for build deployment.

.Prerequisites
You have installed the {pipelines-title} {pipelines-ver} operator from the Operator Hub.

.Procedure
. In the administrator perspective, navigate to *Pipelines* using the navigation pane.
. Click *Setup GitHub App* on the *Pipelines* page.
. Enter your GitHub application name, for example, `pipelines-ci-clustername-ss-test`.
. Click *Setup*.
. Enter your Git password when prompted in the browser.
. Click *Create GitHub App for `username`*. The variable `username` denotes your actual user name.

.Verification
After the Git application is successfully created, the {product-title} web console opens and provides you with details about the application.
