= Gateway in place migration

If you need less detailed control over your gateway migration, you can perform gateway in place migration. This method applies to namespaces with dedicated gateways and to environments using a centralized gateway shared across multiple namespaces.

[NOTE]
====
The label for the gateway namespace differs between mulitenant and cluster-wide meshes. To understand which labels to use in your specific migration case and the `maistra.io/ignore-namespace: "true"` label requirement, see the "Multitenant migration guide" or the "Cluster-wide migration guide" section.
====
.Procedure

. Run the following command to label the gateway namespace to ensure that gateway injection is enabled from the new mesh and add the `maistra.io/ignore-namespace: "true"` label:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label namespace <gateway_namespace> istio.io/rev=<istio_revision_name> maistra.io/ignore-namespace="true"
----
.. Remove the `istio-injection=enabled` label, if needed.

. Restart the gateway deployment by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n ${app_namespace} rollout restart deployment ${gateway_name}
----

.Verification

. Check that the gateway is running the new revision by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc istioctl ps -n istio-ingress
----

. Test application-specific routes.
