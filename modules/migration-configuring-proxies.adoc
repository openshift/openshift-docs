= Configuring proxies

For {product-title} 4.1 and earlier versions, you must configure proxies in the `MigrationController` custom resource (CR) manifest after you install the {mtc-full} Operator because these versions do not support a cluster-wide `proxy` object.

For {product-title} 4.2 to {product-version}, the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) inherits the cluster-wide proxy settings. You can change the proxy parameters if you want to override the cluster-wide proxy settings.

You must configure the proxies to allow the SPDY protocol and to forward the `Upgrade HTTP` header to the API server. Otherwise, an `Upgrade request required` error is displayed. The `MigrationController` CR uses SPDY to run commands within remote pods. The `Upgrade HTTP` header is required in order to open a websocket connection with the API server.

.Direct volume migration

If you are performing a direct volume migration (DVM) from a source cluster behind a proxy, you must configure an Stunnel proxy. Stunnel creates a transparent tunnel between the source and target clusters for the TCP connection without changing the certificates.

DVM supports only one proxy. The source cluster cannot access the route of the target cluster if the target cluster is also behind a proxy.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges on all clusters.

.Procedure

. Get the `MigrationController` CR manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get migrationcontroller <migration_controller> -n openshift-migration
----

. Update the proxy parameters:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: migration.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: MigrationController
metadata:
  name: <migration_controller>
  namespace: openshift-migration
...
spec:
  stunnel_tcp_proxy: http://<username>:<password>@<ip>:<port> <1>
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<password>@<ip>:<port> <2>
  httpsProxy: http://<username>:<password>@<ip>:<port> <3>
  noProxy: example.com <4>
----
<1> Stunnel proxy URL for direct volume migration.
<2> Proxy URL for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be `http`.
<3> Proxy URL for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. If this is not specified, then `httpProxy` is used for both HTTP and HTTPS connections.
<4> Comma-separated list of destination domain names, domains, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude proxying.
+
Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass proxy for all destinations.
If you scale up workers that are not included in the network defined by the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr` field from the installation configuration, you must add them to this list to prevent connection issues.
+
This field is ignored if neither the `httpProxy` nor the `httpsProxy` field is set.

. Save the manifest as `migration-controller.yaml`.
. Apply the updated manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc replace -f migration-controller.yaml -n openshift-migration
----
