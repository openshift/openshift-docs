= Defining workers

In a Kubernetes clusters, the workers are where the actual workloads requested by Kubernetes users are run and otherwise managed. OpenShift sometimes refers to these as compute nodes. The worker nodes advertise their capacity and the scheduler (part of the control plane/master services) decides where containers/pods get started. Important services running on each worker node include CRI-O (the container engine), Kubelet (which accepts and carries out requests for running and stopping container workloads), and a service proxy (to handle communications for pods across workers).
