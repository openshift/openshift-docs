You can create new access scopes from the *Access Control* view.

.Prerequisites
* You must have the *Admin* role, or a role with the permission set with read and write permissions for the `Access` resource to create, modify, and delete permission sets.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access control*.
. Select *Access scopes*.
. Click *Create access scope*.
. Enter a *Name* and *Description* for the new access scope.
. Under the *Allowed resources* section:
** Use the *Cluster filter* and *Namespace filter* fields to filter the list of clusters and namespaces visible in the list.
** Expand the *Cluster name* to see the list of namespaces in that cluster.
** To allow access to all namespaces in a cluster, toggle the switch in the *Manual selection* column.

[NOTE]
====
Access to a specific cluster provides users with access to the following resources within the scope of the cluster:

* {ocp} or Kubernetes cluster metadata and security information
* Compliance information for authorized clusters
* Node metadata and security information
* Access to all namespaces in that cluster and their associated security information
====
** To allow access to a namespace, toggle the switch in the *Manual selection* column for a namespace.
+
[NOTE]
====
Access to a specific namespace gives access to the following information within the scope of the namespace:

* Alerts and violations for deployments
* Vulnerability data for images
* Deployment metadata and security information
* Role and user information
* Network graph, policy, and baseline information for deployments
* Process information and process baseline configuration
* Prioritized risk information for each deployment
====
. If you want to allow access to clusters and namespaces based on labels, click *Add label selector* under the *Label selection rules* section. Then click *Add rule* to specify *Key* and *Value* pairs for the label selector. You can specify labels for clusters and namespaces.
. Click *Save*.
