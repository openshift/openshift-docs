= Resetting the IP family policy for application pods and services

The default `ipFamilyPolicy` configuration value, `PreferSingleStack`, does not automatically update in all services after you update your {microshift-short} configuration to dual-stack networking. To enable dual-stack networking in services and application pods, you must update the `ipFamilyPolicy` value.

.Prerequisites

* You used the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` to define a dual-stack network with an IPv6 address family.

.Procedure

. Set the `spec.ipFamilyPolicy` field to a valid value for dual-stack networking in your service or pod by using the following example:
+
.Example dual-stack network configuration for a service
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: microshift-new-service
  labels: app: microshift-application
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ipFamilyPolicy: `PreferDualStack` # <1>
# ...
----
<1> Required. Valid values for dual-stack networking are `PreferDualStack` and `RequireDualStack`. The value you set depends on the requirements of your application. `PreferSingleStack` is the default value for the `ipFamilyPolicy` field.

. Restart any application pods that do not have a `hostNetwork` defined. Pods that do have a `hostNetwork` defined do not need to be restarted to update the `ipFamilyPolicy` value.

[NOTE]
====
{microshift-short} system services and pods are automatically updated when the `ipFamilyPolicy` value is updated.
