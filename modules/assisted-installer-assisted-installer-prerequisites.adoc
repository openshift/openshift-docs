= Assisted Installer prerequisites

The {ai-full} validates the following prerequisites to ensure successful installation.

== Hardware

For control plane nodes or the {sno} node, nodes must have at least the following resources:

* 8 CPU cores
* 16.00 GiB RAM
* 100 GB storage
* 10ms write speed or less for etcd `wal_fsync_duration_seconds`

For worker nodes, each node must have at least the following resources:

* 4 CPU cores
* 16.00 GiB RAM
* 100 GB storage

== Networking

The network must meet the following requirements:

* A DHCP server unless using static IP addressing.
* A base domain name. You must ensure that the following requirements are met:
  - There is no wildcard, such as `*.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, or the installation will not proceed.
  - A DNS A/AAAA record for `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`.
  - A DNS A/AAAA record with a wildcard for `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`.
* Port `6443` is open for the API URL if you intend to allow users outside the firewall to access the cluster via the `oc` CLI tool.
* Port `443` is open for the console if you intend to allow users outside the firewall to access the console.

[IMPORTANT]
====
DNS A/AAAA record settings at top-level domain registrars can take significant time to update. Ensure the A/AAAA record DNS settings are working before installation to prevent installation delays.
====

The {product-title} cluster's network must also meet the following requirements:

* Connectivity between all cluster nodes
* Connectivity for each node to the internet
* Access to an NTP server for time synchronization between the cluster nodes

== Preflight validations

The {ai-full} ensures the cluster meets the prerequisites before installation, because it eliminates complex post-installation troubleshooting, thereby saving significant amounts of time and effort. Before installing software on the nodes, the {ai-full} conducts the following validations:

* Ensures network connectivity
* Ensures sufficient network bandwidth
* Ensures connectivity to the registry
* Ensures time synchronization between cluster nodes
* Verifies that the cluster nodes meet the minimum hardware requirements
* Validates the installation configuration parameters

If the {ai-full} does not successfully validate the foregoing requirements, installation will not proceed.
