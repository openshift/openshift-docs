= Source-to-image

[role="_abstract"] 

This build strategy is composed of `source-to-image` and `buildah`. You can use this strategy to generate a container file and prepare the application to build with a builder image. You must specify the builder image in the `spec.paramValues` field of the `Build` CR.

You can share the `source-to-image` strategy across different namespaces within your cluster because the {builds-operator} installs the `source-to-image` strategy at cluster level.

You can configure the following parameters for the `source-to-image` strategy:
