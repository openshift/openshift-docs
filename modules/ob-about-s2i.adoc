= source-to-image

You can use the `source-to-image` build strategy with `kaniko` to generate a container file and prepare the source code for image build. Creating and pushing the container image to an output location specified in the `spec.output.image` field of your `Build` CR requires the `kaniko` strategy.

The `source-to-image` strategy requires an image, which can be used as a `builderImage` parameter in the `Build` CR.
