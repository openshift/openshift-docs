= Limit speaker pods to specific nodes

By default, when you start MetalLB with the MetalLB Operator, the Operator starts an instance of a `speaker` pod on each node in the cluster.
Only the nodes with a `speaker` pod can advertise a load balancer IP address.
You can configure the `MetalLB` custom resource with a node selector to specify which nodes run the `speaker` pods.

The most common reason to limit the `speaker` pods to specific nodes is to ensure that only nodes with network interfaces on specific networks advertise load balancer IP addresses.
Only the nodes with a running `speaker` pod are advertised as destinations of the load balancer IP address.

If you limit the `speaker` pods to specific nodes and specify `local` for the external traffic policy of a service, then you must ensure that the application pods for the service are deployed to the same nodes.

.Example configuration to limit speaker pods to worker nodes
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: MetalLB
metadata:
  name: metallb
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  nodeSelector:  <.>
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
----
<.> The example configuration specifies to assign the speaker pods to worker nodes, but you can specify labels that you assigned to nodes or any valid node selector.

After you apply a manifest with the `spec.nodeSelector` field, you can check the number of pods that the Operator deployed with the `oc get daemonset -n metallb-system speaker` command.
Similarly, you can display the nodes that match your labels with a command like `oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=`.
