= Support policy for unmanaged Operators

The _management state_ of an Operator determines whether an Operator is actively
managing the resources for its related component in the cluster as designed. If
an Operator is set to an _unmanaged_ state, it does not respond to changes in
configuration nor does it receive updates.

While this can be helpful in non-production clusters or during debugging,
Operators in an unmanaged state are unsupported and the cluster administrator
assumes full control of the individual component configurations and upgrades.

An Operator can be set to an unmanaged state using the following methods:

* **Individual Operator configuration**
+
Individual Operators have a `managementState` parameter in their configuration.
This can be accessed in different ways, depending on the Operator. For example,
the Cluster Logging Operator accomplishes this by modifying a custom resource
(CR) that it manages, while the Cluster Samples Operator uses a cluster-wide
configuration resource.
+
Changing the `managementState` parameter to `Unmanaged` means that the Operator
is not actively managing its resources and will take no action related to the
related component. Some Operators might not support this management state as it
might damage the cluster and require manual recovery.
+
[WARNING]
====
Changing individual Operators to the `Unmanaged` state renders that particular
component and functionality unsupported. Reported issues must be reproduced in
`Managed` state for support to proceed.
====

* **Cluster Version Operator (CVO) overrides**
+
The `spec.overrides` parameter can be added to the CVO's configuration to allow
administrators to provide a list of overrides to the CVO's behavior for a
component. Setting the `spec.overrides[].unmanaged` parameter to `true` for a
component blocks cluster upgrades and alerts the administrator after a CVO
override has been set:
+

----
Disabling ownership via cluster version overrides prevents upgrades. Please remove overrides before continuing.
----

[WARNING]
====
Setting a CVO override puts the entire cluster in an unsupported state. Reported
issues must be reproduced after removing any overrides for support to proceed.
