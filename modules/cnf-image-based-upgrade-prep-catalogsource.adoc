= Creating ConfigMap objects of custom catalog sources for the image-based upgrade with {lcao}

You can keep your custom catalog sources after the upgrade by generating a `ConfigMap` object for your catalog sources and adding them to the `spec.extraManifest` field in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR.
For more information about catalog sources, see "Catalog source".

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file that contains the `CatalogSource` CR:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: example-catalogsources
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  displayName: disconnected-redhat-operators
  image: quay.io/example-org/example-catalog:v1
----
--

. Create the `ConfigMap` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap example-catalogsources-cm --from-file=example-catalogsources.yaml=<path_to_catalogsource_cr> -n openshift-lifecycle-agent
----

. Patch the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io upgrade \
  -p='{"spec": {"extraManifests": [{"name": "example-catalogsources-cm", "namespace": "openshift-lifecycle-agent"}]}}' \
  --type=merge -n openshift-lifecycle-agent
