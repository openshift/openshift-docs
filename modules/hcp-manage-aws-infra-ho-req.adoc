= Unmanaged infrastructure for the HyperShift Operator in an {aws-short} account

An arbitrary {aws-first} account depends on the provider of the {hcp} service.

In self-managed {hcp}, the cluster service provider controls the {aws-short} account. The cluster service provider is the administrator who hosts cluster control planes and is responsible for uptime. In managed {hcp}, the {aws-short} account belongs to Red Hat.

In a prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure for the HyperShift Operator, the following infrastructure requirements apply for a management cluster {aws-short} account:

* One S3 Bucket
** OpenID Connect (OIDC)

* Route 53 hosted zones
** A domain to host private and public entries for hosted clusters
