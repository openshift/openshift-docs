= Installing by using the web console

You can install the {TempoShortName} from the *Administrator* view of the web console.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

* For {product-dedicated}, you must be logged in using an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

* You have completed setting up the required object storage by a supported provider: link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation[Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation], link:https://min.io/[MinIO], link:https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3], link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/[Azure Blob Storage], link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Google Cloud Storage]. For more information, see "Object storage setup".
+
[WARNING]
====
Object storage is required and not included with the {TempoShortName}. You must choose and set up object storage by a supported provider before installing the {TempoShortName}.
====

.Procedure

. Install the {TempoOperator}:

.. Go to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* and search for `{TempoOperator}`.

.. Select the *{TempoOperator}* that is *provided by Red Hat*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The following selections are the default presets for this Operator:

* *Update channel* -> *stable*
* *Installation mode* -> *All namespaces on the cluster*
* *Installed Namespace* -> *openshift-tempo-operator*
* *Update approval* -> *Automatic*
====

.. Select the *Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace* checkbox.

.. Select *Install* -> *Install* -> *View Operator*.

.. In the *Details* tab of the page of the installed Operator, under *ClusterServiceVersion details*, verify that the installation *Status* is *Succeeded*.

. Create a project of your choice for the *TempoStack* instance that you will create in a subsequent step: go to *Home* -> *Projects* -> *Create Project*.

. In the project that you created for the *TempoStack* instance, create a secret for your object storage bucket: go to *Workloads* -> *Secrets* -> *Create* -> *From YAML*. For more information, see "Object storage setup".

. Create a *TempoStack* instance.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can create multiple *TempoStack* instances in separate projects on the same cluster.
====

.. Go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

.. Select *TempoStack* -> *Create TempoStack* -> *YAML view*.

.. In the *YAML view*, customize the `TempoStack` custom resource (CR):

<1> The secret you created in step 3.
<2> The value of the `name` in the `metadata` of the secret.
<3> The accepted values are `azure` for Azure Blob Storage; `gcs` for Google Cloud Storage; and `s3` for Amazon S3, MinIO, or Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation.

<1> In this example, the object storage was set up as one of the prerequisites, and the object storage secret was created in step 3.
<2> The stack deployed in this example is configured to receive Jaeger Thrift over HTTP and OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), which permits visualizing the data with the Jaeger UI.

.. Select *Create*.


.Verification

. Use the *Project:* dropdown list to select the project of the *TempoStack* instance.

. Go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* to verify that the *Status* of the *TempoStack* instance is *Condition: Ready*.

. Go to *Workloads* -> *Pods* to verify that all the component pods of the *TempoStack* instance are running.

. Access the Tempo console:

.. Go to *Networking* -> *Routes* and kbd:[Ctrl+F] to search for `tempo`.

.. In the *Location* column, open the URL to access the Tempo console.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Tempo console initially shows no trace data following the Tempo console installation.
