= Finding clusters with most Kubernetes and Istio vulnerabilities by using the dashboard

[role="_abstract"]
You can identify the clusters with most Kubernetes, {osp}, and Istio vulnerabilities (deprecated) in your environment by using the vulnerability management dashboard.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, click *Vulnerability Management*-> *Dashboard*. The *Clusters with most orchestrator and Istio vulnerabilities*  widget shows a list of clusters, ranked by the number of Kubernetes, {osp}, and Istio vulnerabilities (deprecated) in each cluster.
The cluster on top of the list is the cluster with the highest number of vulnerabilities.
. Click on one of the clusters from the list to view details about the cluster.
The *Cluster* view includes:
** *Cluster Summary* section, which shows cluster details and metadata, top risky objects (deployments, namespaces, and images), recently detected vulnerabilities, riskiest images, and deployments with the most severe policy violations.
** *Cluster Findings* section, which includes a list of failing policies and list of fixable CVEs.
** *Related Entities* section, which shows the number of namespaces, deployments, policies, images, components, and CVEs the cluster contains.
You can select these entities to view more details.
. Click *View All* on the widget header to view the list of all clusters.
