== Bug fixes

* Before this update, events such as Out-of-Memory (OOM) caused buffer corruption with the following error message: `Last written record was unable to be deserialized`.
This error caused the collector pod to stop forwarding logs.
This update improves the recovery logic for corrupted buffer files, preventing log forwarding issues after an OOM event. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7995[LOG-7995])
