New in this release::
* Cluster Logging Operator 6.0 is new in this release.
Update your existing implementation to adapt to the new version of the API.

Description::
The Cluster Logging Operator enables collection and shipping of logs off the node for remote archival and analysis. The reference configuration ships audit and infrastructure logs to a remote archive by using Kafka.

Limits and requirements::
Not applicable

Engineering considerations::
* The impact of cluster CPU use is based on the number or size of logs generated and the amount of log filtering configured.
* The reference configuration does not include shipping of application logs. Inclusion of application logs in the configuration requires evaluation of the application logging rate and sufficient additional CPU resources allocated to the reserved set.
