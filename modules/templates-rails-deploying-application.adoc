= Deploying your application to {product-title}

You can deploy you application to {product-title}.

After creating the `rails-app` project, you will be automatically switched to
the new project namespace.

Deploying your application in {product-title} involves three steps:

* Creating a database service from {product-title}'s PostgreSQL image.
* Creating a frontend service from {product-title}'s Ruby 2.0 builder image and
your Ruby on Rails source code, which are wired with the database service.
* Creating a route for your application.
