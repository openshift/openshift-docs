= Granting additional permissions to individual users and groups

[role="_abstract"]
When your first log in, you might notice that you have very limited permissions. By default, {product-title} only grants you the ability to create new projects, or namespaces, in the cluster. Other projects are restricted from view.

You must grant these additional abilities to individual users and groups.
