[id="service-accounts-default_{context}"]
= Default service accounts

Your {product-title} cluster contains default service accounts for
cluster management and generates more service accounts for each project.

[id="default-cluster-service-accounts{context}"]
== Default cluster service accounts

Several infrastructure controllers run using service account credentials. The
following service accounts are created in the {product-title} infrastructure
project (`openshift-infra`) at server start, and given the following roles
cluster-wide:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|====
|Service Account |Description

|`replication-controller`
|Assigned the `system:replication-controller` role

|`deployment-controller`
|Assigned the `system:deployment-controller` role

|`build-controller`
|Assigned the `system:build-controller` role. Additionally, the
`build-controller` service account is included in the privileged
security context constraint in order to create privileged
build pods.
|====


////
To configure the project where those service accounts are created, set the
`openshiftInfrastructureNamespace` field in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on the master:

----
policyConfig:
  ...
  openshiftInfrastructureNamespace: openshift-infra
----
////

[id="default-service-accounts-and-roles_{context}"]
== Default project service accounts and roles

Three service accounts are automatically created in each project:

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Service Account |Usage

|`builder`
|Used by build pods. It is given the `system:image-builder` role, which allows
pushing images to any imagestream in the project using the internal Docker
registry.

|`deployer`
|Used by deployment pods and given the `system:deployer` role, which allows
viewing and modifying replication controllers and pods in the project.

|`default`
|Used to run all other pods unless they specify a different service account.
|===

All service accounts in a project are given the `system:image-puller` role,
which allows pulling images from any imagestream in the project using the
internal container image registry.
