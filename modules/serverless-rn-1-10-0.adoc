[id="fixed-issues-1-10-0_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* In previous releases, Knative Serving had a fixed, minimum CPU request of `25m` for `queue-proxy`. If your cluster had any value set that conflicted with this, for example, if you had set a minimum CPU request for `defaultRequest` of more than `25m`, the Knative service failed to deploy. This issue is fixed in 1.10.0.
