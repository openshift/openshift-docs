= Ensuring the host firmware is compatible with the update

You are responsible for the firmware versions that you run in your clusters.
Updating host firmware is not a part of the {product-title} update process.
It is not recommended to update firmware in conjunction
with the {product-title} version.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Hardware vendors advise that it is best to apply the latest certified firmware version for the specific hardware that you are running.
For telco use cases, always verify firmware updates in test environments before applying them in production.
The high throughput nature of telco CNF workloads can be adversely affected by sub-optimal host firmware.

You should thoroughly test new firmware updates to ensure that they work as expected with the current version of {product-title}.
Ideally, you test the latest firmware version with the target {product-title} update version.
