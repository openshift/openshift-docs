:FeatureName: The `round-robin` sharding algorithm
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

By default, the Argo CD Application Controller uses the non-uniform `legacy` hash-based sharding algorithm to assign clusters to shards. This can result in uneven cluster distribution. You can enable the `round-robin` sharding algorithm to achieve more equal cluster distribution across all shards.

Using the `round-robin` sharding algorithm in {gitops-title} provides the following benefits:

* Ensure more balanced workload distribution
* Prevent shards from being overloaded or underutilized
* Optimize the efficiency of computing resources
* Reduce the risk of bottlenecks
* Improve overall performance and reliability of the Argo CD system

The introduction of alternative sharding algorithms allows for further customization based on specific use cases. You can select the algorithm that best aligns with your deployment needs, which results in greater flexibility and adaptability in diverse operational scenarios.

[TIP]
====
To leverage the benefits of alternative sharding algorithms in {gitops-shortname}, it is crucial to enable sharding during deployment.
