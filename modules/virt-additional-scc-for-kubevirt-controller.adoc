= Additional {product-title} security context constraints and Linux capabilities for the `kubevirt-controller` service account

Security context constraints (SCCs) control permissions for pods. These permissions include actions that a pod, a collection of containers, can perform and what resources it can access. You can use SCCs to define a set of conditions that a Pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system.

The `kubevirt-controller` is a cluster controller that creates the virt-launcher pods for virtual machines in the cluster. These virt-launcher pods are granted permissions by the `kubevirt-controller` service account.

== Additional SCCs granted to the `kubevirt-controller` service account

The `kubevirt-controller` service account is granted additional SCCs and Linux capabilities so that it can create virt-launcher pods with the appropriate permissions. These extended permissions allow virtual machines to take advantage of {VirtProductName} features that are beyond the scope of typical pods.

The `kubevirt-controller` service account is granted the following SCCs:

* `scc.AllowHostDirVolumePlugin = true` +
This allows virtual machines to use the hostPath volume plug-in.

* `scc.AllowPrivilegedContainer = false` +
This ensures the virt-launcher Pod is not run as a privileged container.

* `scc.AllowedCapabilities = []corev1.Capability{"NET_ADMIN", "NET_RAW", "SYS_NICE"}` +
This provides the following additional Linux capabilities
`NET_ADMIN`,
`NET_RAW`, and
`SYS_NICE`.
