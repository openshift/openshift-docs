= Verifying that your AI model is accessible

Before querying the model through the API, you can check to be certain that the model is accessible and ready to provide answers based on the connected data. The following examples continue with the {ovms}.

.Prerequisites

* You configured the AI model-serving runtime.
* You uploaded your AI model to {microshift-short}.
* The {microshift-short} cluster is running.
* You installed {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Get the IP address of the {microshift-short} cluster and assign it to the `IP` variable as the following example command shows:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ IP=$(oc get nodes -o json | jq -r '.items[0].status.addresses[0].address')
----

. Identify the name of the route you created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc get route -n ai-test _<route_name>_ -o yaml <1>
----
<1> Replace `_<route_name>_` with the actual name of your route.

. Extract and assign the `HOST` value of the route to the `DOMAIN` variable by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
DOMAIN=$(oc get route -n ai-test _<route_name>_ -o=jsonpath="{ .status.ingress[0].host }") <1>
----
<1> Replace `_<route_name>_` with the actual name of your route.

. Enable data transfer from the route to the {microshift-short} IP address by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -i "${DOMAIN}/v2/models/ovms-resnet50/ready" --connect-to "${DOMAIN}::${IP}:" <1>
----
<1> Instead of using the `--connect-to "${DOMAIN}::${IP}:"` flag, you can also use real DNS, or add the IP address and the domain to the `/etc/hosts` file.

. Query the model metadata by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl "${DOMAIN}/v2/models/ovms-resnet50" --connect-to "${DOMAIN}::${IP}:"

.Next steps

* Verify that your model is ready for inferencing.
* Query the model.
* Verify the model response.
* Optional: Get the model server metrics.
