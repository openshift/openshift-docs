= Creating a RolloutManager custom resource

To manage progressive delivery of deployments by using Argo Rollouts in {gitops-title}, you must create and configure a `RolloutManager` custom resource (CR) in the namespace of your choice. By default, any new `argo-rollouts` instance has permission to manage resources only in the namespace where it is deployed, but you can use Argo Rollouts in multiple namespaces as required.

.Prerequisites

* {gitops-title} 1.9.0 or a newer version is installed on your cluster.

.Procedure 

. Log in to the {OCP} web console as a cluster administrator. 

. In the *Administrator* perspective, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Create or select the project where you want to create and configure a `RolloutManager` custom resource (CR) from the *Project* drop-down menu.

. Select *OpenShift GitOps Operator* from the installed operators.

. In the *Details* tab, under the *Provided APIs* section, click *Create instance* in the *RolloutManager* pane.

. On the *Create RolloutManager* page, select the *YAML view* and use the default YAML or edit it according to your requirements:
+
.Example: `RolloutManager` CR

. Click *Create*.

. In the *RolloutManager* tab, under the *RolloutManagers* section, verify that the *Status* field of the RolloutManager instance shows as *Phase: Available*.

. In the left navigation pane, verify the creation of the namespace-scoped supporting resources:
+ 
* Click *Workloads* -> *Deployments* to verify that the `argo-rollouts` deployment is available with the *Status* showing as `1 of 1 pods` running.
* Click *Workloads* -> *Secrets* to verify that the `argo-rollouts-notification-secret` secret is available.
* Click *Networking* -> *Services* to verify that the `argo-rollouts-metrics` service is available.
* Click *User Management* -> *Roles* to verify that the `argo-rollouts` role and `argo-rollouts-aggregate-to-admin`, `argo-rollouts-aggregate-to-edit`, and `argo-rollouts-aggregate-to-view` cluster roles are available.
* Click *User Management* -> *RoleBindings* to verify that the `argo-rollouts` role binding is available.
