:context: installing-rhv-copying-install-config-and-running-installer

IMPORTANT: When you run the installer, it deletes the `install-config.yaml` installer file. To preserve your customized file, make a working copy of the file in a separate directory.

. When you have finished customizing `install-config.yaml`, make a working copy of the asset directory. For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cp -r ~/my-custom-config/ ~/my-working-dir/
----
+
. Run the installer and specify the working directory. For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo ./openshift-install create cluster --my-working-dir
----
+
The installer runs, using the information in `install-config.yaml` instead of prompting you for information. It also deletes `install-config.yaml` from the working directory.

NOTE:You have finished installing the {product-title} cluster on {rh-virtualization}.
