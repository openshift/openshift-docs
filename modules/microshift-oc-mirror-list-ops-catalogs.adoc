[id="microshift-oc-mirror-list-operators-catalogs_{context}"]
= Inspecting catalog contents by using the oc-mirror plugin

Use the following example procedure to select a catalog and list {OCP} Operators to add to your oc-mirror plugin image set configuration file. You must use oc mirror v1 to selecting a catalog and listing Operators.

[NOTE]
====
If you use your own catalogs and Operators, you can push the images directly to your internal registry.
====

.Prerequisites
* You uninstalled {oc-first}.
* You installed the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
* You installed the oc-mirror plugin.

.Procedure
. Get a list of available Red{nbsp}Hat-provided Operator catalogs to filter by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc mirror list operators --version {product-version} --catalogs
----

. Get a list of Operators in the Red Hat Operators catalog by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror list operators <--catalog=<catalog_source>> <1>
----
<1> Specifies your catalog source, such as `registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v{product-version}` or `quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog:latest`.

. Select an Operator. This example uses the `amq-broker-rhel9` Operator.

. Optional: To inspect the channels and versions of the Operator you want to filter, enter the following commands:

.. Get a list of channels by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc mirror list operators --catalog=registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v{product-version} --package=amq-broker-rhel9
----
.. Get a list of versions within a channel by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc mirror list operators --catalog=registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v{product-version} --package=amq-broker-rhel9 --channel=7.13.x
----

.Next steps
* Create and edit an image set configuration file using the information gathered in this procedure.
* Mirror the images from the transformed image set configuration file to a mirror registry or disk.
