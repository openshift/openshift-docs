= Cluster guidelines for image-based installation and deployment

For a successful image-based installation and deployment, see the following guidelines.

== Cluster guidelines

* If you are using {rh-rhacm-first}, to avoid including any {rh-rhacm} resources in your seed image, you need to disable all optional {rh-rhacm} add-ons before generating the seed image.

== Seed cluster guidelines

* If your cluster deployment at the edge of the network requires a proxy configuration, you must create a seed image from a seed cluster featuring a proxy configuration. The proxy configurations do not have to match.

* If you set a maximum transmission unit (MTU) in the seed cluster, you must set the same MTU value in the static network configuration for the image-based configuration ISO.

* Your {sno} seed cluster must have a shared `/var/lib/containers` directory for precaching images during an image-based installation. For more information see "Configuring a shared container partition between ostree stateroots".

* Create a seed image from a {sno} cluster that uses the same hardware as your target bare-metal host. The seed cluster must reflect your target cluster configuration for the following items:

** CPU topology
*** CPU architecture
*** Number of CPU cores
*** Tuned performance configuration, such as number of reserved CPUs

** IP version
+
[NOTE]
====
Dual-stack networking is not supported in this release.
====

** Disconnected registry
+
[NOTE]
====
If the target cluster uses a disconnected registry, your seed cluster must use a disconnected registry. The registries do not have to be the same.
====

** FIPS configuration
