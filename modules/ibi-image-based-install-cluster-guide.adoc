= Cluster guidelines for an image-based installation and deployment

For a successful image-based installation and deployment, see the following guidelines.

== Hub cluster guidelines

* If you are using {rh-rhacm-first}, to avoid including any {rh-rhacm} resources in your seed image, you need to disable all optional {rh-rhacm} add-ons before generating the seed image.

== Seed cluster guidelines

* If your cluster deployment at the edge of the network requires a proxy configuration, you must create a seed image from a seed cluster featuring a proxy configuration. The proxy configurations do not have to match.

* Your {sno} seed cluster must have a shared `var/lib/containers` directory for precaching images during an image-based installation. For more information see the section _Configuring a shared container directory between ostree stateroots_.
