== Enabling kdump

The `kdump` service, included in `kexec-tools`, provides a crash-dumping mechanism. You can use this service to save the contents of the system's memory for later analysis.

The `kdump` service is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview
features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.

{op-system} ships with `kexec-tools`, but manual configuration is required to enable `kdump`.

.Procedure

Perform the following steps to enable `kdump` on {op-system}.

. To reserve memory for the crash kernel during the first kernel booting, provide kernel arguments by entering the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
# rpm-ostree kargs --append='crashkernel=256M'
----

. Optional: To write the crash dump over the network or to some other location, rather than to the default local `/var/crash` location, edit the `/etc/kdump.conf` configuration file.
+
[NOTE]
====
Network dumps are required when using LUKS. `kdump` does not support local crash dumps on LUKS-encrypted devices.
====
+
For details on configuring the `kdump` service, see the comments in `/etc/sysconfig/kdump`, `/etc/kdump.conf`, and the `kdump.conf` manual page.

endif::[]

. Enable the `kdump` systemd service.
+
[source, terminal]
----
# systemctl enable kdump.service
----

. Reboot your system.
+
[source, terminal]
----
# systemctl reboot
----

. Ensure that `kdump` has loaded a crash kernel by checking that the `kdump.service` has started and exited successfully and that `cat /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_loaded` prints `1`.

== Enabling kdump on day-1
The `kdump` service is intended to be enabled per node to debug kernel problems. Because there are costs to having `kdump` enabled, and these costs accumulate with each additional `kdump`-enabled node, it is recommended that `kdump` only be enabled on each node as needed. Potential costs of enabling `kdump` on each node include:

* Less available RAM due to memory being reserved for the crash kernel.
* Node unavailability while the kernel is dumping the core.
* Additional storage space being used to store the crash dumps.
* Not being production-ready because the `kdump` service is in link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview].

If you are aware of the downsides and trade-offs of having the `kdump` service enabled, it is possible to enable `kdump` in a cluster-wide fashion. Although machine-specific machine configs are not yet supported, you can perform the previous steps through a `systemd` unit in a `MachineConfig` object on day-1 and have kdump enabled on all nodes in the cluster. You can create a `MachineConfig` object and inject that object into the set of manifest files used by Ignition during cluster setup. See "Customizing nodes" in the _Installing -> Installation configuration_ section for more information and examples on how to use Ignition configs.

.Procedure

Create a `MachineConfig` object for cluster-wide configuration:

. Create a Butane config file, `99-worker-kdump.bu`, that configures and enables kdump:
+
[source,yaml]
----

          KEXEC_ARGS="-s"
          KDUMP_IMG="vmlinuz"

systemd:
  units:
    - name: kdump.service
      enabled: true
----
+
<1> Replace `worker` with `master` in both locations when creating a `MachineConfig` object for control plane nodes.
<2> Provide kernel arguments to reserve memory for the crash kernel. You can add other kernel arguments if necessary.
<3> If you want to change the contents of `/etc/kdump.conf` from the default, include this section and modify the `inline` subsection accordingly.
<4> If you want to change the contents of `/etc/sysconfig/kdump` from the default, include this section and modify the `inline` subsection accordingly.

. Use Butane to generate a machine config YAML file, `99-worker-kdump.yaml`, containing the configuration to be delivered to the nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ butane 99-worker-kdump.bu -o 99-worker-kdump.yaml
----

. Put the YAML file into manifests during cluster setup. You can also create this `MachineConfig` object after cluster setup with the YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 $ oc create -f ./99-worker-kdump.yaml
----
