The `kdump` service, included in the `kexec-tools` package, provides a crash-dumping mechanism. You can use this service to save the contents of a system's memory for later analysis.

The `x86_64` architecture supports kdump in General Availability (GA) status, whereas other architectures support kdump in Technology Preview (TP) status.

The following table provides details about the support level of kdump for different architectures.
