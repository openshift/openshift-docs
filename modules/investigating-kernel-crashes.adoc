== Enabling `kdump`

The `kdump` service, included in `kexec-tools`, provides a crash-dumping mechanism. You can use this service to save the contents of the system’s memory for later analysis.

{op-system} ships with `kexec-tools`, but manual configuration is required to enable `kdump`.

.Procedure

Perform the following steps to enable `kdump` on {op-system}.

. To reserve memory for the crash kernel during the first kernel booting, provide kernel arguments by entering the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
# rpm-ostree kargs --append='crashkernel=256M'
----

. By default, the path in which the vmcore will be saved is `/var/crash`. It is also possible to write the dump over the network or to some other location on the local system by editing `/etc/kdump.conf`. For example, assuming `/var/usrlocal/cores` exists, enter the following command to edit `/etc/kdump.conf` to save the vmcore to `/var/usrlocal/cores`:
+
[source, terminal]
----
# sed -i "s/^path.*/path \/var\/usrlocal\/cores/" /etc/kdump.conf
----
+
For additional information, see `kdump.conf`, a manual page for the `/etc/kdump.conf` configuration file containing the full documentation of available options, and note the comments in `/etc/kdump.conf` and `/etc/sysconfig/kdump`.

+

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Because `kdump` has trouble finding the correct bootimage location on {op-system}, the `KDUMP_BOOTDIR` variable must be manually set in `/etc/kdump.conf`. You can use `/proc/cmdline` to figure out the `ostree` boot location. For example:
+
[source, terminal]
----
# BOOT_LOC=/boot$(cat /proc/cmdline | egrep -o "/ostree/.*/vmlinuz" | sed -e "s|/vmlinuz||g")
# sed -i "s|^#KDUMP_BOOTDIR=\"/boot\"|KDUMP_BOOTDIR=\"${BOOT_LOC}\"|" /etc/sysconfig/kdump
----

. Configure `/etc/sysconfig/kdump` to not use the default link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kexec_file_load.2.html[file-based `kexec` syscall] for loading the crash kernel.
+
[source, terminal]
----
# sed -i "s|^KEXEC_ARGS=\"-s\"|KEXEC_ARGS=\"\"|" /etc/sysconfig/kdump
----
endif::[]

. Enable the `kdump` systemd service.
+
[source, terminal]
----
# systemctl enable kdump.service
----

. Reboot your system.
+
[source, terminal]
----
# systemctl reboot
----

. Ensure that `kdump` has loaded a crash kernel by checking that the `kdump.service` has started and exited successfully and that `cat /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_loaded` prints `1`.

== Enabling kdump on day-1
The `kdump` service is intended to be enabled per-node to debug kernel problems. It is not recommended to enable `kdump` on all of your nodes in the cluster. Although machine-specific machine configs are not yet supported, you can perform the previous steps through a `systemd` unit in a `MachineConfig` object on day-1 and have kdump enabled on all nodes in the cluster. You can create a machine config object and inject that object into the set of manifest files used by Ignition during cluster setup. See "Customizing nodes" in the _Installing -> Installation configuration_ section for more information and examples on how to use Ignition configs.
