= Configuring monitoring for SR-IOV interface traffic

[role="_abstract"]
Configure the `FlowCollector` resource to monitor traffic on Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) device by setting the `spec.agent.ebpf.privileged` field to `true`, which enables the eBPF agent to monitor other network namespaces.

The eBPF agent monitors other network namespaces in addition to the host network namespaces, which are monitored by default. When a pod with a virtual functions (VF) interface is created, a new network namespace is created. With `SRIOVNetwork` policy `IPAM` configurations specified, the VF interface is migrated from the host network namespace to the pod network namespace.

.Prerequisites
* Access to an {product-title} cluster with a SR-IOV device.
* The `SRIOVNetwork` custom resource (CR) `spec.ipam` configuration must be set with an IP address from the range that the interface lists or from other plugins.

.Procedure
. In the web console, navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster* and then select the *YAML* tab.
. Configure the `FlowCollector` custom resource. A sample configuration is as follows:
