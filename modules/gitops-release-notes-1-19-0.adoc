== New features

Argo CD Agent-based architecture (General Availability)::
With this update, the Argo CD Agent functionality in the {gitops-title} Operator is promoted from Technology Preview (TP) to General Availability (GA). This feature enables Argo CD to use an agent-based, pull-based approach to Argo CD application deployment, which leads to improved scalability, security, reliability, and more. For more information, see the Additional Resources section, which includes the downstream documentation for the Argo CD Agent architecture and installation.

Enhanced control over image pull policies for Argo CD components::
The {gitops-title} Operator now provides administrators with flexible, multi-level control over the `imagePullPolicy` for container images used by the Argo CD, GitOpsService, and RolloutsManager components. This enhancement enables organizations to define a consistent image pulling strategy across all managed instances. The {gitops-title} Operator evaluates image pull policy settings in the following order:
* Instance-level policy: Defined in the Custom Resource (CR) using the `.spec.imagePullPolicy` field. This overrides all other values for that instance.  
* Subscription-level policy: Configured using the `IMAGE_PULL_POLICY` environment variable in the {gitops-title}  Subscription.  
* Default policy: If no other policy is set, defaults to `IfNotPresent`.
+
The {gitops-title} Operator supports the following standard Kubernetes `imagePullPolicy` values:
* `Always`: Argo CD always pulls the image from the registry.
* `IfNotPresent`: Argo CD pulls the image only if it is not already present on the cluster node.
* `Never`: Argo CD never pulls the image and uses only the locally available image.
+
For more information, see the Additional Resources section, which includes the downstream documentation for Image pull policies.

Delegated management of Argo CD notification settings::
With this update, cluster administrators can delegate the management of Argo CD notification settings to specific namespaces, enabling users to manage their configurations. Teams can now configure their own triggers, templates, and subscriptions for their Applications without requiring access to the control plane namespace configurations. Administrators can enable this capability by adding the target namespace to the `.spec.sourceNamespaces` and `.spec.notifications.sourceNamespaces` fields in the Argo CD CR. For more information, see the Additional Resources section, which includes information about Configuring Notifications in any Namespace.

Argo CD Image Updater (Technology Preview)::
With this update, Argo CD Image Updater is now available as a Technology Preview feature in {gitops-title}. Argo CD Image Updater automatically updates container images for Kubernetes workloads managed by Argo CD. It tracks image versions in applications as defined by ImageUpdater CRs and updates it by applying parameter overrides through the Argo CD API or by using the Git write-back method. The image updater supports applications built with Kustomize or Helm. In this release, the {gitops-title} Operator provides a productized container image of the Argo CD Image Updater and introduces a new property in the Argo CD CR to enable or disable the feature.
+
The following example shows how to configure the Argo CD Image Updater feature in the Argo CD CR:
+
[source,YAML]
----
spec:
  imageUpdater:
    enabled: true
    env:
      - name: IMAGE_UPDATER_LOGLEVEL
        value: trace
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 1024Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 250m
        memory: 512Mi

Configurable resource limits and requests for GitOps plugin components::
With this update, you can configure resource requests and limits for the cluster and {gitops-shortname} plugin components through the `GitOpsService` CR. Administrators can define these values by using the following fields:
* `.spec.consolePlugin.backend.resources`
* `.spec.consolePlugin.gitopsPlugin.resources`
+
This enhancement allows administrators to assign distinct or identical resource allocations to the {gitops-shortname} plugin components, providing greater flexibility in resource management.
+
The following example shows how to configure resource requests and limits for the console plugin backend and GitOps plugin components in the `GitopsService` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: pipelines.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: GitopsService
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  consolePlugin:
    backend:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 1Gi
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 1Gi
    gitopsPlugin:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 200m

          cpu: 100m
          memory: 1Gi

Argo CD Agent is built with FIPS-validated cryptographic modules::
With this update, the Argo CD Agent component is built and verified with FIPS-validated cryptographic modules, ensuring that all cryptographic operations conform to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). This enhancement enables the Argo CD Agent to operate in FIPS-enabled Red Hat Enterprise Linux and OpenShift environments and aligns the component with Red Hat's FIPS certification standards.

Optimized memory usage in the {gitops-title} Operator manager::
With this update, the {gitops-title} Operator introduces memory usage optimizations in the {gitops-title} Operator manager. The enhancement uses controller-runtime `Transform` functions to remove unnecessary fields from cached secrets and config maps that the {gitops-title} Operator does not require. This approach helps reduce memory consumption, especially in clusters with a large number of secrets and config maps. These improvements can lower the memory footprint of the `openshift-gitops-operator-controller-manager` deployment. The optimization is enabled by default. If you encounter unexpected behavior, you can disable the feature by adding the following environment variable to the {gitops-title} Operator `Subscription` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-operator
spec:
  config:
    env:
      - name: MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED
        value: "false"

== Known issues

`redis-ha-haproxy` deployment does not automatically scale after upgrade::
When upgrading the {gitops-title} Operator from a version earlier than 1.17.x, the `redis-ha-haproxy` deployment might not automatically scale to 3 replicas, even if high availability (HA) mode was enabled before the upgrade. This issue occurs only when HA mode was configured before upgrading to version 1.17.x.
+
Workaround:
Manually scale the `redis-ha-haproxy` deployment to the expected replica count by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deployment <argocd instance>-redis-ha-haproxy \
  -n <argocd namespace> --replicas=3

== Breaking changes

Annotation-based resource tracking enabled by default::
With this update, the {gitops-title} Operator changes the default resource tracking behavior from label-based tracking to annotation-based tracking. Annotation-based tracking provides improved reliability and reduces the risk of errors caused by external tools or automation that might unintentionally copy tracking labels between resources. This change aligns the {gitops-title} Operator with the upstream Argo CD defaults. After upgrading, you should complete remediation steps to ensure a smooth transition to annotation-based tracking. For guidance, see the upstream documentation. If you want to continue using label-based tracking, you can configure it by setting the `.spec.resourceTrackingMethod` field to `label` in the Argo CD CR. For more details, see the Additional Resources section, which includes the upstream link for the Argo CD Annotation-based resource tracking.

argocd-cmp-server requires glibc for FIPS compliance::
With this update, the `argocd-cmp-server binary` is not statically linked. To meet FIPS compliance requirements, the binary is now dynamically linked and uses the OpenSSL implementation for cryptographic operations. As a result, the binary has a hard dependency on `glibc` and can run only on container images that include `glibc` support. Minimal images such as BusyBox or Alpine (without glibc) do not meet this requirement, and running the binary on those images causes it to crash. Before upgrading, ensure that your CMP sidecar container image includes `glibc`. If it does not, use one of the following options:
* Switch to an image that includes glibc, such as UBI or Fedora.
* Use the default Argo CD base image, which includes glibc, is fully compatible, and is the recommended approach.
+
You can switch to the default Argo CD image by removing the image field from your sidecar container configuration under `.spec.repo.sidecarContainers` in the Argo CD CR. During reconciliation, the {gitops-title} Operator automatically applies the default image.
