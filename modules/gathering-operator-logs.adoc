= Gathering Operator logs

If you experience Operator issues, you can gather detailed diagnostic information from Operator pod logs.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Your API service is still functional.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have the fully qualified domain names of the control plane, or master machines.

.Procedure

. List the Operator pods that are running in the Operator's namespace, plus the pod status, restarts, and age:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n <operator_namespace>
----

. Review logs for an Operator pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs pod/<pod_name> -n <operator_namespace>
----
+
If an Operator pod has multiple containers, the preceding command will produce an error that includes the name of each container. Query logs from an individual container:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs pod/<operator_pod_name> -c <container_name> -n <operator_namespace>
----

. If the API is not functional, review Operator pod and container logs on each master node by using SSH instead. Replace `<master-node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` with appropriate values.
.. List pods on each master node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh core@<master-node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> sudo crictl pods
----
+
.. For any Operator pods not showing a `Ready` status, inspect the pod's status in detail. Replace `<operator_pod_id>` with the Operator pod's ID listed in the output of the preceding command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh core@<master-node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> sudo crictl inspectp <operator_pod_id>
----
+
.. List containers related to an Operator pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh core@<master-node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> sudo crictl ps --pod=<operator_pod_id>
----
+
.. For any Operator container not showing a `Ready` status, inspect the container's status in detail. Replace `<container_id>` with a container ID listed in the output of the preceding command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh core@<master-node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> sudo crictl inspect <container_id>
----
+
.. Review the logs for any Operator containers not showing a `Ready` status. Replace `<container_id>` with a container ID listed in the output of the preceding command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh core@<master-node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> sudo crictl logs -f <container_id>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} {product-version} cluster nodes running {op-system-first} are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Accessing cluster nodes using SSH is not recommended and nodes will be tainted as _accessed_. Before attempting to collect diagnostic data over SSH, review whether the data collected by running `oc adm must gather` and other `oc` commands is sufficient instead. However, if the {product-title} API is not available, or the kubelet is not properly functioning on the target node, `oc` operations will be impacted. In such situations, it is possible to access nodes using `ssh core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`.
