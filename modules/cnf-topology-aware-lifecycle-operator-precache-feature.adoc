= Using the container image pre-cache feature

The clusters might have limited bandwidth to access the container image registry, which can cause a timeout before the updates are completed. 
The pre-cache feature allows the required container images to be present on the spoke cluster before the update starts.

[NOTE]
====
The time of the update is not set by TALO. You can apply the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR at the beginning of the update by manual application or by external automation.
====

The container image pre-caching starts when the `preCaching` field is set to `true` in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. After a successful pre-caching process, you can start remediating policies. The remediation actions start when the `enable` field is set to `true`.

//Review of the pre-caching statuses is needed

The pre-caching process can be in the following statuses:

`PrecacheNotStarted`:: This is the initial state all clusters are automatically assigned to on the first reconciliation pass of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. 
+
In this state, TALO deletes any pre-caching namespace and Hub view resources of spoke clusters that remain from previous incomplete updates. TALO then creates a new `ManagedClusterView` resource for the spoke pre-caching namespace to verify its deletion in the `PrecachePreparing` state.
`PrecachePreparing`:: In this state, cleaning up any remaining resources from previous incomplete updates is in progress.
`PrecacheStarting`:: In this state, pre-caching job pre-requisites and the job are created.
`PrecacheActive`:: The job is in "Active" state.
`PrecacheSucceeded`:: In this state, the pre-cache job has succeeded.
`PrecacheTimeout`:: In this state, the artifact pre-caching has been partially done.
`PrecacheUnrecoverableError`:: In this sate, the job ends with a non-zero exit code.

== Creating a ClusterGroupUpgrade CR with pre-caching

.Prerequisites

* Install the Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator.
* Provision one or more managed clusters.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Save the contents of `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `preCaching` field set to `true` in the `clustergroupupgrades-group-du.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: du-upgrade-4918
  namespace: ztp-group-du-sno
spec:
  actions:
    preCaching: true <1>
    afterCompletion:
      deleteObjects: true
  clusters:
  - cnfdb1
  - cnfdb2
  enable: true
  managedPolicies:
  - du-upgrade-platform-upgrade
  remediationStrategy:
    maxConcurrency: 2
    timeout: 240
----
<1> The `preCaching` field is set to `true`, which enables TALO to pull the container images before starting the update.

. When you want to start the update, apply the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f clustergroupupgrades-group-du.yaml
----

.Verification

. Check if the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR exists in the Hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu -A
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE          NAME              AGE
ztp-group-du-sno   du-upgrade-4918   10s <1>
----
<1> The CR is created.

. Check the status of the pre-caching task by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu -n ztp-group-du-sno du-upgrade-4918 -o jsonpath='{.status}' | jq
----
+
.Example output
