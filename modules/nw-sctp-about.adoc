= Support for Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) on {product-title}

As a cluster administrator, you can enable SCTP on the hosts in the cluster.
On {op-system-first}, the SCTP module is disabled by default.

SCTP is a reliable message based protocol that runs on top of an IP network. The protocol is commonly used in the telecommunications industry. It differs from TCP in several ways, including the following:

- Multihoming of IP addresses to provide fault-tolerant connectivity. For example, if you have two separate networks providing connectivity to an endpoint, the endpoint will survive an interruption of one connection.
- Detection of duplicate or dropped packets.
- Tolerance for Path MTU Discovery (PMTU) and fragmentation.

[NOTE]
====
An application must be designed specifically to work with the SCTP protocol.
====

When enabled, you can use SCTP as a protocol with Pods, Services, and network policy.
A Service must be defined with the `type` parameter set to either the `ClusterIP` or `NodePort` value.

== Example configurations using SCTP protocol

You can configure a Pod or Service to use SCTP by setting the `protocol` parameter to the `SCTP` value in the Pod or Service resource definition.

In the following example, a Pod is configured to use SCTP:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  namespace: project1
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: example-pod
...
      ports:
        - containerPort: 30100
          name: sctpserver
          protocol: SCTP
----

In the following example, a Service is configured to use SCTP:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  namespace: project1
  name: sctpserver
spec:
...
  ports:
    - name: sctpserver
      protocol: SCTP
      port: 30100
      targetPort: 30100
  type: ClusterIP
----

In the following example, a NetworkPolicy object is configured to apply to SCTP network traffic on port `80` from any Pods with a specific label:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-sctp-on-http
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: web
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: SCTP
      port: 80
