= TaskRun

A _TaskRun_ instantiates a Task for execution with specific inputs, outputs, and execution parameters on a cluster. It can be invoked on its own or as part of a PipelineRun.

A Task consists of one or more Steps that execute container images, and each container image performs a specific piece of build work. A TaskRun executes the Steps in a Task in the specified order, until all Steps execute successfully or a failure occurs.

The following example shows a TaskRun that runs the `apply-manifests` Task with the relevant input parameters:
[source,yaml]
