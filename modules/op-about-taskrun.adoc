= Task run

[role="_abstract"]
You can use a `TaskRun` resource to instantiate and execute a task with specific inputs, outputs, and execution parameters on a cluster. You can initiate a task run independently or as part of a pipeline run to execute the steps defined in a task.

A `TaskRun` instantiates a task for execution with specific inputs, outputs, and execution parameters on a cluster. You can start it on its own or as part of a pipeline run for each task in a pipeline.

A task consists of one or more steps that run container images, and each container image performs a specific piece of build work. A task run starts the steps in a task in the specified order, until all steps run successfully or a failure occurs. A `TaskRun` is automatically created by a `PipelineRun` for each task in a pipeline.

The following example shows a task run that runs the `apply-manifests` task with the relevant input parameters:
[source,yaml]

`apiVersion`:: The task run API version `v1`.

`kind`:: Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, `TaskRun`.

`metadata.name`:: Unique name to identify this task run.

`spec`:: Definition of the task run. For this task run, the task and the required workspace you define.

`spec.taskRef`:: Name of the task reference used for this task run. This task run runs the `apply-manifests` task.

`spec.workspaces`:: Workspace used by the task run.
