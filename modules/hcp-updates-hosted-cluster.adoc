= Updates for the hosted cluster

The `spec.release.image` value dictates the version of the control plane. The `HostedCluster` object transmits the intended `spec.release.image` value to the `HostedControlPlane.spec.releaseImage` value and runs the appropriate Control Plane Operator version.

The hosted control plane manages the rollout of the new version of the control plane components along with any {product-title} components through the new version of the Cluster Version Operator (CVO).

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {hcp}, the `NodeHealthCheck` resource cannot detect the status of the CVO. A cluster administrator must manually pause the remediation triggered by `NodeHealthCheck`, before performing critical operations, such as updating the cluster, to prevent new remediation actions from interfering with cluster updates.

To pause the remediation, enter the array of strings, for example, `pause-test-cluster`, as a value of the `pauseRequests` field in the `NodeHealthCheck` resource. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/workload_availability_for_red_hat_openshift/24.4/html/remediation_fencing_and_maintenance/node-health-check-operator#about-node-health-check-operator_node-health-check-operator[About the Node Health Check Operator].

After the cluster update is complete, you can edit or delete the remediation. Navigate to the *Compute* -> *NodeHealthCheck* page, click your node health check, and then click *Actions*, which shows a drop-down list.
