These limitations exist in Jaeger:

* Apache Spark is not supported.

* Jaeger streaming via AMQ/Kafka is unsupported on IBM Z and IBM Power Systems.

These are the known issues in Jaeger:

* link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1918920[BZ-1918920] The Elasticsearch pods does not get restarted automatically after an update.  As a workaround, restart the pods manually.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-809[TRACING-809] Jaeger Ingester is incompatible with Kafka 2.3. When there are two or more instances of the Jaeger Ingester and enough traffic it will continuously generate rebalancing messages in the logs.  This is due to a regression in Kafka 2.3 that was fixed in Kafka 2.3.1.  For more information, see https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1819[Jaegertracing-1819].
