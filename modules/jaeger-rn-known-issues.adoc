These limitations exist in Jaeger:

* While Kafka publisher is included as part of Jaeger, it is not supported.
* Apache Spark is not supported.
* Only self-provisioned Elasticsearch instances are supported.  External Elasticsearch instances are not supported in this release.

These are the known issues in Jaeger:

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-1166[TRACING-1166] It is not currently possible to use the Jaeger streaming strategy within a disconnected environment. When a Kafka cluster is being provisioned, it results in a error: `Failed to pull image registry.redhat.io/amq7/amq-streams-kafka-24-rhel7@sha256:f9ceca004f1b7dccb3b82d9a8027961f9fe4104e0ed69752c0bdd8078b4a1076`.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-809[TRACING-809] Jaeger Ingester is incompatible with Kafka 2.3. When there are two or more instances of the Jaeger Ingester and enough traffic it will continuously generate rebalancing messages in the logs.  This is due to a regression in Kafka 2.3 that was fixed in Kafka 2.3.1.  For more information, see https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1819[Jaegertracing-1819].
