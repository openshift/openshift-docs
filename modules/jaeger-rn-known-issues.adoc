https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-809[TRACING-809] Jaeger Ingester is incompatible with Kafka 2.3. When there are two or more instances of the Jaeger Ingester and enough traffic it will continuously generate rebalancing messages in the logs.  This is due to a regression in Kafka 2.3 that was fixed in Kafka 2.3.1.  For more information, see https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1819[Jaegertracing-1819].
