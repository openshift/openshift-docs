= Configuration by using declarative configuration

You can  configure the following resources by using the {product-title-short} declarative configuration method:

* Authentication providers
* Roles
* Permission sets
* Notifiers
* Access scopes
* Short-lived tokens

To configure these resources, you create YAML files that contain configuration information. These files are used to create a ConfigMap or Secret that is added to {product-title-short} by using a mount point during installation of the {product-title-short} Central resource.
