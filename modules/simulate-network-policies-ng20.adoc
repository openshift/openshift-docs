= Simulating network policies from the network graph

[role="_abstract"]
Your current network policies might allow unneeded network communications. You can use the network policy generator to create network policies that restrict ingress traffic to the computed baselines for a set of deployments.

[NOTE]
====
The Network Graph does not display the generated policies in the visualization. Generated policies are only for ingress traffic and policies that restrict egress traffic are not generated.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Network Graph*.
. Select a cluster, and then select one or more namespaces.
. On the network graph header, select *Network policy generator*.
. You can perform the following actions:
** Generate a YAML file with network policies to use in the simulation by clicking *Generate and simulate network policies*. For more information, see "Generating network policies in the network graph".
** Upload a YAML file of a network policy that you want to use in the simulation by performing the following steps:
.. Click *Upload YAML* and then select the file.
.. Click *Open*. The system displays a message to indicate the processing status of the uploaded policy.
. You can view active YAML files that correspond to the current network policies by clicking the *View active YAMLS* tab, and then selecting policies from the drop-down list. You can also perform the following actions:
** Click the appropriate button to copy or download the displayed YAML file.
** Use the *Actions* menu to rebuild rules from active traffic or revert rules to a previously applied YAML. For more information, see "Generating network policies in the network graph".
