= Simulating network policies from the network graph (2.0 preview)

[role="_abstract"]
Your current network policies might allow unneeded network communications.
To simulate the effects of a new set of network policies, use the network policy simulator. For information about using the network policy simulator to generate policies, see "Generating network policies in the network graph (2.0 preview)."

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, navigate to *Network Graph (2.0 preview)*.
. Select a cluster, and then select one or more namespaces.
. On the network graph header, select *Simulate network policy*.
. Optional: Generate a YAML file with network policies to use in the simulation by clicking *Generate and simulate network policies*. For more information, see "Generating network policies in the network graph (2.0 preview)".
. Upload a YAML file of a network policy that you want to use in the simulation. The network graph view displays what your proposed network policies would achieve. Perform the following steps:
.. Click *Upload YAML* and then select the file.
.. Click *Open*. The system displays a message to indicate the processing status of the uploaded policy.
. You can view active YAML files that correspond to the current network policies by clicking the *View active YAMLS* tab, and then selecting policies from the drop-down list. You can also perform the following actions:
** Click the appropriate button to copy or download the displayed YAML file.
** Use the *Actions* menu to rebuild rules from active traffic or revert rules to a previously applied YAML. For more information, see "Generating network policies from the network graph (2.0 preview)".

[WARNING]
====
Directly applying network policies might cause problems for running applications.
Always download and test the network policies in a development environment or test clusters before applying them to production workloads.
