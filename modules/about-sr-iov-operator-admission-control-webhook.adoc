= About the SR-IOV Network Operator admission controller webhook

[role="_abstract"]
To validate network configurations and prevent errors, rely on the SR-IOV Network Operator admission controller webhook. This Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller intercepts API requests to ensure that your SR-IOV resource definitions and pod specifications comply with cluster policies.

The SR-IOV Network Operator Admission Controller webhook provides the following capabilities:

* Validation of the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` CR when it is created or updated.
* Mutation of the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` CR by setting the default value for the `priority` and `deviceType` fields when the CR is created or updated.

The SR-IOV Network Operator Admission Controller webhook is enabled by the Operator when the `enableOperatorWebhook` is set to `true` in the `SriovOperatorConfig` CR. The `operator-webhook` pod runs as a daemon set on all control plane nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Use caution when disabling the SR-IOV Network Operator Admission Controller webhook. You can disable the webhook under specific circumstances, such as troubleshooting, or if you want to use unsupported devices. For information about configuring unsupported devices, see "Configuring the SR-IOV Network Operator to use an unsupported NIC".
