[id="ossm-auto-route-create-subdomains_{context}"]
= Creating subdomain routes

The following example creates a gateway in the Bookinfo sample application, which creates subdomain routes.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway1
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - www.bookinfo.com
    - bookinfo.example.com
----

Then, the following OpenShift Routes are created automatically. You can check that the routes are created with the following command. In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the control plane project.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n istio-system get routes
----

.Expected output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME           HOST/PORT             PATH  SERVICES               PORT  TERMINATION   WILDCARD
gateway1-lvlfn bookinfo.example.com        istio-ingressgateway   <all>               None
gateway1-scqhv www.bookinfo.com            istio-ingressgateway   <all>               None
----

If the gateway is deleted, {ProductName} deletes the routes. However, routes created manually are never modified by {ProductName}.

[id="ossm-auto-route-annotations_{context}"]
= Annotations

Sometimes specific annotations are needed in an OpenShift Route. For example, some advanced features in OpenShift Routes are managed via xref:../../networking/routes/route-configuration.adoc[special annotations]. For this and other use cases, {ProductName} will copy all annotations present in the Istio Gateway resource (with the exception of those starting with `kubectl.kubernetes.io`) into the managed OpenShift Route resource.

If you need specific annotations in the OpenShift Routes created by {ProductShortName}, create them in the Istio Gateway resource and they will be copied into the OpenShift Route resources managed by the {ProductShortName}.

[id="ossm-auto-route-enable_{context}"]
= Disabling automatic route creation

By default, the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource automatically synchronizes the Gateway resources with OpenShift routes. Disabling the automatic route creation allows you more flexibility to control routes if you have a special case or prefer to control routes manually.

Disable integration between Istio Gateways and OpenShift Routes by setting the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` field `gateways.openshiftRoute.enabled` to `false`. For example, see the following resource snippet.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  gateways:
    openshiftRoute:
      enabled: false
