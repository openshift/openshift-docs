= Creating subdomain routes

The following example creates a gateway in the Bookinfo sample application, which creates subdomain routes.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway1
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - www.bookinfo.com
    - bookinfo.example.com
----

Then, the following OpenShift Routes are created automatically. You can check that the routes are created with the following command. In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the control plane project.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n istio-system get routes
----

.Expected output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME           HOST/PORT             PATH  SERVICES               PORT  TERMINATION   WILDCARD
gateway1-lvlfn bookinfo.example.com        istio-ingressgateway   <all>               None
gateway1-scqhv www.bookinfo.com            istio-ingressgateway   <all>               None
----

If the gateway is deleted, {ProductName} deletes the routes. However, routes created manually are never modified by {ProductName}.
