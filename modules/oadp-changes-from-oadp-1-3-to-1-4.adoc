= Changes from OADP 1.3 to 1.4

[role="_abstract"]
The Velero server has been updated from version 1.12 to 1.14. Although the Data Protection Application (DPA) remains unchanged, several plugins and default configuration values were updated.

The changes are as follows:

* The `velero-plugin-for-csi` code is now available in the Velero code, which means an `init` container is no longer required for the plugin.

* Velero changed the client Burst default from 30 to 100 and the QPS default from 20 to 100.

* The `velero-plugin-for-aws` plugin updated default value of the `spec.config.checksumAlgorithm` field in `BackupStorageLocation` objects (BSLs) from `""` (no checksum calculation) to the `CRC32` algorithm. For more information, see link:https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-aws/blob/release-1.10/backupstoragelocation.md[Velero plugins for AWS Backup Storage Location]. The checksum algorithm types are known to work only with AWS.
Several S3 providers require the `md5sum` to be disabled by setting the checksum algorithm to `""`. Confirm `md5sum` algorithm support and configuration with your storage provider.
+
In OADP 1.4, the default value for BSLs created within DPA for this configuration is `""`. This default value means that the `md5sum` is not checked, which is consistent with OADP 1.3. For BSLs created within DPA, update it by using the `spec.backupLocations[].velero.config.checksumAlgorithm` field in the DPA. If your BSLs are created outside DPA, you can update this configuration by using `spec.config.checksumAlgorithm` in the BSLs.
