= Using and changing worker latency profiles

To change a worker latency profile to deal with network latency, edit the `node.config` object to add the name of the profile. You can change the profile at any time as latency increases or decreases.

You must move one worker latency profile at a time. For example, you cannot move directly from the `Default` profile to the `LowUpdateSlowReaction` worker latency profile. You must move from the `Default` worker latency profile to the `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile first, then to `LowUpdateSlowReaction`. Similarly, when returning to the `Default` profile, you must move from the low profile to the medium profile first, then to `Default`.

[NOTE]
====
You can also configure worker latency profiles upon installing an {product-title} cluster.

.Procedure

To move from the default worker latency profile:

. Move to the medium worker latency profile:

.. Edit the `node.config` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit nodes.config/cluster
----

.. Add `spec.workerLatencyProfile: MediumUpdateAverageReaction`:
+
.Example `node.config` object

<1> Specifies the medium worker latency policy.

Scheduling on each worker node is disabled as the change is being applied.

. Optional: Move to the low worker latency profile:

.. Edit the `node.config` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit nodes.config/cluster
----

.. Change the `spec.workerLatencyProfile` value to `LowUpdateSlowReaction`:

# ...
----
<1> Specifies use of the low worker latency policy.

Scheduling on each worker node is disabled as the change is being applied.

.Verification

* When all nodes return to the `Ready` condition, you can use the following command to look in the Kubernetes Controller Manager to ensure it was applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get KubeControllerManager -o yaml | grep -i workerlatency -A 5 -B 5

To change the medium profile to default or change the default to medium, edit the `node.config` object and set the `spec.workerLatencyProfile` parameter to the appropriate value.
