== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the default TLS termination policy of the Argo CD server route changed from `passthrough` to `reencrypt`, leading to issues for users who previously configured the passthrough route with a custom TLS certificate. This update fixes the issue by reverting the default termination policy to `passthrough`. With this update, the Argo CD UI is accessible without any issues, even if the server route with a passthrough policy is configured with a custom TLS certificate. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-4758[GITOPS-4758]
