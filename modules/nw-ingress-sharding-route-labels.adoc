= Configuring Ingress Controller sharding by using route labels

Ingress Controller sharding by using route labels means that the Ingress
Controller serves any route in any namespace that is selected by the route
selector.

.Ingress sharding using route labels
image::nw-sharding-route-labels.png[A diagram showing multiple Ingress Controllers with different route selectors serving any route containing a label that matches a given route selector regardless of the namespace a route belongs to]

Ingress Controller sharding is useful when balancing incoming traffic load among
a set of Ingress Controllers and when isolating traffic to a specific Ingress
Controller. For example, company A goes to one Ingress Controller and company B
to another.

.Procedure

. Edit the `router-internal.yaml` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# cat router-internal.yaml
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
  kind: IngressController
  metadata:
    name: sharded
    namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
  spec:
    domain: <apps-sharded.basedomain.example.net>
    nodePlacement:
      nodeSelector:
        matchLabels:
          node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
    routeSelector:
      matchLabels:
        type: sharded
  status: {}
kind: List
metadata:
  resourceVersion: ""
  selfLink: ""
----

. Apply the Ingress Controller `router-internal.yaml` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc apply -f router-internal.yaml
----
+
The Ingress Controller selects routes in any namespace that have the label
`type: sharded`.
