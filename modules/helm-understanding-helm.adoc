= Understanding Helm

Helm is a software package manager that simplifies deployment of applications and services to {product-title} clusters.

Helm uses a packaging format called _charts_.
A Helm chart is a collection of files that describes the {product-title} resources.

A running instance of the chart in a cluster is called a _release_. A new release is created every time a chart is installed on the cluster.

Each time a chart is installed, or a release is upgraded or rolled back, an incremental revision is created.


== Key features

Helm provides the ability to:

* Search through a large collection of charts stored in the chart repository.
* Modify existing charts.
* Create your own charts with {product-title} or Kubernetes resources.
* Package and share your applications as charts.
