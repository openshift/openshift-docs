= VMware vSphere region and zone enablement

You can deploy an {product-title} cluster to multiple vSphere datacenters, or regions, that run in a single VMware vCenter. Each datacenter can run multiple clusters, or zones. This configuration reduces the risk of a hardware failure or network outage causing your cluster to fail.

You can also specify multiple regions and zones on a cluster after installation. You must upgrade your existing cluster to {product-title} {product-version} before you configure a multiple region and zone environment.

You must create an installation configuration file and then modify for the purposes of region and zone enablement, because deploying a cluster to a single vSphere datacenter is the default installation configuration.

For {product-title} {product-version}, the default `install-config.yaml` file includes `vcenters` and `failureDomains` fields, so that you can choose to specify multiple datacenters, region, and zone information for your cluster. You can leave these fields blank if you want to install an {product-title} cluster in a vSphere environment that consists of single datacenter running in a VMware vCenter.

The following list describes terms associated with defining zones and regions for your cluster:

* Failure domain: Establishes the relationships between a region and zone. You define a failure domain by using vCenter objects, such as a `datastore` object. A failure domain defines the vCenter location for {product-title} cluster nodes.
* Region: Specifies a vCenter datacenter. You define a region by using a tag from the  `openshift-region` tag category. 
* Zone: Specifies a vCenter cluster. You define a zone by using a tag from the `openshift-zone` tag category. 

[NOTE]
====
If you plan on specifying more than one failure domain in your `install-config.yaml` file, you must create tag categories, zone tags, and region tags in advance of creating the configuration file.
====

You must create a vCenter tag for each vCenter datacenter, which represents a region. Additionally, you must create a vCenter tag for each cluster than runs in a datacenter, which represents a zone. After you create the tags, you must attach each tag to their respective datacenters and clusters. 

The following table outlines an example of the relationship among regions, zones, and tags for a configuration with multiple vSphere datacenters running in a single VMware vCenter.
