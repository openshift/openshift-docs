= Control plane and infrastructure node sizing and scaling

When you install a {product-title}
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
(ROSA)
endif::[]
cluster, the sizing of the control plane and infrastructure nodes are automatically determined by the compute node count.

If you change the number of compute nodes in your cluster after installation, the Red{nbsp}Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team scales the control plane and infrastructure nodes as required to maintain cluster stability.

[id="node-sizing-during-installation_{context}"]
== Node sizing during installation

During the installation process, the sizing of the control plane and infrastructure nodes are dynamically calculated. The sizing calculation is based on the number of compute nodes in a cluster.

[id="node-scaling-after-installation_{context}"]
== Node scaling after installation

If you change the number of compute nodes after installation, the control plane and infrastructure nodes are scaled by the Red{nbsp}Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team as required. The nodes are scaled to maintain platform stability.

Postinstallation scaling requirements for control plane and infrastructure nodes are assessed on a case-by-case basis. Node resource consumption and received alerts are taken into consideration.

.Rules for control plane node resizing alerts

The resizing alert is triggered for the control plane nodes in a cluster when the following occurs:

* Control plane nodes sustain over 66% utilization on average in a cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The maximum number of compute nodes on
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
ROSA
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
{product-title}
endif::[]
is 180.
====

.Rules for infrastructure node resizing alerts

Resizing alerts are triggered for the infrastructure nodes in a cluster when it has high-sustained CPU or memory utilization. This high-sustained utilization status is:

* Infrastructure nodes sustain over 50% utilization on average in a cluster with a single availability zone using 2 infrastructure nodes.
* Infrastructure nodes sustain over 66% utilization on average in a cluster with multiple availability zones using 3 infrastructure nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
The maximum number of compute nodes on
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
ROSA
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
{product-title}
endif::[]
is 180.

The resizing alerts only appear after sustained periods of high utilization. Short usage spikes, such as a node temporarily going down causing the other node to scale up, do not trigger these alerts.
====

The SRE team might scale the control plane and infrastructure nodes for additional reasons, for example to manage an increase in resource consumption on the nodes.

ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
When scaling is applied, the customer is notified through a service log entry. For more information about the service log, see _Accessing the service logs for ROSA clusters_.

[id="sizing-considerations-for-larger-clusters_{context}"]
== Sizing considerations for larger clusters

For larger clusters, infrastructure node sizing can become a significant impacting factor to scalability. There are many factors that influence the stated thresholds, including the etcd version or storage data format.

Exceeding these limits does not necessarily mean that the cluster will fail. In most cases, exceeding these numbers results in lower overall performance.
