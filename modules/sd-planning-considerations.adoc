= Control plane and infrastructure node sizing and scaling

When you install a {product-title}

(ROSA)
endif::[]
cluster, the sizing of the control plane and infrastructure nodes are automatically determined by the compute node count.

If you change the number of compute nodes in your cluster after installation, the Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team scales the control plane and infrastructure nodes as required to maintain cluster stability.

[id="node-sizing-during-installation_{context}"]
== Node sizing during installation

During the installation process, the sizing of the control plane and infrastructure nodes are dynamically calculated. The sizing calculation is based on the number of compute nodes in a cluster.

The following table lists the control plane and infrastructure node sizing that is applied during installation.

[id="node-scaling-after-installation_{context}"]
== Node scaling after installation

If you change the number of compute nodes after installation, the control plane and infrastructure nodes are scaled by the Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team as required. The nodes are scaled to maintain platform stability.

Post-installation scaling requirements for control plane and infrastructure nodes are assessed on a case-by-case basis. Node resource consumption and received alerts are taken into consideration.

.Rules for control plane node resizing alerts

Resizing alerts are triggered for the control plane nodes in a cluster when either of the following scenarios are true:

* Each control plane node has less than 16GiB RAM, and there are more than 25 and less than 101 compute nodes.
* Each control plane node has less than 32GiB RAM, and there are more than 100 compute nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
The maximum number of compute nodes on ROSA is 180.

.Rules for infrastructure node resizing alerts

Resizing alerts are triggered for the infrastructure nodes in a cluster when either of the following scenarios are true:

* Each infrastructure node has less than 16GiB RAM or less than 5 CPUs, and there are more than 25 and less than 101 compute nodes.
* Each infrastructure node has less than 32GiB RAM or less than 9 CPUs, and there are more than 100 compute nodes.

The SRE team might scale the control plane and infrastructure nodes for additional reasons, for example to manage an increase in resource consumption on the nodes.

When scaling is applied, the customer is notified through a service log entry. For more information about the service log, see xref:../../logging/sd-accessing-the-service-logs.adoc#sd-accessing-the-service-logs[Accessing the service logs for ROSA clusters].

[id="sizing-considerations-for-larger-clusters_{context}"]
== Sizing considerations for larger clusters

For larger clusters, infrastructure node sizing can become a significant impacting factor to scalability. There are many factors that influence the stated thresholds, including the etcd version or storage data format.

Exceeding these limits does not necessarily mean that the cluster will fail. In most cases, exceeding these numbers results in lower overall performance.
