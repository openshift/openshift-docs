= Adding day-1 kernel arguments
Although it is often preferable to modify kernel arguments as a day-2 activity,
you might want to add kernel arguments to all master or worker nodes during initial cluster
installation. Here are some reasons you might want
to add kernel arguments during cluster installation so they take effect before
the systems first boot up:

* You want to disable a feature, such as SELinux, so it has no impact on the systems when they first come up.
* You need to do some low-level network configuration before the systems start.

To add kernel arguments to master or worker nodes, you can create a `MachineConfig` object
and inject that object into the set of manifest files used by Ignition during
cluster setup.

For a listing of arguments you can pass to a RHEL 8 kernel at boot time, see
link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt[Kernel.org kernel parameters].
It is best to only add kernel arguments with this procedure if they are needed to complete the initial
{product-title} installation.

.Procedure

. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
----

. Decide if you want to add kernel arguments to worker or control plane nodes (also known as the master nodes).

. In the `openshift` directory, create a file (for example,
`99-openshift-machineconfig-master-kargs.yaml`) to define a `MachineConfig`
object to add the kernel settings.
This example adds a `loglevel=7` kernel argument to control plane nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF > 99-openshift-machineconfig-master-kargs.yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
  name: 99-openshift-machineconfig-master-kargs
spec:
  kernelArguments:
    - 'loglevel=7'
EOF
----
+
You can change `master` to `worker` to add kernel arguments to worker nodes instead.
Create a separate YAML file to add to both master and worker nodes.

You can now continue on to create the cluster.
