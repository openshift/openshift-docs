= About NonAdminBackupStorageLocation CR

A namespace administrator can create a `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` (NABSL) custom resource (CR) to store the backup data.

To ensure that the NABSL CR is created and used securely, use cluster administrator controls. The cluster administrator manages the NABSL CR to comply with company policies, and compliance requirements.

You can create a NABSL CR by using one of the following workflows:

* *Administrator creation workflow*: In this workflow, the cluster administrator creates the NABSL CR for the namespace admin user. The namespace admin user then references the NABSL in the `NonAdminBackup` CR.
* *Administrator approval workflow*: The cluster administrator must explicitly enable this opt-in feature in the DPA by setting the `nonAdmin.requireApprovalForBSL` field to `true`. The cluster administrator approval process works as follows:
.. A namespace admin user creates a NABSL CR. Because the administrator has enforced an approval process in the DPA, it triggers the creation of a `NonAdminBackupStorageLocationRequest` CR in the `openshift-adp` namespace.
.. The cluster administrator reviews the request and either approves or rejects the request. 
** If approved, a `Velero` `BackupStorageLocation` (BSL) is created in the `openshift-adp` namespace, and the NABSL CR status is updated to reflect the approval. 
** If rejected, the status of the NABSL CR is updated to reflect the rejection.
.. The cluster administrator can also revoke a previously approved NABSL CR. The `approve` field is set back to `pending` or `reject`. This results in the deletion of the `Velero` BSL, and the namespace admin user is notified of the rejection. 
* *Automatic approval workflow*: In this workflow, the cluster administrator does not enforce an approval process for the NABSL CR by setting the `nonAdmin.requireApprovalForBSL` field in the DPA to `false`. The default value of this field is `false`. Not setting the field results in an automatic approval of the NABSL. Therefore, the namespace admin user can create the NABSL CR from their authorized namespace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For security purposes, use either the administrator creation or the administrator approval workflow. The automatic approval workflow is less secure as it does not require administrator review.
