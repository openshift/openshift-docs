= Upgrading the hosted control plane with the ROSA CLI

You can manually upgrade the hosted control plane of a {hcp-title} cluster by using the ROSA CLI. This method schedules the control plane for an upgrade if a more recent version is available, either immediately, or at a specified future time.

[NOTE]
====
Your control plane only supports machine pools within two minor Y-stream versions. For example, a {hcp-title} cluster with a control plane using version 4.15.z supports machine pools with version 4.13.z and 4.14.z, but the control plane does not support machine pools using version 4.12.z.

//END HCP-ONLY conditions

// WHOLE CLUSTER: Condition for upgrading hosted control plane as part of upgrading the whole cluster in sequence
ifeval::["{context}" == "rosa-hcp-upgrading-whole-cluster"]
= Upgrading the hosted control plane

When you need to upgrade the whole cluster, upgrade the hosted control plane first.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed and configured the latest version of the ROSA CLI.
* No machine pool upgrades are in progress or scheduled to take place at the same time as the hosted control plane upgrade.

//END WHOLE CLUSTER conditions

.Procedure

. Verify the current version of your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe cluster --cluster=<cluster_name_or_id> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<cluster_name_or_id>` with the cluster name or the cluster ID.

. List the versions that you can upgrade your control plane to by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list upgrade --cluster=<cluster_name_or_id>
----
+
The command returns a list of available updates, including the recommended version.
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
VERSION  NOTES
4.14.8   recommended
4.14.7
4.14.6
----

. Upgrade the cluster's hosted control plane by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa upgrade cluster -c <cluster_name_or_id> --control-plane [--schedule-date=<yyyy-mm-dd> --schedule-time=<HH:mm>] --version <version_number>
----

** To schedule an immediate upgrade to the specified version, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa upgrade cluster -c <cluster_name_or_id> --control-plane --version <version_number>
----
+
Your hosted control plane is scheduled for an immediate upgrade.

** To schedule an upgrade to the specified version at a future date, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa upgrade cluster -c <cluster_name_or_id> --control-plane --schedule-date=<yyyy-mm-dd> --schedule-time=<HH:mm> --version=<version_number>
----
+
Your hosted control plane is scheduled for an upgrade at the specified time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

.Troubleshooting
* Sometimes a scheduled upgrade does not initiate. See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6648291[Upgrade maintenance canceled] for more information.
