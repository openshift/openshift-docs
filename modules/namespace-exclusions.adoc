[id="namespace-exclusions_{context}"]
= Namespace exclusions

By default, {product-title-short} excludes certain administrative namespaces, such as the `stackrox`, `kube-system`, and `istio-system` namespaces, from enforcement blocking. The reason for this is that some items in these namespaces must be deployed for {product-title-short} to work correctly.

In addition, the {product-title-short} admission controller bypasses requests that originate from a `service` account in a `system` namespace. Consider this factor when deploying the CI/CD tool of your choice.
