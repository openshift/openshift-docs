[id="namespace-exclusions_{context}"]
= Namespace exclusions from admission controller enforcement

[role="_abstract"]
By default, {rh-rhacs-first} excludes certain administrative namespaces from from the validating webhook configurations in the admission controller. Policy evaluation and enforcement is not performed on review requests originating from these administrative namespaces. Some items in these namespaces must be deployed for {product-title-short} to work correctly so they are excluded. 

In addition to excluding namespaces, the {product-title-short} admission controller bypasses requests that originate from from a Kubernetes `ServiceAccount` in a system namespace. 
[NOTE]
====
Consider this factor when choosing the namespace to deploy your continuous deployment tool of choice.
====

The following namespaces are excluded by default:

* `stackrox`
* `kube-system`
* `kube-public`
* `istio-system`

For Helm installations on Kubernetes secured clusters, you can customize the namespaces that are excluded from the validating webhook configuration by configuring the `values-public.yaml` file. In the `admissionControl.namespaceSelector` field, you can specify the namespaces that you want to exclude. See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
...
admissionControl:
   namespaceSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: namespace.metadata.stackrox.io/name
      operator: NotIn
      values:
        - stackrox
        - kube-system
        - kube-public
        - istio-system
        - example-namespace
...
----
where:

example-namespace::
Signifies the namespace that you want to exclude.
