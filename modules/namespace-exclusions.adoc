= Namespace exclusions from admission controller enforcement

[role="_abstract"]
By default, {product-title-short} excludes certain administrative namespaces, such as the `stackrox`, `kube-system`, and `istio-system` namespaces, from admission controller enforcement blocking. The reason for this is that some items in these namespaces must be deployed for {product-title-short} to work correctly. 

These exclusions mean that API calls for these namespaces are not passed to {product-title-short} for review. Instead of rejecting the `CREATE` verb, the deployment is created and then scaled down using Sensor. 

There are two places where excluded namespaces are defined:

* The configuration of the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`
* The {product-title-short} code that defines "system" namespaces

The following namespaces are excluded:

* `stackrox`
* `kube.*`
* `kube-system`
* `kube-public`
* `istio-system`
* `openshift.*`
* `redhat.*`

In addition to excluding namespaces, the {product-title-short} admission controller bypasses requests that originate from a `service` account in a `system` namespace. Consider this factor when deploying the CI/CD tool of your choice.
