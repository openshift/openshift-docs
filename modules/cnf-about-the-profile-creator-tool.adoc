= About the Performance Profile Creator

[role="_abstract"]
The Performance Profile Creator (PPC) is a command-line tool delivered with the Node Tuning Operator that helps you tune nodes for low latency. By combining existing cluster data with user-supplied configurations, the PPC generates a performance profile tailored to your specific hardware, topology, and use case.

The PPC processes must-gather data to identify key hardware configurations, which you can then use to define your profile. Key information includes:

* NUMA cell partitioning with the allocated CPU IDs
* Hyper-Threading node configuration

Once generated and applied, the performance profile allows you to restrict CPUs for infrastructure and application containers, configure huge pages, and manage CPU partitions for latency-sensitive processes.

[NOTE]
====
Performance profiles are only applicable to bare-metal environments where the cluster has direct access to hardware. They can be configured for both {sno} and multi-node clusters.
====

To create and apply a performance profile, follow these steps:

1. Create a Machine Config Pool (MCP): Identify the nodes you want to target. For SNO clusters, you must use the master MCP.
2. Gather Cluster Data: Use the `must-gather` command to collect the necessary hardware and topology information.
3. Run the PPC Tool: Use the gathered data and your specific configuration arguments to generate the profile
4. Apply the Profile: Configure the resulting profile for your specific use case and apply it to the cluster.

You can run the PPC by using one of the following methods:

* Run the PPC by using Podman

* Run the PPC by using the wrapper script

[NOTE]
====
Using the wrapper script abstracts some of the more granular Podman tasks into an executable script. For example, the wrapper script handles tasks such as pulling and running the required container image, mounting directories into the container, and providing parameters directly to the container through Podman. Both methods achieve the same result.
