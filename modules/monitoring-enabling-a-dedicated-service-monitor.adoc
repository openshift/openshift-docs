= Enabling a dedicated service monitor

You can configure core platform monitoring to use a dedicated service monitor by configuring the `dedicatedServiceMonitors` key in the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.

.Procedure

. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Add an `enabled: true` key-value pair as shown in the following sample:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    k8sPrometheusAdapter:
      dedicatedServiceMonitors:
        enabled: true <1>
----
<1> Set the value of the `enabled` field to `true` to deploy a dedicated service monitor that exposes the kubelet `/metrics/resource` endpoint.

. Save the file to apply the changes automatically.
+
[WARNING]
====
When you save changes to a `cluster-monitoring-config` config map, the pods and other resources in the `openshift-monitoring` project might be redeployed.
The running monitoring processes in that project might also restart.
