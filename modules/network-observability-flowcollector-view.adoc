= View the FlowCollector resource
You can view and edit YAML directly in the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure
. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster* then select the *YAML* tab. There, you can modify the `FlowCollector` resource to configure the Network Observability operator.

The following example shows a sample `FlowCollector` resource for {product-title} Network Observability operator:

<1> The Agent specification, `spec.agent.type`, must be `EBPF`. eBPF is the only {product-title} supported option.
<2> You can set the Sampling specification, `spec.agent.ebpf.sampling`, to manage resources. Lower sampling values might consume a large amount of computational, memory and storage resources. You can mitigate this by specifying a sampling ratio value. A value of 100 means 1 flow every 100 is sampled. A value of 0 or 1 means all flows are captured. The lower the value, the increase in returned flows and the accuracy of derived metrics. By default, eBPF sampling is set to a value of 50, so 1 flow every 50 is sampled. Note that more sampled flows also means more storage needed. It is recommend to start with default values and refine empirically, to determine which setting your cluster can manage.
<3> The Processor specification `spec.processor.` can be set to enable conversation tracking. When enabled, conversation events are queryable in the web console. The `spec.processor.logTypes` value is `Flows`. The `spec.processor.advanced` values are `Conversations`, `EndedConversations`, or `ALL`. Storage requirements are highest for `All` and lowest for `EndedConversations`.
<4> The Loki specification, `spec.loki`, specifies the Loki client. The default values match the Loki install paths mentioned in the Installing the Loki Operator section. If you used another installation method for Loki, specify the appropriate client information for your install.
<5> The `LokiStack` mode automatically sets a few configurations: `querierUrl`, `ingesterUrl` and `statusUrl`, `tenantID`, and corresponding TLS configuration. Cluster roles and a cluster role binding are created for reading and writing logs to Loki. And `authToken` is set to `Forward`. You can set these manually using the `Manual` mode.
<6> The `spec.quickFilters` specification defines filters that show up in the web console. The `Application` filter keys,`src_namespace` and `dst_namespace`, are negated (`!`), so the `Application` filter shows all traffic that _does not_ originate from, or have a destination to, any `openshift-` or `netobserv` namespaces. For more information, see Configuring quick filters below.
