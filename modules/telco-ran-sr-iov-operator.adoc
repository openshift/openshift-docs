= SR-IOV Operator

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
The SR-IOV Operator provisions and configures the SR-IOV CNI and device plugins.
Both `netdevice` (kernel VFs) and `vfio` (DPDK) devices are supported and applicable to the RAN use models.

Limits and requirements::
* Use {product-title} supported devices
* SR-IOV and IOMMU enablement in BIOS: The SR-IOV Network Operator will automatically enable IOMMU on the kernel command line.
* SR-IOV VFs do not receive link state updates from the PF. If link down detection is needed you must configure this at the protocol level.
* NICs which do not support firmware updates using Secure Boot or kernel lockdown must be pre-configured with sufficient virtual functions (VFs) to support the number of VFs required by the application workload.

[NOTE]
====
You might need to disable the SR-IOV Operator plugin for unsupported NICs using the undocumented `disablePlugins` option.

Engineering considerations::
* SR-IOV interfaces with the `vfio` driver type are typically used to enable additional secondary networks for applications that require high throughput or low latency.

* Customer variation on the configuration and number of `SriovNetwork` and `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` custom resources (CRs) is expected.

* IOMMU kernel command line settings are applied with a `MachineConfig` CR at install time. This ensures that the `SriovOperator` CR does not cause a reboot of the node when adding them.

* SR-IOV support for draining nodes in parallel is not applicable in a {sno} cluster.

* If you exclude the `SriovOperatorConfig` CR from your deployment, the CR will not be created automatically.

* In scenarios where you pin or restrict workloads to specific nodes, the SR-IOV parallel node drain feature will not result in the rescheduling of pods. In these scenarios, the SR-IOV Operator disables the parallel node drain functionality.
