= SR-IOV Operator

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
The SR-IOV Operator provisions and configures the SR-IOV CNI and device plugins.
Both `netdevice` (kernel VFs) and `vfio` (DPDK) devices are supported and applicable to the RAN DU use models.

Limits and requirements::
* Use devices that are supported for {product-title}.
See "Supported devices".
* SR-IOV and IOMMU enablement in host firmware settings: The SR-IOV Network Operator automatically enables IOMMU on the kernel command line.
* SR-IOV VFs do not receive link state updates from the PF.
If link down detection is required you must configure this at the protocol level.

Engineering considerations::
* SR-IOV interfaces with the `vfio` driver type are typically used to enable additional secondary networks for applications that require high throughput or low latency.
* Customer variation on the configuration and number of `SriovNetwork` and `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` custom resources (CRs) is expected.
* IOMMU kernel command line settings are applied with a `MachineConfig` CR at install time.
This ensures that the `SriovOperator` CR does not cause a reboot of the node when adding them.
* SR-IOV support for draining nodes in parallel is not applicable in a {sno} cluster.
* You must include the `SriovOperatorConfig` CR in your deployment; the CR is not created automatically.
This CR is included in the reference configuration policies which are applied during initial deployment.
* In scenarios where you pin or restrict workloads to specific nodes, the SR-IOV parallel node drain feature will not result in the rescheduling of pods.
In these scenarios, the SR-IOV Operator disables the parallel node drain functionality.
* NICs which do not support firmware updates under secure boot or kernel lockdown must be pre-configured with sufficient virtual functions (VFs) to support the number of VFs needed by the application workload.
For Mellanox NICs, the Mellanox vendor plugin must be disabled in the SR-IOV Network Operator.
For more information, see "Configuring an SR-IOV network device".
* To change the MTU value of a virtual function after the pod has started, do not configure the MTU field in the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` CR.
Instead, configure the Network Manager or use a custom systemd script to set the MTU of the physical function to an appropriate value.
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# ip link set dev <physical_function> mtu 9000
----
