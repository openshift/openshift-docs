= Restoring the network

If you want to reconnect a disconnected cluster and pull images from online registries, delete the cluster's ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) objects. Without the ICSP, pull requests to external registries are no longer redirected to the mirror registry.

.Procedure 

. View the ICSP objects in your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get imagecontentsourcepolicy
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                 AGE
mirror-ocp           6d20h
ocp4-index-0         6d18h
qe45-index-0         6d15h
----

. Delete all the ICSP objects you created when disconnecting your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete imagecontentsourcepolicy <icsp_name> <icsp_name> <icsp_name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete imagecontentsourcepolicy mirror-ocp ocp4-index-0 qe45-index-0
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
imagecontentsourcepolicy.operator.openshift.io "mirror-ocp" deleted
imagecontentsourcepolicy.operator.openshift.io "ocp4-index-0" deleted
imagecontentsourcepolicy.operator.openshift.io "qe45-index-0" deleted
----

. Wait for all the nodes to restart and return to the READY status and verify that the `registries.conf` file is pointing to the original registries and not the mirror registries:

.. Log into a node: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----

.. Set `/host` as the root directory within the debug shell:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# chroot /host
----

.. Examine the `registries.conf` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# cat /etc/containers/registries.conf 
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"] <1>
----
<1> The `registry` and `registry.mirror` entries created by the ICSPs you deleted are removed.
