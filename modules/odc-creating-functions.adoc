= Creating a function in the web console

You can create a function from a Git repository by using the *Developer* perspective of the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on the cluster.
* The {pipelines-shortname} Operator is installed on the cluster.
* You have logged in to the {product-title} web console.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* You have created or have access to a Git repository that contains the code for your function. The repostory must contain a `func.yaml` file and use the `s2i` build strategy.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you can create a function by using the web console, a cluster administrator must create the following tasks and pipeline, so that they are available for all namespaces on your cluster.

* Create the `func-s2i` task:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-knative/kn-plugin-func/release-next/pkg/pipelines/resources/tekton/task/func-s2i/0.1/func-s2i.yaml
----

* Create the `func-deploy` task:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-knative/kn-plugin-func/release-next/pkg/pipelines/resources/tekton/task/func-s2i/0.1/func-s2i.yaml
----

* Create the Node.js function pipeline:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-knative/kn-plugin-func/release-next/pkg/pipelines/resources/tekton/task/func-s2i/0.1/func-s2i.yaml
----

.Procedure

. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to *+Add* â†’ *Create Serverless function*. The *Create Serverless function* page is displayed.
. Enter a *Git Repo URL* that points to the Git repository that contains the code for your function.
. In the *Pipelines* section:
.. Select the *Build, deploy and configure a Pipeline Repository* radio button to create a new pipeline for your function.
.. Select the *Use Pipeline from this cluster* radio button to connect your function to an existing pipeline in the cluster.
. Click *Create*.

.Verification

* After you have created a function, you can view it in the *Topology* view of the *Developer* perspective.
