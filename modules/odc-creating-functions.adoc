= Creating a function in the web console

You can create a function from a Git repository by using the *Developer* perspective of the {ocp-product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* Before you can create a function by using the web console, a cluster administrator must complete the following steps:
** Install the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving on the cluster.
** Install the {pipelines-shortname} Operator on the cluster.
** Create the following pipeline tasks so that they are available for all namespaces on the cluster:
+
.func-s2i task
[source,terminal]

$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-knative/kn-plugin-func/serverless-1.31/pkg/pipelines/resources/tekton/task/func-s2i/0.1/func-s2i.yaml
----
+
.func-deploy task
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-knative/kn-plugin-func/serverless-1.31/pkg/pipelines/resources/tekton/task/func-deploy/0.1/func-deploy.yaml

.Node.js function
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-knative/kn-plugin-func/serverless-1.31/pkg/pipelines/resources/tekton/pipeline/dev-console/0.1/nodejs-pipeline.yaml
----

* You must log into the {ocp-product-title} web console.
* You must create a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You must create or have access to a Git repository that contains the code for your function. The repository must contain a `func.yaml` file and use the `s2i` build strategy.
 

.Procedure

. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to *+Add* → *Create Serverless function*. The *Create Serverless function* page is displayed.
. Enter a *Git Repo URL* that points to the Git repository that contains the code for your function.
. In the *Pipelines* section:
.. Select the *Build, deploy and configure a Pipeline Repository* radio button to create a new pipeline for your function.
.. Select the *Use Pipeline from this cluster* radio button to connect your function to an existing pipeline in the cluster.
. Click *Create*.

.Verification

* After you have created a function, you can view it in the *Topology* view of the *Developer* perspective.
