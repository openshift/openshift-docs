= Creating a function in the web console

You can create a function from a Git repository by using the {ocp-product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* Before you can create a function by using the web console, a cluster administrator must complete the following steps:
** Install the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving on the cluster.
** Install the {pipelines-shortname} Operator on the cluster.
** Create the following pipeline tasks so that they are available for all namespaces on the cluster:
+
.func-s2i and func-deploy tasks
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn func tkn-tasks | oc apply -f -
----
+
.Node.js function
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-knative/kn-plugin-func/serverless-1.34/pkg/pipelines/resources/tekton/pipeline/dev-console/0.1/nodejs-pipeline.yaml
----

* You must log into the {ocp-product-title} web console.
* You must create a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You must create or have access to a Git repository that contains the code for your function. The repository must contain a `func.yaml` file and use the `s2i` build strategy.
 

.Procedure

. Navigate to *+Add* â†’ *Create Serverless function*. The *Create Serverless function* page is displayed.
. Enter a *Git Repo URL* that points to the Git repository that contains the code for your function.
. In the *Pipelines* section:
.. Select the *Build, deploy and configure a Pipeline Repository* radio button to create a new pipeline for your function.
.. Select the *Use Pipeline from this cluster* radio button to connect your function to an existing pipeline in the cluster.
. Click *Create*.

.Verification

* After you have created a function, you can view it in the *Topology* view.
