= Metro-DR for {rh-storage-first}

{VirtProductName} supports the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.14/html-single/configuring_openshift_data_foundation_disaster_recovery_for_openshift_workloads/index#metro-dr-solution[Metro-DR solution for {rh-storage}], which provides two-way synchronous data replication between managed {VirtProductName} clusters installed on primary and secondary sites. This solution combines {rh-rhacm-first}, Red{nbsp}Hat Ceph Storage, and {rh-storage} components.

Use this solution during a site disaster to failover applications from the primary to the secondary site, and relocate the applications back to the primary site after restoring the disaster site.

This synchronous solution is only available to metropolitan distance data centers with a 10-millisecond latency or less.

For more information about using the Metro-DR solution for {rh-storage} with {VirtProductName}, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7053115[the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase] or {ibm-title}â€™s {rh-storage} Metro-DR documentation.
