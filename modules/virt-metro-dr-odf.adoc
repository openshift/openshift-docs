= Metro-DR for {rh-storage-first}

[role="_abstract"]
{VirtProductName} supports the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/latest/html-single/configuring_openshift_data_foundation_disaster_recovery_for_openshift_workloads/index#metro-dr-solution[Metro-DR solution for {rh-storage}], which provides two-way synchronous data replication between managed {VirtProductName} clusters installed on primary and secondary sites.

== Metro-DR differences

* This synchronous solution is only available to metropolitan distance data centers with a network round-trip latency of 10 milliseconds or less.
* Multiple disk VMs are supported.
* To prevent data corruption, you must ensure that storage is fenced during failover.

[TIP]
====
Fencing means isolating a node so that workloads do not run on it.
