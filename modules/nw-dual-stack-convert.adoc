= Converting to a dual-stack cluster network

As a cluster administrator, you can convert your single-stack cluster network to a dual-stack cluster network.

[NOTE]
====
After converting to dual-stack networking only newly created pods are assigned IPv6 addresses. Any pods created before the conversion must be recreated to receive an IPv6 address.
====

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider.
* The cluster nodes have IPv6 addresses.

.Procedure

. To specify IPv6 address blocks for the cluster and service networks, create a file containing the following YAML:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
- op: add
  path: /spec/clusterNetwork/-
  value: <1>
    cidr: fd01::/48
    hostPrefix: 64
- op: add
  path: /spec/serviceNetwork/-
  value: fd02::/112 <2>
----
<1> Specify an object with the `cidr` and `hostPrefix` fields. The host prefix must be `64` or greater. The IPv6 CIDR prefix must be large enough to accommodate the specified host prefix.

<2> Specify an IPv6 CIDR with a prefix of `112`. Kubernetes uses only the lowest 16 bits. For a prefix of `112`, IP addresses are assigned from `112` to `128` bits.
--

. To patch the cluster network configuration, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch network.config.openshift.io cluster \
  --type='json' --patch-file <file>.yaml
----
+
--
where:

`file`:: Specifies the name of the file you created in the previous step.
--
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
network.config.openshift.io/cluster patched
----

.Verification

Complete the following step to verify that the cluster network recognizes the IPv6 address blocks that you specified in the previous procedure.

. Display the network configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe network
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
