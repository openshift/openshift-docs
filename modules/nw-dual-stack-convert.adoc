= Converting to a dual-stack cluster network

As a cluster administrator, you can convert your single-stack cluster network to a dual-stack cluster network. After converting to a dual-stack networking, new and existing pods have dual-stack networking enabled.

Converting a single-stack cluster network to a dual-stack cluster network consists of creating patches and applying them to the cluster's network and infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
Each patch operation that changes `clusterNetwork`, `serviceNetwork`, `apiServerInternalIPs`, and `ingressIP` objects triggers a restart of the cluster. Changing the `MachineNetworks` object does not cause a reboot of the cluster.
====

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* The cluster nodes have IPv6 addresses.
* You have configured an IPv6-enabled router based on your infrastructure.

.Procedure

. To specify IPv6 address blocks for the cluster and service networks, create a YAML configuration patch file that has a similar configuration to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- op: add
  path: /spec/clusterNetwork/-
  value: <1>
    cidr: fd01::/48
    hostPrefix: 64
- op: add
  path: /spec/serviceNetwork/-
  value: fd02::/112 <2>
----
<1> Specify an object with the `cidr` and `hostPrefix` fields. The host prefix must be `64` or greater. The IPv6 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) prefix must be large enough to accommodate the specified host prefix.
<2> Specify an IPv6 CIDR with a prefix of `112`. Kubernetes uses only the lowest 16 bits. For a prefix of `112`, IP addresses are assigned from `112` to `128` bits.

. Patch the cluster network configuration by entering the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch network.config.openshift.io cluster \// <1>
  --type='json' --patch-file <file>.yaml
----
<1> Where `file` specifies the name of your created YAML file.
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
network.config.openshift.io/cluster patched
----

. To specify IPv6 Virtual IPs (VIPs) for API and Ingress services for your cluster, create a YAML configuration patch file that has a similar configuration to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- op: add
  path: /spec/platformSpec/baremetal/machineNetworks/- <1>
  value: fd2e:6f44:5dd8::/64
- op: add
  path: /spec/platformSpec/baremetal/apiServerInternalIPs/- <2>
  value: fd2e:6f44:5dd8::4
- op: add
  path: /spec/platformSpec/baremetal/ingressIPs/-
  value: fd2e:6f44:5dd8::5
----
<1> Ensure that you specify an address block for the `machineNetwork` network where your machines operate. You must select both API and Ingress IP addresses for the machine network.
<2> Ensure that you specify each file path according to your platform. The example demonstrates a file path on a bare-metal platform.

. Patch the cluster's infrastructure by entering the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch infrastructure cluster \// <1>
  --type='json' --patch-file <file>.yaml
----
<1> Where `file` specifies the name of your created YAML file.
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
infrastructure/cluster patched
----

.Verification

. Show the cluster network configuration by entering the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe network
----

. Verify the successful installation of the patch on the network configuration by checking that the cluster network configuration recognizes the IPv6 address blocks that you specified in the YAML file.
