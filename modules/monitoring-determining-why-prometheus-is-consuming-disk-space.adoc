= Determining why Prometheus is consuming a lot of disk space

Developers can create labels to define attributes for metrics in the form of key-value pairs. The number of potential key-value pairs corresponds to the number of possible values for an attribute. An attribute that has an unlimited number of potential values is called an unbound attribute. For example, a `customer_id` attribute is unbound because it has an infinite number of possible values.

Every assigned key-value pair has a unique time series. The use of many unbound attributes in labels can result in an exponential increase in the number of time series created. This can impact Prometheus performance and can consume a lot of disk space.

You can use the following measures when Prometheus consumes a lot of disk:

* *Check the number of scrape samples* that are being collected.

* *Check the time series database (TSDB) status in the Prometheus UI* for more information on which labels are creating the most time series. This requires cluster administrator privileges.

* *Reduce the number of unique time series that are created* by reducing the number of unbound attributes that are assigned to user-defined metrics.
+
[NOTE]
====
Using attributes that are bound to a limited set of possible values reduces the number of potential key-value pair combinations.
====
+
* *Enforce limits on the number of samples that can be scraped* across user-defined projects. This requires cluster administrator privileges.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Observe* -> *Metrics*.

. Run the following Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) query in the *Expression* field. This returns the ten metrics that have the highest number of scrape samples:
+
[source,terminal]
----
topk(10,count by (job)({__name__=~".+"}))
----

. Investigate the number of unbound label values assigned to metrics with higher than expected scrape sample counts.
** *If the metrics relate to a user-defined project*, review the metrics key-value pairs assigned to your workload. These are implemented through Prometheus client libraries at the application level. Try to limit the number of unbound attributes referenced in your labels.

** *If the metrics relate to a core {product-title} project*, create a Red Hat support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

. Check the TSDB status in the Prometheus UI.
.. In the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Networking* -> *Routes*.
.. Select the `openshift-monitoring` project in the *Project* list.
.. Select the URL in the `prometheus-k8s` row to open the login page for the Prometheus UI.
.. Choose *Log in with OpenShift* to log in using your {product-title} credentials.
.. In the Prometheus UI, navigate to *Status* -> *TSDB Status*.
