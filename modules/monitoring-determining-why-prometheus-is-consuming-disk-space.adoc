= Determining why Prometheus is consuming a lot of disk space

Labels are used to define attributes for metrics in the form of key-value pairs. A unique time series is created for every key-value pair. Adding many values to labels can result in an exponential increase in the number of time series created. This can impact Prometheus performance and can consume a lot of disk space.

When Prometheus consumes a lot of disk:

* You can *check the number of scrape samples* that are being collected
* You can *reduce the number of unique time series that are created* by reducing the number of unbound attributes that are assigned to user-defined metrics
+
[NOTE]
====
Unbound attributes are those that can contain any possible value. Using attributes that are bound to a limited set of possible values reduces the number of potential key-value pair combinations.
====
+
* Cluster administrators can *enforce limits on the number of samples that can be scraped* across user-defined projects

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Monitoring* -> *Metrics*.

. Run the following Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) query in the *Expression* field. This returns the ten metrics that have the highest number of scrape samples:
+
[source,terminal]
----
topk(10,count by (job)({__name__=~".+"}))
----

. Investigate the number of unbound label values assigned to metrics with higher than expected scrape sample counts.
** *If the metrics relate to a user-defined project*, review the metrics key-value pairs assigned to your workload. These are implemented through Prometheus client libraries at the application level. Try to limit the number of unbound attributes referenced in your labels.

** *If the metrics relate to a core {product-title} project*, create a Red Hat support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].
