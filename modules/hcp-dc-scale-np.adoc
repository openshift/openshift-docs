= Scaling up the node pool

After you create the bare metal hosts, their statuses change from `Registering` to `Provisioning` to `Provisioned`. The nodes start with the `LiveISO` of the agent and a default pod that is named `agent`. That agent is responsible for receiving instructions from the Assisted Service Operator to install the {product-title} payload.

.Procedure

. To scale up the node pool, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> scale nodepool <hosted_cluster_name> --replicas 3
----
+
where:

* `<hosted_cluster_namespace>` is the name of the hosted cluster namespace.
* `<hosted_cluster_name>` is the name of the hosted cluster.

. After the scaling process is complete, notice that the agents are assigned to a hosted cluster:

. Also notice that the node pool replicas are set:

Replace `4.x.y` with the supported {product-title} version that you want to use.

. Wait until the nodes join the cluster. During the process, the agents provide updates on their stage and status.
