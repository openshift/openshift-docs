= Connect an event source to a function

Functions are deployed as Knative services on an {ocp-product-title} cluster. When you create an event source by using the {ocp-product-title} web console, you can specify a deployed function that events are sent to from that source.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Serving, and Knative Eventing are installed on your {ocp-product-title} cluster.
* You have logged in to the web console.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have created and deployed a function.

.Procedure

. Create an event source of any type, by navigating to *+Add* -> *Event Source* and selecting the event source type that you want to create.

. In the *Target* section of the *Create Event Source* form view, select your function in the *Resource* list.

. Click *Create*.

.Verification

You can verify that the event source was created and is connected to the function by viewing the *Topology* page.

. Navigate to *Topology*.

. View the event source and click the connected function to see the function details in the right panel.
