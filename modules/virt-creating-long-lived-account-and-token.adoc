QUESTION: Would adding the instructions/copying the sample file from the Early Access Test Plan be appropriate here? Alexander, you mention this in the PR's comments:
We should explain how to create a Service Account (SA), and how to create a longer lived token associated with that SA. The hard part will be to define the RBAC needed for this Service Account. In our examples we use a cluster admin, but it may make sense to limit that.
