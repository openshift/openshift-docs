= Sample performance profile

This example YAML shows a performance profile created by using the performance profile creator (PPC) tool: 

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
  name: performance
spec:
  cpu:
    isolated: "3"
    reserved: 0-2
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: "" <1>
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
  numa:
    topologyPolicy: single-numa-node <2>
  realTimeKernel:
    enabled: true
  workloadHints:
    highPowerConsumption: true
    perPodPowerManagement: false
    realTime: true

<1> This should match the `MachineConfigPool` that you want to configure the NUMA Resources Operator on. For example, you might have created a `MachineConfigPool` named `worker-cnf` that designates a set of nodes that run telecommunications workloads.
<2> The `topologyPolicy` must be set to `single-numa-node`. Ensure that this is the case by setting the `topology-manager-policy` argument to `single-numa-node` when running the PPC tool.
