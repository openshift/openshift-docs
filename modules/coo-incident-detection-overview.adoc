= {coo-full} incident detection overview

Clusters can generate significant volumes of monitoring data, making it hard for you to distinguish critical signals from noise.
Single incidents can trigger a cascade of alerts, and this results in extended time to detect and resolve issues.

The {coo-full} incident detection feature groups related alerts into *incidents*. These incidents are then visualized as timelines that are color-coded by severity.
Alerts are mapped to specific components, grouped by severity, helping you to identify root causes by focusing on high impact components first.
You can then drill down from the incident timelines to individual alerts to determine how to fix the underlying issue.

{coo-full} incident detection transforms the alert storm into clear steps for faster understanding and resolution of the incidents that occur on your clusters.
