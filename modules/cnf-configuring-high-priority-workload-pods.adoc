= Disabling power saving mode for high priority pods

You can configure pods to ensure that high priority workloads are unaffected when you configure power saving for the node that the workloads run on.

When you configure a node with a power saving configuration, you must configure high priority workloads with performance configuration at the pod level, which means that the configuration applies to all the cores used by the pod.

By disabling P-states and C-states at the pod level, you can configure high priority workloads for best performance and lowest latency.

|===
| Annotation | Possible Values | Description

|`cpu-c-states.crio.io:` a|  * `"enable"`
* `"disable"`
* `"max_latency:microseconds"` | This annotation allows you to enable or disable C-states for each CPU. Alternatively, you can also specify a maximum latency in microseconds for the C-states. For example, enable C-states with a maximum latency of 10 microseconds with the setting `cpu-c-states.crio.io`: `"max_latency:10"`. Set the value to `"disable"` to provide the best performance for a pod.

| `cpu-freq-governor.crio.io:` | Any supported `cpufreq governor`. | Sets the `cpufreq` governor for each CPU. The `"performance"` governor is recommended for high priority workloads.
|===

.Prerequisites

* You have configured power saving in the performance profile for the node where the high priority workload pods are scheduled.

.Procedure

. Add the required annotations to your high priority workload pods. The annotations override the `default` settings.
