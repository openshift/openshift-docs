= Registering and Configuring Alibaba Cloud Domain

To install {product-title}, the Alibaba Cloud account you use must have a dedicated public hosted zone in your account. This zone must be authoritative for the domain. This service provides cluster DNS resolution and name lookup for external connections to the cluster.

.Procedure

. Identify your domain, or subdomain, and registrar. You can transfer an existing domain and registrar or obtain a new one through Alibaba Cloud or another source.

[NOTE]
====
If you purchase a new domain through Alibaba Cloud, it takes time for the relevant DNS changes to propagate. For more information about purchasing domains through Alibaba Cloud, see link:https://www.alibabacloud.com/domain[Alibaba Cloud domains].
====

. If you are using an existing domain and registrar, migrate its DNS to Alibaba Cloud. See link:https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/42479.htm[Domain name transfer]
in the Alibaba Cloud documentation.

. Configure DNS for your domain. This includes:
