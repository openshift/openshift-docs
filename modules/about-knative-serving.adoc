= Knative Serving

Knative Serving supports developers who want to create, deploy, and manage link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps[cloud-native applications]. It provides a set of objects as Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) that define and control the behavior of serverless workloads on an {product-title} cluster.

Developers use these CRDs to create custom resource (CR) instances that can be used as building blocks to address complex use cases. For example:

* Rapidly deploying serverless containers.
* Automatically scaling pods.
