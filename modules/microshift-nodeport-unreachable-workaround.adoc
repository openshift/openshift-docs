= Manually restarting the `ovnkube-master` pod to resume node port traffic

After you install {product-title}, NodePort service traffic might stop. To troubleshoot this issue, manually restart the `ovnkube-master` pod in the `openshift-ovn-kubernetes` namespace.

.Prerequisites

* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.
* A cluster installed on infrastructure configured with the Open Virtual Network (OVN)-Kubernetes network plugin.
* Access to the `kubeconfig` file.
* The KUBECONFIG environment variable is set.

.Procedure

Run the commands listed in each step that follows to restore the `NodePort` service traffic after you install{product-title}:

. Find the name of the ovn-master pod that you want to restart by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ pod=$(oc get pods -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes | grep ovnkube-master | awk -F " " '{print $1}')
----

. Force a restart of the of the ovnkube-master pod by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes delete pod $pod
----

. Optional: To confirm that the ovnkube-master pod restarted, run the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes
----
If the pod restarted, the listing of the running pods shows a different ovnkube-master pod name and age consistent with the procedure you just completed.

. Verify that the `NodePort` service can now be reached.
