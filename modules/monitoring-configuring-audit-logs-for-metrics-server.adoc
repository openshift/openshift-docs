= Configuring audit logs for Metrics Server

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure audit logs for Metrics Server to help you troubleshoot issues with the server. 
Audit logs record the sequence of actions in a cluster. It can record user, application, or control plane activities.

You can configure audit log rules to record specific events and a subset of associated data. The following audit profiles define configuration rules:

* `Metadata` (default): This profile logs event metadata including user, timestamps, resource, and verb. It does not record request and response bodies.
* `Request`: This profile logs event metadata and request body, but it does not record response body. This configuration does not apply to non-resource requests.
* `RequestResponse`: This profile logs event metadata, and request and response bodies. This configuration does not apply to non-resource requests.
* `None`: None of the previously described events are recorded.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Add audit log configuration for Metrics Server under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    metricsServer:
      audit:
        profile: <audit_log_profile>
----
+
where:

`<audit_log_profile>`::
Specifies the audit profile for Metrics Server.

. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are automatically redeployed.

.Verification

* Verify that the audit profile is applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring get deploy metrics-server -o yaml | grep -- '--audit-policy-file=*'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
        - --audit-policy-file=/etc/audit/request-profile.yaml
----
