= Running the cluster capacity tool on the command line

You can run the {product-title} cluster capacity tool from the command line
to estimate the number of pods that can be scheduled onto your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Download and install link:https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cluster-capacity[the *cluster-capacity* tool].

* Create a sample `Pod` spec file, which the tool uses for estimating resource usage. The `podspec` specifies its resource
requirements as `limits` or `requests`. The cluster capacity tool takes the
pod's resource requirements into account for its estimation analysis.
+
An example of the `Pod` spec input is:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: small-pod
  labels:
    app: guestbook
    tier: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: php-redis
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend:v4
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 150m
        memory: 100Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 150m
        memory: 100Mi
----


.Procedure

To use the tool on the command line: 

. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./cluster-capacity --kubeconfig <path-to-kubeconfig> \ <1>
    --podspec <path-to-pod-spec> <2>
----
<1> Specify the path to your Kubernetes configuration file.
<2> Specify the path to the sample `Pod` spec file
+
You can also add the `--verbose` option to output a detailed description of how
many pods can be scheduled on each node in the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./cluster-capacity --kubeconfig <path-to-kubeconfig> \
    --podspec <path-to-pod-spec> --verbose
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
small-pod pod requirements:
	- CPU: 150m
	- Memory: 100Mi

The cluster can schedule 52 instance(s) of the pod small-pod.

Termination reason: Unschedulable: No nodes are available that match all of the
following predicates:: Insufficient cpu (2).

Pod distribution among nodes:
small-pod
	- 192.168.124.214: 26 instance(s)
	- 192.168.124.120: 26 instance(s)
----
+
In the above example, the number of estimated pods that can be scheduled onto
the cluster is 52.
