= Creating nodes in the {oda} environment

[role="_abstract"]
Before creating and booting the Agent ISO in your {oda-first} environment, create control plane nodes and worker nodes in the environment.

////
The steps below are based on the Oracle PDF where you create nodes using scripts they provide. However, the scripts mention the discover ISO for Assisted and therefore don't seem to apply for the Agent Installer. Should there be different steps here for creating these nodes if you're doing an Agent installation?

.Procedure

. Run the script to create control plane nodes as described in section 3.4 of the link:https://www.oracle.com/a/otn/docs/red-hat-openshift-container-platform-4-19.pdf[Red{nbsp}Hat {product-title} on {oda} Deployment Guide] (Oracle documentation).

. Run the script to create worker nodes as described in section 3.5 of the link:https://www.oracle.com/a/otn/docs/red-hat-openshift-container-platform-4-19.pdf[Red{nbsp}Hat {product-title} on {oda} Deployment Guide] (Oracle documentation).

. Update the MAC address for each node as described in section 3.6 of the link:https://www.oracle.com/a/otn/docs/red-hat-openshift-container-platform-4-19.pdf[Red{nbsp}Hat {product-title} on {oda} Deployment Guide] (Oracle documentation).
