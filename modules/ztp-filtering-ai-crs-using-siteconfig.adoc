= Filtering custom resources using SiteConfig filters

By using filters, you can easily customize `SiteConfig` custom resources (CRs) to include or exclude other CRs for use in the installation phase of the {ztp-first} pipeline.

You can specify an `inclusionDefault` value of `include` or `exclude` for the `SiteConfig` CR, along with a list of the specific `extraManifest` RAN CRs that you want to include or exclude. Setting `inclusionDefault` to `include` makes the {ztp} pipeline apply all the files in `/source-crs/extra-manifest` during installation. Setting `inclusionDefault` to `exclude` does the opposite.

You can exclude individual CRs from the `/source-crs/extra-manifest` folder that are otherwise included by default. The following example configures a custom {sno} `SiteConfig` CR to exclude the `/source-crs/extra-manifest/03-sctp-machine-config-worker.yaml` CR at installation time.

Some additional optional filtering scenarios are also described.

.Prerequisites

* You configured the hub cluster for generating the required installation and policy CRs.

* You created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the Argo CD application.

.Procedure

. To prevent the {ztp} pipeline from applying the `03-sctp-machine-config-worker.yaml` CR file, apply the following YAML in the `SiteConfig` CR:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1
kind: SiteConfig
metadata:
  name: "site1-sno-du"
  namespace: "site1-sno-du"
spec:
  baseDomain: "example.com"
  pullSecretRef:
    name: "assisted-deployment-pull-secret"
  clusterImageSetNameRef: "openshift-{product-version}"
  sshPublicKey: "<ssh_public_key>"
  clusters:
- clusterName: "site1-sno-du"
  extraManifests:
    filter:
      exclude:
        - 03-sctp-machine-config-worker.yaml
----
+
The {ztp} pipeline skips the `03-sctp-machine-config-worker.yaml` CR during installation. All other CRs in `/source-crs/extra-manifest` are applied.

. Save the `SiteConfig` CR and push the changes to the site configuration repository.
+
The {ztp} pipeline monitors and adjusts what CRs it applies based on the `SiteConfig` filter instructions.

. Optional: To prevent the {ztp} pipeline from applying all the `/source-crs/extra-manifest` CRs during cluster installation, apply the following YAML in the `SiteConfig` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- clusterName: "site1-sno-du"
  extraManifests:
    filter:
      inclusionDefault: exclude
----

. Optional: To exclude all the `/source-crs/extra-manifest` RAN CRs and instead include a custom CR file during installation, edit the custom `SiteConfig` CR to set the custom manifests folder and the `include` file, for example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
clusters:
- clusterName: "site1-sno-du"
  extraManifestPath: "<custom_manifest_folder>" <1>
  extraManifests:
    filter:
      inclusionDefault: exclude  <2>
      include:
        - custom-sctp-machine-config-worker.yaml
----
<1> Replace `<custom_manifest_folder>` with the name of the folder that contains the custom installation CRs, for example, `user-custom-manifest/`.
<2> Set `inclusionDefault` to `exclude` to prevent the {ztp} pipeline from applying the files in `/source-crs/extra-manifest` during installation.
+
The following example illustrates the custom folder structure:
+
[source,text]
----
siteconfig
  ├── site1-sno-du.yaml
  └── user-custom-manifest
        └── custom-sctp-machine-config-worker.yaml
----
