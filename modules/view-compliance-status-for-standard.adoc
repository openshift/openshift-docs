= Viewing compliance status for a specific standard

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} supports NIST, PCI DSS, NIST, HIPAA, CIS for Kubernetes and CIS for Docker compliance standards.
You can view all the compliance controls for a single compliance standard.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the {product-title-short} portal and open the compliance dashboard by selecting *Compliance* from the navigation menu.
. On the compliance dashboard, look for the *Passing standards across clusters cluster* widget.
. In this widget, click on a standard to view information about all the controls associated with that standard.

[NOTE]
====
Many of the controls in CIS Docker refer to the configuration of the Docker engine on each Kubernetes node. Many CIS Docker controls are also best practices for building and using containers, and {product-title-short} has policies to enforce their use. See "Managing security policies" in "Additional resources" for more information.
