= Troubleshooting BFD issues

The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) implementation that Red Hat supports uses FRRouting (FRR) in a container in the `speaker` pods.
The BFD implementation relies on BFD peers also being configured as BGP peers with an established BGP session.
As a cluster administrator, if you need to troubleshoot BFD configuration issues, you need to run commands in the FRR container.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Display the names of the `speaker` pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n metallb-system pods -l component=speaker
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
NAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
speaker-66bth   4/4     Running   0          26m
speaker-gvfnf   4/4     Running   0          26m
...
----

. Display the BFD peers:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -n metallb-system speaker-66bth -c frr -- vtysh -c "show bfd peers brief"
----
+
.Example output
----
Session count: 2
SessionId  LocalAddress              PeerAddress              Status
=========  ============              ===========              ======
3909139637 10.0.1.2                  10.0.2.3                 up  <.>
----
<.> Confirm that the `PeerAddress` column includes each BFD peer.
If the output does not list a BFD peer IP address that you expected the output to include, troubleshoot BGP connectivity with the peer.
If the status field indicates `down`, check for connectivity on the links and equipment between the node and the peer.
You can determine the node name for the speaker pod with a command like `oc get pods -n metallb-system speaker-66bth -o jsonpath='{.spec.nodeName}'`.
