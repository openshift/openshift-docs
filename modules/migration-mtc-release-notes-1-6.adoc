== Deprecated features

The following features are deprecated:

* {mtc-short} version 1.4 is no longer supported.

[id="known-issues-1-6_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* On {product-title} 3.10, the `MigrationController` pod takes too long to restart. The Bugzilla report contains a workaround. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1986796[*BZ#1986796*])
* `Stage` pods fail during direct volume migration from a classic {product-title} source cluster on IBM Cloud. The IBM block storage plugin does not allow the same volume to be mounted on multiple pods of the same node. As a result, the PVCs cannot be mounted on the Rsync pods and on the application pods simultaneously. To resolve this issue, stop the application pods before migration. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1887526[*BZ#1887526*])
* `MigPlan` custom resource does not display a warning when an AWS gp2 PVC has no available space. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1963927[*BZ#1963927*])
* Block storage for IBM Cloud must be in the same availability zone. See the link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-faq[IBM FAQ for block storage for virtual private cloud].
