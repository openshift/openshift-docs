= Opening the firewall for remote access to the {product-title} cluster

Use the following procedure to open the firewall so that a remote user can access the {product-title} cluster. This procedure must be completed before a workstation user can access the cluster remotely.

For this procedure, `user@microshift` is the user on the {product-title} host machine and is responsible for setting up that machine so that it can be accessed by a remote user on a separate workstation.

* Your account has cluster administration privileges.

.Procedure

* As `user@microshift` on the {product-title} host, open the firewall port for the Kubernetes API server (`6443/tcp`) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[user@microshift]$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=6443/tcp && sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----

.Verification

* As `user@microshift`, verify that {product-title} is running by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[user@microshift]$ oc get all -A
