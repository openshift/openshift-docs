= How Kustomize works with manifests to deploy applications

The `kustomize` configuration management tool is integrated with {microshift-short}. You can use Kustomize and the {oc-first} together to apply customizations to your application manifests and deploy those applications to a {microshift-short} cluster.

* A `kustomization.yaml` file is a specification of resources plus customizations.
* Kustomize uses a `kustomization.yaml` file to load a resource, such as an application, then applies any changes you want to that application manifest and produces a copy of the manifest with the changes overlaid.
* Using a manifest copy with an overlay keeps the original configuration file for your application intact, while enabling you to deploy iterations and customizations of your applications efficiently.
* You can then deploy the application in your {microshift-short} cluster with an `oc` command.

== How {microshift-short} uses manifests
At every start, {microshift-short} searches the following manifest directories for Kustomize manifest files:

* `/etc/microshift/manifests`
* `/etc/microshift/manifests.d/++*++`
* `/usr/lib/microshift/`
* `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/++*++`

{microshift-short} automatically runs the equivalent of the `kubectl apply -k` command to apply the manifests to the cluster if any of the following file types exists in the searched directories:

* `kustomization.yaml`
* `kustomization.yml`
* `Kustomization`

This automatic loading from multiple directories means you can manage {microshift-short} workloads with the flexibility of having different workloads run independently of each other.
