= How manifests work with kustomize

The `kustomize` configuration management tool is integrated with {product-title}. At every start, {product-title} searches the `/etc/microshift/manifests` and `/usr/lib/microshift/` manifest directories for a `kustomization.yaml` file. If it finds one, {product-title} automatically runs the equivalent of the `kubectl apply -k` command to apply the identified manifests to the cluster.
