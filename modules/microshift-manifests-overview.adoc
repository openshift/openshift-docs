= How manifests work with kustomize

The `kustomize` configuration management tool is integrated with {microshift-short}. At every start, {microshift-short} searches the `/etc/microshift/manifests`, `/etc/microshift/manifests.d/++*++`, `/usr/lib/microshift/`, and `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/++*++` manifest directories for a `kustomization.yaml`, `kustomization.yml`, or `Kustomization` file. If it finds one, {microshift-short} automatically runs the equivalent of the `kubectl apply -k` command to apply the identified manifests to the cluster.

Loading from multiple directories allows you to manage {microshift-short} workloads with more flexibility. Different workloads can be independent of each other.
