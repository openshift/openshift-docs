= Cluster notification severity levels

Each cluster notification has an associated severity level to help you identify notifications with the greatest impact to your business. You can filter cluster notifications according to these severity levels in the {hybrid-console}, in the **Cluster history** tab for your cluster.

Red{nbsp}Hat uses the following severity levels for cluster notifications, from most to least severe:

Critical:: Immediate action is required. One or more key functions of a service or cluster is not working, or will stop working soon. A critical alert is important enough to page on-call staff and interrupt regular workflows.
Major:: Immediate action is strongly recommended. One or more key functions of the cluster will soon stop working. A major issue may lead to a critical issue if it is not addressed in a timely manner.
Warning:: Action is required as soon as possible. One or more key functions of the cluster are not working optimally and may degrade further, but do not pose an immediate danger to the functioning of the cluster.
Info:: No action necessary. This severity does not describe problems that need to be addressed, only important information about meaningful or important life cycle, service, or cluster events.
Debug:: No action necessary. Debug notifications provide low-level information about less important lifecycle, service, or cluster events to aid in debugging unexpected behavior.
