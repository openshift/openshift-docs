= Recovering from failure when expanding volumes

If expanding underlying storage fails, the {product-title} administrator
can manually recover the persistent volume claim (PVC) state and cancel
the resize requests. Otherwise, the resize requests are continuously
retried by the controller without administrator intervention.

.Procedure

. Mark the persistent volume (PV) that is bound to the PVC with the
`Retain` reclaim policy. This can be done by editing the PV and changing
`persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy` to `Retain`.
. Delete the PVC. This will be recreated later.
. To ensure that the newly created PVC can bind to the PV marked `Retain`,
manually edit the PV and delete the `claimRef` entry from the PV specs.
This marks the PV as `Available`.
. Re-create the PVC in a smaller size, or a size that can be allocated by
the underlying storage provider.
. Set the `volumeName` field of the PVC to the name of the PV. This binds
the PVC to the provisioned PV only.
. Restore the reclaim policy on the PV.
