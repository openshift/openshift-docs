= Recovering from failure when expanding volumes

If expanding underlying storage fails, the {product-title} administrator can manually recover the persistent volume claim (PVC) state and cancel the resize requests. Otherwise, the resize requests are continuously retried by the controller.

.Procedure

. Mark the persistent volume (PV) that is bound to the PVC with the `Retain` reclaim policy. This can be done by editing the PV and changing `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy` to `Retain`.
. Delete the PVC.
. Manually edit the PV and delete the `claimRef` entry from the PV specs to ensure that the newly created PVC can bind to the PV marked `Retain`. This marks the PV as `Available`.
. Re-create the PVC in a smaller size, or a size that can be allocated by the underlying storage provider.
. Set the `volumeName` field of the PVC to the name of the PV. This binds the PVC to the provisioned PV only.
. Restore the reclaim policy on the PV.
