= Deploying an egress router pod in redirect mode

In _redirect mode_, an egress router pod sets up iptables rules to redirect traffic from its own IP address to one or more destination IP addresses. Client pods that need to use the reserved source IP address must be modified to connect to the egress router rather than connecting directly to the destination IP.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create an egress router pod.

. To ensure that other pods can find the IP address of the egress router pod, create a service to point to the egress router pod, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-1
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
  - name: https
    port: 443
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    name: egress-1
----
+
Your pods can now connect to this service. Their connections are redirected to
the corresponding ports on the external server, using the reserved egress IP
address.
