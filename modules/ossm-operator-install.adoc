= Installing the Operators

The Service Mesh installation process introduces an Operator to manage the installation of the control plane within the `istio-operator` namespace. This Operator defines and monitors a custom resource related to the deployment, update, and deletion of the control plane.

You must install the Jaeger Operator and the Kiali Operator before the Service Mesh Operator can install the control plane.
