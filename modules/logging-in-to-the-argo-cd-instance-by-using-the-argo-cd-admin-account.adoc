= Logging in to the Argo CD instance by using the Argo CD admin account

{gitops-title} automatically creates a ready-to-use Argo CD instance that is available in the `openshift-gitops` namespace. Optionally, you can create a new Argo CD instance to manage cluster configurations or deploy applications.

Use the Argo CD admin account to log in to the default ready-to-use Argo CD instance or the newly installed and deployed Argo CD instance.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {gitops-title} Operator on your {OCP} cluster.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* to verify that the {gitops-title} Operator is installed.
. Navigate to the {rh-app-icon} menu -> *OpenShift GitOps* -> *Cluster Argo CD*. The login page of the Argo CD UI is displayed in a new window.
. Optional: To log in with your {OCP} credentials, ensure you are a user of the `cluster-admins` group and then select the `LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT` option in the Argo CD user interface.
+
[NOTE]
====
To be a user of the `cluster-admins` group, use the `oc adm groups new cluster-admins <user>` command, where `<user>` is the default cluster role that you can bind to users and groups cluster-wide or locally. 
====
. Obtain the password for the Argo CD instance:
.. Use the navigation panel to go to the *Workloads* -> *Secrets* page.
.. Use the *Project* drop-down list and select the namespace where the Argo CD instance is created.
.. Select the *<argo_CD_instance_name>-cluster* instance to display the password.
.. On the *Details* tab, copy the password under *Data* -> *admin.password*.
. Use `admin` as the *Username* and the copied password as the *Password* to log in to the Argo CD UI in the new window.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot create two Argo CD CRs in the same namespace.
====

[WARNING]
====
Avoid modifying the `argocd-secret` secret that {gitops-shortname} creates, using external secret management solutions such as the External Secrets Operator or Vault plugins. The `openshift-gitops-operator` manages this secret as part of its core functionality. If you modify this secret externally, it can cause reconciliation conflicts, unpredictable behavior, or disruption of Argo CD instances and {gitops-shortname} workflows. To maintain consistency and reliability, allow the {gitops-shortname} Operator to exclusively manage the `argocd-secret` secret.
