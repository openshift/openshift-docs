= Logging in to the Argo CD instance by using the Argo CD admin account

[role="_abstract"]
{gitops-title} Operator automatically creates a ready-to-use Argo CD instance that is available in the `openshift-gitops` namespace.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {gitops-title} Operator in your cluster.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators* to verify that the {gitops-title} Operator is installed.
. Navigate to the {rh-app-icon} menu -> *OpenShift GitOps* -> *Cluster Argo CD*. The login page of the Argo CD UI is displayed in a new window.
. Optional: To log in with your {product-title} credentials, ensure you are a user of the `cluster-admins` group and then select the `LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT` option in the Argo CD user interface.
+
[NOTE]
====
To be a user of the `cluster-admins` group, use the `oc adm groups new cluster-admins <user>` command, where `<user>` is the default cluster role that you can bind to users and groups cluster-wide or locally.
====
. To log in with your username and password, obtain the password for the Argo CD instance:
.. In the left panel of the console, use the perspective switcher to switch to the *Developer* perspective.
.. Use the *Project* drop-down list and select the `openshift-gitops` project.
.. Use the left navigation panel to navigate to the *Secrets* page.
.. Select the *openshift-gitops-cluster* instance to display the password.
.. Copy the password.
. Use this password and `admin` as the username to log in to the Argo CD UI in the new window.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot create two Argo CD CRs in the same namespace.
