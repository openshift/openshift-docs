* Before this update, the logging view plugin of the OpenShift Web Console showed only an error text when the LokiStack was not reachable. After this update the plugin shows a proper error message with details on how to fix the unreachable LokiStack. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2874[LOG-2874])
