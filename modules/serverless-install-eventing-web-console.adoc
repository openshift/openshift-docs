= Installing Knative Eventing by using the web console

After you install the {ServerlessOperatorName}, install Knative Eventing by using the {ocp-product-title} web console. You can install Knative Eventing by using the default settings or configure more advanced settings in the `KnativeEventing` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.

. Click *Knative Eventing* in the list of *Provided APIs* for the {ServerlessOperatorName} to go to the *Knative Eventing* tab.

. Click *Create Knative Eventing*.

. In the *Create Knative Eventing* page, you can configure the `KnativeEventing` object by using either the form provided, or by editing the YAML file.

.Verification

. Click on the `knative-eventing` custom resource in the *Knative Eventing* tab. You are automatically directed to the *Knative Eventing Overview* page.
