= Common PostgreSQL persistence configuration

The {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} automatically connects supporting services to the common PostgreSQL server configured in the `spec.persistence` field. 

For rules, the following precedence is applicable:

* If you configure a specific persistence for a supporting service, for example, `services.dataIndex.persistence`, it uses that configuration.
* If you do not configure persistence for a service, the system uses the common persistence configuration from the current platform.

[NOTE]
====
When using a common PostgreSQL configuration, each service schema is automatically set as the `SonataFlowPlatform` name, suffixed with `-data-index-service` or `-jobs-service`, for example, `sonataflow-platform-example-data-index-service`.
