= Viewing IPAddressPool 

As a cluster administrator, you can add address pools to your cluster to control the IP addresses that MetalLB can assign to load-balancer services. This worked example shows how to create an `IPAddressPool` custom resource (CR) and view its status. The advertisement mode is set to L2. 

.Prerequisites

* You have an {product-title} cluster with the MetalLB Operator installed.
* You have at least one MetalLB Custom Resource (CR) instance created.

.Procedure

The `IPAddressPool` CR's status section provides details about IP address allocation from a specific pool.

.Procedure

. Create an IP address pool.

.. Create a file, such as `ipaddresspool.yaml`, with content like the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-l2
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.122.200-192.168.122.220
  autoAssign: true
  avoidBuggyIPs: false
----

.. Apply the configuration for the IP address pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ipaddresspool.yaml
----

. View the status of the IP address pool by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ipaddresspool doc-example-l2 -n metallb-system -o yaml
----
+
.Example output:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"metallb.io/v1beta1","kind":"IPAddressPool","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"doc-example-l2","namespace":"metallb-system"},"spec":{"addresses":["192.168.122.200-192.168.122.220"],"autoAssign":true,"avoidBuggyIPs":false}}
  creationTimestamp: "2025-07-17T10:13:37Z"
  generation: 1
  name: doc-example-l2
  namespace: metallb-system
  resourceVersion: "29080"
  uid: 8df1c303-03ac-4d31-8970-6dacdb173dc2
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.122.200-192.168.122.220
  autoAssign: true
  avoidBuggyIPs: false
status: 
  assignedIPv4: 0 <1>
  assignedIPv6: 0 <2>
  availableIPv4: 21 <3>
  availableIPv6: 0 <4>
----
<1> This integer represents the total number of IPv4 addresses that have been successfully assigned by MetalLB from this pool to LoadBalancer services.
<2> This integer represents the total number of IPv6 addresses that have been successfully assigned by MetalLB from this pool to LoadBalancer services.
<3> This integer indicates the total number of IPv4 addresses remaining and available for assignment within this pool. This value is calculated by subtracting assignedIPv4 from the total theoretical IPv4 addresses in the spec.addresses ranges, potentially accounting for avoidBuggyIPs if enabled.
<4> This integer indicates the total number of IPv6 addresses remaining and available for assignment within this pool. This value is calculated similarly to availableIPv4, based on the total theoretical IPv6 addresses in the spec.addresses ranges.

. Create a L2Advertisement for Layer 2 mode with the following sample YAML:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: l2advertisement
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
  - doc-example-l2
----

.. Apply the configuration for the L2 advertisement:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f l2advertisement.yaml
----

. Deploy an application and expose it with a LoadBalancer service.

.. Create a file, such as `nginx.yaml`, with the following content to deploy an Nginx application:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
----    

.. Apply the configuration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f nginx.yaml
----

.. Expose the deployment as a LoadBalancer service by creating a file, such as `nginx-service.yaml`, with content like the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
  namespace: metallb-system # Or the namespace where your deployment is
  annotations:
    metallb.universe.tf/address-pool: doc-example-l2 # Explicitly tells MetalLB to use your specific IPAddressPool
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx # Must match the labels of your deployment
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
----

.. Apply the service configuration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f nginx-service.yaml
----

. View the updated `IPAddressPool` status to see the assigned and available IP addresses by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ipaddresspool doc-example-l2 -n metallb-system -o yaml
----
+
.Example output:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"metallb.io/v1beta1","kind":"IPAddressPool","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"doc-example-l2","namespace":"metallb-system"},"spec":{"addresses":["192.168.122.200-192.168.122.220"],"autoAssign":true,"avoidBuggyIPs":false}}

  uid: 8df1c303-03ac-4d31-8970-6dacdb173dc2
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.122.200-192.168.122.220
  autoAssign: true
  avoidBuggyIPs: false
status:
  assignedIPv4: 1 <1>
  assignedIPv6: 0
  availableIPv4: 20
  availableIPv6: 0
----
<1> This value indicates that one IPv4 address from this pool has been successfully assigned by MetalLB to your `nginx-service` LoadBalancer. This confirms that MetalLB has allocated an IP and it is in use.
