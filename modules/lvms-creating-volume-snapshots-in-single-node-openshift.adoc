= Creating volume snapshots in {sno}

You can create volume snapshots based on the available capacity of the thin pool and the overprovisioning limits.
{lvms} creates a `VolumeSnapshotClass` with the `lvms-<deviceclass-name>` name.

.Prerequisites

* You ensured that the persistent volume claim (PVC) is in `Bound` state. This is required for a consistent snapshot.
* You stopped all the I/O to the PVC before taking the snapshot.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {sno} for which you need to run the `oc` command.
. Save the following YAML to a file with a name such as `lvms-vol-snapshot.yaml`.

.Example YAML to create a volume snapshot
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
    name: lvm-block-1-snap
spec:
    volumeSnapshotClassName: lvms-vg1
    source:
        persistentVolumeClaimName: lvm-block-1
----

. Create the snapshot by running the following command in the same namespace as the PVC:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc create -f lvms-vol-snapshot.yaml
----

A read-only copy of the PVC is created as a volume snapshot.
