You can install {rh-rhacs-first} by configuring and deploying the provided Helm charts. This process involves installing the `central-services` chart to set up Central and Scanner, followed by the `secured-cluster-services` chart to deploy per-cluster components like the Sensor and Collector. Follow this workflow to ensure you generate the necessary init bundles and correctly register your clusters.

High-level installation flow:

. Add the {rh-rhacs-first} Helm chart repository.
. Configure the `central-services` Helm chart.
. Install the `central-services` Helm chart to install the Central and Scanner.
. Generate an init bundle or cluster registration secret (CRS).
. Configure the `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart.
. Install the `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart to install the per-cluster and per-node components, such as, Sensor, Admission controller, Collector, and Scanner-slim.
