=== Known issues

These are the known issues in {coo-full} 1.2.1:

* The installation of the incident detection feature could fail intermittently. The symptoms include the incident detection UI being visible but not including any data. In addition, the health-analyzer `ServiceMonitor` resource is in a failed state, with the error message `tls: failed to verify certificate: x509`.  You can resolve this issue by upgrading to 1.2.2 and recreating the monitoring UI plugin. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1062[COO-1062])

* When installing version 1.2.1 or when upgrading from version 1.2.0, the monitoring plugin's `UIPlugin` resource can be corrupted. This occurs when you have also deployed distributed tracing, the troubleshooting panel, and Advance Cluster Management (ACM), together with the monitoring UI plugin. You can resolve this issue by recreating the UI plugin. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1051[COO-1051])
