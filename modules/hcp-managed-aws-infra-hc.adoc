= Infrastructure requirements for an {aws-short} account in a hosted cluster

When your infrastructure is managed by {hcp} in a hosted cluster {aws-first} account, the infrastructure requirements differ depending on whether your clusters are public, private, or a combination.

For accounts with public clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Node pools must have EC2 instances that have `Role` and `RolePolicy` defined.

For accounts with private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* One private link endpoint for each availability zone
* EC2 instances for node pools

For accounts with public and private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* One private link endpoint for each availability zone
* EC2 instances for node pools
