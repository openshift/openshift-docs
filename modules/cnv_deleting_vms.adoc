[[deletevm]]
=== Deleting virtual machines and virtual machine PVCs 

When you delete a virtual machine, the PVC it uses is unbound. If you
do not plan to bind this PVC to a different VM, delete it, too.

You can only delete objects in the project you are currently working in,
unless you specify the `-n <project_name>` option.
