= Running the Container Security Operator

You can start the Container Security Operator from the {product-title}
web console by selecting and installing that Operator from the Operator Hub,
as described here.

.Prerequisites

* Have administrator privileges to the {product-title} cluster
* Have containers that come from a Red Hat Quay or Quay.io registry running on your cluster

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* and select *Security*.

. Select the *Container Security* Operator, then select *Install*
to go to the Create Operator Subscription page.

. Check the settings. All namespaces and automatic approval strategy are selected, by default.

. Select *Install*. The *Container Security* Operator appears after a few moments on the *Installed Operators* screen.

. Optionally, you can add custom certificates to the CSO. In this example, create a certificate
named `quay.crt` in the current directory. Then run the following command to add the cert to the CSO:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic container-security-operator-extra-certs --from-file=quay.crt -n openshift-operators
----

. If you added a custom certificate, restart the Operator pod for the new certs to take effect.

. Open the OpenShift Dashboard (`Home` -> `Overview`). A link to
*Quay Image Security* appears under the status section, with a listing of the number
of vulnerabilities found so far. Select the link to see a *Quay Image Security breakdown*, as shown in the following figure:
+
image:image_security.png[Access image scanning data from {product-title} dashboard]

. You can do one of two things at this point to follow up on any detected vulnerabilities:
+
*  Select the link to the vulnerability. You are taken to the container
registry that the container came
from, where you can see information about the vulnerability. The following
figure shows an example of detected vulnerabilities from a Quay.io registry:
+
image:cso-registry-vulnerable.png[The CSO points you to a registry containing the vulnerable image]
+
* Select the namespaces link to go to the *ImageManifestVuln* screen,
where you can see the name of the selected image
and all namespaces where that image is running.
The following figure indicates that a particular vulnerable image
is running in the `quay-enterprise` namespace:
+
image:cso-namespace-vulnerable.png[View namespaces a vulnerable image is running in]

At this point, you know what images are vulnerable, what
you need to do to fix those vulnerabilities,
and every namespace that the image was run in. So you can:

* Alert anyone running the image that
they need to correct the vulnerability
* Stop the images from running by deleting the deployment
or other object that started the pod that the image is in

Note that if you do delete the pod, it may take several minutes
for the vulnerability to reset on the dashboard.
