= Installing the {op-system-rt-kernel}

Although the real-time kernel is not necessary for low latency workloads, using the {op-system-rtk} can optimize low latency performance. You can install it on a host by using RPM packages, and include it in a {op-system-ostree-first} image deployment.

.Prerequisites

* You have a Red Hat subscription that includes {op-system-rt-kernel}. For example, your host machine is registered and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is attached to a RHEL for Real Time subscription.
* You are using x86_64 architecture.

.Procedure

. Enable the {op-system-rtk} repository by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-9-for-x86_64-rt-rpms
----

. Install the real-time kernel by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y kernel-rt
----

. Query the real-time kernel version by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RTVER=$(rpm -q --queryformat '%{version}-%{release}.%{arch}' kernel-rt | sort | tail -1)
----
+
. Make a persistent change in GRUB that designates the real-time kernel as the default kernel by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo grubby --set-default="/boot/vmlinuz-${RTVER}+rt"
----

. Restart the host to activate the real-time kernel.

.Next steps
. Prepare your {microshift-short} workloads for low latency.
. Optional: Use a blueprint to install the real-time kernel in a {op-system-ostree} image.
