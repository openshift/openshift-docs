= Setting up the CA certificate for {rh-virtualization}

Download the CA certificate from the {rh-virtualization-first} Manager and set it up on the installation machine.

You can download the certificate from a webpage on the {rh-virtualization} Manager or by using a `curl` command.

Later, you provide the certificate to the installation program.

.Procedure

. Download the CA certificate using either of these methods:
** Go to the Manager's webpage and click the *CA Certificate* link. The URL of the Manager's webpage uses this format: `https://<engine-fqdn>/ovirt-engine/`.
** Run the following command:
+
----
$ curl -k 'https://<engine-fqdn>/ovirt-engine/services/pki-resource?resource=ca-certificate&format=X509-PEM-CA' -o /tmp/ca.pem  <1>
----
<1> For `<engine-fqdn>`, specify the fully qualified domain name of the {rh-virtualization} Manager, such as `rhv-env.virtlab.example.com`.

. Add the certificate to the computer using the appropriate method for your operating system:
** For Linux, copy the CA certificate to the directory for server certificates, and update the CA trust. For example:
+
----
$ sudo cp /tmp/ca.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ca.pem
$ update-ca-trust
----
+
** For macOS, double-click the certificate file and use the *Keychain Access* utility to add the file to the *System* keychain.

[NOTE]
====
If you use your own certificate authority, make sure the system trusts it.
