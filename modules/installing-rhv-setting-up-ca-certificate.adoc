= Setting up the CA certificate for {rh-virtualization}

Download the CA certificate from the {rh-virtualization-first} Manager and set it up on the installation machine.

You can download the certificate from a webpage on the {rh-virtualization} Manager or by using a `curl` command.

Later, you provide the certificate to the installation program.

.Procedure

. Use either of these two methods to download the CA certificate:
** Go to the Manager's webpage, `\https://<engine-fqdn>/ovirt-engine/`. Then, under *Downloads*, click the *CA Certificate* link.
** Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -k 'https://<engine-fqdn>/ovirt-engine/services/pki-resource?resource=ca-certificate&format=X509-PEM-CA' -o /tmp/ca.pem  <1>
----
<1> For `<engine-fqdn>`, specify the fully qualified domain name of the {rh-virtualization} Manager, such as `rhv-env.virtlab.example.com`.

. Configure the CA file to grant rootless user access to the Manager. Set the CA file permissions to have an octal value of `0644` (symbolic value: `-rw-r--r--`):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo chmod 0644 /tmp/ca.pem
----
. For Linux, copy the CA certificate to the directory for server certificates. Use `-p` to preserve the permissions:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo cp -p /tmp/ca.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ca.pem
----
. Add the certificate to the certificate manager for your operating system:
** For macOS, double-click the certificate file and use the *Keychain Access* utility to add the file to the *System* keychain.
** For Linux, update the CA trust:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo update-ca-trust
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use your own certificate authority, make sure the system trusts it.
