= Enabling admission controller enforcement in {product-title} version 3.0.54 and older

[role="_abstract"]
You can enable admission controller enforcement from the *Clusters* view when you install Sensor or edit an existing cluster configuration.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
. Select an existing cluster from the list or select *+ New Cluster*.
. In the cluster configuration panel, fill in the details for your cluster.
. Turn on the *Create Admission Controller Webhook* toggle in the *Static Configuration* section.
This setting controls whether Kubernetes or {ocp} is configured to contact {product-title} with `AdmissionReview` requests.
. Red Hat recommends that you only turn on the *Configure Admission Controller Webhook to listen on updates* toggle if you are planning to use the admission controller to enforce on updates.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Configure Admission Controller Webhook to listen on updates* option is only available in {product-title} version 3.0.41 and newer.
====
+
When you keep it turned off, {product-title} creates the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` in a way that causes the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server not to send object update events.
Since the volume of object updates is usually higher than the object creates, leaving this turned off limits the load on the admission control service.
. Turn on the *Enable Admission Controller* toggle in the *Dynamic Configuration* section.
This setting controls whether {product-title} evaluates policies;
if it is disabled, all `AdmissionReview` requests are automatically accepted.
. Configure the following options:
** *Enforce on Updates*: This toggle controls the behavior of the admission control service.
You must have the *Configure Admission Controller Webhook to listen on updates* toggle turned on for this to work.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Enforce on Updates* option is only available in {product-title} version 3.0.41 and newer.
====
** *Timeout*: The maximum time in seconds, {product-title} should wait while evaluating admission review requests.
Use it to set request timeouts when you enable image scanning.
If the image scan runs longer than the specified time, the  {product-title} accepts the request.
Other enforcement options, such as scaling the deployment to zero replicas, are still applied later if the image violates applicable policies.
** *Contact Image Scanners*: Turn on this toggle to enable image scanning.
See information about image scanning before you enable this toggle.
** *Disable Use of Bypass Annotation*: Turn on this toggle to disable bypassing the admission controller.
. Select *Next*.
. In the *Download files* section, select *Download YAML Files and Keys*.
+
[NOTE]
====
When enabling admission controller for an existing cluster, if you make any changes in the:

* *Static Configuration* section, you must download the YAML files and redeploy the Sensor.
* *Dynamic Configuration* section, you can skip downloading the files and deployment, because {product-title} automatically syncs the Sensor and applies the changes.
====
. Select *Finish*.

.Verification
* After you provision a new cluster with the generated YAML, run the following command to verify if admission controller enforcement is set up:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ValidatingWebhookConfiguration <1>
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.
+
.Example output
