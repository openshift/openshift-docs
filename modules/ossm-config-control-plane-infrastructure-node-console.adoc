= Configuring all control plane components to run on infrastructure nodes using the web console

Perform this task if all of the components deployed by the {SMProductShortName} control plane will run on infrastructure nodes. These deployed components include Istiod, Ingress Gateway, and Egress Gateway, and optional applications such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Distributed Tracing.

If the control plane will run on a worker node, skip this task.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator.
* You are logged in as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you are logged in as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the {SMProductName} Operator, and then click *Istio Service Mesh Control Plane*.

. Click the name of the control plane resource. For example, `basic`.

. Click *YAML*.

. Add the `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` fields to the `spec.runtime.defaults.pod` specification in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  runtime:
    defaults:
      pod:
        nodeSelector: <1>
          node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
        tolerations: <2>
        - effect: NoSchedule
          key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
          value: reserved
        - effect: NoExecute
          key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
          value: reserved
----
<1> Ensures that the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` pod is only scheduled on an infrastructure node.
<2> Ensures that the pod is accepted by the infrastructure node for execution.

. Click *Save*.

. Click *Reload*.
