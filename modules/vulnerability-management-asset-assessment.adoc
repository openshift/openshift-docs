= Performing asset assessment

[role="_abstract"]
Performing an assessment of an organization's assets involve the following actions:

* Identifying the assets in your environment
* Scanning these assets to identify known vulnerabilities
* Reporting on the vulnerabilities in your environment to impacted stakeholders

When you install {product-title} on your Kubernetes or {ocp} cluster, it first aggregates the assets running inside of your cluster to help you identify those assets. {product-title-short} allows organizations to perform continuous assessments on their {ocp} and Kubernetes clusters. {product-title-short} provides organizations with the contextual information to prioritize and act on vulnerabilities in their environment more effectively.

Important assets that should be monitored by the organization's vulnerability management process using {product-title-short} include:

* *Components*: Components are software packages that may be used as part of an image or run on a node. Components are the lowest level where vulnerabilities are present. Therefore, organizations must upgrade, modify or remove software components in some way to remediate vulnerabilities.
* *Image*: A collection of software components and code that create an environment to run an executable portion of code. Images are where you upgrade components to fix vulnerabilities.
* *Nodes*: A server used to manage and run applications using OpenShift or Kubernetes and the components that make up the {ocp} or Kubernetes service.

{product-title} groups these assets into the following structures:

* *Deployment*: A definition of an application in Kubernetes that may run pods with containers based on one or many images.
* *Namespace*: A grouping of resources such as Deployments that support and isolate an application.
* *Cluster*: A group of nodes used to run applications using OpenShift or Kubernetes.

{product-title} scans the assets for known vulnerabilities and uses the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data to assess the impact of a known vulnerability.
