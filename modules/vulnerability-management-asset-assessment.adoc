= Perform an assessment of your assets 

[role="_abstract"]

To perform an assessment on an organizations assets users must perform the following steps:

* Identify the assets in your environment
* Scan these assets to identify known vulnerabilites
* Report on the vulnerabilites in your environment to impacted stakeholders

When {product-title} is installed on your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster it first aggregates the assets running inside of your cluster to help you identify those assets.

Important assets that should be monitored by vulnerability management programs using {product-title} include:

* *Components*: Components are software packages that may be used as part of an image or run on a node. Components are the lowest level where vulnerabilites are present. Organizations must upgrade, modify or remove software components in some way to remediate vulnerabilites.
* *Image*: A collection of software components and code that create an environment to run an executable portion of code. Images are where you upgrade components to fix vulnerabilites.
* *Nodes*: A server used to manage and run applications using OpenShift or Kubernetes and the components that make up the OpenShift or Kubernetes service.

These assets are grouped into the following structures:

* *Deployment*: A definition of an application in Kubernetes that may run pods with containers based on one or many images. 
* *Namespace*: A grouping of resources such as Deployments that support and isolate an application. 
* *Cluster*: A group of nodes that are used to run applications using OpenShift or Kubernetes. 

Assets are then scanned for known vulnerabilites and the common vulnerability and exposure data is able to be used to assess the impact of a known vulnerability.
