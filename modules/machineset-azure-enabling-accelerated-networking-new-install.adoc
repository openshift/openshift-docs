= Enabling Accelerated Networking during installation

You can enable Accelerated Networking on Microsoft Azure by adding `acceleratedNetworking` to your machine set YAML file before you install the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have created the `install-config.yaml` file and completed any modifications to it.

ifdef::custom-network[]
* You have created the manifests for your cluster.
endif::custom-network[]

.Procedure

ifndef::custom-network[]
. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> <1>
----
+
<1> `<installation_directory>` specifies the name of the directory that contains the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster.
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
INFO Credentials loaded from the "myprofile" profile in file "/home/myuser/.azure/credentials"
INFO Consuming Install Config from target directory
INFO Manifests created in: installation_directory/manifests and installation_directory/openshift
----
endif::custom-network[]

. Change to the `openshift` directory within the directory that contains the installation program. The `openshift` directory contains the Kubernetes manifest files that define the worker machines. These are the three default machine set files for an Azure cluster:
+
.Machine set files in `openshift` directory listing
[source,terminal]
----
99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-0.yaml
99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-1.yaml
99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-2.yaml
----

. Add the following to the `providerSpec` field in each machine set file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  value:
    ...
    acceleratedNetworking: true <1>
    ...
    vmSize: <azure-vm-size> <2>
    ...
----
+
<1> This line enables Accelerated Networking.
<2> Specify an Azure VM size that includes at least four vCPUs. For information about VM sizes, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes[Microsoft Azure documentation].
