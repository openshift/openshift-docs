= About virtual IP addresses

Keepalived manages a set of virtual IP addresses (VIP). The administrator must make sure that all of these addresses:

* Are accessible on the configured hosts from outside the cluster.
* Are not used for any other purpose within the cluster.

Keepalived on each node determines whether the needed service is running. If it is, VIPs are supported and Keepalived participates in the negotiation to determine which node serves the VIP. For a node to participate, the service must be listening on the watch port on a VIP or the check must be disabled.

[NOTE]
====
Each VIP in the set may end up being served by a different node.
