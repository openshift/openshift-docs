= Scorecard configuration

The scorecard tool uses a configuration that allows you to configure internal plug-ins, as well as several global configuration options. Tests are driven by a configuration file named `config.yaml`, which is generated by the `make bundle` command, located in your `bundle/` directory:

[source,terminal]
----
./bundle
...
└── tests
    └── scorecard
        └── config.yaml

The configuration file defines each test that scorecard can execute. The
following fields of the scorecard configuration file define the test as follows:

[cols="3,7",options="header"]

|Configuration field |Description

|`image`
|Test container image name that implements a test

|`entrypoint`
|Command and arguments that are invoked in the test image to execute a test

|`labels`
