= Scorecard configuration

The scorecard tool uses a configuration file that allows you to configure internal plug-ins, as well as several global configuration options.

[id="osdk-scorecard-config-file_{context}"]
== Configuration file

The default location for the scorecard tool configuration is the `<project_dir>/.osdk-scorecard.*`. The following is an example of a YAML-formatted configuration file:

.Scorecard configuration file
[source,yaml]
----
scorecard:
  output: json
  plugins:
    - basic: <1>
        cr-manifest:
          - "deploy/crds/cache.example.com_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml"
          - "deploy/crds/cache.example.com_v1alpha1_memcachedrs_cr.yaml"
    - olm: <2>
        cr-manifest:
          - "deploy/crds/cache.example.com_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml"
          - "deploy/crds/cache.example.com_v1alpha1_memcachedrs_cr.yaml"
        csv-path: "deploy/olm-catalog/memcached-operator/0.0.3/memcached-operator.v0.0.3.clusterserviceversion.yaml"
----
<1> `basic` tests configured to test two custom resources (CRs).
<2> `olm` tests configured to test two CRs.

Configuration methods for global options take the following priority, highest to lowest:

Command arguments (if available) -> configuration file -> default

The configuration file must be in YAML format. As the configuration file might be extended to allow configuration of all `operator-sdk` subcommands in the future, the scorecard configuration must be under a `scorecard` subsection.

[NOTE]
====
Configuration file support is provided by the `viper` package. For more info on how `viper` configuration works, see the link:https://github.com/spf13/viper/blob/master/README.md[README].

[id="osdk-scorecard-config-args_{context}"]
== Command arguments

While most of the scorecard tool configuration is done using a configuration file, you can also use the following arguments:

.Scorecard tool arguments
[cols="25%,20%,55%",options="header"]
|===
|Flag |Type |Description

|`--bundle`, `-b`
|string
|The path to a bundle directory used for the bundle validation test.

|`--config`
|string
|The path to the scorecard configuration file. The default is `<project_dir>/.osdk-scorecard`. The file type and extension must be `.yaml`. If a configuration file is not provided or found at the default location, the scorecard exits with an error.

|`--output`, `-o`
|string
|Output format. Valid options are `text` and `json`. The default format is `text`, which is designed to be a human readable format. The `json` format uses the JSON schema output format used for plug-ins defined later.

|`--kubeconfig`, `-o`
|string
|The path to the `kubeconfig` file. It sets the `kubeconfig` for internal plug-ins.

|`--version`
|string
|The version of scorecard to run. The default and only valid option is `v1alpha2`.

|`--selector`, `-l`
|string
|The label selector to filter tests on.

|`--list`, `-L`
|bool
|If `true`, only print the test names that would be run based on selector filtering.
|===

[id="osdk-scorecard-config-file-options_{context}"]
== Configuration file options

The scorecard configuration file provides the following options:

.Scorecard configuration file options
[cols="25%,20%,55%",options="header"]
|===
|Option |Type |Description

|`bundle`
|string
|Equivalent of the `--bundle` flag. Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) bundle directory path, when specified, runs bundle validation.

|`output`
|string
|Equivalent of the `--output` flag. If this option is defined by both the configuration file and the flag, the flag value takes priority.

|`kubeconfig`
|string
|Equivalent of the `--kubeconfig` flag. If this option is defined by both the configuration file and the flag, the flag value takes priority.

|`plugins`
|array
|An array of plug-in names.
|===

[id="osdk-scorecard-config-plugins_{context}"]
=== Basic and OLM plug-ins

The scorecard supports the internal `basic` and `olm` plug-ins, which are configured by a `plugins` section in the configuration file.

.Plug-in options
[cols="25%,20%,55%",options="header"]
|===
|Option |Type |Description

|`cr-manifest`
|[]string
|The path(s) for CRs being tested. Required if `olm-deployed` is unset or `false`.

|`csv-path`
|string
|The path to the cluster service version (CSV) for the Operator. Required for OLM tests or if `olm-deployed` is set to `true`.

|`olm-deployed`
|bool
|Indicates that the CSV and relevant CRDs have been deployed onto the cluster by OLM.

|`kubeconfig`
|string
|The path to the `kubeconfig` file. If both the global `kubeconfig` and this field are set, this field is used for the plug-in.

|`namespace`
|string
|The namespace to run the plug-ins in. If unset, the default specified by the `kubeconfig` file is used.

|`init-timeout`
|int
|Time in seconds until a timeout during initialization of the Operator.

|`crds-dir`
|string
|The path to the directory containing CRDs that must be deployed to the cluster.

|`namespaced-manifest`
|string
|The manifest file with all resources that run within a namespace. By default, the scorecard combines the `service_account.yaml`, `role.yaml`, `role_binding.yaml`, and `operator.yaml` files from the `deploy` directory into a temporary manifest to use as the namespaced manifest.

|`global-manifest`
|string
|The manifest containing required resources that run globally (not namespaced). By default, the scorecard combines all CRDs in the `crds-dir` directory into a temporary manifest to use as the global manifest.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Currently, using the scorecard with a CSV does not permit multiple CR manifests to be set through the CLI, configuration file, or CSV annotations. You must tear down your Operator in the cluster, re-deploy, and re-run the scorecard for each CR that is tested.
