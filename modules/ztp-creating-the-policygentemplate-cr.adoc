= Creating the PolicyGenTemplate CR

Use this procedure to create the `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resource (CR) for your site in your local clone of the Git repository.

.Prerequisites

Ensure that policy namespaces meets the following requirements:

* Namespace names must be prefixed with `ztp`. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ztp-common
----

* Namespaces must not match the namespace of a pre-existing cluster.

.Procedure

. Choose an appropriate example from `out/argocd/example/policygentemplates`. This directory demonstrates a three-level policy framework that represents a well-supported low-latency profile tuned for the needs of 5G Telco DU deployments:
+
** A single `common-ranGen.yaml` file that applies to all types of sites.
** A set of shared `group-du-*-ranGen.yaml` files that are common between similar clusters.
** An example `example-*-site.yaml` file that you can copy and update for each individual site.

. Ensure that the labels defined in your `PolicyGenTemplate` `bindingRules` section correspond to the labels that are defined in the `SiteConfig` files of the clusters you are managing.

. Ensure that the content of the overlaid spec files matches your desired end state. As a reference, the `out/source-crs` directory contains the full list of `source-crs` available to be included and overlaid by your `PolicyGenTemplate` templates.
+
[NOTE]
====
Depending on the specific requirements of your clusters, you might need more than a single group policy per cluster type, especially considering that the example group policies each have a single `PerformancePolicy.yaml` file that can only be shared across a set of clusters if those clusters consist of identical hardware configurations.
====

. Define all the policy namespaces in a YAML file similar to the example `out/argocd/example/policygentemplates/ns.yaml` file.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that policy namespaces begin with `ztp` and are unique.
====

. Add all the `PolicyGenTemplate` files and `ns.yaml` file to the `kustomization.yaml` file, similar to the example `out/argocd/example/policygentemplates/kustomization.yaml` file.

. Commit the `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs, `ns.yaml` file, and the associated `kustomization.yaml` file in the Git repository.
