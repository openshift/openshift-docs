= Disabling admission controller enforcement on a cluster

[role="_abstract"]
You can disable admission controller enforcement on a cluster when installing {product-title-short}. For clusters that you did not install by using the Operator or Helm, you can disable admission controller enforcement from the *Clusters* view on the {product-title} ({product-title-short}) portal. 

.Procedure
. For a cluster that was installed by using the Operator, in the `SecuredCluster` custom resource (CR), edit the `admissionControl.enforcement` parameter to `Disabled`.
. For a cluster that was installed by using Helm, in the `values-public.yaml` file, set the `admissionControl.enforce` value to `false` and run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
helm upgrade -n stackrox \
  stackrox-secured-cluster-services rhacs/secured-cluster-services \
  --reuse-values \
  -f /config/yaml/values-public.yaml \
  -f /config/yaml/values-private.yaml
----
. For clusters that are not managed by the Operator or Helm, you can use the {product-title-short} portal to change this setting:
.. In the {product-title-short} portal, select *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
.. Select an existing cluster from the list.
.. In the *Dynamic configuration* section, in the *Admission controller enforcement behavior* field, select one of the following options:
* Enforce policies: The admission controller enforces policies that are configured for enforcement by rejecting the workload admission or update attempt.
* No enforcement: Even if enforcement is configured for a policy, if this option is selected, the admission controller does not enforce the policy and allows workload admission attempts or updates that violate the policy.
.. Select *Next*.
.. Select *Finish*.
