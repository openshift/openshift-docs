= Operator Framework

The Operator Framework is a family of tools and capabilities to deliver on the
customer experience described above. It is not just about writing code; testing,
delivering, and updating Operators is just as important. The Operator Framework
components consist of open source tools to tackle these problems:

Operator SDK::
The Operator SDK assists Operator authors in bootstrapping, building, testing,
and packaging their own Operator based on their expertise without requiring
knowledge of Kubernetes API complexities.

Operator Lifecycle Manager::
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) controls the installation, upgrade, and
role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster. Deployed by default
in {product-title} {product-version}.

Operator Registry::
The Operator Registry stores ClusterServiceVersions (CSVs) and custom resource
definitions (CRDs) for creation in a cluster and stores Operator metadata about
packages and channels. It runs in a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster to provide
this Operator catalog data to OLM.

OperatorHub::
OperatorHub is a web console for cluster administrators to discover and
select Operators to install on their cluster. It is deployed by default in
{product-title}.

Operator Metering::
Operator Metering collects operational metrics about Operators on the cluster for
Day 2 management and aggregating usage metrics.

These tools are designed to be composable, so you can use any that are useful to
you.
