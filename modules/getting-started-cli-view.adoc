= Viewing the application in a web browser

After you have deployed the necessary applications and loaded data into the database, you are now ready view the national parks application through a browser.

You can get the URL for the application by retrieving the route information for the front-end application.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed the `parksmap` front-end application.
* You have deployed the `nationalparks` back-end application.
* You have deployed the `mongodb-nationalparks` database application.
* You have loaded the data into the `mongodb-nationalparks` database.

.Procedure

. Get your route information to retrieve your map application URL by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get route parksmap
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME       HOST/PORT                                                  PATH   SERVICES    PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
parksmap   parksmap-user-getting-started.apps.cluster.example.com            parksmap    8080-tcp   edge          None
----

. From the above output, copy the value in the `HOST/PORT` column.

. Add `https://` in front of the copied value to get the application URL. This is necessary because the route is a secured route.
