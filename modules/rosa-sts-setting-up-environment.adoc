= Setting up the environment for STS

Before you create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS), complete the following steps to set up your environment.

.Prerequisites

* Review and complete the deployment prerequisites and policies.
* Create a link:https://cloud.redhat.com[Red Hat account], if you do not already have one. Then, check your email for a verification link. You will need these credentials to install ROSA.

.Procedure

. Log in to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) account that you want to use.
+
It is recommended to use a dedicated AWS account to run production clusters. If you are using AWS Organizations, you can use an AWS account within your organization or link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-new[create a new one].
+
If you are using AWS Organizations and you need to have a service control policy (SCP) applied to the AWS account you plan to use, these policies must not be more restrictive than the roles and policies required by the cluster.
+
. Enable the ROSA service in the AWS Management Console.
.. Sign in to your link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/home[AWS account].
.. To enable ROSA, go to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/[ROSA service] and select *Enable OpenShift*.

. Install and configure the AWS CLI.
.. Follow the AWS command-line interface documentation to link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html[install] and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html[configure] the AWS CLI for your operating system.
+
Specify the correct `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` in the `.aws/credentials` file. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html[AWS Configuration basics] in the AWS documentation.

.. Set a default AWS region.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use the environment variable to set the default AWS region.
====
+
The ROSA service evaluates regions in the following priority order:
+
... The region specified when running a `rosa` command with the `--region` flag.
... The region set in the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html[Environment variables to configure the AWS CLI] in the AWS documentation.
... The default region set in your AWS configuration file. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config[Quick configuration with aws configure] in the AWS documentation.
.. Optional: Configure your AWS CLI settings and credentials by using an AWS named profile. `rosa` evaluates AWS named profiles in the following priority order:
... The profile specified when running a `rosa` command with the `--profile` flag.
... The profile set in the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html[Named profiles] in the AWS documentation.
.. Verify the AWS CLI is installed and configured correctly by running the following command to query the AWS API:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws sts get-caller-identity
----
+
. Install the latest version of the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).
.. Download the link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-service-aws/[latest release] of the `rosa` CLI for your operating system.
.. Optional: Rename the file you downloaded to `rosa` and make the file executable. This documentation uses `rosa` to refer to the executable file.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ chmod +x rosa
----
.. Optional: Add `rosa` to your path.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mv rosa /usr/local/bin/rosa
----
.. Enter the following command to verify your installation:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

Use "rosa [command] --help" for more information about a command.
----
+
.. Generate the command completion scripts for the `rosa` CLI. The following example generates the Bash completion scripts for a Linux machine:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/rosa
----
.. Source the scripts to enable `rosa` command completion from your existing terminal. The following example sources the Bash completion scripts for `rosa` on a Linux machine:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ source /etc/bash_completion.d/rosa
----

. Log in to your Red Hat account with the `rosa` CLI.
+
.. Enter the following command.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login
----
+
.. Replace `<my_offline_access_token>` with your token.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
To login to your Red Hat account, get an offline access token at https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa
? Copy the token and paste it here: <my-offline-access-token>
----
+
.Example output continued
[source,terminal]
----
I: Logged in as '<rh-rosa-user>' on 'https://api.openshift.com'
----

. Verify that your AWS account has the necessary quota to deploy a ROSA cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify quota [--region=<region>]
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Validating AWS quota...
I: AWS quota ok
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Sometimes your AWS quota varies by region. If you receive any errors, try a different region.
====
+
If you need to increase your quota, go to the link:https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS Management Console] and request a quota increase for the service that failed.
+
After the quota check succeeds, proceed to the next step.
+
. Prepare your AWS account for cluster deployment:
+
.. Run the following command to verify your Red Hat and AWS credentials are setup correctly.  Check that your AWS Account ID, Default Region and ARN match what you expect. You can safely ignore the rows beginning with {cluster-manager} for now.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa whoami
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
