= Setting up the environment for STS

Before you create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS), complete the following steps to set up your environment.

.Prerequisites

* Review and complete the deployment prerequisites and policies.
* Create a link:https://cloud.redhat.com[Red{nbsp}Hat account], if you do not already have one. Then, check your email for a verification link. You will need these credentials to install ROSA.

.Procedure

. Log in to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) account that you want to use.
+
It is recommended to use a dedicated AWS account to run production clusters. If you are using AWS Organizations, you can use an AWS account within your organization or link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-new[create a new one].
+
If you are using AWS Organizations and you need to have a service control policy (SCP) applied to the AWS account you plan to use, these policies must not be more restrictive than the roles and policies required by the cluster.
+
. Enable the ROSA service in the AWS Management Console.
.. Sign in to your link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/home[AWS account].
.. To enable ROSA, go to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/[ROSA service] and select *Enable OpenShift*.

. Install and configure the AWS CLI.
.. Follow the AWS command-line interface documentation to link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html[install] and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html[configure] the AWS CLI for your operating system.
+
Specify the correct `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` in the `.aws/credentials` file. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html[AWS Configuration basics] in the AWS documentation.

.. Set a default AWS region.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use the environment variable to set the default AWS region.
====
+
The ROSA service evaluates regions in the following priority order:
+
... The region specified when running the `rosa` command with the `--region` flag.
... The region set in the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html[Environment variables to configure the AWS CLI] in the AWS documentation.
... The default region set in your AWS configuration file. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config[Quick configuration with aws configure] in the AWS documentation.
.. Optional: Configure your AWS CLI settings and credentials by using an AWS named profile. `rosa` evaluates AWS named profiles in the following priority order:
... The profile specified when running the `rosa` command with the `--profile` flag.
... The profile set in the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html[Named profiles] in the AWS documentation.
.. Verify the AWS CLI is installed and configured correctly by running the following command to query the AWS API:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws sts get-caller-identity
----
+
. Install the latest version of the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).
.. Download the latest release of the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads[ROSA CLI] for your operating system.
.. Optional: Rename the file you downloaded to `rosa` and make the file executable. This documentation uses `rosa` to refer to the executable file.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ chmod +x rosa
----
.. Optional: Add `rosa` to your path.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mv rosa /usr/local/bin/rosa
----
.. Enter the following command to verify your installation:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa
----
+
.Example output

.. Generate the command completion scripts for the ROSA CLI. The following example generates the Bash completion scripts for a Linux machine:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/rosa
----
.. Source the scripts to enable `rosa` command completion from your existing terminal. The following example sources the Bash completion scripts for `rosa` on a Linux machine:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ source /etc/bash_completion.d/rosa
----

. Log in to your Red{nbsp}Hat account with the ROSA CLI.
+
.. Enter the following command.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login
----
+
.. Replace `<my_offline_access_token>` with your token.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
To login to your Red Hat account, get an offline access token at https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa
? Copy the token and paste it here: <my-offline-access-token>
----
+
.Example output continued
[source,terminal]
----
I: Logged in as '<rh-rosa-user>' on 'https://api.openshift.com'
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Validating AWS quota...
I: AWS quota ok
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Sometimes your AWS quota varies by region. If you receive any errors, try a different region.
====
+
If you need to increase your quota, go to the link:https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS Management Console] and request a quota increase for the service that failed.
+
After the quota check succeeds, proceed to the next step.
+
. Prepare your AWS account for cluster deployment:
+
.. Run the following command to verify your Red{nbsp}Hat and AWS credentials are setup correctly.  Check that your AWS Account ID, Default Region and ARN match what you expect. You can safely ignore the rows beginning with {cluster-manager} for now.
