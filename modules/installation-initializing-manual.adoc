= Manually creating the installation configuration file

For installations of {product-title} that use user-provisioned
infrastructure, you must manually generate your installation configuration file.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} installation program and the access token for your
cluster.

.Procedure

. Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets
in:
+
----
$ mkdir <installation_directory>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create a directory. Some installation assets, like bootstrap X.509
certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an
installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another
cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file
names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution
when copying installation files from an earlier {product-title} version.
====

. Customize the following `install-config.yaml` file template and save the
it in the `<installation_directory>`.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must name this configuration file `install-config.yaml`.
====

. Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use it to install
multiple clusters.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `install-config.yaml` file is consumed during the next step of the
installation process. You must back it up now.
