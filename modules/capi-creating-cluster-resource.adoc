= Creating the Cluster API cluster resource

You can create the cluster resource by creating a YAML manifest file and applying it with the {oc-first}.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed an {product-title} cluster.

* You have enabled the use of the Cluster API.

* You have access to the cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

* You have the cluster ID value.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file similar to the following. This procedure uses `<cluster_resource_file>.yaml` as an example file name.

--
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name> # <1>
  namespace: openshift-cluster-api
spec:
  infrastructureRef:
    apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: <infrastructure_kind> # <2>
    name: <cluster_name>
    namespace: openshift-cluster-api
----
<1> Specify the cluster ID as the name of the cluster.
<2> Specify the infrastructure kind for the cluster.
The following values are valid:
+
* `AWSCluster`: The cluster is running on {aws-first}.
* `GCPCluster`: The cluster is running on {gcp-first}.
* `VSphereCluster`: The cluster is running on {vmw-first}.
--

. Create the cluster CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <cluster_resource_file>.yaml
----

.Verification

* Confirm that the cluster CR exists by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cluster
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
NAME             PHASE          AGE    VERSION
<cluster_name>   Provisioning   4h6m
----
+
The cluster resource is ready when the value of `PHASE` is `Provisioned`.
