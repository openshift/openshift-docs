= Creating a project using the web console

If allowed by your cluster administrator, you can create a new project.

[NOTE]
====
Projects starting with `openshift-` and `kube-` are considered critical by {product-title}. As such, {product-title} does not allow you to create Projects starting with `openshift-` using the web console.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot assign an SCC to pods created in one of the default namespaces: `default`, `kube-system`, `kube-public`, `openshift-node`, `openshift-infra`, and `openshift`. You cannot use these namespaces for running pods or services.

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} clusters that use the Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model, you cannot assign an SCC to pods created in one of the default namespaces: `default`, `kube-system`, `kube-public`, `openshift-node`, `openshift-infra`, and `openshift`. You cannot use these namespaces for running pods or services. You cannot create any SCCs for {product-title} clusters that use a Red Hat cloud account, because SCC resource creation requires `cluster-admin` privileges.
