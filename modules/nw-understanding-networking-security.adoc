= Security and traffic management

Administrators can expose applications to external traffic and secure network connections using service types, such as `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, and `LoadBalaner` and API resources such as `Ingress` and `Route`. The Ingress Operator and Cluster Network Operator (CNO) help configure and manage these services and resources. The Ingress Operator deploys and manages one or more Ingress Controllers. These controllers route external HTTP and HTTPS traffic to services within the cluster. A CNO deploys and manages the cluster network components, including pod networks, service networks, and DNS.
