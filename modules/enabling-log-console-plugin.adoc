= Enabling the {log-plug} after you have installed the {clo}

You can enable the {log-plug} as part of the {clo} installation, but you can also enable the plugin if you have already installed the {clo} with the plugin disabled.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrator permissions.
* You have installed the {clo} and selected *Disabled* for the *Console plugin*.
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Click *Red Hat OpenShift Logging*. This takes you to the Operator *Details* page.
. In the *Details* page, click *Disabled* for the *Console plugin* option.
. In the *Console plugin enablement* dialog, select *Enable*.
. Click *Save*.
. Verify that the *Console plugin* option now shows *Enabled*.
. The web console displays a pop-up window when changes have been applied. The window prompts you to reload the web console. Refresh the browser when you see the pop-up window to apply the changes.
