= About live migration

Live migration is the process of moving a running virtual machine instance (VMI) to another node in the cluster without interrupting the virtual workload or access. If a VMI uses the `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy, it automatically migrates when the node that the VMI runs on is placed into maintenance mode. You can also manually start live migration by selecting a VMI to migrate.

You can use live migration if the following conditions are met:

* Virtual machines must have a persistent volume claim (PVC) with a shared `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode to be live migrated.

* The pod network binding must not be of the bridge interface type `()`.

* Ports `49152` and `49153` must be available in the `virt-launcher` pod. If these ports are specified in the `masquerade` interface, live migration does not function.

* Live migration is supported for virtual machines that are attached to an SR-IOV network interface only if the `sriovLiveMigration` feature gate is enabled in the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR). When the `spec.featureGates.sriovLiveMigration` field is set to `true`, the `virt-launcher` pod runs with the `SYS_RESOURCE` capability. This might degrade its security.
