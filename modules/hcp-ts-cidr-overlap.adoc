[id="hcp-ts-cidr-overlap_{context}"]
= Avoiding an overlap between OVN subnets and CIDR values

If the configured OVN subnets overlap with the machine classless inter-domain routing (CIDR), service CIDR, cluster network CIDR, or with each other, an error occurs.

.Procedure

* Use subnets that do not overlap with any network CIDR. You can use a CIDR calculator to verify that no overlaps exist.
