= Importing a service into a federated mesh

Importing services lets you explicitly specify which services exported from another mesh should be accessible within your service mesh.

image::ossm-federation-import-service.png[Service Mesh federation importing service illustration]

You use an `ImportedServiceSet` resource to select services for import. Only services exported by a mesh peer and explicitly imported are available to the mesh. Services that you do not explicitly import are not made available within the mesh.

* You can select services by namespace or name.
* You can use wildcards to select services, for example, to import all the services that were exported to the namespace.
* You can select services for export using a label selector, which may be global to the mesh, or scoped to a specific member namespace.
* You can import services using an alias. For example, you can import the `custom-ns/bar` service as `other-mesh/bar`.
// Need non foo/bar example above
* You can specify a custom domain suffix, which will be appended to the `name.namespace` of an imported service for its fully qualified domain name; for example, `bar.other-mesh.imported.local`.

The following example is for the `green-mesh` importing a service that was exported by `red-mesh`.

|metadata:
  namespace:
|Name of the namespace containing the ServiceMeshPeer resource (the mesh system namespace).
