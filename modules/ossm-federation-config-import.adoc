= Importing a service into a federated mesh

Importing services lets you explicitly specify which services exported from another mesh should be accessible within your service mesh.

image::ossm-federation-import-service.png[Service Mesh federation importing service illustration]

You use an `ImportedServiceSet` resource to select services for import. Only services exported by a mesh peer and explicitly imported are available to the mesh. Services that you do not explicitly import are not made available within the mesh.

* You can select services by namespace or name.
* You can use wildcards to select services, for example, to import all the services that were exported to the namespace.
* You can select services for export using a label selector, which may be global to the mesh, or scoped to a specific member namespace.
* You can import services using an alias. For example, you can import the `custom-ns/bar` service as `other-mesh/bar`.
// Need non foo/bar example above
* You can specify a custom domain suffix, which will be appended to the `name.namespace` of an imported service for its fully qualified domain name; for example, `bar.other-mesh.imported.local`.

The following example is for the `green-mesh` importing a service that was exported by `red-mesh`.

|Parameter |Description |Values
|metadata:
  name:

|metadata:
  namespace:
|Name of the namespace containing the ServiceMeshPeer resource (the mesh system namespace).

|spec:
  importRules:
  - type:
|Type of rule that will govern the import for the service. The first matching rule found for the service will be used for the import.
|`NameSelector`

  - type: NameSelector
    nameSelector:
      namespace:
      name:
|To create a `NameSelector` rule, specify the `namespace` and the `name` of the exported service.

|spec:
  importRules:
  - type: NameSelector
    importAsLocal:
|Set to `true` to aggregate remote endpoint with local services. When `true`, services will be imported as `<name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`

        namespace:
        name:
|To create a `NameSelector` rule that uses an alias for the service, after specifying the `namespace` and `name` for the service, then specify the alias for the `namespace` and the alias to be used for `name` of the service.
