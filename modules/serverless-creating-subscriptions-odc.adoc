= Creating a subscription by using the Developer perspective

After you have created a channel and an event sink, you can create a subscription to enable event delivery. Using the {product-title} web console provides a streamlined and intuitive user interface to create a subscription.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Serving, and Knative Eventing are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* You have logged in to the web console.
* You have created an event sink, such as a Knative service, and a channel.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

.Procedure

. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to the *Topology* page.

. Create a subscription using one of the following methods:

.. Hover over the channel that you want to create a subscription for, and drag the arrow. The *Add Subscription* option is displayed.

+
... Select your sink in the *Subscriber* list.
... Click *Add*.
.. If the service is available in the *Topology* view under the same namespace or project as the channel, click on the channel that you want to create a subscription for, and drag the arrow directly to a service to immediately create a subscription from the channel to that service.

.Verification

* After the subscription has been created, you can see it represented as a line that connects the channel to the service in the *Topology* view:
