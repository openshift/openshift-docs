= Creating subscriptions in the Developer perspective

.Prerequisites
To create subscriptions using the *Developer* perspective, ensure that:

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Serving, and Knative Eventing are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* You have logged in to the web console.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* You have created an event sink, such as a Knative service, and a channel.

.Procedure
. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to the *Topology* page.
. Create a subscription using one of the following methods:
.. Hover over the channel that you want to create a subscription for, and drag the arrow. The *Add Subscription* option is displayed.

+
... Select your sink as a subscriber from the drop-down list.
... Click *Add*.
.. If the service is available in the *Topology* view under the same namespace or project as the channel, click on the channel that you want to create a subscription for, and drag the arrow directly to a service to immediately create a subscription from the channel to that service.


.Verification steps
* After the subscription has been created, you can see it represented as a line that connects the channel to the service in the *Topology* view:

You can view the event source, channel, and subscriptions for the sink by clicking on the service.
