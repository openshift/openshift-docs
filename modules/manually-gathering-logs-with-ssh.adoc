= Manually gathering logs with SSH access to your host(s)

Manually gather logs in situations where `must-gather` or automated collection
methods do not work.

.Prerequisites

* You must have SSH access to your host(s).

.Procedure

. Collect the `bootkube.service` service logs from the bootstrap host using the
`journalctl` command by running:
+
----
$ journalctl -b -f -u bootkube.service
----

. Collect the bootstrap host's container logs using the Podman logs. This is shown
as a loop to get all of the container logs from the host:
+
----
$ for pod in $(sudo podman ps -a -q); do sudo podman logs $pod; done
----

. Alternatively, collect the host's container logs using the `tail` command by
running:
+
----
# tail -f /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay-containers/*/userdata/ctr.log
----

. Collect the `kubelet.service` and `crio.service` service logs from the master
and worker hosts using the `journalctl` command by running:
+
----
$ journalctl -b -f -u kubelet.service -u crio.service
----

. Collect the master and worker host container logs using the `tail` command by
running:
+
----
$ sudo tail -f /var/log/containers/*
----
