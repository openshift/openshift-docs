= Preparing the hub cluster for ZTP

You can configure your hub cluster with a set of ArgoCD applications that generate the required installation and policy custom resources (CR) for each site based on a zero touch provisioning (ZTP) GitOps flow.

.Prerequisites

* Openshift Cluster 4.11 as the hub cluster
* {rh-rhacm-first} Operator 2.5 installed on the hub cluster
* Red Hat OpenShift GitOps Operator 1.5 on the hub cluster

.Procedure

. Install the {cgu-operator-first}, which coordinates with any new sites added by ZTP and manages application of the `PolicyGenTemplate`-generated policies.

. Prepare the ArgoCD pipeline configuration:
+
.. Create a Git repository with the directory structure similar to the example directory. For more information, see "Preparing the ZTP Git repository".

.. Configure access to the repository using the ArgoCD UI. Under *Settings* configure the following:
+
* *Repositories* - Add the connection information. The URL must end in `.git`, for example, `https://repo.example.com/repo.git` and credentials.

* *Certificates* - Add the public certificate for the repository, if needed.

.. Modify the two ArgoCD Applications, `out/argocd/deployment/clusters-app.yaml` and `out/argocd/deployment/policies-app.yaml`, based on your Git repository:
+
* Update the URL to point to the Git repository. The URL must end with `.git`, for example, `https://repo.example.com/repo.git`.

* The `targetRevision` must indicate which Git repository branch to monitor.

* The path should specify the path to the `SiteConfig` or `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs, respectively.

. To patch the ArgoCD instance in the hub cluster by using the patch file previously extracted into the `out/argocd/deployment/` directory, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch argocd openshift-gitops \ 
-n openshift-gitops --type=merge \ 
--patch-file out/argocd/deployment/argocd-openshift-gitops-patch.json
----

. Apply the pipeline configuration to your hub cluster by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -k out/argocd/deployment
----
