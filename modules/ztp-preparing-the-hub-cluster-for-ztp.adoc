= Configuring the hub cluster with ArgoCD

You can configure the hub cluster with a set of ArgoCD applications that generate the required installation and policy custom resources (CRs) for each site with {ztp-first}.

[NOTE]
====
{rh-rhacm-first} uses `ClusterInstance` CRs to generate the Day 1 managed cluster installation CRs for ArgoCD. Each ArgoCD application can manage a maximum of 1000 `ClusterInstance` CRs.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have a {product-title} hub cluster with {rh-rhacm-first} and {gitops-title} installed.

* You have extracted the reference deployment from the {ztp} plugin container as described in the "Preparing the {ztp} site configuration repository" section. Extracting the reference deployment creates the `out/argocd/deployment` directory referenced in the following procedure.

.Procedure

. Prepare the ArgoCD pipeline configuration:

.. Create a Git repository with the directory structure similar to the example directory. For more information, see "Preparing the {ztp} site configuration repository".

.. Configure access to the repository using the ArgoCD UI. Under *Settings* configure the following:

*** *Repositories* - Add the connection information. The URL must end in `.git`, for example, `https://repo.example.com/repo.git` and credentials.

*** *Certificates* - Add the public certificate for the repository, if needed.

.. Modify the two ArgoCD applications, `out/argocd/deployment/clusters-app.yaml` and `out/argocd/deployment/policies-app.yaml`, based on your Git repository:

*** Update the URL to point to the Git repository. The URL ends with `.git`, for example, `https://repo.example.com/repo.git`.

*** The `targetRevision` indicates which Git repository branch to monitor.

*** `path` specifies the path to the `ClusterInstance` and `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` CRs, respectively.

. Optional: If you have existing ArgoCD applications, verify that the `PrunePropagationPolicy=background` policy is set in the `Application` resource by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-gitops get applications.argoproj.io  \
clusters -o jsonpath='{.spec.syncPolicy.syncOptions}' |jq
----

.Example output for an existing policy
[source,terminal]
----
[
  "CreateNamespace=true",
  "PrunePropagationPolicy=background",
  "RespectIgnoreDifferences=true"
]
----
--

.. If the `spec.syncPolicy.syncOption` field does not contain a `PrunePropagationPolicy` parameter or `PrunePropagationPolicy` is set to the `foreground` value, set the policy to `background` in the `Application` resource. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Application
spec:
  syncPolicy:
    syncOptions:
    - PrunePropagationPolicy=background
----

+
Setting the `background` deletion policy ensures that the `ManagedCluster` CR and all its associated resources are deleted.
