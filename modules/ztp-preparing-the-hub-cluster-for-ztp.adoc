= Configuring the hub cluster with ArgoCD

You can configure the hub cluster with a set of ArgoCD applications that generate the required installation and policy custom resources (CRs) for each site with {ztp-first}.

[NOTE]
====
{rh-rhacm-first} uses `SiteConfig` CRs to generate the Day 1 managed cluster installation CRs for ArgoCD. Each ArgoCD application can manage a maximum of 300 `SiteConfig` CRs.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have a {product-title} hub cluster with {rh-rhacm-first} and {gitops-title} installed.

* You have extracted the reference deployment from the {ztp} plugin container as described in the "Preparing the {ztp} site configuration repository" section. Extracting the reference deployment creates the `out/argocd/deployment` directory referenced in the following procedure.

.Procedure

. Prepare the ArgoCD pipeline configuration:

.. Create a Git repository with the directory structure similar to the example directory. For more information, see "Preparing the {ztp} site configuration repository".

.. Configure access to the repository using the ArgoCD UI. Under *Settings* configure the following:

*** *Repositories* - Add the connection information. The URL must end in `.git`, for example, `https://repo.example.com/repo.git` and credentials.

*** *Certificates* - Add the public certificate for the repository, if needed.

.. Modify the two ArgoCD applications, `out/argocd/deployment/clusters-app.yaml` and `out/argocd/deployment/policies-app.yaml`, based on your Git repository:

*** Update the URL to point to the Git repository. The URL ends with `.git`, for example, `https://repo.example.com/repo.git`.

*** The `targetRevision` indicates which Git repository branch to monitor.

*** `path` specifies the path to the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs, respectively.

. To install the {ztp} plugin you must patch the ArgoCD instance in the hub cluster by using the patch file previously extracted into the `out/argocd/deployment/` directory. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch argocd openshift-gitops \
-n openshift-gitops --type=merge \
--patch-file out/argocd/deployment/argocd-openshift-gitops-patch.json
----

. In {rh-rhacm} 2.7 and later, the multicluster engine enables the `cluster-proxy-addon` feature by default.
To disable this feature, apply the following patch to disable and remove the relevant hub cluster and managed cluster pods that are responsible for this add-on.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch multiclusterengines.multicluster.openshift.io multiclusterengine --type=merge --patch-file out/argocd/deployment/disable-cluster-proxy-addon.json
----

. Apply the pipeline configuration to your hub cluster by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -k out/argocd/deployment
----
