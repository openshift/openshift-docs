= OperatorHub architecture

The OperatorHub UI component is driven by the Marketplace Operator by default on
{product-title} in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace.

The Marketplace Operator manages OperatorHub and OperatorSource Custom Resource
Definitions (CRDs).

[NOTE]
====
Although some OperatorSource information is exposed through the OperatorHub user
interface, it is only used directly by those who are creating their own
Operators.
====

[NOTE]
====
While OperatorHub no longer uses CatalogSourceConfig resources, they are still
supported in {product-title}.

== OperatorHub CRD

You can use the OperatorHub CRD to change the state of the default
OperatorSources provided with OperatorHub on the cluster between enabled and
disabled. This capability is useful when configuring {product-title} in
restricted network environments.

.Example OperatorHub Custom Resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OperatorHub
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  disableAllDefaultSources: true <1>
  sources: [ <2>
    {
      name: "community-operators",
      disabled: false
    }
  ]
----
<1> `disableAllDefaultSources` is an override that controls availability of all
default OperatorSources that are configured by default during an {product-title}
installation.
<2> Disable default OperatorSources individually by changing the `disabled`
parameter value per source.

[id="olm-operatorhub-arch-operatorsource_crd_{context}"]
== OperatorSource CRD

For each Operator, the OperatorSource CRD is used to define the external data
store used to store Operator bundles.

.Example OperatorSource Custom Resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorSource
metadata:
  name: community-operators
  namespace: marketplace
spec:
  type: appregistry <1>
  endpoint: https://quay.io/cnr <2>
  registryNamespace: community-operators <3>
  displayName: "Community Operators" <4>
  publisher: "Red Hat" <5>
----
<1> To identify the data store as an application registry, `type` is set to `appregistry`.
<2> Currently, Quay is the external data store used by the OperatorHub, so
the endpoint is set to `\https://quay.io/cnr` for the Quay.io `appregistry`.
<3> For a Community Operator, `registryNamespace` is set to `community-operator`.
<4> Optionally, set `displayName` to a name that appears for the Operator in the OperatorHub UI.
<5> Optionally, set `publisher` to the person or organization publishing the Operator that appears in the OperatorHub UI.
