= Support considerations for monitoring

The following modifications are explicitly not supported:

* *Creating additional `ServiceMonitor`, `PodMonitor`, and `PrometheusRule` objects in the `openshift-&#42;`, and `kube-&#42;` projects.*
* *Modifying any resources or objects deployed in the `openshift-monitoring` or `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` projects.* The resources created by the {product-title} monitoring stack are not meant to be used by any other resources, as there are no guarantees about their backward compatibility.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Alertmanager configuration is deployed as a secret resource in the `openshift-monitoring` project. To configure additional routes for Alertmanager, you need to decode, modify, and then encode that secret. This procedure is a supported exception to the preceding statement.
====
+
* *Modifying resources of the stack.* The {product-title} monitoring stack ensures its resources are always in the state it expects them to be. If they are modified, the stack will reset them.
* *Deploying user-defined workloads to `openshift-&#42;`, and `kube-&#42;` projects.* These projects are reserved for Red Hat provided components and they should not be used for user-defined workloads.
* *Installing custom Prometheus instances on {product-title}.*
* *Enabling symptom based monitoring by using the `Probe` custom resource definition (CRD) in Prometheus Operator.*
* *Modifying Alertmanager configurations by using the `AlertmanagerConfig` CRD in Prometheus Operator.*

[NOTE]
====
Backward compatibility for metrics, recording rules, or alerting rules is not guaranteed.
