= Support considerations for monitoring

[NOTE]
====
Backward compatibility for metrics, recording rules, or alerting rules is not guaranteed.
====

The following modifications are explicitly not supported:

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* *Creating additional `ServiceMonitor`, `PodMonitor`, and `PrometheusRule` objects in the `openshift-&#42;` and `kube-&#42;` projects.*
* *Modifying any resources or objects deployed in the `openshift-monitoring` or `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` projects.* The resources created by the {product-title} monitoring stack are not meant to be used by any other resources, as there are no guarantees about their backward compatibility.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Alertmanager configuration is deployed as the `alertmanager-main` secret resource in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.
If you have enabled a separate Alertmanager instance for user-defined alert routing, an Alertmanager configuration is also deployed as the `alertmanager-user-workload` secret resource in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.
To configure additional routes for any instance of Alertmanager, you need to decode, modify, and then encode that secret.
This procedure is a supported exception to the preceding statement.
====
+
* *Modifying resources of the stack.* The {product-title} monitoring stack ensures its resources are always in the state it expects them to be. If they are modified, the stack will reset them.
* *Deploying user-defined workloads to `openshift-&#42;`, and `kube-&#42;` projects.* These projects are reserved for Red Hat provided components and they should not be used for user-defined workloads.
* *Enabling symptom based monitoring by using the `Probe` custom resource definition (CRD) in Prometheus Operator.*
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

* *Installing custom Prometheus instances on {product-title}.* A custom instance is a Prometheus custom resource (CR) managed by the Prometheus Operator.
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* *Modifying the default platform monitoring components.* You should not modify any of the components defined in the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map. Red Hat SRE uses these components to monitor the core cluster components and Kubernetes services.
