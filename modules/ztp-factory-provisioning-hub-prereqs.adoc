= Hub node prerequisites

This document assumes an external hub cluster, which runs an OpenShift deployment (Compact), RHACM-based cluster with assisted service installed.

The hub cluster can be deployed in a fully disconnected fashion, or it can be deployed as a connected cluster. Regardless of the choice, the hub cluster is expected to provide the required mirrors and images for the spoke cluster to be deployed in a fully disconnected fashion.

The hub node needs an OpenShift Container platform installed.

Deploy the {product-title} cluster following the guidance link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-overview.html[Installing on bare metal].  

Create a Storage Class and some Persistent Volumes (5 at least)
1 for Internal Registry
1 for HTTPD
1 for RHACM
2 for Assisted
