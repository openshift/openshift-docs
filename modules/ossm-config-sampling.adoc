= Adjusting the sampling rate

The sampling rate determines how often a trace is generated. Configure sampling as a scaled integer representing 0.01% increments. 

A trace is an execution path between services in the service mesh. A trace is comprised of one or more spans. A span is a logical unit of work that has a name, start time, and duration.

In a basic installation, `spec.tracing.sampling` is set to `10000`, which samples 100% of traces. Setting the value to 10 samples 0.1% of traces, setting the value to 500 samples 5% of traces. 

Setting the value to `10000` is useful for debugging, but can affect performance. For production, set `spec.tracing.sampling` to `100.`

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. From the Project menu, select the project where you installed the control plane, for example `istio-system`.

. Click the {ProductName} Operator. In the *Istio Service Mesh Control Plane* column, click the name of your `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, for example `basic`.

. To adjust the sampling rate, set a different value for `spec.tracing.sampling`.
+
.. Click the *YAML* tab.
+
.. Set the value for `spec.tracing.sampling` in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. In the following example, set it to `100`.
