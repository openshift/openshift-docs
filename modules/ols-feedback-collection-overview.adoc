= Feedback collection overview 

[role="_abstract"]
{ols-long} collects opt-in user feedback from the virtual assistant interface to analyze response accuracy and improve service quality.

If you submit feedback, the feedback score (thumbs up or down), text feedback (if entered), your query, and the LLM provider response are stored and sent to {red-hat} on the same schedule as transcript collection. If you are using the filtering and redaction functionality, the filtered or redacted content is sent to {red-hat}. {red-hat} will not see the original non-redacted content, and the redaction takes place before any content is captured in logs.

Feedback is associated with the cluster from which it originated, and {red-hat} can attribute specific clusters to specific customer accounts. Feedback does not contain any information about which user submitted the feedback, and feedback cannot be tied to any individual user.
