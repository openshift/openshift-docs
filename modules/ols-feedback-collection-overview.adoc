= Feedback collection overview 

{ols-long} collects feedback from users who engage with the feedback feature in the virtual assistant interface. If a user submits feedback, the feedback score (thumbs up or down), text feedback (if entered), the user query, and the LLM provider response are stored and sent to {red-hat} on the same schedule as transcript collection. If you are using the filtering and redaction functionality, the filtered or redacted content is sent to {red-hat}. {red-hat} will not see the original non-redacted content, and the redaction takes place before any content is captured in logs.

Feedback is associated with the cluster from which it originated, and {red-hat} can attribute specific clusters to specific customer accounts. Feedback does not contain any information about which user submitted the feedback, and feedback cannot be tied to any individual user.
