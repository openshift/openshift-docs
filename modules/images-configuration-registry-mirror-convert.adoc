= Converting ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) files for image registry repository mirroring

Using an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) object to configure repository mirroring is a deprecated feature. This functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

ICSP objects are being replaced by `ImageDigestMirrorSet` and `ImageTagMirrorSet` objects to configure repository mirroring. If you have existing YAML files that you used to create `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects, you can use the `oc adm migrate icsp` command to convert those files to an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML file. The command updates the API to the current version, changes the `kind` value to `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, and changes `spec.repositoryDigestMirrors` to `spec.imageDigestMirrors`. The rest of the file is not changed.

Because the migration does not change the `registries.conf` file, the cluster does not need to reboot. 

For more information about `ImageDigestMirrorSet` or `ImageTagMirrorSet` objects, see "Configuring image registry repository mirroring" in the previous section.

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]

* Ensure that you have `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects on your cluster.

.Procedure

. Use the following command to convert one or more `ImageContentSourcePolicy` YAML files to an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm migrate icsp <file_name>.yaml <file_name>.yaml <file_name>.yaml --dest-dir <path_to_the_directory>
----
+
--
where:

`<file_name>`:: Specifies the name of the source `ImageContentSourcePolicy` YAML. You can list multiple file names.
`--dest-dir`:: Optional: Specifies a directory for the output `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML. If unset, the file is written to the current directory.
--
+
For example, the following command converts the `icsp.yaml` and `icsp-2.yaml` file and saves the new YAML files to the `idms-files` directory.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm migrate icsp icsp.yaml icsp-2.yaml --dest-dir idms-files
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
wrote ImageDigestMirrorSet to idms-files/imagedigestmirrorset_ubi8repo.5911620242173376087.yaml
wrote ImageDigestMirrorSet to idms-files/imagedigestmirrorset_ubi9repo.6456931852378115011.yaml
----

. Create the CR object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <path_to_the_directory>/<file-name>.yaml
----
+
--
where:

`<path_to_the_directory>`:: Specifies the path to the directory, if you used the `--dest-dir` flag.
`<file_name>`:: Specifies the name of the `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML.
--

. Remove the ICSP objects after the IDMS objects are rolled out.
