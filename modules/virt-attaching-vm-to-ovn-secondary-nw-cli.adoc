[id="virt-attaching-vm-to-ovn-secondary-nw-cli_{context}"]
= Attaching a virtual machine to an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network using the CLI

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network by including the network details in the VM configuration.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure
. Edit the `VirtualMachine` manifest to add the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network interface details, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: vm-server
spec:
  running: true
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          interfaces:
          - name: default
            masquerade: {}
          - name: secondary <1>
            bridge: {}
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 1024Mi
      networks:
      - name: default
        pod: {}
      - name: secondary  <2>
        multus:
          networkName: l2-network <3>
# ...
----
<1> The name of the OVN-Kubernetes secondary interface.
<2> The name of the network. This must match the value of the `spec.template.spec.domain.devices.interfaces.name` field.
<3> The name of the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object.

. Apply the `VirtualMachine` manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----

. Optional: If you edited a running virtual machine, you must restart it for the changes to take effect.
