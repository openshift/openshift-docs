= About the Performance Profile Creator

The PPC is a command-line tool, delivered with the Node Tuning Operator, used to create the performance profile.

The tool consumes `must-gather` data from the cluster and several user-supplied profile arguments. The PPC generates a performance profile that is appropriate for your hardware and topology.

The tool is executed by one of the following methods:

* Invoking `podman`.
* Calling a wrapper script.
