= Installing the Cluster Logging and Elasticsearch Operators

You can use the {product-title} console to install cluster logging, by deploying,
the Cluster Logging and Elasticsearch Operators.  The Cluster Logging Operator
creates and manages the components of the logging stack.  The Elasticsearch Operator
creates and manages the Elasticsearch cluster used by cluster logging.

[NOTE]
====
The {product-title} cluster logging solution requires that you install both the
Cluster Logging Operator and Elasticsearch Operator.
====

.Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the necessary persistent storage for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch node
requires its own storage volume.

Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. Each Elasticsearch node needs 16G of memory for both memory requests and CPU limits.
The initial set of {product-title} nodes might not be large enough to support the Elasticsearch cluster. You must add additional nodes to the
{product-title} cluster to run with the recommended or higher memory. Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower
memory setting though this is not recommended for production deployments.

.Procedure

. Install the Elasticsearch Operator via the OperatorHub. See: xref:../applications/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.adoc[Adding Operators to a cluster].

. Install the Cluster Logging Operator using the {product-title} web console for best results:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Catalog* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose  *Cluster Logging* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.

.. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page, under *A specific namespace on the cluster* select *openshift-logging*.
Then, click *Subscribe*.

. Verify the operator installations:

.. Switch to the *Catalog* → *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *Cluster Logging* is listed in the *openshift-logging* project with a *Status* of *InstallSucceeded*.

.. Ensure that *Elasticsearch Operator* is listed in the *openshift-operator-redhat* project with a *Status* of *InstallSucceeded*.
The Elasticsearch Operator is copied to all other projects.
+
[NOTE]
====
During installation an operator might display a *Failed* status. If the operator then installs with an *InstallSucceeded* message,
you can safely ignore the *Failed* message.
====
+
If either operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:
+
* Switch to the *Catalog* → *Operator Management* page and inspect
the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors
under *Status*.
* Switch to the *Workloads* → *Pods* page and check the logs in any Pods in the
`openshift-logging` and `openshift-operators-redhat` projects that are reporting issues.

. Create a cluster logging instance:

.. Switch to the the *Administration* -> *Custom Resource Definitions* page.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click *ClusterLogging*.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definition Overview* page, select *View Instances* from the *Actions* menu.

.. On the *Cluster Loggings* page, click *Create Cluster Logging*.
+
You might have to refresh the page to load the data.

.. In the YAML, replace the code with the following:
+
[NOTE]
====
This default cluster logging configuration should support a wide array of environments. Review the topics on tuning and
configuring the cluster logging components for information on modifications you can make to your cluster logging cluster.
