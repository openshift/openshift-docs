= Using must-gather with insecure TLS connections

If a custom CA certificate is used, the `must-gather` pod fails to grab the output for `velero logs/describe`. To use the `must-gather` tool with  insecure TLS connections, you can pass the `gather_without_tls` flag to the `must-gather` command.

.Procedure
* Pass the `gather_without_tls` flag, with value set to `true`, to the `must-gather` tool by using the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/oadp/oadp-mustgather-rhel9:v1.3 -- /usr/bin/gather_without_tls <true/false>
----

By default, the flag value is set to `false`. Set the value to `true` to allow insecure TLS connections.
