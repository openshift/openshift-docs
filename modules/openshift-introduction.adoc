= Introduction to OpenShift

OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) is a platform for developing and running containerized applications. It is designed to allow both applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to thousands of machines serving millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, OpenShift incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking and other applications. Its implementation in open Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

The architecture presented here is meant to give you insights into how OpenShift works. It does this by stepping you through the process of installing an OCP cluster, managing the cluster, and developing and deploying applications on it. Along the way, this architecture describes:

* Major components of OCP
* Ways of exploring different aspects of OCP yourself
* Available frontdoors (and backdoors) to modify the installation and management of your OCP cluster
* Different types of container application types
