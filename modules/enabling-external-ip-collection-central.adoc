= Enabling external IP collection in Central

[role="_abstract"]
There are two environmental variables that control the collection of external IP in Central: `ROX_EXTERNAL_IPS` and `ROX_NETWORK_GRAPH_EXTERNAL_IPS`.

You must enable `ROX_EXTERNAL_IPS` in Central to enable external IP collection and to query external entities by using the API. After that, you can use `ROX_NETWORK_GRAPH_EXTERNAL_IPS` to display collected external IPs in the Network Graph.

.Procedure

* If you installed {product-title-short} by using the {product-title-short} Operator, insert the following customization in the Central custom resource definition (CRD):

  customize:
    envVars:
      - name: ROX_EXTERNAL_IPS <1>
        value: 'true'
----
<1> Additionally, you can also specify `ROX_NETWORK_GRAPH_EXTERNAL_IPS`.

* If you installed {product-title-short} by using Helm, add the following annotations to your `values-public.yaml` file:

  # Extra environment variables for all containers in all objects.
