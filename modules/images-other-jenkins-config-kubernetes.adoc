= Configuring the Jenkins Kubernetes plug-in

The OpenShift Jenkins image includes the pre-installed link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes plug-in] so that Jenkins agents can be dynamically provisioned on multiple container hosts using Kubernetes and {product-title}.

To use the Kubernetes plug-in, {product-title} provides images that are suitable for use as Jenkins agents, including the Base, Maven, and Node.js images.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} 4.11 moves the OpenShift Jenkins and OpenShift Agent Base images to the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io` so that Red Hat can produce and update the images outside the {product-title} lifecycle. Previously, these images were in the {product-title} install payload and the `openshift4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`.

{product-title} 4.11 removes the OpenShift Jenkins Maven and NodeJS Agent images from its payload. Red Hat no longer produces these images, and they are not available from the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`. Red Hat maintains the 4.10 and earlier versions of these images for any significant bug fixes or security CVEs, following the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} lifecycle policy].

For more information, see the "Important changes to OpenShift Jenkins images" link in the following "Additional resources" section.
====

Both the Maven and Node.js agent images are automatically configured as Kubernetes pod template images within the {product-title} Jenkins image configuration for the Kubernetes plug-in. That configuration includes labels for each of the images that can be applied to any of your Jenkins jobs under their Restrict where this project can be run setting. If the label is applied, jobs run under an {product-title} pod running the respective agent image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {product-title} 4.10 and later, the recommended pattern for running Jenkins agents using the Kubernetes plug-in is to use pod templates with both `jnlp` and `sidecar` containers. The `jnlp` container uses the {product-title} Jenkins Base agent image to facilitate launching a separate pod for your build. The `sidecar` container image has the tools needed to build in a particular language within the separate pod that was launched. Many container images from the Red Hat Container Catalog are referenced in the sample image streams present in the `openshift` namespace. The {product-title} Jenkins image has two pod templates named `java-build` and `nodejs-builder` with sidecar containers that demonstrate this approach. These two pod templates use the latest Java and NodeJS versions provided by the `java` and `nodejs` image streams in the `openshift` namespace.

With this update, in {product-title} 4.10 and later, the non-sidecar `maven` and `nodejs` pod templates for Jenkins are deprecated. These pod templates are planned for removal in a future release. Bug fixes and support are provided through the end of that future life cycle, after which no new feature enhancements will be made.

// Writer: This admonition is tied to the "Non-sidecar pod templates for Jenkins" deprecation item (JKNS-257) in the OpenShift 4.10 release notes. Update this admonition when this deprecation status eventually changes to "removed."
====

The Jenkins image also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration of additional agent images for the Kubernetes plug-in.

With the {product-title} sync plug-in, the Jenkins image on Jenkins startup searches for the following within the project that it is running or the projects specifically listed in the plug-in's configuration:

* Image streams that have the label `role` set to `jenkins-agent`.
* Image stream tags that have the annotation `role` set to `jenkins-agent`.
* Config maps that have the label `role` set to `jenkins-agent`.

When it finds an image stream with the appropriate label, or image stream tag with the appropriate annotation, it generates the corresponding Kubernetes plug-in configuration so you can assign your Jenkins jobs to run in a pod that runs the container image that is provided by the image stream.

The name and image references of the image stream or image stream tag are mapped to the name and image fields in the Kubernetes plug-in pod template. You can control the label field of the Kubernetes plug-in pod template by setting an annotation on the image stream or image stream tag object with the key `agent-label`. Otherwise, the name is used as the label.

[NOTE]
====
Do not log in to the Jenkins console and change the pod template configuration. If you do so after the pod template is created, and the {product-title} Sync plug-in detects that the image associated with the image stream or image stream tag has changed, it replaces the pod template and overwrites those configuration changes. You cannot merge a new configuration with the existing configuration.

Consider the config map approach if you have more complex configuration needs.
====

When it finds a config map with the appropriate label, it assumes that any values in the key-value data payload of the config map contain Extensible Markup Language (XML) that is consistent with the configuration format for Jenkins and the Kubernetes plug-in pod templates. One key benefit of using config maps, rather than image streams or image stream tags, is that you can control all the parameters of the Kubernetes plug-in pod template.

The following example shows two containers that reference image streams that are present in the `openshift` namespace. One container handles the JNLP contract for launching Pods as Jenkins Agents. The other container uses an image with tools for building code in a particular coding language:

[NOTE]
====
If you log in to the Jenkins console and make further changes to the pod template configuration after the pod template is created, and the {product-title} Sync plug-in detects that the config map has changed, it will replace the pod template and overwrite those configuration changes. You cannot merge a new configuration with the existing configuration.

Do not log in to the Jenkins console and change the pod template configuration. If you do so after the pod template is created, and the {product-title} Sync plug-in detects that the image associated with the image stream or image stream tag has changed, it replaces the pod template and overwrites those configuration changes. You cannot merge a new configuration with the existing configuration.

Consider the config map approach if you have more complex configuration needs.
====

After it is installed, the {product-title} Sync plug-in monitors the API server of {product-title} for updates to image streams, image stream tags, and config maps and adjusts the configuration of the Kubernetes plug-in.

The following rules apply:

* Removing the label or annotation from the config map, image stream, or image stream tag results in the deletion of any existing `PodTemplate` from the configuration of the Kubernetes plug-in.
* If those objects are removed, the corresponding configuration is removed from the Kubernetes plug-in.
* Either creating appropriately labeled or annotated `ConfigMap`, `ImageStream`, or `ImageStreamTag` objects, or the adding of labels after their initial creation, leads to creating of a `PodTemplate` in the Kubernetes-plugin configuration.
* In the case of the `PodTemplate` by config map form, changes to the config map data for the `PodTemplate` are applied to the `PodTemplate` settings in the Kubernetes plug-in configuration and overrides any changes that were made to the `PodTemplate` through the Jenkins UI between changes to the config map.

To use a container image as a Jenkins agent, the image must run the agent as an entry point. For more details, see the official https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-Launchslaveagentheadlessly[Jenkins documentation].
