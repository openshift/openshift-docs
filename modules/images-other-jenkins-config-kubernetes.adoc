= Configuring the Jenkins Kubernetes plug-in

The {product-title} Jenkins image includes the pre-installed link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes plug-in] that allows Jenkins agents to be dynamically provisioned on multiple container hosts using Kubernetes and {product-title}.

To use the Kubernetes plug-in, {product-title} provides images that are suitable for use as Jenkins agents including the Base, Maven, and Node.js images.

Both the Maven and Node.js agent images are automatically configured as Kubernetes pod template images within the {product-title} Jenkins image configuration for the Kubernetes plug-in. That configuration includes labels for each of the images that can be applied to any of your Jenkins jobs under their Restrict where this project can be run setting. If the label is applied, jobs run under an {product-title} pod running the respective agent image.

The Jenkins image also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration of additional agent images for the Kubernetes plug-in.

With the {product-title} sync plug-in, the Jenkins image on Jenkins start-up searches for the following within the project that it is running or the projects specifically listed in the plug-in's configuration:

* Image streams that have the label `role` set to `jenkins-agent`.
* Image stream tags that have the annotation `role` set to `jenkins-agent`.
* Config maps that have the label `role` set to `jenkins-agent`.

When it finds an image stream with the appropriate label, or image stream tag with the appropriate annotation, it generates the corresponding Kubernetes plug-in configuration so you can assign your Jenkins jobs to run in a pod that runs the container image that is provided by the image stream.

The name and image references of the image stream or image stream tag are mapped to the name and image fields in the Kubernetes plug-in pod template. You can control the label field of the Kubernetes plug-in pod template by setting an annotation on the image stream or image stream tag object with the key `agent-label`. Otherwise, the name is used as the label.

[NOTE]
====
Do not log in to the Jenkins console and modify the pod template configuration. If you do so after the pod template is created, and the {product-title} Sync plug-in detects that the image associated with the image stream or image stream tag has changed, it replaces the pod template and overwrites those configuration changes. You cannot merge a new configuration with the existing configuration.

Consider the config map approach if you have more complex configuration needs.
====

When it finds a config map with the appropriate label, it assumes that any values in the key-value data payload of the config map contains Extensible Markup Language (XML) that is consistent with the configuration format for Jenkins and the Kubernetes plug-in pod templates. A key differentiator to note when using config maps, instead of image streams or image stream tags, is that you can control all the parameters of the Kubernetes plug-in pod template.

[NOTE]
====
If you log in to the Jenkins console and make further changes to the pod template configuration after the pod template is created, and the {product-title} Sync plug-in detects that the config map has changed, it will replace the pod template and overwrite those configuration changes. You cannot merge a new configuration with the existing configuration.

====

After it is installed, the {product-title} Sync plug-in monitors the API server of {product-title} for updates to image streams, image stream tags, and config maps and adjusts the configuration of the Kubernetes plug-in.

The following rules apply:

* Removing the label or annotation from the config map, image stream, or image stream tag results in the deletion of any existing `PodTemplate` from the configuration of the Kubernetes plug-in.
* If those objects are removed, the corresponding configuration is removed from the Kubernetes plug-in.
* Either creating appropriately labeled or annotated `ConfigMap`, `ImageStream`, or `ImageStreamTag` objects, or the adding of labels after their initial creation, leads to creating of a `PodTemplate` in the Kubernetes-plugin configuration.
* In the case of the `PodTemplate` by config map form, changes to the config map data for the `PodTemplate` are applied to the `PodTemplate` settings in the Kubernetes plug-in configuration and overrides any changes that were made to the `PodTemplate` through the Jenkins UI between changes to the config map.

To use a container image as a Jenkins agent, the image must run the agent as an entrypoint. For more details about this, refer to the official https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-Launchslaveagentheadlessly[Jenkins documentation].
