= Argo Rollouts architecture overview

Argo Rollouts support is enabled on a cluster by installing the {gitops-title} Operator and configuring a `RolloutManager` custom resource (CR) instance.

After a `RolloutManager` CR is created, the {gitops-title} Operator installs Argo Rollouts into that same namespace. This step includes the installation of the Argo Rollouts controller and the resources required for handling Argo Rollouts, such as CRs, roles, role bindings, and configuration data.

The Argo Rollouts controller can be installed in two different modes:

* *Cluster-scoped mode* (default): The controller oversees resources throughout all namespaces within the cluster.
* *Namespace-scoped mode*: The controller monitors resources within the namespace where Argo Rollouts is deployed.

The architecture of Argo Rollouts is structured into components and resources. Components are used to manage resources. For example, the AnalysisRun controller manages the `AnalysisRun` CR.

Argo Rollouts include several mechanisms to gather analysis metrics to verify that a new application version is deployed:

* *Prometheus metrics*: The `AnalysisTemplate` CR is configured to connect to Prometheus instances to evaluate the success or failure of one or more metrics.
* *Kubernetes job metrics*: Argo Rollouts support the Kubernetes `Job` resource to run analysis on resource metrics. You can verify a successful deployment of an application based on the successful run of Kubernetes jobs.
