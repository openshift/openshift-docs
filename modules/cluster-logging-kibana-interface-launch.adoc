= Launching Kibana

Kibana is a browser-based console to query, discover, and visualize your logs through histograms, line graphs,
pie charts, heat maps, built-in geospatial support, and other visualizations.

.Prerequisites

If you installed {product-title} with a proxy, you need to add `.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` to the `noProxy` list in your cluster-wide Proxy object.

For example:

----
$ oc edit proxy/cluster

apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2020-03-30T00:45:44Z"
  generation: 3
  name: cluster
  resourceVersion: "26654"
  selfLink: /apis/config.openshift.io/v1/proxies/cluster
  uid: 2213b41b-0721-4c9f-9586-0678c0058f85
spec:
  httpProxy: http://proxy.com
  httpsProxy: https://proxy.com
  noProxy: .apps.mycluster.example.com <1>
  trustedCA:
    name: user-ca-bundle
----
<1> Add `.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` to the `noProxy` list. This is a comma-separated list of destination domain names, domains, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude proxying.  

.Procedure

To launch Kibana:

. In the {product-title} console, click *Monitoring* -> *Logging*.

. Log in using the same credentials you use to log in to the {product-title} console.
+
The Kibana interface launches. You can now:
+
* Search and browse your data using the Discover page.
* Chart and map your data using the Visualize page.
* Create and view custom dashboards using the Dashboard page.
+
Use and configuration of the Kibana interface is beyond the scope of this documentation. For more information,
on using the interface, see the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.6/connect-to-elasticsearch.html[Kibana documentation].

[NOTE]
====
If you get a *security_exception* error in the Kibana console and cannot access your Kibana indices, you might have an expired OAuth token. If you see this error, log out of the Kibana console, and then log back in. This refreshes your OAuth tokens and you should be able to access your indices.
