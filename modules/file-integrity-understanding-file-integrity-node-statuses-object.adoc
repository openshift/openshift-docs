[NOTE]
====
`FileIntegrityNodeStatus` might not be created until the second run of the
scanner is finished. The period is configurable.
====

There is one result object per node. The `nodeName` attribute of
each `FileIntegrityNodeStatus` object corresponds to the node being scanned. The
status of the file integrity scan is represented in the `results` array, which
holds scan conditions.
