= Scaling down the data plane to zero

If you are not using the hosted control plane, to save the resources and cost you can scale down a data plane to zero.

[NOTE]
====
Ensure you are prepared to scale down the data plane to zero. Because the workload from the worker nodes disappears after scaling down.
====

.Procedure

. Set the `kubeconfig` file to access the hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=<install_directory>/auth/kubeconfig
----

. Get the name of the `NodePool` resource associated to your hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodepool --namespace <HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE>
----

. Optional: To prevent the pods from draining, add the `nodeDrainTimeout` field in the `NodePool` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit NodePool <nodepool> -o yaml --namespace <HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE>
----
+

----
<1> Defines the name of your hosted cluster.
<2> Specifies the total amount of time that the controller spends to drain a node. By default, the `nodeDrainTimeout: 0s` setting blocks the node draining process.
+
[NOTE]
====
To allow the node draining process to continue for a certain period of time, you can set the value of the `nodeDrainTimeout` field accordingly, for example, `nodeDrainTimeout: 1m`.
====

. Scale down the `NodePool` resource associated to your hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale nodepool/<NODEPOOL_NAME> --namespace <HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE> --replicas=0
----
+
[NOTE]
====
After scaling down the data plan to zero, some pods in the control plane stay in the `Pending` status and the hosted control plane stays up and running. If necessary, you can scale up the `NodePool` resource.
====

. Optional: Scale up the `NodePool` resource associated to your hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale nodepool/<NODEPOOL_NAME> --namespace <HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE> --replicas=1
----
+
After rescaling the `NodePool` resource,  wait for couple of minutes for the `NodePool` resource to become available in a `Ready` state.
