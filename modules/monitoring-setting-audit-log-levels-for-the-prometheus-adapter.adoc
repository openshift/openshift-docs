= Setting audit log levels for the Prometheus Adapter

[role=_abstract]
In default platform monitoring, you can configure the audit log level for the Prometheus Adapter.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.

.Procedure

You can set an audit log level for the Prometheus Adapter in the default `openshift-monitoring` project:

. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Add `profile:` in the `k8sPrometheusAdapter/audit` section under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    k8sPrometheusAdapter:
      audit:
        profile: <audit_log_level> <1>
----
<1> The audit log level to apply to the Prometheus Adapter.

. Set the audit log level by using one of the following values for the `profile:` parameter:
+
* `None`: Do not log events.
* `Metadata`: Log only the metadata for the request, such as user, timestamp, and so forth. Do not log the request text and the response text. `Metadata` is the default audit log level.
* `Request`: Log only the metadata and the request text but not the response text. This option does not apply for non-resource requests.
* `RequestResponse`: Log event metadata, request text, and response text. This option does not apply for non-resource requests.

. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods for the Prometheus Adapter restart automatically when you apply the change.
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to a monitoring config map, the pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
====

.Verification

. In the config map, under `k8sPrometheusAdapter/audit/profile`, set the log level to `Request` and save the file.

. Confirm that the pods for the Prometheus Adapter are running. The following example lists the status of pods in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring get pods
----

. Confirm that the audit log level and audit log file path are correctly configured:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring get deploy prometheus-adapter -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
...
  - --audit-policy-file=/etc/audit/request-profile.yaml
  - --audit-log-path=/var/log/adapter/audit.log
----

. Confirm that the correct log level has been applied in the `prometheus-adapter` deployment in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring exec deploy/prometheus-adapter -c prometheus-adapter -- cat /etc/audit/request-profile.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
"apiVersion": "audit.k8s.io/v1"
"kind": "Policy"
"metadata":
  "name": "Request"
"omitStages":
- "RequestReceived"
"rules":
- "level": "Request"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you enter an unrecognized `profile` value for the Prometheus Adapter in the `ConfigMap` object, no changes are made to the Prometheus Adapter, and an error is logged by the Cluster Monitoring Operator.
====

. Review the audit log for the Prometheus Adapter:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring exec -c <prometheus_adapter_pod_name> -- cat /var/log/adapter/audit.log
----
