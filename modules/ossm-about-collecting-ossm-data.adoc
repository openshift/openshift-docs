= About collecting service mesh data

You can use the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command to collect information about your cluster, including features and objects associated with {SMProductName}.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* The {product-title} CLI (`oc`) installed.

.Procedure

. To collect {SMProductName} data with `must-gather`, you must specify the {SMProductName} image.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/openshift-service-mesh/istio-must-gather-rhel8:2.4
----

. To collect {SMProductName} data for a specific {SMProductShortName} control plane namespace with `must-gather`, you must specify the {SMProductName} image and namespace. In this example, after `gather,` replace `<namespace>` with your {SMProductShortName} control plane namespace, such as `istio-system`.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/openshift-service-mesh/istio-must-gather-rhel8:2.4 gather <namespace>

This creates a local directory that contains the following items:

* The Istio Operator namespace and its child objects
* All control plane namespaces and their children objects
* All namespaces and their children objects that belong to any service mesh
* All Istio custom resource definitions (CRD)
* All Istio CRD objectsm such as VirtualServices in a given namespace
* All Istio webhooks
