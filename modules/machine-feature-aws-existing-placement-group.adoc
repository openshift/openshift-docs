= Elastic Fabric Adapter instances and placement group options

You can deploy compute machines on link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html[Elastic Fabric Adapter] (EFA) instances within an existing AWS placement group.

EFA instances do not require placement groups, and you can use placement groups for purposes other than configuring an EFA. 
The following example uses an EFA and placement group together to demonstrate a configuration that can improve network performance for machines within the specified placement group.

<1> Specifies an instance type that link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html#efa-instance-types[supports EFAs].
<2> Specifies the `efa` network interface type.
<3> Specifies the name of the existing AWS placement group to deploy machines in.
<4> Optional: Specifies the partition number of the existing AWS placement group where you want your machines deployed. 

[NOTE]
====
Ensure that the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#limitations-placement-groups[rules and limitations] for the type of placement group that you create are compatible with your intended use case.

////
The MAPI version of this has additional parameters in the providerSpec:

----
placement:
  availabilityZone: <zone> # <3>
  region: <region> # <4>
----
<3> Specifies the zone, for example, `us-east-1a`.
<4> Specifies the region, for example, `us-east-1`.

Do we need to say anything specific about this, or is this just redundant with the failure domain?

Note: 
CAPI has networkInterfaceType: efa
MAPI has networkInterfaceType: EFA
Capitalization matters!
