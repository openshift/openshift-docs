= Overriding deployment configurations

Currently, overriding default configuration settings is supported for the `eventing-controller`, `eventing-webhook`, and `imc-controller` fields, as well as for the `readiness` and `liveness` fields for probes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `replicas` spec cannot override the number of replicas for deployments that use the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), and does not work for the `eventing-webhook` deployment.
====

In the following example, a `KnativeEventing` CR overrides the `eventing-controller` deployment so that:

* The `readiness` probe timeout `eventing-controller` is set to be 10 seconds.
* The deployment has specified CPU and memory resource limits.
* The deployment has 3 replicas.
* The `example-label: label` label is added.
* The `example-annotation: annotation` annotation is added.
* The `nodeSelector` field is set to select nodes with the `disktype: hdd` label.

----
<1> You can use the `readiness` and `liveness` probe overrides to override all fields of a probe in a container of a deployment as specified in the Kubernetes API except for the fields related to the probe handler: `exec`, `grpc`, `httpGet`, and `tcpSocket`.

[NOTE]
====
The `KnativeEventing` CR label and annotation settings override the deployment's labels and annotations for both the deployment itself and the resulting pods.
