= Configuring init containers

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/[Init containers] are specialized containers that are run before application containers in a pod. They are generally used to implement initialization logic for an application, which may include running setup scripts or downloading required configurations.

[NOTE]
====
Init containers may cause longer application start-up times and should be used with caution for serverless applications, which are expected to scale up and down frequently.
====

Multiple init containers are supported in a single Knative service spec. Knative provides a default, configurable naming template if a template name is not provided. The init containers template can be set by adding an appropriate value in a Knative `Service` object spec.

.Prerequisites

* {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster.

* Before you can use init containers for Knative services, an administrator must add the `kubernetes.podspec-init-containers` flag to the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR). See the {ServerlessProductName} "Global configuration" documentation for more information.

.Procedure

* Add the `initContainers` spec to a Knative `Service` object:
