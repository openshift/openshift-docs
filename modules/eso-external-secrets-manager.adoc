= externalSecretsManager

The `externalSecretsManager` object defines the configuration and information of deployments managed by the {external-secrets-operator-short}. Set the name to `cluster` as this allows only one instance of `externalSecretsManager` per cluster.

You can configure global options and enable optional features by using `externalSecretsManager`. This serves as a centralized configuration for managing multiple controllers of the Operator. The Operator automatically creates the `externalSecretsManager` object during installation.
