== Known issues

* Before this update, while enabling retention, the Loki Operator produced an invalid configuration. As a result, Loki did not start up properly. With this update, Loki pods work fine with the ability to set retention. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5821[LOG-5821])

[id="logging-release-notes-5-8-10-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the `ClusterLogForwarder` introduced an extra space in the message payload which did not follow the `RFC3164` specification. With this update, the extra space has been removed, fixing the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5647[LOG-5647])
