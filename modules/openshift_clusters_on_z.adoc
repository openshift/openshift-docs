//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_openshift_on_z.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= OpenShift clusters on Z

The goal of this document is to describe the processes for an IBM quality engineer to access and stand up OpenShift 4 clusters inside the Poughkeepsie lab and in their own environments for the purpose of testing layered products. This guide will walk you through accessing your OpenShift environment, as well as how to install the product itself.

== Key Definitions

* Localhost - An external machine you want to access the cluster from - oftentimes your laptop.

* Bastion - The system which will act as a workstation for deploying the cluster.  It will also provide network infrastructure services like `DNS` and `DHCP` (in the case of `zKVM`) to your cluster, and is the primary host upon which deployment is performed.

* Hypervisor - This is the `zKVM` `LPAR` which hosts the VM nodes.  This term only applies to `z/KVM` deployments.

== Accessing Clusters in the From a Remote Host

For some teams looking to test OpenShift 4, you may be assigned an existing environment which you can use to test. Otherwise, you will need to set up your own environment according to the instructions below. In either case, once you have an OpenShift cluster running, this section describes how to to access the environment.
