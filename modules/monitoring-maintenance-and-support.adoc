= Maintenance and support

The supported way of configuring {product-title} Monitoring is by configuring it using the options described in this document. *Do not use other configuration, it is unsupported.* The reason is that configuration paradigms might change across Prometheus releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled. If you use other configuration than is described in this section, your changes will dissappear, because the cluster-monitoring-operator reconciles any differences. It is by default and by design that the operator reverses everything to the defined state.

Explicitly unsupported cases include:

* *Creating additional `ServiceMonitor` objects in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.* This extends the targets the cluster monitoring Prometheus instance scrapes, which can cause collisions and load differences that cannot be accounted for. This makes the Prometheus setup can be unstable.
* *Creating additional apart from expected `ConfigMap` objects or prometheus rule objects.* This causes the cluster monitoring Prometheus instance to include additional alerting and recording rules.
* *Modifying resources of the stack.* The Prometheus Monitoring Stack ensures its resources are always in the state it expects them to be. If they are modified, the stack will reset them.
* *Using resources of the stack for your purposes.* The resources created by the Prometheus Cluster Monitoring stack are not meant to be used by any other resources, as there are no guarantees about their backward compatibility.
* *Adding new alerting rules.*
