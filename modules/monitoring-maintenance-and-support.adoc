= Maintenance and support for monitoring

Not all configuration options for the monitoring stack are exposed. The only supported way of configuring {product-title} monitoring is by configuring the Cluster Monitoring Operator using the options described in the "Config map reference for the Cluster Monitoring Operator". *Do not use other configurations, as they are unsupported.*

Configuration paradigms might change across Prometheus releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled. If you use configurations other than those described in the "Config map reference for the Cluster Monitoring Operator", your changes will disappear because the Cluster Monitoring Operator automatically reconciles any differences and resets any unsupported changes back to the originally defined state by default and by design.
