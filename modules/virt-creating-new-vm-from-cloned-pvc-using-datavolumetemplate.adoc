= Creating a new virtual machine from a cloned persistent volume claim by using a data volume template

You can create a virtual machine that clones the persistent volume claim (PVC) of
an existing virtual machine into a data volume. Reference a
`dataVolumeTemplate` in the virtual machine manifest and the `source` PVC is cloned to
a data volume, which is then automatically used for the creation of the virtual
machine.

[NOTE]
====
When a data volume is created as part of the data volume template of a virtual
machine, the lifecycle of the data volume is then dependent on the virtual
machine. If the virtual machine is deleted, the data volume and associated
PVC are also deleted.
====

.Prerequisites

* Determine the PVC of an existing virtual machine disk to use. You must power
down the virtual machine that is associated with the PVC before you can clone it.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Examine the virtual machine you want to clone to identify the name and
namespace of the associated PVC.

. Create a YAML file for a `VirtualMachine` object. The following virtual
machine example clones `my-favorite-vm-disk`, which is located in the
`source-namespace` namespace. The `2Gi` data volume called `favorite-clone`
is created from `my-favorite-vm-disk`.
