= Creating a new virtual machine from a cloned PersistentVolumeClaim by using a DataVolumeTemplate

You can create a virtual machine that clones the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) of
an existing virtual machine into a DataVolume. By referencing a
`dataVolumeTemplate` in the virtual machine `spec`, the `source` PVC is cloned to
a DataVolume, which is then automatically used for the creation of the virtual
machine.

[NOTE]
====
When a DataVolume is created as part of the DataVolumeTemplate of a virtual
machine, the lifecycle of the DataVolume is then dependent on the virtual
machine. If the virtual machine is deleted, the DataVolume and associated
PVC are also deleted.
====

.Prerequisites

* Determine the PVC of an existing virtual machine disk to use. You must power
down the virtual machine that is associated with the PVC before you can clone it.
* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.

.Procedure

. Examine the virtual machine you want to clone to identify the name and
namespace of the associated PVC.

. Create a YAML file for a `VirtualMachine` object. The following virtual
machine example clones `my-favorite-vm-disk`, which is located in the
`source-namespace` namespace. The `2Gi` DataVolume called `favorite-clone`
is created from `my-favorite-vm-disk`.
