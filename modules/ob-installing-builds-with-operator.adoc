= Installing {builds-shortname} by using the web console

You can install the {builds-operator} from the OperatorHub by using the {ocp-product-title} web console. Installing this Operator enables you to install and use build components.

.Procedure
. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* page.

. Use the *Filter by keyword* box to search for {builds-operator} in the catalog.

. Click the *{builds-operator}* tile.

. Read the brief description about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

.. Check that the *Installation Mode* is set to *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This mode installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster.

.. Check that the *Installed Namespace* is set to `openshift-operators` by default.

.. Select *Automatic* for the *Approval Strategy*. This ensures that the future upgrades to the Operator are handled automatically by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). If you select the *Manual* approval strategy, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve the OLM update request to update the Operator to the new version.

.. Select an *Update Channel*:

** The *Update Channel* is set to *latest* by default. The latest channel enables installation of the most recent stable version of the {builds-operator}.
** To install a specific version of the {builds-operator}, cluster administrators can use the corresponding `openshift-builds-<version>` channel. For example, to install the {builds-operator} version `0.11.0`, you can use the `openshift-builds-0.11.0` channel.

. Click *Install*.

.Verification

* On the *Installed Operators* page, verify that the {builds-operator} is listed and its *Status* is set to *Succeeded* to confirm successful installation.
