= Deleting a specific machine

You can delete a specific machine.

.Prerequisites

* Install an {product-title} cluster.
* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`
* Log into `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. View the Machines that are in the cluster and identify the one to delete:
+
----
$ oc get machine -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
The command output contains a list of Machines in the `<clusterid>-worker-<cloud_region>` format.

. Delete the Machine:
+
----
$ oc delete <machine> -n openshift-machine-api
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, the machine controller tries to drain the node that is backed by the machine until it succeeds. In some situations, such as with a misconfigured Pod disruption budget, the drain operation might not be able to succeed in preventing the machine from being deleted. You can skip draining the node by annotating "machine.openshift.io/exclude-node-draining" in a specific machine.
If the machine being deleted belongs to a MachineSet, a new machine is immediately created to satisfy the specified number of replicas.
