= Creating a legacy service account token secret

As an administrator, you can create a legacy service account token secret, which allows you to distribute a service account token to applications that must authenticate to the API.

[WARNING]
====
It is recommended to obtain bound service account tokens using the TokenRequest API instead of using legacy service account token secrets. You should create a service account token secret only if you cannot use the TokenRequest API and if the security exposure of a nonexpiring token in a readable API object is acceptable to you.

Bound service account tokens are more secure than service account token secrets for the following reasons:

* Bound service account tokens have a bounded lifetime.
* Bound service account tokens contain audiences.
* Bound service account tokens can be bound to pods or secrets and the bound tokens are invalidated when the bound object is removed.

Workloads are automatically injected with a projected volume to obtain a bound service account token. If your workload needs an additional service account token, add an additional projected volume in your workload manifest.

For more information, see "Configuring bound service account tokens using volume projection".

.Procedure

. Create a `Secret` object in a YAML file:
+
.Example `Secret` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-sa-sample
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: "sa-name" <1>
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token <2>
----
<1> Specifies an existing service account name. If you are creating both the `ServiceAccount` and the `Secret` objects, create the `ServiceAccount` object first.
<2> Specifies a service account token secret.

. Use the following command to create the `Secret` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
----

. To use the secret in a pod:

.. Update the pod's service account to reference the secret, as shown in the "Understanding how to create secrets" section.

.. Create the pod, which consumes the secret as an environment variable or as a file (using a `secret` volume), as shown in the "Understanding how to create secrets" section.
