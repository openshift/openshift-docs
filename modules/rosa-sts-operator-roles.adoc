= Cluster-specific Operator IAM role reference

Operator roles are used to obtain the temporary permissions required to carry out cluster operations, such as managing back-end storage, cloud ingress controller, and external access to a cluster.

When you create the Operator roles, the account-wide Operator policies for the matching cluster version are attached to the roles.
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
The Operator policies are tagged with the Operator and version they are compatible with. The correct policy for an Operator role is determined by using the tags.
endif::openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
AWS managed Operator policies are versioned in AWS IAM. The latest version of an AWS managed policy is always used, so you do not need to manage or schedule upgrades for AWS managed policies used by {product-title}.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

[NOTE]
====
If more than one matching policy is available in your account for an Operator role, an interactive list of options is provided when you create the role.
