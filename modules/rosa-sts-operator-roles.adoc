= Cluster-specific Operator IAM role reference

This section provides details about the Operator IAM roles that are required for ROSA deployments that use STS.

When you create the Operator roles by using the `rosa` CLI, the account-wide Operator policies for the matching cluster version are attached to the roles. The Operator policies are tagged with the Operator and version they are compatible with. The correct policy for an Operator role is determined by using the tags. 

[NOTE]
====
If more than one matching policy is available in your account for an Operator role, an interactive list of options is provided when you create the Operator.
