[id="upgrading_esearch5_esearch6_{context}"]
= Upgrading from Elasticsearch 5 to Elasticsearch 6

When updating from Elasticsearch 5 to Elasticsearch 6, you must delete your Jaeger instance, then recreate the Jaeger instance because of an issue with certificates. Re-creating the Jaeger instance triggers creating a new set of certificates.   If you are using persistent storage the same volumes can be mounted for the new Jaeger instance as long as the Jaeger name and namespace for the new Jaeger instance are the same as the deleted Jaeger instance.

.Procedure if Jaeger is installed as part of Red Hat Service Mesh

. Determine the name of your Jaeger custom resource file. In this example, `istio-system` is the control plane namespace.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get jaeger -n <istio-system>
----
+
You should see something like the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     AGE
jaeger   3d21h
----
+
. Copy the generated custom resource file into a temporary directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get jaeger jaeger -oyaml -n <istio-system> > /tmp/jaeger-cr.yaml
----
+
. Delete the Jaeger instance:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete jaeger jaeger -n <istio-system>
----
+
. Recreate the Jaeger instance from your copy of the custom resource file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f /tmp/jaeger-cr.yaml -n <istio-system>
----
+
. Delete the copy of the generated custom resource file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rm /tmp/jaeger-cr.yaml
----


.Procedure if Jaeger not installed as part of Red Hat Service Mesh

Before you begin, create a copy of your Jaeger custom resource file.

. Delete the Jaeger instance by deleting the custom resource file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f <jaeger-cr-file>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f jaeger-prod-elasticsearch.yaml
----
+
. Recreate your Jaeger instance from the backup copy of your custom resource file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <jaeger-cr-file>
----
+
. Validate that your pods have restarted:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n <jaeger-system> -w
----
+
