= Removing a cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can remove a cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure from
your cloud.

.Prerequisites

* Have a copy of the installation program that you used to deploy the cluster.
* Have the files that the installation program generated when you created your
cluster.

.Procedure

. From the computer that you used to install the cluster, run the following command:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install destroy cluster \
--dir=<installation_directory> --log-level=info <1> <2>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.
<2> To view different details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or `error` instead of `info`.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must specify the directory that contains the cluster definition files for
your cluster. The installation program requires the `metadata.json` file in this
directory to delete the cluster.
====

. Optional: Delete the `<installation_directory>` directory and the
{product-title} installation program.
