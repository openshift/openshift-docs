= Using environment variables for custom builds

To make environment variables available to the Custom build
process, you can add environment variables to the `customStrategy` definition
of the `BuildConfig`.

The environment variables defined there are passed to the pod that runs the
custom build.

.Procedure

To define a custom HTTP proxy to be used during build:

[source,yaml]
----
customStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "HTTP_PROXY"
      value: "http://myproxy.net:5187/"

----

Cluster administrators can also configure global build settings using Ansible.
endif::[]

You can also manage environment variables defined in the `BuildConfig` with the
`oc set env` command.
