= IPv6 networking with {microshift-short}

The {microshift-short} service defaults to IPv4 address families cluster-wide. However, IPv6 single-stack and IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking is available on supported platforms.

* When you set the values for IPv6 in the {microshift-short} configuration file and restart the service, settings managed by the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin are updated automatically.
* After migrating to dual-stack networking, both new and existing pods have dual-stack networking enabled.
* If you require cluster-wide IPv6 access, such as for the control plane and other services, use the following configuration examples. The {microshift-short} Multus Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin can enable IPv6 for pods.
* For dual-stack networking, each {microshift-short} cluster network and service network supports up to two values in the cluster and service network configuration parameters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Plan for IPv6 before starting {microshift-short} for the first time. Switching a cluster to and from different IP families is not supported unless you are migrating a cluster from default single-stack to dual-stack networking.

If you configure your networking for either IPv6 single stack or IPv4/IPv6 dual stack, you must restart application pods and services. Otherwise pods and services remain configured with the default IP family.
