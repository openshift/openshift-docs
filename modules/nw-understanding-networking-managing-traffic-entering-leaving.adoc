= Managing traffic entering and leaving the cluster

You need a way for external users to access your applications and for your applications to securely access external services. {product-title} provides several tools to manage this flow of traffic into and out of your cluster.

[id="exposing-applications-with-ingress-and-route-objects_{context}"]
== Exposing applications with Ingress and Route objects

To allow external traffic to reach services inside your cluster, you use an Ingress Controller. This component acts as the front door that directs incoming requests to the correct application. You define the traffic rules using one of two primary resources:

* Ingress: The standard Kubernetes resource for managing external access to services, typically for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

* `Route` object: A resource that provides the same functionality as Ingress but includes additional features like more advanced TLS termination options and traffic splitting. `Route` objects are specific to {product-title}.

[id="distributing-traffic-with-load-balancers_{context}"]
== Distributing traffic with Load Balancers

A Load Balancer provides a single, highly available IP address for directing traffic to your cluster. It typically runs outside the cluster on a cloud provider or using MetalLB on bare-metal infrastructure and distributes incoming requests across multiple nodes that are running the Ingress Controller.

This prevents any single node from becoming a bottleneck or a point of failure to ensure that your applications remain accessible.

[id="controlling-egress-traffic_{context}"]
== Controlling Egress traffic

Egress refers to outbound traffic that originates from a pod inside the cluster and is destined for an external system. {product-title} provides several mechanisms to manage this:

* EgressIP: You can assign a specific, predictable source IP address to all outbound traffic from a given project. This is useful when you need to access an external service like a database that has a firewall requiring you to allow specific source IPs.

* Egress Router: This is a dedicated pod that acts as a gateway for outbound traffic. It allows you to route connections through a single, controlled exit point.

* Egress Firewall: This acts as a cluster-level firewall for all outbound traffic. It enhances your security posture by allowing you to create rules that explicitly allow or deny connections from pods to specific external destinations.
