Deploy your `cloud-event-consumer` application container and subscribe the `cloud-event-consumer` application to PTP events posted by the `cloud-event-proxy` container in the pod managed by the PTP Operator.

Subscribe consumer applications to PTP events by sending a `POST` request to `\http://ptp-event-publisher-service-NODE_NAME.openshift-ptp.svc.cluster.local:9043/api/ocloudNotifications/v2/subscriptions` passing the appropriate subscription request payload.

[NOTE]
====
`9043` is the default port for the `cloud-event-proxy` container deployed in the PTP event producer pod.
You can configure a different port for your application as required.
