= Configuration of the monitor tab in Jaeger UI

Trace data contains rich information, and the data is normalized across instrumented languages and frameworks.
Therefore, additional metrics can be extracted from traces. These metrics are request count, duration, and error count (RED).
The metrics can be visualized in Jaeger console in the *Monitor* tab.

The metrics are derived from spans in the OpenTelemetry Collector that are scraped from the Collector by the Prometheus deployed in the user-workload monitoring stack.
The Jaeger UI queries these metrics from the Prometheus endpoint and visualizes them.

== OpenTelemetry Collector configuration

The OpenTelemetry Collector requires configuration of the `spanmetrics` connector that derives metrics from traces and exports the metrics in the Prometheus format.

.OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource for span RED
[source,yaml]
----
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1

----
<1> Creates the `ServiceMonitor` custom resource to enable scraping of the Prometheus exporter.
<2> The Spanmetrics connector receives traces and exports metrics.
<3> The OTLP receiver to receive spans in the OpenTelemetry protocol.
<4> The Prometheus exporter is used to export metrics in the Prometheus format.
<5> The Spanmetrics connector is configured as exporter in traces pipeline.
<6> The Spanmetrics connector is configured as receiver in metrics pipeline.

== Tempo configuration

The `TempoStack` custom resource must specify the following: the *Monitor* tab is enabled, and the Prometheus endpoint is set to the Thanos querier service to query the data from the user-defined monitoring stack.

.TempoStack custom resource with the enabled Monitor tab
[source,yaml]
----
kind:  TempoStack
apiVersion: tempo.grafana.com/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: simplest
spec:
  template:
    gateway:
      enabled: false <1>
    queryFrontend:
      jaegerQuery:

        monitorTab:
          enabled: true <2>
          prometheusEndpoint: https://thanos-querier.openshift-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9091 <3>
        ingress:
          type: route
----
<1> Gateway must be enabled because the Monitor tab is not supported thorough the gateway deployment.
<2> Enables the monitoring tab in the Jaeger console.
<3> The service name for Thanos Querier from user-workload monitoring.
