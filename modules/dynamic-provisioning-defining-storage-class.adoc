= Defining a StorageClass

`StorageClass` objects are currently a globally scoped object and must be
created by `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin` users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The ClusterStorageOperator may install a default StorageClass depending
on the platform in use. This StorageClass is owned and controlled by the
operator. It cannot be deleted or modified beyond defining annotations
and labels. If different behavior is desired, you must define a custom
StorageClass.
====

The following sections describe the basic object definition for a
StorageClass and specific examples for each of the supported plug-in types.
