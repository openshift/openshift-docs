= Understanding resource consumption in pipelines

Each task consists of a number of required steps to be executed in a particular order defined in the `steps` field of the `Task` resource. Every task runs as a pod, and each step runs as a container within that pod.

The `Resources` field in the `steps` spec specifies the limits for resource consumption.
By default, the resource requests for the CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage are set to `BestEffort` (zero) values or to the minimums set through limit ranges in that project.

.Example configuration of resource requests and limits for a step
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  steps:
  - name: <step_name>
    computeResources:
      requests:
        memory: 2Gi
        cpu: 600m
      limits:
        memory: 4Gi
        cpu: 900m
----

When the `LimitRange` parameter and the minimum values for container resource requests are specified in the project in which the pipeline and task runs are executed, {pipelines-title} looks at all the `LimitRange` values in the project and uses the minimum values instead of zero.
