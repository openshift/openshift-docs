= Bootstrap VM cannot boot up the cluster nodes

During the deployment, it is possible for the bootstrap VM to fail to boot the cluster nodes, which prevents the VM from provisioning the nodes with the {op-system} image. This scenario can arise due to:

* A problem with the `install-config.yaml` file.
* Issues with out-of-band network access via the baremetal network.

To verify the issue, there are three containers related to `ironic`:

* `ironic-api`
* `ironic-conductor`
* `ironic-inspector`

.Procedure

. Log in to the bootstrap VM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh core@172.22.0.2
----

. To check the container logs, execute the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[core@localhost ~]$ sudo podman logs -f <container-name>
----
+
Replace `<container-name>` with one of `ironic-api`, `ironic-conductor`, or `ironic-inspector`. If you encounter an issue where the control plane nodes are not booting up via PXE, check the `ironic-conductor` pod. The `ironic-conductor` pod contains the most detail about the attempt to boot the cluster nodes, because it attempts to log in to the node over IPMI.

.Potential reason
The cluster nodes might be in the `ON` state when deployment started.

.Solution
Power off the {product-title} cluster nodes before you begin the
installation over IPMI:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -P <password> -H <out-of-band-ip> power off
----
