= About the must-gather tool

The `oc adm must-gather` CLI command collects the information from your cluster
that is most likely needed for debugging issues, such as:

* Resource definitions
* Audit logs
* Service logs

You can specify one or more images when you run the command by including the
`--image` argument. When you specify an image, the tool collects data related to
that feature or product.

When you run `oc adm must-gather`, a new Pod is created on the cluster. The data
is collected on that Pod and saved in a new directory that starts with
`must-gather.local`. This directory is created in the current working
directory.

// todo: table or ref module listing available images?
