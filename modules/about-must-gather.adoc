= About the must-gather tool

The `oc adm must-gather` CLI command collects the information from your cluster that is most likely needed for debugging issues, including:

* Resource definitions
* Service logs

By default, the `oc adm must-gather` command uses the default plugin image and writes into `./must-gather.local`.

Alternatively, you can collect specific information by running the command with the appropriate arguments as described in the following sections:

* To collect data related to one or more specific features, use the `--image` argument with an image, as listed in a following section.
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v{HCOVersion}
----

* To collect the audit logs, use the `-- /usr/bin/gather_audit_logs` argument, as described in a following section.
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather -- /usr/bin/gather_audit_logs
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Audit logs are not collected as part of the default set of information to reduce the size of the files.
====

When you run `oc adm must-gather`, a new pod with a random name is created in a new project on the cluster. The data is collected on that pod and saved in a new directory that starts with `must-gather.local` in the current working directory.

For example:

[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE                      NAME                 READY   STATUS      RESTARTS      AGE
...
openshift-must-gather-5drcj    must-gather-bklx4    2/2     Running     0             72s
openshift-must-gather-5drcj    must-gather-s8sdh    2/2     Running     0             72s
...
----
// todo: table or ref module listing available images?
Optionally, you can run the `oc adm must-gather` command in a specific namespace by using the `--run-namespace` option.

For example:

[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --run-namespace <namespace> \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v{HCOVersion}
