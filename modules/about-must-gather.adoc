= About the must-gather tool

The `oc adm must-gather` CLI command collects the information from your cluster that is most likely needed for debugging issues, such as:

* Resource definitions
* Audit logs
* Service logs

You can specify one or more images when you run the command by including the `--image` argument. When you specify an image, the tool collects data related to that feature or product.

When you run `oc adm must-gather`, a new pod is created on the cluster. The data is collected on that pod and saved in a new directory that starts with `must-gather.local`. This directory is created in the current working directory.

// todo: table or ref module listing available images?
