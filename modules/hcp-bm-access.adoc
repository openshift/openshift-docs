= Accessing the hosted cluster

You can access the hosted cluster by either getting the `kubeconfig` file and `kubeadmin` credential directly from resources, or by using the `hcp` command line interface to generate a `kubeconfig` file.

.Prerequisites

To access the hosted cluster by getting the `kubeconfig` file and credentials directly from resources, you need to be familiar with the access secrets for hosted control plane clusters. The secrets are stored in the hosted cluster (hosting) namespace. The _hosted cluster (hosting)_ namespace contains hosted cluster resources, and the _hosted control plane_ namespace is where the hosted control plane runs.

The secret name formats are as follows:

** `kubeconfig` secret: `<hosted_cluster_namespace>-<name>-admin-kubeconfig`. For example, `clusters-hypershift-demo-admin-kubeconfig`.
** `kubeadmin` password secret: `<hosted_cluster_namespace>-<name>-kubeadmin-password`. For example, `clusters-hypershift-demo-kubeadmin-password`.

The `kubeconfig` secret contains a Base64-encoded `kubeconfig` field, which you can decode and save into a file to use with the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig <hosted_cluster_name>.kubeconfig get nodes
----

The `kubeadmin` password secret is also Base64-encoded. You can decode it and use the password to log in to the API server or console of the hosted cluster.

.Procedure

* To access the hosted cluster by using the `hcp` CLI to generate the `kubeconfig` file, take the following steps:

. Generate the `kubeconfig` file by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ hcp create kubeconfig --namespace <hosted_cluster_namespace> --name <hosted_cluster_name> > <hosted_cluster_name>.kubeconfig
----

. After you save the `kubeconfig` file, you can access the hosted cluster by entering the following example command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig <hosted_cluster_name>.kubeconfig get nodes
----
