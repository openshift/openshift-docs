= Creating a MachineConfig object by using Butane

You can use Butane to produce a `MachineConfig` object so that you can configure worker or control plane nodes at installation time or via the Machine Config Operator.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the `butane` utility.

.Procedure

. Create a Butane config file. The following example creates a file named `99-worker-custom.bu` that configures the system console to show kernel debug messages and specifies custom settings for the chrony time service:
+
[source,yaml]
----
variant: openshift
version: 4.9.0
metadata:
  name: 99-worker-custom
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
openshift:
  kernel_arguments:
    - loglevel=7
storage:
  files:
    - path: /etc/chrony.conf
      mode: 0644
      overwrite: true
      contents:
        inline: |
          pool 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst
          driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
          makestep 1.0 3
          rtcsync
          logdir /var/log/chrony
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `99-worker-custom.bu` file is set to create a machine config for worker nodes. To deploy on control plane nodes, change the role from `worker` to `master`. To do both, you could repeat the whole procedure using different file names for the two types of deployments.
====

. Create a `MachineConfig` object by giving Butane the file that you created in the previous step:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ butane 99-worker-custom.bu -o ./99-worker-custom.yaml
----
+
A `MachineConfig` object YAML file is created for you to finish configuring your machines.
. Save the Butane config in case you need to update the `MachineConfig` object in the future.
. If the cluster is not running yet, generate manifest files and add the `MachineConfig` object YAML file to the `openshift` directory. If the cluster is already running, apply the file as follows:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f 99-worker-custom.yaml
