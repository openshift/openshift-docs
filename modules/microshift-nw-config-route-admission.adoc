= Configuring the route admission policy

By default, {microshift-short} allows routes in multiple namespaces to use the same hostname. You can prevent routes from claiming the same hostname in different namespaces by configuring the route admission policy.

.Prerequisites

* You installed {microshift-short}.
* You created a {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file.
* You installed the {oc-first}.
+
[TIP]
====
If you complete all the configurations that you need to make in the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file at the same time, you can minimize system restarts.

.Procedure

. To prevent routes in different namespaces from claiming the same hostname, update the `namespaceOwnership` field value to `Strict` in the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file. See the following example:
+
.Example `config.yaml` route admission policy
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
ingress:
  routeAdmissionPolicy:
    namespaceOwnership: Strict <1>
# ...
----
<1> Prevents routes in different namespaces from claiming the same host. Valid values are `Strict` and `InterNamespaceAllowed`. If you delete the value in a customized `config.yaml`, the `InterNamespaceAllowed` value is set automatically.
. To apply the configuration, restart the {microshift-short} service by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart microshift
