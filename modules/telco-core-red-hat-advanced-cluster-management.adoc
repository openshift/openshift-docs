= Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
+
--
{rh-rhacm-first} provides Multi Cluster Engine (MCE) installation and ongoing {ztp} lifecycle management for deployed clusters.
You manage cluster configuration and upgrades declaratively by applying `Policy` custom resources (CRs) to clusters during maintenance windows.

You apply policies with the {rh-rhacm} policy controller as managed by {cgu-operator-full}.
Configuration, upgrades, and cluster status are managed through the policy controller.

When installing managed clusters, {rh-rhacm} applies labels and initial ignition configuration to individual nodes in support of custom disk partitioning, allocation of roles, and allocation to machine config pools.
You define these configurations with `SiteConfig` or `ClusterInstance` CRs.

Limits and requirements::

* Hub cluster sizing is discussed in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.11/html-single/install/index#sizing-your-cluster[Sizing your cluster].

* {rh-rhacm} scaling limits are described in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.11/html-single/install/index#performance-and-scalability[Performance and Scalability].

Engineering considerations::
* When managing multiple clusters with unique content per installation, site, or deployment, using {rh-rhacm} hub templating is strongly recommended.
{rh-rhacm} hub templating allows you to apply a consistent set of policies to clusters while providing for unique values per installation.
