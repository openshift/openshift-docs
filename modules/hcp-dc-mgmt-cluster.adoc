= Setting up a management cluster for {hcp} in a disconnected environment

To set up an {product-title} management cluster, you need to ensure that the {mce} is installed. The {mce-short} plays a crucial role in deploying clusters across providers.

.Prerequisites

* There must be bidirectional connectivity between the management cluster and the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) of the target Bare Metal Host (BMH). As an alternative, you follow a Boot It Yourself approach through the Agent provider.

* The hosted cluster must be able to resolve and reach the API hostname of the management cluster hostname and `{asterisk}.apps` hostname. Here is an example of the API hostname of the management cluster and `{asterisk}.apps` hostname:

** `api.management-cluster.internal.domain.com`
** `console-openshift-console.apps.management-cluster.internal.domain.com`

* The management cluster must be able to resolve and reach the API and `{asterisk}.apps` hostname of the hosted cluster. Here is an example of the API hostname of the hosted cluster and `{asterisk}.apps` hostname:

** `api.sno-hosted-cluster-1.internal.domain.com`
** `console-openshift-console.apps.sno-hosted-cluster-1.internal.domain.com`

.Procedure

. Install {mce-short} 2.4 or later on an {product-title} cluster. You can install {mce-short} as an Operator from the {product-title} OperatorHub. The HyperShift Operator is included with {mce-short}. For more information about installing {mce-short}, see "Installing and upgrading multicluster engine operator" in the Red{nbsp}Hat Advanced Cluster Management documentation.

. Ensure that the HyperShift Operator is installed. The HyperShift Operator is automatically included with {mce-short}, but if you need to manually install it, follow the steps in "Manually enabling the hypershift-addon managed cluster add-on for local-cluster".

.Next steps

Next, configure the web server.
