= Gathering CRI-O journald unit logs

If you experience CRI-O issues, you can obtain CRI-O journald unit logs from a node.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Your API service is still functional.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have the fully qualified domain names of the control plane, or master machines.

.Procedure

. Gather CRI-O journald unit logs. The following example collects logs from all master nodes within the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm node-logs --role=master -u crio
----

. Gather CRI-O journald unit logs from a specific node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm node-logs <node_name> -u crio
----

. If the API is not functional, review the logs using SSH instead. Replace `<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` with appropriate values:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> journalctl -b -f -u crio.service
----
+
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} {product-version} cluster nodes running {op-system-first} are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Accessing cluster nodes using SSH is not recommended and nodes will be tainted as _accessed_. Before attempting to collect diagnostic data over SSH, review whether the data collected by running `oc adm must gather` and other `oc` commands is sufficient instead. However, if the {product-title} API is not available, or the kubelet is not properly functioning on the target node, `oc` operations will be impacted. In such situations, it is possible to access nodes using `ssh core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`.
