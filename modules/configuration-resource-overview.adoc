= About Configuration Resources in {product-title}

You perform many customization and configuration tasks after you deploy your
cluster, including configuring networking and setting your identity provider.

In {product-title}, you modify Configuration Resources to determine the behavior
of these integrations. The Configuration Resources are controlled by Operators
that are managed by the Cluster Version Operator, which manages all of the
Operators that run your cluster's control plane.

You can customize the following Configuration Resources:

|Authentication

|Samples
| * *ManagementState:*
** *Managed.* The operator updates the samples as the configuration dictates.
** *Unmanaged.* The operator ignores updates to the samples resource object and
any imagestreams or templates in the `openshift` namespace.
** *Removed.* The operator removes the set of managed imagestreams
and templates in the `openshift` namespace. It ignores new samples created by
the cluster administrator or any samples in the skipped lists. After the removals are
complete, the operator works like it is in the `Unmanaged` state and ignores
any watch events on the sample resources, imagestreams, or templates. It
operates on secrets to facilitate the CENTOS to RHEL switch. There are some
caveats around concurrent create and removal.
* *Samples Registry:* Overrides the registry from which images are imported.
* *Architecture:* Place holder to choose an architecture type. Currently only x86
is supported.
* *Skipped Imagestreams:* Imagestreams that are in the operator’s
inventory, but that the cluster administrator wants the operator to ignore or not manage.
* *Skipped Templates:* Templates that are in the operator’s inventory, but that
the cluster administrator wants the operator to ignore or not manage.

While you can complete many other customizations and configure other integrations
with an {product-title} cluster, configuring these resources is a common first
step after you deploy a cluster.

Like all Operators, the Configuration Resources are governed by
Custom Resource Definitions (CRD). You customize the CRD for each
Configuration Resource that you want to modify in your cluster.
