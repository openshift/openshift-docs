= Granting `cluster-admin` access

As the user who created the cluster, add the `cluster-admin` user role to your account to have the maximum administrator privileges. These privileges are not automatically assigned to your user account when you create the cluster.

Additionally, only the user who created the cluster can grant cluster access to other `cluster-admin` or `dedicated-admin` users. Users with `dedicated-admin` access have fewer privileges. As a best practice, limit the number of `cluster-admin` users to as few as possible.

.Prerequisites

* You have added an identity provider (IDP) to your cluster.
* You have the IDP user name for the user you are creating.
* You are logged in to the cluster.

.Procedure

. Give your user `cluster-admin` privileges:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa grant user cluster-admin --user=<idp_user_name> --cluster=<cluster_name>
----
+
. Verify your user is listed as a cluster administrator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list users --cluster=<cluster_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
GROUP             NAME
cluster-admins    rh-rosa-test-user
dedicated-admins  rh-rosa-test-user
----
+
. Enter the following command to verify that your user now has `cluster-admin` access. A cluster administrator can run this command without errors, but a dedicated administrator cannot.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get all -n openshift-apiserver
----
