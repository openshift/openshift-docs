= Creating a local block persistent volume

If you intend to import a virtual machine image into block storage with a data volume, you must have an available local block persistent volume.

Create a local block persistent volume (PV) on a node by populating a file and
mounting it as a loop device. You can then reference this loop device in a
PV manifest as a `Block` volume and use it as a block device for a
virtual machine image.

.Procedure

. Log in as root user to the node on which to create the local PV. This procedure
uses `node01` for its examples.

. Create a file and populate it with null characters so that it can be used as a block device.
The following example creates a file `loop10` with a size of 2Gb (20 100Mb blocks):
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dd if=/dev/zero of=loop10 bs=100M count=20
----

. Mount the `loop10` file as a loop device as in the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# losetup /path/loop10 loop10 <1>
----
<1> Specify the path of the loop device and the loop device file name.

. Create a `PersistentVolume` manifest that references the mounted loop device.

----
<1> The file name of the persistent volume created in the previous step.
