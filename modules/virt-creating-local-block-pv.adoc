= Creating a local block persistent volume

Create a local block persistent volume (PV) on a node by populating a file and
mounting it as a loop device. You can then reference this loop device in a
PV manifest as a `Block` volume and use it as a block device for a
virtual machine image.

.Procedure

. Log in as `root` to the node on which to create the local PV. This procedure
uses `node01` for its examples.

. Create a file and populate it with null characters so that it can be used as a block device.
The following example creates a file `loop10` with a size of 2Gb (20 100Mb blocks):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=<loop10> bs=100M count=20
----

. Mount the `loop10` file as a loop device.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ losetup </dev/loop10>d3 <loop10> <1> <2>
----
<1> File path where the loop device is mounted.
<2> The file created in the previous step to be mounted as the loop device.

. Create a `PersistentVolume` manifest that references the mounted loop device.
