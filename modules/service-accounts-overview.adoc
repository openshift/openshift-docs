= Service accounts overview

A service account is an {product-title} account that allows a component to
directly access the API. Service accounts are API objects that exist within each project.
Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API
access without sharing a regular user's credentials.

When you use the {product-title} CLI or web console, your API token
authenticates you to the API. You can associate a component with a service account
so that they can access the API without using a regular user's credentials.

For example, service accounts can allow:

* Replication controllers to make API calls to create or delete pods.
* Applications inside containers to make API calls for discovery purposes.
* External applications to make API calls for monitoring or integration purposes.

Each service account's user name is derived from its project and name:

[source,text]
----
system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name>
----

Every service account is also a member of two groups:

|===

|Group
|Description

|system:serviceaccounts
|Includes all service accounts in the system.

|system:serviceaccounts:<project>
|Includes all service accounts in the
specified project.

|===

Each service account automatically contains two secrets:

* An API token
* Credentials for the OpenShift Container Registry

The generated API token and registry credentials do not expire, but you can
revoke them by deleting the secret. When you delete the secret, a new one is
automatically generated to take its place.
