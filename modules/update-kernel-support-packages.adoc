= Updating kernel support packages in offline mode

Collector monitors the runtime activity for each node in your secured clusters.
To monitor the activities, Collector requires probes in the form of eBPF programs.

With the `CORE_BPF` collection method, the probe is not specific to any kernel version, and can still be used after the underlying kernel
has been updated. This collection method does not require you to provide or update a support package.

Instead, when you use the collection method `EBPF`, the probes are specific to the Linux kernel version installed on the host.
The Collector image contains a set of built-in probes for the kernels supported at release time. However, later kernels will require newer probes.

When {product-title} runs in normal mode (connected to the internet), Collector automatically downloads a new probe if the required probe is not built in.

In offline mode, you can manually download packages containing probes for all recent and supported Linux kernel versions and upload them to Central.
Collectors then download these probes from Central.

Collector checks for the new probes in the following order. It checks:

. The existing Collector image.
. The kernel support package (if you have uploaded one to Central).
. A Red{nbsp}Hat-operated server available on the internet.
Collector uses Central's network connection to check and download the probes.

If Collector does not get new probes after checking, it reports a `CrashLoopBackoff` event.

If your network configuration restricts outbound traffic, you can manually download packages containing probes for all recent and supported Linux kernel versions and upload them to Central. Collectors then download these probes from Central, thus avoiding any outbound internet access.
