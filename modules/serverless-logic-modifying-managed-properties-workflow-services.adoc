= Managed properties in workflow services

The {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} uses managed properties to control essential runtime behavior. These values are stored separately and override user-defined properties during each reconciliation cycle. You can also apply custom managed properties globally by updating the `SonataFlowPlatform` resource within the same namespace.

Some properties used by the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} are managed properties and cannot be changed through the standard user configuration. These properties are stored in a dedicated `ConfigMap`, typically named `<workflow-name>-managed-props`. If you try to modify any managed property directly, the Operator will automatically revert it to its default value, but it will preserve your other user-defined changes.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot override the default managed properties set by the Operator using global managed properties. These defaults are always enforced during reconciliation.

The following table lists some core managed properties as an example:
