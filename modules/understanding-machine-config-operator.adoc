= Understanding the Machine Config Operator

{product-title} {product-version} integrates both
operating system and cluster management. Because the cluster manages its own
updates, including updates to {op-system-first} on cluster nodes,
{product-title} provides an opinionated lifecycle management
experience that simplifies the orchestration of node upgrades.

{product-title} employs three daemon sets and controllers to
simplify node management. These daemon sets orchestrate operating system updates
and configuration changes to the hosts by using standard Kubernetes-style
constructs. They include:

* The `machine-config-controller`, which coordinates machine upgrades from the control
plane. It monitors all of the cluster nodes and orchestrates their configuration
updates.
* The `machine-config-daemon` daemon set, which runs on
each node in the cluster and updates a machine to configuration as defined by
machine config and as instructed by the MachineConfigController. When the node detects
a change, it drains off its pods, applies the update, and reboots. These changes
come in the form of Ignition configuration files that apply the specified
machine configuration and control kubelet configuration. The update itself is
delivered in a container. This process is key to the success of managing
{product-title} and {op-system} updates together.
* The `machine-config-server` daemon set, which provides the Ignition config files
to control plane nodes as they join the cluster.

The machine configuration is a subset of the Ignition configuration. The
`machine-config-daemon` reads the machine configuration to see if it needs to do
an OSTree update or if it must apply a series of systemd kubelet file changes,
configuration changes, or other changes to the operating system or {product-title}
configuration.

When you perform node management operations, you create or modify a
`KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR).
//See https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/blob/master/docs/KubeletConfigDesign.md[KubeletConfigDesign] for details.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To prevent control plane nodes from autorebooting after machine config changes are applied, you must pause the autoreboot process by setting the `spec.paused` field to `true` in the machine pool config.
