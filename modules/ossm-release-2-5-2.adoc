== Fixed issues
// The explanations of these issues have been reviewed/approved in previous releases.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-6331[OSSM-6331] Previously, the `smcp.general.logging.componentLevels` spec accepted invalid `LogLevel` values, and the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource was still created. Now, the terminal shows an error message if an invalid value is used, and the control plane is not created.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-6290[OSSM-6290] Previously, the **Project** filter drop-down of the **Istio Config** list page did not work correctly. All `istio config` items were displayed from all namespaces even if you selected a specific project from the drop-down menu. Now, only the `istio config` items that belong to the selected project in the filter drop-down are displayed.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-6298[OSSM-6298] Previously, when you clicked an item reference within the {SMPlugin}, the console sometimes performed multiple redirects before opening the desired page. As a result, navigating back to the previous page that was open in the console caused your web browser to open the wrong page. Now, these redirects do not occur, and clicking *Back* in a web browser opens the correct page.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-6299[OSSM-6299] Previously, in {product-title} 4.15, when you clicked the **Node graph** menu option of any node menu within the traffic graph, the node graph was not displayed. Instead, the page refreshed with the same traffic graph. Now, clicking the **Node graph** menu option correctly displays the node graph.
