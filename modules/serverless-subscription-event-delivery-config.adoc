= Configuring event delivery failure parameters using subscriptions

After you have created a channel and an event sink, you can create a subscription to enable event delivery. You can configure event delivery parameters for individual subscriptions by modifying the `delivery` settings for a `Subscription` object. Knative Eventing provides configuration parameters for subscriptions that you can use to control what happens to events in cases where events fail to be delivered.

.Example `Subscription` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: <subscription_name>
  namespace: <subscription_namespace>
spec:
  delivery:
    deadLetterSink: <1>
      ref:
        apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
        kind: Service
        name: <sink_name>
    backoffDelay: <duration> <2>
    backoffPolicy: <policy_type> <3>
    retry: <integer> <4>
----
<1> Configuration settings to enable using a dead letter sink. This tells the subscription what happens to events that cannot be delivered to the subscriber.
+
When this is configured, events that fail to be delivered are sent to the dead letter sink destination. The destination can be a Knative service or a URI.
<2> You can set the `backoffDelay` delivery parameter to specify the time delay before an event delivery retry is attempted after a failure. The duration of the `backoffDelay` parameter is specified using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations[ISO 8601] format. For example, `PT1S` specifies a 1 second delay.
<3> The `backoffPolicy` delivery parameter can be used to specify the retry back off policy. The policy can be specified as either `linear` or `exponential`. When using the `linear` back off policy, the back off delay is the time interval specified between retries. When using the `exponential` back off policy, the back off delay is equal to `backoffDelay*2^<numberOfRetries>`.
<4> The number of times that event delivery is retried before the event is sent to the dead letter sink.
