= About creating heterogeneous node pools on agent hosted clusters

A node pool is a group of nodes within a cluster that share the same configuration. Heterogeneous node pools are pools that have different configurations, allowing you to create pools optimized for various workloads.

You can create heterogeneous node pools on the agent platform. It enables clusters to run diverse machine types, for example, `x86_64` or `ppc64le`, within a single hosted cluster.

To create a heterogeneous node pool, perform the following general steps, as described in the following sections:

* Create an `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource (CR) that informs the Operator how much storage is needed for components such as the database and filesystem. The CR also defines which {product-title} versions to maintain.
* Create an agent cluster.
* Create the heterogeneous node pool.
* Configure DNS for hosted control planes
* Create an `InfraEnv` custom resource (CR) for each architecture.
* Add agents to the heterogeneous cluster.
