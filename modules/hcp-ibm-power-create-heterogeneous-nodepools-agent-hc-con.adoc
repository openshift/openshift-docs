= About creating heterogeneous node pools on agent hosted clusters

A node pool is a group of nodes within a cluster that share the same configuration. Heterogeneous node pools have different configurations, so that you can create pools and optimize them for various workloads.

You can create heterogeneous node pools on the agent platform. The platform enables clusters to run diverse machine types, such as `x86_64` or `ppc64le`, within a single hosted cluster.

Creating a heterogeneous node pool requires completion of the following general steps:

* Create an `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource (CR) that informs the Operator how much storage it needs for components such as the database and filesystem. The CR also defines which {product-title} versions to support.
* Create an agent cluster.
* Create the heterogeneous node pool.
* Configure DNS for hosted control planes
* Create an `InfraEnv` custom resource (CR) for each architecture.
* Add agents to the heterogeneous cluster.
