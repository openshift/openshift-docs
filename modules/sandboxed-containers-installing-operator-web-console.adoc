= Installing the {sandboxed-containers-operator} using the web console

You can install the {sandboxed-containers-operator} from the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* You have {product-title} {product-version} installed.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Open a browser window and log in to the {product-title} web console.

. From the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Operators* â†’ *OperatorHub*.

. In the *Filter by keyword* field, type `OpenShift sandboxed containers`.

. Select the *{sandboxed-containers-first}* tile.

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:
.. Select *preview-1.0* from the list of available *Update Channel* options. This ensures that you install the version of {sandboxed-containers-first} that is compatible with your {product-title} version.
.. For *Installed Namespace*, ensure that the Operator recommended namespace option is selected. This installs the Operator in the mandatory `openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator` namespace, which is automatically created if it does not exist.
+
[NOTE]
====
Attempting to install the {sandboxed-containers-operator} in a namespace other than `openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator` causes the installation to fail.
====
.. For *Approval Strategy*, ensure that *Automatic*, which is the default value, is selected. {sandboxed-containers-first} automatically updates when a new z-stream release is available.

. Click *Install* to make the Operator available to the {sandboxed-containers-first} namespace.

The {sandboxed-containers-operator} is now installed on your cluster. You can trigger the Operator by enabling the runtime on your cluster. You can do this by creating the `KataConfig` custom resource using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
