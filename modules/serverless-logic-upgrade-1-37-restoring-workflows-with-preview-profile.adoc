= Restoring workflows with the preview profile

After upgrading the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} to version 1.37.0, you must restore workflows that use the preview profile to complete the upgrade process.

.Procedure

. If the workflow is configured to use persistence, back up the workflow database. Ensure that the database backup includes all database objects, not just the table information.

. Ensure that you have a copy of the corresponding SonataFlow custom resource (CR) and any other Kubernetes resources created for the workflow. For example, if you are using custom property configurations, ensure that you have a copy of the user-provided `ConfigMap` containing the `application.properties` file.

. Delete the workflow by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f <workflow_name> -n <target_namespace>
