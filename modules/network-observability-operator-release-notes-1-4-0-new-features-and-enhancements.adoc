= Network observability release notes 1.4.0 new features and enhancements

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the following new features and enhancements in the Network Observability Operator 1.4.0 release.

[id="network-observability-enhanced-configuration-and-ui-1.4_{context}"]
== Notable enhancements
The 1.4 release of the Network Observability Operator adds improvements and new capabilities to the {product-title} web console plugin and the Operator configuration.

[id="web-console-enhancements-1.4_{context}"]
== Web console enhancements:
* In the *Query Options*, the *Duplicate flows* checkbox is added to choose whether or not to show duplicated flows.
* You can now filter source and destination traffic with image:arrow-up-long-solid.png[,10] *One-way*, image:arrow-up-long-solid.png[,10] image:arrow-down-long-solid.png[,10] *Back-and-forth*, and *Swap* filters.
* The network observability metrics dashboards in *Observe* -> *Dashboards* -> *NetObserv* and *NetObserv / Health* are modified as follows:
** The *NetObserv* dashboard shows top bytes, packets sent, packets received per nodes, namespaces, and workloads. Flow graphs are removed from this dashboard.
** The *NetObserv / Health* dashboard shows flows overhead as well as top flow rates per nodes, namespaces, and workloads.
** Infrastructure and Application metrics are shown in a split-view for namespaces and workloads.

[id="configuration-enhancements-1.4_{context}"]
== Configuration enhancements:
* You now have the option to specify different namespaces for any configured ConfigMap or Secret reference, such as in certificates configuration.
* The `spec.processor.clusterName` parameter is added so that the name of the cluster appears in the flows data. This is useful in a multi-cluster context. When using {product-title}, leave empty to make it automatically determined.

[id="network-observability-without-loki-1.4_{context}"]
== Network observability without Loki
The Network Observability Operator is now functional and usable without Loki. If Loki is not installed, it can only export flows to KAFKA or IPFIX format and provide metrics in the network observability metrics dashboards.


For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/installing-operators.adoc#network-observability-without-loki_network_observability[Network observability without Loki]


[id="network-observability-dns-tracking-1.4_{context}"]
== DNS tracking
In 1.4, the Network Observability Operator makes use of eBPF tracepoint hooks to enable DNS tracking. You can monitor your network, conduct security analysis, and troubleshoot DNS issues in the *Network Traffic* and *Overview* pages in the web console.


For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/observing-network-traffic.adoc#network-observability-dns-overview_nw-observe-network-traffic[Configuring DNS tracking]
* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/observing-network-traffic.adoc#network-observability-dns-tracking_nw-observe-network-traffic[Working with DNS tracking]


[id="SR-IOV-configuration-1.4_{context}"]
== SR-IOV support
You can now collect traffic from a cluster with Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) device.


For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/network-observability-secondary-networks.adoc#network-observability-SR-IOV-config_network-observability-secondary-networks[Configuring the monitoring of SR-IOV interface traffic]


[id="IPFIX-support-1.4_{context}"]
== IPFIX exporter support
You can now export eBPF-enriched network flows to the IPFIX collector.


For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/configuring-operator.adoc#network-observability-enriched-flows_network_observability[Export enriched network flow data]


[id="network-observability-packet-drop-1.4_{context}"]
== Packet drops
In the 1.4 release of the Network Observability Operator, eBPF tracepoint hooks are used to enable packet drop tracking. You can now detect and analyze the cause for packet drops and make decisions to optimize network performance. In {product-title} 4.14 and later, both host drops and OVS drops are detected. In {product-title} 4.13, only host drops are detected.


For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/observing-network-traffic.adoc#network-observability-pktdrop-overview_nw-observe-network-traffic[Configuring packet drop tracking]
* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/observing-network-traffic.adoc#network-observability-packet-drops_nw-observe-network-traffic[Working with packet drops]


[id="s390x-architecture-support_{context}"]
== s390x architecture support
Network Observability Operator can now run on `s390x` architecture. Previously it ran on `amd64`, `ppc64le`, or `arm64`.
