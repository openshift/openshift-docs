= Return non-bare-metal clusters to the late binding pool

If you are using late binding managed clusters without `BareMetalHosts`, you must complete additional manual steps to delete a late binding cluster and return the nodes back to the Discovery ISO.

For late binding managed clusters without `BareMetalHosts`, removing cluster information does not automatically return all nodes to the Discovery ISO.

.Procedure

To unbind the non-bare-metal nodes with late binding, complete the following steps:

. Remove the cluster information. For more information, see _Removing a cluster from management_.

. Clean the root disks.

. Reboot manually with the Discovery ISO.
