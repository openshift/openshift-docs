= Installing the {JaegerOperator} Operator

You can install the {JaegerOperator} Operator through the link:https://operatorhub.io/[*OperatorHub*].

By default, the Operator is installed in the `openshift-operators` project.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* If you require persistent storage, you must install the {es-op} before installing the {JaegerOperator} Operator.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Search for the {JaegerOperator} Operator by entering *distributed tracing platform* in the search field.

. Select the *{JaegerOperator}* Operator, which is *provided by Red Hat*, to display information about the Operator.

. Click *Install*.

. For the *Update channel* on the *Install Operator* page, select *stable* to automatically update the Operator when new versions are released.
//If you select a maintenance channel, for example, *Stable*, you will receive bug fixes and security patches for the length of the support cycle for that version.

. Accept the default *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` project and makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.

. Accept the default *Automatic* approval strategy.

[NOTE]
====
If you accept this default, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of this Operator when a new version of the Operator becomes available.

If you select *Manual* updates, the OLM creates an update request when a new version of the Operator becomes available. To update the Operator to the new version, you must then manually approve the update request as a cluster administrator. The *Manual* approval strategy requires a cluster administrator to manually approve Operator installation and subscription.
====

. Click *Install*.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. On the *Installed Operators* page, select the `openshift-operators` project. Wait for the *Succeeded* status of the {JaegerOperator} Operator before continuing.
