= Installing the {JaegerName} Operator

To install {JaegerName}, you use the link:https://operatorhub.io/[OperatorHub] to install the {JaegerName} Operator.

By default the Operator is installed in the `openshift-operators` project.

.Prerequisites
* Access to the {product-title} web console.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* If you require persistent storage, you must also install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator before installing the {JaegerName} Operator.

[WARNING]
====
Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type *distributing tracing platform* into the filter to locate the {JaegerName} Operator.

. Click the *{JaegerName} Operator* provided by Red Hat to display information about the Operator.

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page, select the *stable* Update Channel. This will automatically update your Operator as new versions are released.
//If you select a maintenance channel, for example, *Stable*, you will receive bug fixes and security patches for the length of the support cycle for that version.

. Accept the default *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` project and makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.

* Accept the default *Automatic* approval strategy. By accepting the default, when a new version of this Operator is available, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention. If you select *Manual* updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, the OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.

[NOTE]
====
The Manual approval strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator install and subscription process.

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Subscription Overview* page, select the `openshift-operators` project. Wait until you see that the {ProductName} Operator shows a status of "InstallSucceeded" before continuing.
