= PipelineRun

A _PipelineRun_ instantiates a Pipeline for execution with specific inputs, outputs, and execution parameters on a cluster. A corresponding TaskRun is created for each Task automatically in the PipelineRun.

All the Tasks in the Pipeline are executed in the defined sequence until all Tasks are successful or a Task fails. The `status` field tracks and stores the progress of each TaskRun in the PipelineRun for monitoring and auditing purpose.

The following example shows a PipelineRun to run the `build-and-deploy` Pipeline  with relevant resources and parameters:
