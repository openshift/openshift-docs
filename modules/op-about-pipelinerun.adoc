= PipelineRun

A `PipelineRun` is a type of resource that binds a pipeline, workspaces, credentials, and a set of parameter values specific to a scenario to run the CI/CD workflow.

A _pipeline run_ is the running instance of a pipeline. It instantiates a pipeline for execution with specific inputs, outputs, and execution parameters on a cluster. It also creates a task run for each task in the pipeline run.

The pipeline runs the tasks sequentially until they are complete or a task fails. The `status` field tracks and the progress of each task run and stores it for monitoring and auditing purposes.

The following example runs the `build-and-deploy` pipeline with relevant resources and parameters:
