= Build run status

[role="_abstract"]
The `BuildRun` resource updates whenever the image building status changes, as shown in the following examples:

.Example: BuildRun with Unknown status
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get buildrun buildah-buildrun-mp99r
NAME                    SUCCEEDED   REASON    STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
buildah-buildrun-mp99r  Unknown     Unknown      1s
----

.Example: BuildRun with True status
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get buildrun buildah-buildrun-mp99r
NAME                   SUCCEEDED   REASON     STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
buildah-buildrun-mp99r  True        Succeeded      29m       20m
----

A `BuildRun` resource stores the status-related information in the `status.conditions` field. For example, a condition with the type `Succeeded` indicates that resources have successfully completed their operation. The `status.conditions` field includes significant information like status, reason, and message for the `BuildRun` resource.
