[id="installing-rhv-inspect-and-modify-params-in-install-config_{context}"]
= Inspecting and modifying parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file

With the `install-config` subcommand, the installation program used your responses to create the `install-config.yaml` file in the assets directory you specified. For example:

----
 ~/my-custom-config/install-config.yaml
----


IMPORTANT: To install and run {product-title} on {rh-virtualization-first} without failures, calculate the additional resources required for any customizations you make. Then, ensure that the {rh-virtualization} environment has these additional resources.

The following example of the `install-config.yaml` file shows which parameter values you can edit.

.Procedure

* Optional: you can inspect and modify *some of the values* in the `install-config.yaml` file.

NOTE: Do not copy and paste this example. Instead, create a new installation configuration file.
