[id="installing-rhv-inspect-and-modify-params-in-install-config_{context}"]
= The installation configuration file for {rh-virtualization}

This example uses numbered callouts to show which parameter values you can edit. Do not modify the parameters values without callouts.

This example is specific to installing {product-title} on {rh-virtualization}.

You can find this file in the installation directory you specified when you ran the installation program with the `create config` subcommand.

[NOTE]
====
Do not copy the following example. Instead, run the installation program to create one.
====

IMPORTANT: If you make customizations that require additional resources, such as adding control plane and compute machines, verify that your {rh-virtualization} environment has enough resources. Otherwise, these customizations might cause the installation to fail.
