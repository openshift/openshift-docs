The {SMProductName} Operator does not deploy Ingress or Egress Gateways. Gateways are not part of the control plane. As a security best-practice, Ingress and Egress Gateways should be deployed in a different namespace than the namespace that contains the control plane.

You can deploy gateways using either the Gateway API or Gateway Injection methods.
