= About accessing the Bookinfo application using a gateway

The {SMProductName} Operator does not deploy gateways. Gateways are not part of the control plane. As a security best-practice, Ingress and Egress gateways should be deployed in a different namespace than the namespace that contains the control plane.

You can deploy gateways using either the Gateway API or the gateway injection method.
