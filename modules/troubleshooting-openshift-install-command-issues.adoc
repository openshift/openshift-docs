= Troubleshooting `openshift-install` command issues

If you experience issues running the `openshift-install` command, check the following:

* The installation has been initiated within 24 hours of Ignition configuration file creation. The Ignition files are created when the following command is run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir=./install_dir
----

* The `install-config.yaml` file is in the same directory as the installer. If an alternative installation path is declared by using the `./openshift-install --dir` option, verify that the `install-config.yaml` file exists within that directory.
