= Cloning the persistent volume claim of a virtual machine disk into a new data volume

You can clone a persistent volume claim (PVC) of an existing virtual machine disk
into a new data volume. The new data volume can then be used for a new virtual
machine.

[NOTE]
====
When a data volume is created independently of a virtual machine, the lifecycle
of the data volume is independent of the virtual machine. If the virtual machine
is deleted, neither the data volume nor its associated PVC is deleted.
====

.Prerequisites

* Determine the PVC of an existing virtual machine disk to use. You must power
down the virtual machine that is associated with the PVC before you can clone it.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
ifdef::blockstorage[]
* At least one available block persistent volume (PV) that is the same size as or larger than the source PVC.
endif::[]

.Procedure

. Examine the virtual machine disk you want to clone to identify the name and
namespace of the associated PVC.

. Create a YAML file for a data volume that specifies the name of the
new data volume, the name and namespace of the source PVC, 
ifdef::blockstorage[]
`volumeMode: Block` so that an available block PV is used,
endif::[]
and the size of the new data volume.

For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: DataVolume
metadata:
  name: <cloner-datavolume> <1>
spec:
  source:
    pvc:
      namespace: "<source-namespace>" <2>
      name: "<my-favorite-vm-disk>" <3>
  pvc:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <2Gi> <4>
ifdef::blockstorage[]
    volumeMode: Block <5>
endif::[]
----
<1> The name of the new data volume.
<2> The namespace where the source PVC exists.
<3> The name of the source PVC.
<4> The size of the new data volume. You must allocate enough space, or the
cloning operation fails. The size must be the same as or larger than the source PVC.
ifdef::blockstorage[]
<5> Specifies that the destination is a block PV
endif::[]

. Start cloning the PVC by creating the data volume:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <cloner-datavolume>.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Data volumes prevent a virtual machine from starting before the PVC is prepared,
so you can create a virtual machine that references the new data volume while the
PVC clones.
