= Viewing pod details

[role="_abstract"]
Retrieve detailed pod information to confirm the running status and resource configuration of the applications in this tutorial.

{product-title} uses the Kubernetes concept of a _pod_, which is one or more containers deployed together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed.
Pods are the rough equivalent of a machine instance, physical or virtual, to a container.

You can view the pods in your cluster and to determine the health of those pods and the cluster as a whole.
