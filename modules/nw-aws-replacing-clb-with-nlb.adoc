= Replacing Ingress Controller Classic Load Balancer with Network Load Balancer 

You can replace an Ingress Controller that is using a Classic Load Balancer (CLB) with one that uses a Network Load Balancer (NLB) on AWS. 

[WARNING]
====
This procedure causes an expected outage that can last several minutes due to new DNS records propagation, new load balancers provisioning, and other factors. IP addresses and canonical names of the Ingress Controller load balancer might change after applying this procedure. 
====

.Procedure 

. Create a file with a new default Ingress Controller. The following example assumes that your default Ingress Controller has an `External` scope and no other customizations: 
+
.Example `ingresscontroller.yml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    loadBalancer:
      scope: External
      providerParameters:
        type: AWS
        aws:
          type: NLB
    type: LoadBalancerService
----
+ 
If your default Ingress Controller has other customizations, ensure that you modify the file accordingly. 

. Force replace the Ingress Controller YAML file: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc replace --force --wait -f ingresscontroller.yml
----
+
Wait until the Ingress Controller is replaced. Expect serveral of minutes of outages.
