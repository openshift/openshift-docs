[id="installation-requirements-user-infra_{context}"]
= Machine requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all
of the required machines.

[id="machine-requirements_{context}"]
== Required machines

The smallest {product-title} clusters require the following hosts:

* One bootstrap machine

* Three control plane, or master, machines

* At least two compute, or worker, machines

[NOTE]
====
The cluster requires the bootstrap machine to deploy the {product-title} cluster
on the three control plane machines. You can remove the bootstrap machine after
you install the cluster.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
To maintain high availability of your cluster, use separate physical hosts for
these cluster machines.
====

The bootstrap and control plane machines must use {op-system-first} as the
operating system.

[id="network-connectivity_{context}"]
== Network connectivity requirements

All the {op-system-first} machines require network in `initramfs` during boot
to fetch Ignition config files from the Machine Config Server. During the initial
boot, the machines require a DHCP server in order to establish a network
connection to download their Ignition config files.

[id="minimum-resource-requirements_{context}"]
== Minimum resource requirements

Each cluster machine must meet the following minimum requirements:

[id="csr_management_{context}"]
== Certificate signing requests management

Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you
use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving
cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The
`kube-controller-manager` only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The
`machine-approver` cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate
that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that
the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a
method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests
and approving them.
