[id="installation-requirements-user-infra_{context}"]
= Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all
of the required machines.

This section describes the requirements for deploying {product-title} on user-provisioned infrastructure.

[id="machine-requirements_{context}"]
== Required machines

The smallest {product-title} clusters require the following hosts:

.Minimum required hosts
[options="header"]
|===

|Hosts |Description

|One temporary bootstrap machine
|The cluster requires the bootstrap machine to deploy the {product-title} cluster
on the three control plane machines. You can remove the bootstrap machine after
you install the cluster.

|Three control plane machines
|The control plane machines run the Kubernetes and {product-title} services that form the control plane.

|At least two compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.
|The workloads requested by {product-title} users run on the compute machines.

|===

ifdef::bare-metal[]
[NOTE]
====
As an exception, you can run zero compute machines in a bare metal cluster that consists of three control plane machines only. This provides smaller, more resource efficient clusters for cluster administrators and developers to use for testing, development, and production. Running one compute machine is not supported.
====
endif::bare-metal[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
ifdef::ibm-z[]
To improve high availability of your cluster, distribute the control plane machines over different z/VM instances on at least two physical machines.
endif::ibm-z[]
ifndef::ibm-z[]
To maintain high availability of your cluster, use separate physical hosts for
these cluster machines.
endif::ibm-z[]
====

The bootstrap and control plane machines must use {op-system-first} as the operating system. However, the compute machines can choose between {op-system-first} or {op-system-base-full} 7.9.

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
Note that {op-system} is based on {op-system-base-full} 8 and inherits all of its hardware certifications and requirements.
endif::[]
See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits[Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits].

ifdef::vsphere[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
All virtual machines must reside in the same datastore and in the same folder as the installer.

Each cluster machine must meet the following minimum requirements:

1. One physical core (IFL) provides two logical cores (threads) when SMT-2 is enabled. The hypervisor can provide two or more vCPUs.
endif::ibm-z[]
ifdef::bare-metal[]
1. One CPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = CPUs.

ifndef::ibm-z[]
2. {product-title} and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.
3. As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use {op-system-base} 7 compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. Use of {op-system-base} 7 compute machines is deprecated and planned for removal in a future release of {product-title} 4.
