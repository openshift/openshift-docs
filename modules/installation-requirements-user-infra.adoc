[id="installation-requirements-user-infra_{context}"]
= Machine requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all
of the required machines.

[id="machine-requirements_{context}"]
== Required machines

The smallest {product-title} clusters require the following hosts:

* One temporary bootstrap machine

* Three control plane, or master, machines

* At least two compute machines, which are also known as worker machines

[NOTE]
====
The cluster requires the bootstrap machine to deploy the {product-title} cluster
on the three control plane machines. You can remove the bootstrap machine after
you install the cluster.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
ifdef::ibm-z[]
To improve high availability of your cluster, distribute the control plane machines over different z/VM instances on at least two physical machines.
endif::ibm-z[]
ifndef::ibm-z[]
To maintain high availability of your cluster, use separate physical hosts for
these cluster machines.
endif::ibm-z[]
====

The bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines must use the {op-system-first} as the
operating system.

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
Note that {op-system} is based on {op-system-base-full} 8 and inherits all of its hardware certifications and requirements.
endif::[]
See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits[Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits].

[id="network-connectivity_{context}"]
== Network connectivity requirements

All the {op-system-first} machines require network in `initramfs` during boot to fetch Ignition config files from the Machine Config Server.
ifdef::ibm-z[]
The machines are configured with static IP addresses. No DHCP server is required.
endif::ibm-z[]
ifndef::ibm-z[]
During the initial boot, the machines require either a DHCP server
or that static IP addresses be set in order to establish a network
connection to download their Ignition config files.
endif::ibm-z[]

ifdef::ibm-z[]
[id="ibm-z-network-connectivity_{context}"]
== IBM Z network connectivity requirements

To install on IBM Z under z/VM, you require a single z/VM virtual NIC in layer 2 mode. You also need:

*   A direct-attached OSA or RoCE network adapter
*   A z/VM VSwitch set up. For a preferred setup, use OSA link aggregation.
endif::ibm-z[]

[id="minimum-resource-requirements_{context}"]
== Minimum resource requirements

Each cluster machine must meet the following minimum requirements:

ifdef::ibm-z[]
[id="minimum-ibm-z-system-requirements_{context}"]
== Minimum IBM Z system requirements

You can install {product-title} version {product-version} on the following IBM hardware:

* IBM Z, versions 13, 14, or 15
* LinuxONE, any version

[discrete]
=== Hardware requirements

* 1 LPAR with 6 IFLs that supports SMT2
* 1 OSA or RoCE network adapter

[discrete]
=== Operating system requirements

* One instance of z/VM 7.1

On your z/VM instance, set up:

* 3 guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines
* 2 guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines
* 1 guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine

[discrete]
=== Disk storage for the z/VM guest virtual machines

* FICON attached disk storage (DASDs). These can be z/VM minidisks, fullpack minidisks, or dedicated DASDs. To reach the minimum required DASD size for {op-system-first} installations, you need extended address volumes (EAV). If available, use HyperPAV to ensure optimal performance.
* FCP attached disk storage

[discrete]
=== Storage / Main Memory

* 16 GB for {product-title} control plane machines
* 8 GB for {product-title} compute machines
* 16 GB for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine

[id="preferred-ibm-z-system-requirements_{context}"]
== Preferred IBM Z system requirements

[discrete]
=== Hardware requirements

* 3 LPARs with 6 IFLs each that support SMT2
* 1 or 2 OSA or RoCE network adapters, or both
* Hipersockets, which are attached to a node either directly as a device or by bridging with one z/VM VSWITCH to be transparent to the z/VM guest. To directly connect Hipersockets to a node, you must set up a gateway to the external network via a RHEL 8 guest to bridge to the Hipersockets network.

[discrete]
=== Operating system requirements

* 2 or 3 instances of z/VM 7.1 for high availability

On your z/VM instances, set up:

* 3 guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines, one per z/VM instance
* At least 6 guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines, distributed across the z/VM instances
* 1 guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine

[discrete]
=== Disk storage for the z/VM guest virtual machines

* FICON attached disk storage (DASDs). These can be z/VM minidisks, fullpack minidisks, or dedicated DASDs. To reach the minimum required DASD size for {op-system-first} installations, you need extended address volumes (EAV). If available, use HyperPAV and High Performance FICON (zHPF) to ensure optimal performance.
* FCP attached disk storage

[discrete]
=== Storage / Main Memory

* 16 GB for {product-title} control plane machines
* 8 GB for {product-title} compute machines
* 16 GB for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine

[id="csr_management_{context}"]
== Certificate signing requests management

Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you
use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving
cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The
`kube-controller-manager` only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The
`machine-approver` cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate
that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that
the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a
method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests
and approving them.
