= Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all
of the required machines.

This section describes the requirements for deploying {product-title} on user-provisioned infrastructure.

[id="machine-requirements_{context}"]
== Required machines

The smallest {product-title} clusters require the following hosts:

.Minimum required hosts
[options="header"]
|===

|Hosts |Description

|One temporary bootstrap machine
|The cluster requires the bootstrap machine to deploy the {product-title} cluster
on the three control plane machines. You can remove the bootstrap machine after
you install the cluster.

|Three control plane machines
|The control plane machines run the Kubernetes and {product-title} services that form the control plane.

|At least two compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.
|The workloads requested by {product-title} users run on the compute machines.

|===

ifdef::bare-metal[]
[NOTE]
====
As an exception, you can run zero compute machines in a bare metal cluster that consists of three control plane machines only. This provides smaller, more resource efficient clusters for cluster administrators and developers to use for testing, development, and production. Running one compute machine is not supported.
====
endif::bare-metal[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
ifdef::ibm-z[]
To improve high availability of your cluster, distribute the control plane machines over different z/VM instances on at least two physical machines.
endif::ibm-z[]
ifndef::ibm-z[]
To maintain high availability of your cluster, use separate physical hosts for
these cluster machines.
endif::ibm-z[]
====

The bootstrap and control plane machines must use {op-system-first} as the operating system. However, the compute machines can choose between {op-system-first}, {op-system-base-full} 7.9, or {op-system-base} 8.4.

ifdef::bare-metal,agnostic[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the `platform: none` field is defined in the `install-config.yaml` file, virtual machines (VMs) configured to use virtual hardware version 14 or greater might result in a failed installation. It is recommended to configure VMs with virtual hardware version 13. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1935539[BZ#1935539].
====
endif::bare-metal,agnostic[]

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
Note that {op-system} is based on {op-system-base-full} 8 and inherits all of its hardware certifications and requirements.
endif::[]
See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits[Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits].

ifdef::vsphere[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
All virtual machines must reside in the same datastore and in the same folder as the installer.

1. One physical core (IFL) provides two logical cores (threads) when SMT-2 is enabled. The hypervisor can provide two or more vCPUs.
endif::ibm-z[]
ifndef::ibm-z[]
1. One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.
2. {product-title} and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.
3. As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use {op-system-base} compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. Use of {op-system-base} 7 compute machines is deprecated and planned for removal in a future release of {product-title} 4.

[id="minimum-ibm-z-system-requirements_{context}"]
== Minimum IBM Z system requirements

You can install {product-title} version {product-version} on the following IBM hardware:

* IBM Z, versions 13, 14, or 15
* LinuxONE, any version

[discrete]
=== Hardware requirements

* 1 LPAR with 6 IFLs that supports SMT2
* 1 OSA or RoCE network adapter

[discrete]
=== Operating system requirements

* One instance of z/VM 7.1 or later

On your z/VM instance, set up:

* 3 guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines
* 2 guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines
* 1 guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine

[discrete]
== IBM Z network connectivity requirements

To install on IBM Z under z/VM, you require a single z/VM virtual NIC in layer 2 mode. You also need:

*   A direct-attached OSA or RoCE network adapter
*   A z/VM VSwitch set up. For a preferred setup, use OSA link aggregation.

[discrete]
=== Disk storage for the z/VM guest virtual machines

* FICON attached disk storage (DASDs). These can be z/VM minidisks, fullpack minidisks, or dedicated DASDs, all of which must be formatted as CDL, which is the default. To reach the minimum required DASD size for {op-system-first} installations, you need extended address volumes (EAV). If available, use HyperPAV to ensure optimal performance.
* FCP attached disk storage

[discrete]
=== Storage / Main Memory

* 16 GB for {product-title} control plane machines
* 8 GB for {product-title} compute machines
* 16 GB for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine

[id="preferred-ibm-z-system-requirements_{context}"]
== Preferred IBM Z system requirements

[discrete]
=== Hardware requirements

* 3 LPARs with 6 IFLs each that support SMT2
* 1 or 2 OSA or RoCE network adapters, or both
* Hipersockets, which are attached to a node either directly as a device or by bridging with one z/VM VSWITCH to be transparent to the z/VM guest. To directly connect Hipersockets to a node, you must set up a gateway to the external network via a {op-system-base} 8 guest to bridge to the Hipersockets network.

[discrete]
=== Operating system requirements

* 2 or 3 instances of z/VM 7.1 or later for high availability

On your z/VM instances, set up:

* 3 guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines, one per z/VM instance
* At least 6 guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines, distributed across the z/VM instances
* 1 guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine
* To ensure the availability of integral components in an overcommitted environment, increase the priority of the control plane using the CP command `SET SHARE`. Do the same for infrastructure plane machines if they exist. See link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zvm/7.1?topic=commands-set-share[SET SHARE] in IBM Documentation.

[id="csr_management_{context}"]
== Managing certificate signing requests

Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you
use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving
cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The
`kube-controller-manager` only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The
`machine-approver` cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate
that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that
the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a
method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests
and approving them.
