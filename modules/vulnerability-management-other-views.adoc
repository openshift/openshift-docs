= Other views

The *Vulnerability Management* view also includes multiple other views that all provide information in the context of vulnerabilities.

The available views are:

* Clusters
* Namespaces
* Deployments
* Images
* Components
* CVEs
* Policies

All these views show a list of items for the selected entity type.
You can select the column heading to sort the items and also use local page filtering.

//TODO: Add link to local page filtering

You can easily switch between different views. For example:

* To switch to the *Clusters* view, from the *Vulnerability Management* view:
** Go to *Application & Infrastructure* -> *Clusters*.
* To switch to the *Clusters* view, from a different view:
** Go to *All Entities* -> *Clusters*.
