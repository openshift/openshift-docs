= Updates for hosted control planes

Updates for hosted control planes involve updating the hosted cluster and the node pools. For a cluster to remain fully operational during an update process, you must meet the requirements of the link:https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/[Kubernetes version skew policy] while completing the control plane and node updates.

== Updates for the hosted cluster

The `spec.release` value dictates the version of the control plane. The `HostedCluster` object transmits the intended `spec.release` value to the `HostedControlPlane.spec.release` value and runs the appropriate Control Plane Operator version.

The hosted control plane manages the rollout of the new version of the control plane components along with any {product-title} components through the new version of the Cluster Version Operator (CVO).

== Updates for node pools

With node pools, you can configure the software that is running in the nodes by exposing the `spec.release` and `spec.config` values. You can start a rolling node pool update in the following ways:

* Changing the `spec.release` or `spec.config` values.
* Changing any platform-specific field, such as the AWS instance type. The result is a set of new instances with the new type.
* Changing the cluster configuration, if the change propagates to the node.

Node pools support replace updates and in-place updates. The `nodepool.spec.release` value dictates the version of any particular node pool. A `NodePool` object completes a replace or an in-place rolling update according to the `.spec.management.upgradeType` value.

After you create a node pool, you cannot change the update type. If you want to change the update type, you must create a node pool and delete the other one.

[id="updates-for-nodepools-replace_{context}"]
=== Replace updates for node pools

A _replace_ update creates instances in the new version while it removes old instances from the previous version. This update type is effective in cloud environments where this level of immutability is cost effective.

Replace updates do not preserve any manual changes because the node is entirely re-provisioned.

[id="updates-for-nodepools-inplace_{context}"]
=== In place updates for node pools

An _in-place_ update directly updates the operating systems of the instances. This type is suitable for environments where the infrastructure constraints are higher, such as bare metal.

In-place updates can preserve manual changes, but will report errors if you make manual changes to any file system or operating system configuration that the cluster directly manages, such as kubelet certificates.
