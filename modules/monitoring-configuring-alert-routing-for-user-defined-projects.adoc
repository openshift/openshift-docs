* You are logged in as a user that has the `alert-routing-edit` cluster role for the project for which you want to create alert routing.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for alert routing. The example in this procedure uses a file called `example-app-alert-routing.yaml`.

. Add an `AlertmanagerConfig` YAML definition to the file. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1beta1
kind: AlertmanagerConfig
metadata:
  name: example-routing
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  route:
    receiver: default
    groupBy: [job]
  receivers:
  - name: default
    webhookConfigs:
    - url: https://example.org/post
----

. Save the file.

. Apply the resource to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-app-alert-routing.yaml
----
+
The configuration is automatically applied to the Alertmanager pods.
