* No reference design updates in this release

Description::

The link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/rest_api/node_apis/performanceprofile-performance-openshift-io-v2.html#spec-workloadhints[Performance Profile] can be used to configure a cluster in a high power, low power, or mixed mode.
The choice of power mode depends on the characteristics of the workloads running on the cluster, particularly how sensitive they are to latency.
Configure the maximum latency for a low-latency pod by using the per-pod power management C-states feature.

Limits and requirements::
* Power configuration relies on appropriate BIOS configuration, for example, enabling C-states and P-states. Configuration varies between hardware vendors.

Engineering considerations::
* Latency: To ensure that latency-sensitive workloads meet their requirements, you will need either a high-power configuration or a per-pod power management configuration. Per-pod power management is only available for `Guaranteed` QoS Pods with dedicated pinned CPUs.
