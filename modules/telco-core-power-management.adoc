= Power Management

New in this release::

* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
Use the Performance profile to configure clusters with high power mode, low power mode, or mixed mode.
The choice of power mode depends on the characteristics of the workloads running on the cluster, particularly how sensitive they are to latency.
Configure the maximum latency for a low-latency pod by using the per-pod power management C-states feature.

Limits and requirements::

* Power configuration relies on appropriate BIOS configuration, for example, enabling C-states and P-states.
Configuration varies between hardware vendors.

Engineering considerations::

* Latency: To ensure that latency-sensitive workloads meet requirements, you require a high-power or a per-pod power management configuration.
Per-pod power management is only available for Guaranteed QoS pods with dedicated pinned CPUs.
