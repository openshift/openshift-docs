= Power Management

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
Use the Performance Profile to configure clusters with high power mode, low power mode, or mixed mode.
The choice of power mode depends on the characteristics of the workloads running on the cluster, particularly how sensitive they are to latency.

Limits and requirements::
* Power configuration relies on appropriate BIOS configuration, for example, enabling C-states and P-states. Configuration varies between hardware vendors.

Engineering considerations::
* Latency: To ensure that latency-sensitive workloads meet their requirements, you will need either a high-power configuration or a per-pod power management configuration. Per-pod power management is only available for `Guaranteed` QoS Pods with dedicated pinned CPUs.
