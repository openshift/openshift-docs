= Viewing the image pull source

For clusters with unrestricted network connectivity, you can view the source of your pulled images by using a command on a node, such as `crictl images`.

However, for disconnected installations, to view the source of pulled images, you must review the CRI-O logs to locate the `Trying to access` log entry, as shown in the following procedure. Other methods to view the image pull source, such as the `crictl images` command, show the non-mirrored image name, even though the image is pulled from the mirrored location.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

* Review the CRI-O logs for a master or worker node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc adm node-logs <node_name> -u crio
----
+
.Example output
+
The `Trying to access` log entry indicates where the image is being pulled from.

The log might show the image pull source twice, as shown in the preceding example.

If your `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object lists multiple mirrors, {product-title} attempts to pull the images in the order listed in the configuration, for example:
