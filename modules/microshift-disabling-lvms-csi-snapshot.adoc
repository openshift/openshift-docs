[id="microshift-disabling-lvms-csi-snapshot_{context}"]
= Disabling deployments that run CSI snapshot implementations

Use the following procedure to disable installation of the CSI implementation pods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure is for users who are defining the configuration file before installing and running {microshift-short}. If {microshift-short} is already started then CSI snapshot implementation will be running. Users must manually remove it by following the uninstallation instructions.
====

[NOTE]
====
{microshift-short} will not delete CSI snapshot implementation pods. You must configure {microshift-short} to disable installation of the CSI snapshot implementation pods during the startup process.
====

.Procedure

. Disable installation of the CSI snapshot controller by entering the `optionalCsiComponents` value under the `storage` section of the {microshift-short} configuration file in `/etc/microshift/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
  storage: {} <1>
# ...
----
<1> Accepted values are:
* Not defining `optionalCsiComponents`.
* Specifying `optionalCsiComponents` field with an empty value (`[]`) or a single empty string element (`[""]`).
* Specifying `optionalCsiComponents` with one of the accepted values which are `snapshot-controller`, `snapshot-webhook`, or `none`. `none` is mutually exclusive with all other values.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the `optionalCsiComponents` value is empty or null, {microshift-short} defaults to deploying snapshot-controller and snapshot-webhook.
====

. After the `optionalCsiComponents` field is specified with a supported value in the `config.yaml`, start {microshift-short} by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl start microshift
----
+
[NOTE]
====
{microshift-short} does not redeploy the disabled components after a restart.
