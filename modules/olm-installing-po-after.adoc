= Installing platform Operators after cluster creation

As a cluster administrator, you can install platform Operators after cluster creation on clusters that have enabled the `TechPreviewNoUpgrades` feature set by using the cluster-wide `PlatformOperator` API.

.Procedure

. Choose a platform Operator from the supported set of OLM-based Operators. For the list of this set and details on current limitations, see "Technology Preview restrictions for platform Operators".

. Create a `PlatformOperator` object YAML file for your chosen platform Operator, for example a `cert-manager.yaml` file for the {cert-manager-operator}:
+
.Example `cert-manager.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: platform.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: PlatformOperator
metadata:
  name: cert-manager
spec:
  package:
    name: openshift-cert-manager-operator
----

. Create the `PlatformOperator` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cert-manager.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If your cluster does not have the `TechPreviewNoUpgrades` feature set enabled, the object creation fails with the following message:

[source,terminal]
----
error: resource mapping not found for name: "cert-manager" namespace: "" from "cert-manager.yaml": no matches for kind "PlatformOperator" in version "platform.openshift.io/v1alpha1"
ensure CRDs are installed first
----
====

.Verification

. Check the status of the `cert-manager` platform Operator by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get platformoperator cert-manager -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
...
status:
  activeBundleDeployment:
    name: cert-manager
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-10-24T17:24:40Z"

    reason: InstallSuccessful
    status: "True" <1>
    type: Installed
----
<1> Wait until the `Installed` status condition reports `True`.

. Verify that the `platform-operators-aggregated` cluster Operator is reporting an `Available=True` status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusteroperator platform-operators-aggregated -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
