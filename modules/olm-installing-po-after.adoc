= Installing platform Operators after cluster creation

As a cluster administrator, you can install platform Operators after cluster creation on clusters that have enabled the `TechPreviewNoUpgrades` feature set by using the cluster-wide `PlatformOperator` API.

.Procedure

. Choose a platform Operator from the supported set of OLM-based Operators. For the list of this set and details on current limitations, see "Technology Preview restrictions for platform Operators".

. Create a `PlatformOperator` object YAML file for your chosen platform Operator, for example a `cert-manager.yaml` file for the {cert-manager-operator}:
+
.Example `cert-manager.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: platform.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: PlatformOperator
metadata:
  name: cert-manager
spec:
  package:
    name: openshift-cert-manager-operator
----

. Create the `PlatformOperator` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cert-manager.yaml
----

.Verification

. Check the status of the `cert-manager` platform Operator by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get platformoperator cert-manager -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
