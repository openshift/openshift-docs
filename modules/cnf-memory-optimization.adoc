= Configuring memory page sizes

[role="_abstract"]
Configure memory page sizes to implement efficient memory management tailored to workload requirements by using the Node Tuning Operator performance profile.

By configuring memory page sizes, system administrators can implement more efficient memory management on a specific node to suit workload requirements. The Node Tuning Operator provides a method for configuring huge pages and kernel page sizes by using a performance profile.
