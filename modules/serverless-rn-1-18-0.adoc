== Fixed issues

* The prior 1.4 version of Camel-K was not compatible with {ServerlessProductName} 1.17.0. The issue in Camel-K has been fixed, and Camel-K version 1.4.1 can be used with {ServerlessProductName} 1.17.0.

* Previously, if you created a new subscription for a Kafka channel, or a new Kafka source, a delay was possible in the Kafka data plane becoming ready to dispatch messages after the newly created subscription or sink reported a ready status.
+
As a result, messages that were sent during the time when the data plane was not reporting a ready status, might not have been delivered to the subscriber or sink.
+
In {ServerlessProductName} 1.18.0, the issue is fixed and the initial messages are no longer lost. For more information about the issue, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6343981[Knowledgebase Article #6343981].

[id="known-issues-1-18-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

* Older versions of the Knative `kn` CLI might use older versions of the Knative Serving and Knative Eventing APIs. For example, version 0.23.2 of the `kn` CLI uses the `v1alpha1` API version.
+
On the other hand, newer releases of {ServerlessProductName} might no longer support older API versions. For example, {ServerlessProductName} 1.18.0 no longer supports version `v1alpha1` of the `kafkasources.sources.knative.dev` API.
+
Consequently, using an older version of the Knative `kn` CLI with a newer {ServerlessProductName} might produce an error because the `kn` cannot find the outdated API. For example, version 0.23.2 of the `kn` CLI does not work with {ServerlessProductName} 1.18.0.
+
To avoid issues, use the latest `kn` CLI version available for your {ServerlessProductName} release. For {ServerlessProductName} 1.18.0, use Knative `kn` CLI 0.24.0.
