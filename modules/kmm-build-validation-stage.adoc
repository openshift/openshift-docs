= Build validation stage

Build validation is executed only when image validation has failed and there is a `build` section in the `Module` that is relevant for the upgraded kernel. Build validation attempts to run the build job and validate that it finishes successfully.

[NOTE]
====
You must specify the kernel version when running `depmod`, as shown here:
[source,terminal]
----
$ RUN depmod -b /opt ${KERNEL_VERSION}
----
====

If the `PushBuiltImage` flag is defined in the `PreflightValidationOCP` custom resource (CR), it will also try to push the resulting image into its repository. The resulting image name is taken from the definition of the `containerImage` field of the `Module` CR.

[NOTE]
====
If the `sign` section is defined for the upgraded kernel, then the resulting image will not be the `containerImage` field of the `Module` CR, but a temporary image name, because the resulting image should be the product of Sign flow.
