= Build validation stage

Build validation is executed only when image validation has failed and there is a `build` section in the `Module` that is relevant for the upgraded kernel. Build validation attempts to run the build job and validate that it finishes successfully. If the `PushBuiltImage` flag is defined in the `PreflightValidation` custom resource (CR), it also tries to push the resulting image into its repository. The resulting image name is taken from the definition of the `containerImage` field of the `Module` CR.

[NOTE]
====
If the `sign` section is defined for the upgraded kernel, then the resulting image will not be the
`containerImage` field of the `Module` CR, but a temporary image name, because the resulting image
should be the product of Sign flow.
