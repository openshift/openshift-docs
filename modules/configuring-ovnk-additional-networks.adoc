= Configuration for an OVN-Kubernetes additional network

The {openshift-networking} OVN-Kubernetes network plugin allows the configuration of secondary network interfaces for pods. To configure secondary network interfaces, you must define the configurations in the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resource definition (CRD).

:FeatureName: Configuration for an OVN-Kubernetes additional network
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The following sections provide example configurations for each of the topologies that OVN-Kubernetes currently allows for secondary networks.

[NOTE]
====
Networks names must be unique. For example, creating multiple `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRDs with different configurations that reference the same network is unsupported.
