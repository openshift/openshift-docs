= Configuration for an OVN-Kubernetes additional network

The {openshift-networking} OVN-Kubernetes network plugin allows the configuration of secondary network interfaces for pods. To configure secondary network interfaces, you must define the configurations in the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resource (CR).

You can configure an OVN-Kubernetes additional network in either _layer 2_ or _localnet_ topologies.

- A layer 2 topology supports east-west cluster traffic, but does not allow access to the underlying physical network.
- A localnet topology allows connections to the physical network, but requires additional configuration of the underlying Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge on cluster nodes.

The following sections provide example configurations for each of the topologies that OVN-Kubernetes currently allows for secondary networks.

[NOTE]
====
Networks names must be unique. For example, creating multiple `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRs with different configurations that reference the same network is unsupported.
