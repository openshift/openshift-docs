= Expanding CSI volumes

You can use the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to expand storage volumes after they have already been created.

CSI volume expansion does not support the following:

* Recovering from failure when expanding volumes

* Shrinking

.Prerequisites

* The underlying CSI driver supports resize.

* Dynamic provisioning is used.

ifndef::microshift[]
* The controlling `StorageClass` object has `allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true` (see xref:../storage/expanding-persistent-volumes.adoc#add-volume-expansion_expanding-persistent-volumes[Enabling volume expansion support]).
endif::microshift[]

ifdef::microshift[]
* The controlling `StorageClass` object has `allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true` (see xref:../microshift_storage/expanding-persistent-volumes-microshift.html#add-volume-expansion_expanding-persistent-volumes-microshift[Enabling volume expansion support]).
endif::[]


.Procedure

. For the persistent volume claim (PVC), set `.spec.resources.requests.storage` to the desired new size.

. Watch the `status.conditions` field of the PVC to see if the resize has completed. {product-title} adds the `Resizing` condition to the PVC during expansion, which is removed after expansion completes.
