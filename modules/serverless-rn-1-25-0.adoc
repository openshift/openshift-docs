= Release notes for Red Hat {ServerlessProductName} 1.25.0

{ServerlessProductName} 1.25.0 is now available. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {ServerlessProductName} on {product-title} are included in this topic.

[id="new-features-1.25.0_{context}"]
== New features

* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving 1.4.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Eventing 1.4.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Kourier 1.4.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative (`kn`) CLI 1.4.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Kafka 1.4.
* The `kn func` CLI plugin now uses `func` 1.7.0.

* Integrated development environment (IDE) plugins for creating and deploying functions are now available for link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-knative[Visual Studio Code] and link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/intellij-knative[IntelliJ].
* Knative Kafka broker is now GA. Knative Kafka broker is a highly performant implementation of the Knative broker API, directly targeting Apache Kafka.
+
It is recommended to not use the MT-Channel-Broker, but the Knative Kafka broker instead.
* Knative Kafka sink is now GA. A `KafkaSink` takes a `CloudEvent` and sends it to an Apache Kafka topic. Events can be specified in either structured or binary content modes.

* Enabling TLS for internal traffic is now available as a Technology Preview.

[id="fixed-issues-1.25.0_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Previously, Knative Serving had an issue where the readiness probe failed if the container was restarted after a liveness probe fail. This issue has been fixed.

[id="known-issues-1.25.0_{context}"]
== Known issues

* The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) mode is disabled for Kafka broker, Kafka source, and Kafka sink.

* The `SinkBinding` object does not support custom revision names for services.

* The Knative Serving Controller pod adds a new informer to watch secrets in the cluster. The informer includes the secrets in the cache, which increases memory consumption of the controller pod.
+
If the pod runs out of memory, you can work around the issue by increasing the memory limit for the deployment.

* If you use `net-istio` for Ingress and enable mTLS via SMCP using `security.dataPlane.mtls: true`, Service Mesh deploys `DestinationRules` for the `*.local` host, which does not allow `DomainMapping` for {ServerlessProductName}.
+
To work around this issue, enable mTLS by deploying `PeerAuthentication` instead of using `security.dataPlane.mtls: true`.
