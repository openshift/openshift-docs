* You must ensure that the AWS limits are sufficient to support {product-title} provisioned within your AWS account. Running the `rosa verify quota` command in the CLI validates that you have the required quota to run a cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
Quota verification checks your AWS quota, but it does not compare your consumption to your AWS quota. See the "Limits and scalability" link in Additional resources for more information.

* If SCP policies are applied and enforced, these policies must not be more restrictive than the roles and policies required by the cluster.
* Your AWS account should not be transferable to Red{nbsp}Hat.
* You should not impose additional AWS usage restrictions beyond the defined roles and policies on Red{nbsp}Hat activities. Imposing restrictions will severely hinder Red{nbsp}Hat's ability to respond to incidents.
* You may deploy native AWS services within the same AWS account.
* Your account must have a service-linked role set up as it is required for Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to be configured. See the "Creating the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service-linked role" link in the Additional resources for information about creating a service-linked role for your ELB if you have not created a load balancer in your AWS account previously.

[NOTE]
====
You are encouraged, but not required, to deploy resources in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) separate from the VPC hosting {product-title} and other Red{nbsp}Hat supported services.
