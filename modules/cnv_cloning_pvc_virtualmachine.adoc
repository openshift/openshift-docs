=== Cloning an existing PVC and creating a virtual machine using a dataVolumeTemplate

You can create a new virtual machine that clones the PVC of an existing virtual machine into a new DataVolume. Referencing a `dataVolumeTemplate` in the virtual machine spec, the `source` PVC is cloned to a new DataVolume, which is then automatically used for the creation of the virtual machine.

To clone a DataVolume, examine it to identify the associated PVC. Use the details of the identified PVC as the `source`.

[NOTE]
When a DataVolume is created as part of the DataVolumeTemplate of a virtual machine, the lifecycle of the DataVolume is then dependent on the virtual machine: If the virtual machine is deleted, the DataVolume and associated PVC will also be deleted.


.Prerequisites
* A PVC of an existing virtual machine disk. The associated virtual machine must be powered down, or the clone process will be queued until the PVC is available. 

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for a `VirtualMachine` object. The following virtual machine example, `vm-dv-clone`, clones `my-favorite-vm-disk` (located in the `source-namespace` namespace) and creates the `2Gi` `favorite-clone` DataVolume, referenced in the virtual machine as the `dv-clone` volume.
