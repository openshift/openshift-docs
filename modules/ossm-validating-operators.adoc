= Validating Operator installation

//The Operator installation steps include verifying the Operator status in the OpenShift console.

When you install the {ProductName} Operators, OpenShift automatically creates the following objects as part of a successful Operator installation:

* config maps
* custom resource definitions
* deployments
* pods
* replica sets
* roles
* role bindings
* secrets
* service accounts
* services

.From the Openshift console

You can verify that the Operator pods are available and running by using the {product-title} Console.

. Navigate to *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
. Select the `openshift-operators` namespace.
. Verify that the following pods exist and have a status of `running`:
** `istio-operator`
** `jaeger-operator`
** `kiali-operator`
. Select the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace.
. Verify that the `elasticsearch-operator` pod exists and has a status of `running`.

.From the command line

. Verify the Operator pods are available and running in the `openshift-operators` namespace with the following command:
