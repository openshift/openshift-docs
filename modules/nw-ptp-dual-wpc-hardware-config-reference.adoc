= Dual E810 Westport Channel NIC configuration reference

Use this information to understand how to use the link:https://github.com/openshift/linuxptp-daemon/blob/release-4.14/addons/intel/e810.go[Intel E810-XXVDA4T hardware plugin] to configure a pair of E810 network interfaces as PTP grandmaster clock (T-GM).

Before you configure the dual NIC cluster host, you must connect the two NICs with an SMA1 cable using the 1PPS faceplace connections.

When you configure a dual NIC T-GM, you need to compensate for the 1PPS signal delay that occurs when you connect the NICs using the SMA1 connection ports.
Various factors such as cable length, ambient temperature, and component and manufacturing tolerances can affect the signal delay.
To compensate for the delay, you must calculate the specific value that you use to offset the signal delay.

|PtpConfig field
|Description

|`spec.profile.plugins.e810.pins`
a|Configure the E810 hardware pins using the PTP Operator E810 hardware plugin.

* Pin `2 1` enables the `1PPS OUT` connection for `SMA1` on NIC one.
* Pin `1 1` enables the `1PPS IN` connection for `SMA1` on NIC two.

|`spec.profile.ts2phcConf`
|Use the `ts2phcConf` field to configure parameters for NIC one and NIC two.
Set `ts2phc.master 0` for NIC two.
This configures the timing source for NIC two from the 1PPS input, not GNSS.
Configure the `ts2phc.extts_correction` value for NIC two to compensate for the delay that is incurred for the specific SMA cable and cable length that you use.
The value that you configure depends on your specific measurements and SMA1 cable length.

|`spec.profile.ptp4lConf`
|Set the value of `boundary_clock_jbod` to 1 to enable support for multiple NICs.
