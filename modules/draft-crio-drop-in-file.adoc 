= Creating CRI-O drop in file

Created a custom machine config object to create a crio drop in file for the 
capabilities and removed net_raw and sys_chroot from the default list of cri-o capabilities. 
This way we don't break existing users that depend on those 2 caps, but also new clusters will not 
have those two caps by default. 

Once users are sure that removing these 2 caps won't break them, they can go and delete the machine 
config object and it will delete the drop-in file that was created.
