|Description

//CNF-7349 Rootless DPDK pods
|Support for running rootless Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) workloads with kernel access by using the TAP CNI plugin
a|DPDK applications that inject traffic into the kernel can run in non-privileged pods with the help of the TAP CNI plugin.

//CNF-5977 Better pinning of the networking stack
|Dynamic use of non-reserved CPUs for OVS
a|With this release, the Open vSwitch (OVS) networking stack can dynamically use non-reserved CPUs.
The dynamic use of non-reserved CPUs occurs by default in performance-tuned clusters with a CPU manager policy set to `static`.
The dynamic use of available, non-reserved CPUs maximizes compute resources for OVS and minimizes network latency for workloads during periods of high demand.
OVS cannot use isolated CPUs assigned to containers in `Guaranteed` QoS pods. This separation avoids disruption to critical application workloads.

//CNF-7760
|Enabling more control over the C-states for each pod
a|The `PerformanceProfile` supports `perPodPowerManagement` which provides more control over the C-states for pods. Now, instead of disabling C-states completely, you can specify a maximum latency in microseconds for C-states. You configure this option in the `cpu-c-states.crio.io` annotation, which helps to optimize power savings for high-priority applications by enabling some of the shallower C-states instead of disabling them completely.

//CNF-7741 Permit to disable NUMA Aware scheduling hints based on SR-IOV VFs
|Exclude SR-IOV network topology for NUMA-aware scheduling
a|You can exclude advertising Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes for the SR-IOV network to the Topology Manager. By not advertising NUMA nodes for the SR-IOV network, you can permit more flexible SR-IOV network deployments during NUMA-aware pod scheduling.

For example, in some scenarios, you want flexibility for how a pod is deployed. By not providing a NUMA node hint to the Topology Manager for the pod's SR-IOV network resource, the Topology Manager can deploy the SR-IOV network resource and the pod CPU and memory resources to different NUMA nodes. In previous {product-title} releases, the Topology Manager attempted to place all resources on the same NUMA node.

//CNF-8035 MetalLB VRF Egress interface selection with VRFs (Tech Preview)
|Egress service resource to manage egress traffic for pods behind a load balancer (Technology Preview)
a|With this update, you can use an `EgressService` custom resource (CR) to manage egress traffic for pods behind a load balancer service.

You can use the `EgressService` CR to manage egress traffic in the following ways:

* Assign the load balancer service's IP address as the source IP address of egress traffic for pods behind the load balancer service.

* Configure the egress traffic for pods behind a load balancer to a different network than the default node network.
