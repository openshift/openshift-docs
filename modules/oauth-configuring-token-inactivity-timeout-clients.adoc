= Configuring token inactivity timeout for an OAuth client

You can configure OAuth clients to expire OAuth tokens after a set period of inactivity. By default, no token inactivity timeout is set.

[NOTE]
====
If the token inactivity timeout is also configured in the internal OAuth server configuration, the timeout that is set in the OAuth client overrides that value.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have configured an identity provider (IDP).

.Procedure

. Update the OAuth client configuration to set a token inactivity timeout.

.. Edit the OAuth client configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit oauthclient <oauth_client> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<oauth_client>` with the OAuth client to configure, for example, `console`.
+
Add the `accessTokenInactivityTimeoutSeconds` field and set your timeout value:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: oauth.openshift.io/v1
grantMethod: auto
kind: OAuthClient
metadata:
...
accessTokenInactivityTimeoutSeconds: 600 <1>
----
<1> The minimum allowed timeout value in seconds is `300`.

.. Save the file to apply the changes.

. Verify that the token inactivity timeout was successfully set.

.. Log in to the cluster with an identity from your IDP. Be sure to use the OAuth client that you just configured.

.. Perform an action and verify that it was successful.

.. Wait longer than the configured timeout without using the identity. In this procedure's example, wait longer than 600 seconds.

.. Try to perform an action from the same identity's session.
+
This attempt should fail because the token should have expired due to inactivity longer than the configured timeout.
