====
. Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory that was just created in your working directory. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather.local.472290403699006248 <1>
----
<1> Replace `must-gather-local.472290403699006248` with the actual directory name.

. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/list[the *Customer Support* page] of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
