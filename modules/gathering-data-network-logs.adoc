= Gathering network logs

You can gather network logs on all nodes in a cluster.

.Procedure

. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command with `-- gather_network_logs`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather -- gather_network_logs
----
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the `must-gather` tool collects the OVN `nbdb` and `sbdb` databases from all of the nodes in the cluster. Adding the `-- gather_network_logs` option to include additional logs that contain OVN-Kubernetes transactions for OVN `nbdb` database.
====
.  Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory that was just created in your working directory. Make sure you provide the date and cluster ID for the unique must-gather data. For more information about how to find the cluster ID, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5280291[How to find the cluster-id or name on OpenShift cluster]. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather-`date +"%m-%d-%Y-%H-%M-%S"`-<cluster_id>.tar.gz <must_gather_local_dir><1>
----
<1> Replace `<must_gather_local_dir>` with the actual directory name.

. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/list[the *Customer Support* page] of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
