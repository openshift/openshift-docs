= Migrating {microshift-short} to {op-system-image}

Migrating {microshift-short} from a {op-system-ostree-first} system to a {op-system-image} system requires building a new {op-system-image} image containing the required version of {microshift-short} and any associated optional RPMs.

See the {op-system-base-full} documentation for general instructions on migrating {op-system-ostree} systems to {op-system-image} using the `bootc switch` command. Plan the upgrade process carefully. The following tips apply:

* Follow the instructions in the {op-system-base} documentation for converting `rpm-ostree` blueprint files to image mode container files.
* You can use the `rpm-ostree compose container-encapsulate` image-compose command to create a base container image that can be used for bootc container builds. Then you can derive and familiarize yourself with an {op-system-image} image that is based on existing `ostree` commits.
* To fully adopt {op-system-image}, define a container build pipeline.
* Plan for UID and GID drift because {op-system-ostree} and {op-system-image} are not derived from the same parent image. See the {op-system-base} documentation for more information.
