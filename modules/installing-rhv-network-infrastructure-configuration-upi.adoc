= Network infrastructure configuration for installing {product-title} on {rh-virtualization-first}

Before installing {product-title}, configure your network environment to meet the following requirements.

When they boot, virtual machines must have IP addresses get the Ignition config files. Consider configuring DHCP to provide persistent IP addresses and hostnames to the cluster machines.
// TBD - Day 0 versus day 2? Alternatives?

.Firewall

Configure your firewall so your cluster has access to required sites.

.Network connectivity

// TBD - What do we mean by "machine" here? Where do we configure this? Can this be done at this stage in the process?
Configure your network to enable the following connections:

* Grant every machine access to every other machine on ports `30000`-`32767`. This provides connectivity to {product-title} components.

* Grant every machine access to reserved ports `10250`-`10259` and `9000`-`9999`.

* Grant every machine access on ports `2379`-`2380`. This provides access to etcd, peers, and metrics on the control plane.

* Grant every machine access to the Kubernetes API on port `6443`.

.Load balancers

Configure one or two (preferred) layer-4 load balancers:

* Provide load balancing for ports `6443` and `22623` on the control-plane and bootstrap machines. Port `6443` provides access to the Kubernetes API server and must be reachable both internally and externally. Port `22623` must be accessible to nodes within the cluster.

* Provide load balancing for port `443` and `80` for machines that run the ingress router (usually worker nodes in the default configuration). Both ports must be accessible from within and outside the cluster.

.DNS

Configure infrastructure-provided DNS to allow the correct resolution of the main components and services. If you use only one load balancer, these DNS records can point to the same IP address.

* Create DNS records for `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` (internal and external resolution) and `api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` (internal resolution) that point to the load balancer for the control plane machines.

* Create a DNS record for `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` that points to the load balancer for the ingress router (ports `443` and `80` of the compute machines).
