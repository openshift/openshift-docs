= ComplianceSuite object

The `ComplianceSuite` object helps you keep track of the state of the scans. It contains the raw settings to create scans and the overall result.

For `Node` type scans, you should map the scan to the `MachineConfigPool`, since it contains the remediations for any issues. If you specify a label, ensure it directly applies to a pool.

<1> Set to `true` to enable auto remediations. Set to `false` to disable auto remediations.
<2> Specify how often the scan should be run in cron format.
<3> Specify a list of scan specifications to run in the cluster.
<4> Indicates the progress of the scans.
<5> Indicates the overall verdict of the suite.

The suite in the background creates the `ComplianceScan` object based on the `scans` parameter.
You can programmatically fetch the `ComplianceSuites` events. To get the events for the suite, run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=ComplianceSuite,involvedObject.name=<name of the suite>

[IMPORTANT]
====
You might create errors when you manually define the `ComplianceSuite`, since it contains the XCCDF attributes.
