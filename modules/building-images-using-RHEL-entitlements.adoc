= Building images using the RHEL entitlements

If you have Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) entitlements, you can use these entitlements to build container images. The Insights operator automatically manages your entitlements by importing your simple content access entitlements and storing them in a `secret` object named `etc-pki-entitlement` in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace.

In {ocp-product-title} 4.10 and later, {builds-title} can share the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret from the `openshift-config-managed` namespace to other namespaces using the Shared Resources Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator.
