[id="building-images-using-RHEL-entitlements_{context}"]
= Building images using RHEL entitlements

If you have a {op-system-base-full} entitlement, the Insights Operator automatically manages the entitlement keys using the Simple Content Access (SCA) feature. With SCA, the {op-system-base} systems access the subscription content without manually managing the entitlement keys. The Insights Operator imports your SCA entitlement keys and stores them in a secret called `etc-pki-entitlement` in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace.

Previously, a cluster administrator would manually copy the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret to the required namespace. Starting with {ocp-product-title} 4.10 and later, {builds-title} can share the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret from the `openshift-config-managed` namespace with other namespaces by using the Shared Resource Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator.

= Building images using the RHEL entitlements

If you have Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) entitlements, you can use these entitlements to build container images. The Insights operator automatically manages your entitlements by importing your simple content access entitlements and storing them in a `secret` object named `etc-pki-entitlement` in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace.

In {ocp-product-title} 4.10 and later, {builds-title} can share the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret from the `openshift-config-managed` namespace to other namespaces using the Shared Resources Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator.
