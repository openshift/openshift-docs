= Building images using RHEL entitlements

If you have a {op-system-base-full} entitlement, the Insights Operator automatically manages the entitlement keys using the Simple Content Access (SCA) feature. With SCA, the {op-system-base} systems access the subscription content without manually managing the entitlement keys. The Insights Operator imports your SCA entitlement keys and stores them in a secret called `etc-pki-entitlement` in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace.

Previously, a cluster administrator would manually copy the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret to the required namespace. Starting with {ocp-product-title} 4.10 and later, {builds-title} can share the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret from the `openshift-config-managed` namespace with other namespaces by using the Shared Resource Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator.
