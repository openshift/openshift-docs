[id="microshift-greenboot-test-workload-health-check-script_{context}"]
= Testing a workload health check script

The output of the greenboot workload health check script varies with the host system type. Example outputs for {op-system-base-full} system types are included for reference only.

.Prerequisites

* You have root access.
* You installed a workload.
* You created a health check script for the workload.
* The {microshift-short} service is enabled.

.Procedure

. To test that greenboot is running a health check script file, reboot the host by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo reboot
----

. Examine the output of greenboot health checks by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl -o cat -u greenboot-healthcheck.service
----
+
[NOTE]
====
{microshift-short} core service health checks run before the workload health checks.
====
+
.Example output for an {op-system-image} system
