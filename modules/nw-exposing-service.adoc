= Exposing the service by creating a route

You can expose the service as a route using the `oc expose` command.

.Procedure

To expose the service:

. Log in to {product-title}.

. Log in to the project where the service you want to expose is located:
+
----
$ oc project project1
----

. Run the following command to expose the route:
+
----
$ oc expose service <service_name>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc expose service mysql-55-rhel7
route "mysql-55-rhel7" exposed
----

. Use a tool, such as cURL, to make sure you can reach the service using the
cluster IP address for the service:
+
----
$ curl <pod_ip>:<port>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ curl 172.30.131.89:3306
----
+
The examples in this section use a MySQL service, which requires a client
application. If you get a string of characters with the `Got packets out of order`
message, you are connected to the service.
+
If you have a MySQL client, log in with the standard CLI command:
+
----
$ mysql -h 172.30.131.89 -u admin -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

//Potentially add verification step, "If a verification step is needed, it would
//look something like oc get route mysql-55-rhel7 and curl with the host from the
//output of the oc get route command."
