[id="patching-ovnk-address-ranges_{context}"]
= Patching OVN-Kubernetes address ranges

OVN-Kubernetes reserves the following IP address ranges:

* `100.64.0.0/16`. This IP address range is used for the `internalJoinSubnet` parameter of OVN-Kubernetes by default. 
* `100.88.0.0/16`. This IP address range is used for the `internalTransSwitchSubnet` parameter of OVN-Kubernetes by default.

If these IP addresses have been used by OpenShift SDN or any external networks that might communicate with this cluster, you must patch them to use a different IP address range before initiating the limited live migration.

The following procedure can be used to patch CIDR ranges that are in use by OpenShift SDN if the migration was initially blocked.

[NOTE]
====
Only use this optional procedure if your cluster or network environment overlaps with the `100.64.0.0/16` subnet or the `100.88.0.0/16` subnet. Ensure that you run the steps in the procedure before you start the limited live migration operation.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. If the `100.64.0.0/16` IP address range is already in use, enter the following command to patch it to a different range. The following example uses  `100.63.0.0/16`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' -p='{"spec":{"defaultNetwork":{"ovnKubernetesConfig":{"ipv4":{"internalJoinSubnet": "100.63.0.0/16"}}}}}'
----

. If the `100.88.0.0/16` IP address range is already in use, enter the following command to patch it to a different range. The following example uses  `100.99.0.0/16`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' -p='{"spec":{"defaultNetwork":{"ovnKubernetesConfig":{"ipv4":{"internalTransitSwitchSubnet": "100.99.0.0/16"}}}}}'
----

After patching the `100.64.0.0/16` and `100.88.0.0/16` IP address ranges, you can initiate the limited live migration.
