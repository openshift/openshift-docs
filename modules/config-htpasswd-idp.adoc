= Configuring an HTPasswd identity provider

Configure an HTPasswd identity provider to create a single, static user with cluster administration privileges. You can log in to your cluster as the user to troubleshoot issues.

.Procedure

. From {console-redhat-com}, navigate to the *Clusters* page and select the cluster that you need to configure identity providers for.

. Click the *Access control* tab.

. Click *Add identity provider*.

[NOTE]
====
You can also click the *Add Oauth configuration* link in the warning message displayed after cluster creation to configure your identity providers.
====

. Select *HTPasswd* from the *Identity Provider* drop-down menu.

. Add a unique name in the *Name* field for the identity provider.

. Use the suggested username and password for the static user, or create your own.
+
[NOTE]
====
The credentials defined in this step are not visible after you select *Confirm* in the following step. If you lose the credentials, you must recreate the identity provider and define the credentials again.
====

. Select *Confirm* to create the HTPasswd identity provider and the user.

. Grant the static user permission to manage the cluster:
.. Select *Add user* in the *Cluster administrative users* section of the *Access control* page.
.. Enter the username that you defined in the preceding step into the *User ID* field.
.. Select *Add user* to grant standard administration privileges to the user.

The user is added to the `dedicated-admins` group.

.Verification

* The configured identity provider is now visible on the *Access control* tab of the *Clusters* page.
