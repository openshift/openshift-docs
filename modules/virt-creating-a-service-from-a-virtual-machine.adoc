= Creating a service from a virtual machine

Create a service from a running virtual machine by first creating a `Service` object to expose the virtual machine.

[NOTE]
====
If IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack networking is enabled for your cluster, you can create a service that uses IPv4, IPv6, or both, by defining the `spec.ipFamilyPolicy` and the `spec.ipFamilies` fields in the `Service` object.

The `spec.ipFamilyPolicy` field can be set to one of the following values:

* `SingleStack`: The control plane assigns a cluster IP address for the service based on the first configured service cluster IP range.

* `PreferDualStack`: The control plane assigns both IPv4 and IPv6 cluster IP addresses for the service on clusters that have dual-stack configured.

* `RequireDualStack`: This option fails for clusters that do not have dual-stack networking enabled. For clusters that have dual-stack configured, the behavior is the same as when the value is set to `PreferDualStack`. The control plane allocates cluster IP addresses from both IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges.

You can define which IP family to use for single-stack or define the order of IP families for dual-stack by setting the `spec.ipFamilies` field to one of the following array values:

* `[IPv4]`
* `[IPv6]`
* `[IPv4, IPv6]`
* `[IPv6, IPv4]`
====

The `ClusterIP` service type exposes the virtual machine internally, within the cluster. The `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` service types expose the virtual machine externally, outside of the cluster.

This procedure presents an example of how to create, connect to, and expose a `Service` object of `type: ClusterIP` as a virtual machine-backed service.

[NOTE]
====
`ClusterIP` is the default service `type`, if the service `type` is not specified.

.Procedure

. Edit the virtual machine YAML as follows:
+

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: vm-ephemeral
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  running: false
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        special: key <1>
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          disks:
            - name: containerdisk
              disk:
                bus: virtio
            - name: cloudinitdisk
              disk:
                bus: virtio
          interfaces:
          - masquerade: {}
            name: default
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 1024M
      networks:
        - name: default
          pod: {}
      volumes:
        - name: containerdisk
          containerDisk:
            image: kubevirt/fedora-cloud-container-disk-demo
        - name: cloudinitdisk
          cloudInitNoCloud:
            userData: |
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "fedora" | passwd fedora --stdin
----
<1> Add the label `special: key` in the `spec.template.metadata.labels` section.
+

[NOTE]
====
Labels on a virtual machine are passed through to the pod. The labels on
the `VirtualMachine` configuration, for example `special: key`, must match the labels in
the `Service` YAML `selector` attribute, which you create later
in this procedure.
====

. Save the virtual machine YAML to apply your changes.

. Edit the `Service` YAML to configure the settings necessary to create and expose the `Service` object:
+

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: vmservice <1>
  namespace: example-namespace <2>
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 27017
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 22 <3>
  selector:
    special: key <4>
  type: ClusterIP <5>
----
<1> Specify the `name` of the service you are creating and exposing.
<2> Specify `namespace` in the `metadata` section of the `Service` YAML that corresponds to the `namespace` you specify in the virtual machine YAML.
<3> Add `targetPort: 22`, exposing the service on SSH port `22`.
<4> In the `spec` section of the `Service` YAML, add `special: key` to the `selector` attribute, which corresponds to the `labels` you added in the virtual machine YAML configuration file.
<5> In the `spec` section of the `Service` YAML, add `type: ClusterIP` for a
ClusterIP service. To create and expose other types of services externally, outside of the cluster, such as `NodePort` and `LoadBalancer`, replace
`type: ClusterIP` with `type: NodePort` or `type: LoadBalancer`, as appropriate.
+

. Save the `Service` YAML to store the service configuration.
. Create the `ClusterIP` service:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <service_name>.yaml
----

+
. Start the virtual machine. If the virtual machine is already running, restart it.
+

+
. Query the `Service` object to verify it is available and is configured with type `ClusterIP`.
+

.Verification
* Run the `oc get service` command, specifying the `namespace` that you reference in the virtual machine and `Service` YAML files.
+

[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get service -n example-namespace
----
+

.Example output
[source, terminal]
----
NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)     AGE
vmservice   ClusterIP   172.30.3.149   <none>        27017/TCP   2m
----
+

** As shown from the output, `vmservice` is running.
** The `TYPE` displays as `ClusterIP`, as you specified in the `Service` YAML.

. Establish a connection to the virtual machine that you want to use to back your service. Connect from an object inside the cluster, such as another virtual machine.
+

.. Edit the virtual machine YAML as follows:
+

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: vm-connect
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  running: false
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          disks:
            - name: containerdisk
              disk:
                bus: virtio
            - name: cloudinitdisk
              disk:
                bus: virtio
          interfaces:
          - masquerade: {}
            name: default
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 1024M
      networks:
        - name: default
          pod: {}
      volumes:
        - name: containerdisk
          containerDisk:
            image: kubevirt/fedora-cloud-container-disk-demo
        - name: cloudinitdisk
          cloudInitNoCloud:
            userData: |
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "fedora" | passwd fedora --stdin
----
+

.. Run the `oc create` command to create a second virtual machine, where `file.yaml` is the name of the virtual machine YAML:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file.yaml>
----
+

.. Start the virtual machine.

.. Connect to the virtual machine by running the following `virtctl` command:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl -n example-namespace console <new-vm-name>
----
+

[NOTE]
====
For service type `LoadBalancer`, use the `vinagre` client to connect your
virtual machine by using the public IP and port.
External ports are dynamically allocated when using service type
`LoadBalancer`.
====
+

.. Run the `ssh` command to authenticate the connection, where `172.30.3.149` is the ClusterIP of the service and `fedora` is the user name of the virtual machine:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh fedora@172.30.3.149 -p 27017
----
+

.Verification
* You receive the command prompt of the virtual machine backing the service you want to expose. You now have a service backed by a running virtual machine.
