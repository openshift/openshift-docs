[id="mos-network-prereqs-min-bandwidth_{context}"]
= Minimum bandwidth

During cluster deployment, {product-title} requires a minimum bandwidth of 120{nbsp}Mbps between cluster infrastructure and the public internet or private network locations that provide deployment artifacts and resources. When network connectivity is slower than 120{nbsp}Mbps (for example, when connecting through a proxy) the cluster installation process times out and deployment fails.

After cluster deployment, network requirements are determined by your workload. However, a minimum bandwidth of 120{nbsp}Mbps helps to ensure timely cluster and operator upgrades.
