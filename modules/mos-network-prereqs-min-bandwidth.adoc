= Minimum bandwidth

During cluster deployment, {product-title} requires a minimum bandwidth of 120{nbsp}Mbps between cluster resources and public internet resources. When network connectivity is slower than 120{nbsp}Mbps (for example, when connecting through a proxy) the cluster installation process times out and deployment fails.

After deployment, network requirements are determined by your workload. However, a minimum bandwidth of 120{nbsp}Mbps helps to ensure timely cluster and operator upgrades.
