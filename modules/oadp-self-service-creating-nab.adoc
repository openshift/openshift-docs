= Creating a NonAdminBackup CR

As a namespace admin user, you can create a `NonAdminBackup` (NAB) custom resource (CR) to back up your application from your authorized namespace. NAB is an {product-title} CR that securely facilitates the creation of a `Velero` backup object. The `Velero` backup object reports the status back to the NAB CR that ultimately updates the `status.phase` field.

After you create a NAB CR, the CR undergoes the following phases:

* The initial phase for the CR is `New`. 
* The CR creation request goes to the `NonAdminController` (NAC) for reconciliation and validation. 
* Upon successful validation and creation of the `Velero` backup object, the `status.phase` field of the NAB CR is updated to the next phase, which is, `Created`.

Review the following important points when creating a NAB CR:

* The `NonAdminBackup` CR creates the `Velero` backup object securely so that other namespace admin users cannot access the CR.
* As a namespace admin user, you can only specify your authorized namespace in the NAB CR. You get an error when you specify a namespace you are not authorized to use.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster as a namespace admin user.
* The cluster administrator has installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* The cluster administrator has configured the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) CR to enable {oadp-short} Self-Service.
* The cluster administrator has created a namespace for you and has authorized you to operate from that namespace.
* Optional: You can create and use a `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` (NABSL) CR to store the backup data. If you do not use a NABSL CR, then the backup is stored in the default backup storage location configured in the DPA.

.Procedure

. To create a `NonAdminBackup` CR, create a YAML manifest file with the following configuration:
+
.Example `NonAdminBackup` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminBackup
metadata:
  name: test-nab # <1>
spec:
  backupSpec:
    defaultVolumesToFsBackup: true # <2>
    snapshotMoveData: false # <3>
    storageLocation: test-bsl # <4>
----
<1> Specify a name for the NAB CR, for example, `test-nab`.
<2> To use File System Backup (FSB), set `defaultVolumesToFsBackup` to `true`.
<3> If you want to backup your data volumes by using the Data Mover, set the `snapshotMoveData` to `true`. This example uses the FSB for backup.
<4> Optionally, set a NABSL CR as a storage location. If you do not set a `storageLocation`, then the default backup storage location configured in the DPA is used.

. To apply the NAB CR configuration, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <nab_cr_filename> # <1>
----
<1> Specify the file name containing the NAB CR configuration.

.Verification

* To verify that the NAB CR is successfully created, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nab test-nab -o yaml
----
+

<1> The namespace name that the `NonAdminController` CR sets on the `Velero` backup object to back up.
<2> The NAC has reconciled and validated the NAB CR and has created the `Velero` backup object.
<3> The `fileSystemPodVolumeBackups` field indicates the number of volumes that are backed up by using FSB.
<4> The NAB CR is in the `Created` phase.
<5> This field indicates the queue position of the backup object. There can be multiple backups in process, and each backup object is assigned a queue position. When the backup is complete, the queue position is set to `0`.
<6> The NAC creates the `Velero` backup object and sets the value for the `nacuuid` field.
<7> The name of the associated `Velero` backup object.
<8> The status of the `Velero` backup object.
<9> The `Velero` backup object is in the `Completed` phase and the backup is successful.
