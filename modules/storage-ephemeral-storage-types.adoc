= Types of ephemeral storage

Ephemeral local storage is always made available in the primary
partition. There are two basic ways of creating the primary
partition: root and runtime.

[discrete]
== Root

This partition holds the kubelet root directory, `/var/lib/kubelet/` by
default, and `/var/log/` directory. This partition can be shared between user
pods, the OS, and Kubernetes system daemons. This partition can be consumed by pods
through `EmptyDir` volumes, container logs, image layers, and container-writable
layers. Kubelet manages shared access and isolation of this partition. This
partition is ephemeral, and applications cannot expect any performance SLAs,
such as disk IOPS, from this partition.

[discrete]
== Runtime

This is an optional partition that runtimes can use for overlay
file systems. {product-title} attempts to identify and provide
shared access along with isolation to this partition. Container image
layers and writable layers are stored here. If the runtime partition
exists, the `root` partition does not hold any image layer or other writable storage.
