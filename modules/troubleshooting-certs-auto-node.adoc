= Node certificates

Node certificates are self-signed certificates, which means that they are signed by the cluster and they originate from an internal certificate authority (CA) that is generated by the bootstrap process.

After the cluster is installed, the cluster automatically renews the node certificates.

For more information, see "Node certificates" in _Security and compliance_.
