= About data use

[role="_abstract"]
An explanation of how {ols-long} processes chat messages containing cluster and environment data through your configured Large Language Model (LLM) provider.

{ols-long} has limited capabilities to filter or redact the data and information you provide to the LLM. Do not enter data and information into the {ols-long} interface that you do not want to send to the LLM provider.

By sending transcripts or feedback to Red{nbsp}Hat you agree that Red{nbsp}Hat can use the data for quality assurance purposes. The transcript recording data uses the back-end of the Red{nbsp}Hat{nbsp}Insights system, and is subject to the same access restrictions and other security policies. 

You can email mailto:openshift-lightspeed-alpha@redhat.com[Red Hat] and request that your data be deleted.
