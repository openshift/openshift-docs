{ols-full} is a virtual assistant you interact with using natural language. Using the {ols-long} interface, you send chat messages that {ols-long} transforms and sends to the Large Language Model (LLM) provider you have configured for your environment. These messages can contain information about your cluster, cluster resources, or other aspects of your environment.

The {ols-long} {ols-release} release has limited capabilities to filter or redact the information you provide to the LLM. Do not enter information into the {ols-long} interface that you do not want to send to the LLM provider.

By using the {ols-long} as part of the {ols-release} release, you agree that Red Hat may use all of the messages that you exchange with the LLM provider for any purpose. The transcript recording data uses the Red Hat Insights system’s back-end, and is subject to the same access restrictions and other security policies. 

You may email mailto:openshift-lightspeed-alpha@redhat.com[Red Hat] and request that your data be deleted at the end of the {ols-release} release period.
