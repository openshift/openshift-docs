{ols-official} is a virtual assistant you interact with using natural language. Using the {ols-long} interface, you send chat messages that {ols-long} transforms and sends to the Large Language Model (LLM) provider you have configured for your environment. These messages can contain information about your cluster, cluster resources, or other aspects of your environment.

The {ols-long} service has limited capabilities to filter or redact the information you provide to the LLM. Do not enter information into the {ols-long} interface that you do not want to send to the LLM provider.

By sending transcripts or feedback to Red{nbsp}Hat you agree that Red{nbsp}Hat can use the data for quality assurance purposes. The transcript recording data uses the back-end of the Red{nbsp}Hat{nbsp}Insights system, and is subject to the same access restrictions and other security policies. 

You can email mailto:openshift-lightspeed-alpha@redhat.com[Red Hat] and request that your data be deleted.
