[id="ossm-multitenant-install_{context}"]
= {ProductName} multitenant installation

{ProductName} installs a multitenant control plane by default. You can specify the projects that can access the {ProductShortName} and isolate the {ProductShortName} from other control plane instances.

[id="ossm-mt-vs-clusterwide_{context}"]
== Multitenant installations

{ProductName} configures each member project to ensure network access between the project, the control plane, and other member projects. The exact configuration differs depending on how OpenShift software-defined networking (SDN) is configured. See About OpenShift SDN for additional details.

If the {product-title} cluster is configured to use the SDN plug-in:

* *`NetworkPolicy`*: {ProductName} creates a `NetworkPolicy` resource in each member project allowing ingress to all pods from the other members and the control plane. If you remove a member from {ProductShortName}, this `NetworkPolicy` resource is deleted from the project.
+
[NOTE]
====
This also restricts ingress to only member projects. If you require ingress from non-member projects, you need to create a `NetworkPolicy` to allow that traffic through.
====

* *Multitenant*: {ProductName} joins the `NetNamespace` for each member project to the `NetNamespace` of the control plane project (the equivalent of running `oc adm pod-network join-projects --to control-plane-project member-project`). If you remove a member from the {ProductShortName}, its `NetNamespace` is isolated from the control plane (the equivalent of running `oc adm pod-network isolate-projects member-project`).
