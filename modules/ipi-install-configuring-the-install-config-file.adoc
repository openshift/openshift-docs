= Configuring the install-config.yaml file

The `install-config.yaml` file requires some additional details.
Most of the information teaches the installation program and the resulting cluster enough about the available hardware that it is able to fully manage it.

[NOTE]
====
The installation program no longer needs the `clusterOSImage` {op-system} image because the correct image is in the release payload.
====

. Configure `install-config.yaml`. Change the appropriate variables to match the environment, including `pullSecret` and `sshKey`:

<1> Scale the worker machines based on the number of worker nodes that are part of the {product-title} cluster. Valid options for the `replicas` value are `0` and integers greater than or equal to `2`. Set the number of replicas to `0` to deploy a three-node cluster, which contains only three control plane machines. A three-node cluster is a smaller, more resource-efficient cluster that can be used for testing, development, and production. You cannot install the cluster with only one worker.
<2> When deploying a cluster with static IP addresses, you must set the `bootstrapExternalStaticIP` configuration setting to specify the static IP address of the bootstrap VM when there is no DHCP server on the bare-metal network.
<3> When deploying a cluster with static IP addresses, you must set the `bootstrapExternalStaticGateway` configuration setting to specify the gateway IP address for the bootstrap VM when there is no DHCP server on the bare-metal network.
<4> See the BMC addressing sections for more options.
<5> To set the path to the installation disk drive, enter the kernel name of the disk. For example, `/dev/sda`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the disk discovery order is not guaranteed, the kernel name of the disk can change across booting options for machines with multiple disks. For instance, `/dev/sda` becomes `/dev/sdb` and vice versa.
To avoid this issue, you must use persistent disk attributes, such as the disk World Wide Name (WWN). To use the disk WWN, replace the `deviceName` parameter with the `wwnWithExtension` parameter. Depending on the parameter that you use, enter the disk name, for example, `/dev/sda` or the disk WWN, for example, `"0x64cd98f04fde100024684cf3034da5c2"`. Ensure that you enter the disk WWN value within quotes so that it is used as a string value and not a hexadecimal value.

Failure to meet these requirements for the `rootDeviceHints` parameter might result in the following error:

ironic-inspector inspection failed: No disks satisfied root device hints

[NOTE]
====
Before {product-title} 4.12, the cluster installation program only accepted an IPv4 address or and IPv6 address for the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` configuration settings. In {product-title} 4.12 and later, these configuration settings are deprecated. Instead, use a list format in the `apiVIPs` and `ingressVIPs` configuration settings to specify IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses or both IP address formats.

. Create a directory to store the cluster configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir ~/clusterconfigs
----

. Copy the `install-config.yaml` file to the new directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cp install-config.yaml ~/clusterconfigs
----

. Ensure all bare metal nodes are powered off prior to installing the {product-title} cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ipmitool -I lanplus -U <user> -P <password> -H <management-server-ip> power off
----

. Remove old bootstrap resources if any are left over from a previous deployment attempt:
+
[source,bash]
----
for i in $(sudo virsh list | tail -n +3 | grep bootstrap | awk {'print $2'});
do
  sudo virsh destroy $i;
  sudo virsh undefine $i;
  sudo virsh vol-delete $i --pool $i;
  sudo virsh vol-delete $i.ign --pool $i;
  sudo virsh pool-destroy $i;
  sudo virsh pool-undefine $i;
done
