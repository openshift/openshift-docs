= Machine set options for the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service

You can use machine sets to create machines that use a specific version of the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). Machine sets can create machines that allow the use of both IMDSv1 and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html[IMDSv2] or machines that require the use of IMDSv2.

[NOTE]
====
Using IMDSv2 is only supported on AWS clusters that were created with {product-title} version 4.7 or later.
====

ifndef::cpmso[]
To deploy new compute machines with your preferred IMDS configuration, create a compute machine set YAML file with the appropriate values. You can also edit an existing machine set to create new machines with your preferred IMDS configuration when the machine set is scaled up. 
endif::cpmso[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before configuring a machine set to create machines that require IMDSv2, ensure that any workloads that interact with the AWS metadata service support IMDSv2.
