= Machine set options for the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service

You can use machine sets to create compute machines that use a specific version of the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). Machine sets can create compute machines that allow the use of both IMDSv1 and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html[IMDSv2] or compute machines that require the use of IMDSv2.

[NOTE]
====
Using IMDSv2 is only supported on AWS clusters that were created with {product-title} version 4.7 or later.
====

To change the IMDS configuration for existing compute machines, edit the machine set YAML file that manages those machines. To deploy new compute machines with your preferred IMDS configuration, create a machine set YAML file with the appropriate values.

The IMDS configuration for control plane machines is set during cluster installation. To change the control plane machine IMDS configuration, you must use the AWS CLI. For more information, see the AWS documentation about how to link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-options.html#configuring-IMDS-existing-instances[Modify instance metadata options for existing instances].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before configuring a machine set to create compute machines that require IMDSv2, ensure that any workloads that interact with the AWS metadata service support IMDSv2.
