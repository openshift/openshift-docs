= Machine set options for the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service

You can use machine sets to create machines that use a specific version of the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). Machine sets can create machines that allow the use of both IMDSv1 and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html[IMDSv2] or machines that require the use of IMDSv2.

[NOTE]
====
Using IMDSv2 is only supported on AWS clusters that were created with {product-title} version 4.7 or later.
====

To change the IMDS configuration for existing machines, edit the machine set YAML file that manages those machines.
ifndef::cpmso[]
To deploy new compute machines with your preferred IMDS configuration, create a compute machine set YAML file with the appropriate values.
endif::cpmso[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before configuring a machine set to create machines that require IMDSv2, ensure that any workloads that interact with the AWS metadata service support IMDSv2.
