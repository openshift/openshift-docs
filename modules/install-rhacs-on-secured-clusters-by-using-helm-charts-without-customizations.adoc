= Install {product-title-short} on secured clusters by using Helm charts without customizations

[role="_abstract"]
The `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart is the primary method for deploying the required {rh-rhacs-first} components onto the clusters you wish to monitor.

Purpose and scope::

The {product-title-short} Helm repository provides two primary charts:

`central-services`::: Installs the centralized management components (Central and Scanner). This is deployed only once.
`secured-cluster-services`::: Installs the detection and enforcement components. You must deploy this chart on every cluster that you want to secure, including the cluster hosting Central if you want to monitor it.

Installed components::

Installing the `secured-cluster-services` chart deploys the following per-cluster and per-node services:

Sensor::: The analysis and enforcement component that interacts with the Kubernetes API to monitor cluster state.
Admission controller::: A webhook that prevents the creation of non-compliant workloads based on your security policies.
Collector::: A component that gathers runtime information from the nodes in your cluster.
Scanner-slim::: A lightweight version of Scanner that performs image scanning operations within the secured cluster.

Installation modes::

You can install this chart in two primary ways:

Quick installation::: Uses default configuration values suitable for standard environments.
Customized installation::: Allows you to override default settings by using `helm install` parameters or YAML configuration files to tailor the deployment to specific network or security requirements.
