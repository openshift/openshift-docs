= Providing secure connection with OpenShift routes

[role="_abstract"]
To ensure secure communication for your webhooks, you can expose the `EventListener` service by using an OpenShift route configured with re-encrypt TLS termination. This approach terminates the external TLS connection at the router and establishes a new TLS connection to the `EventListener` pod by using its internal service certificate.

.Procedure

* To create a route with the re-encrypted TLS termination, run:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc create route reencrypt --service=<svc_name> \
                            --cert=tls.crt \
                            --key=tls.key \
                            --ca-cert=ca.crt \
                            --hostname=<hostname>
----
+
Alternatively, you can create a re-encrypted TLS termination YAML file to create a secure route.

`metadata.name`:: The name of the object. This name must not exceed 63 characters.
`spec.tls.termination`:: Set the termination field to `reencrypt`. This is the only required TLS field.
`spec.tls.destinationCACertificate`:: Required for re-encryption. The `destinationCACertificate` field specifies a CA certificate to validate the endpoint certificate, thus securing the connection from the router to the destination pods. You can omit this field in either of the following scenarios:
+
* The service uses a service signing certificate.
* The administrator specifies a default CA certificate for the router, and the service has a certificate signed by that CA.
+
You can run the `oc create route reencrypt --help` command to display more options.
