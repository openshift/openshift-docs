You can save on costs by creating a machine set running on AWS that deploys machines as non-guaranteed Spot Instances. Spot Instances utilize unused AWS EC2 capacity and are less expensive than On-Demand Instances. You can use Spot Instances for workloads that can tolerate interruptions, such as batch or stateless, horizontally scalable workloads.
endif::aws[]
ifdef::azure[]
You can save on costs by creating a machine set running on Azure that deploys machines as non-guaranteed Spot VMs. Spot VMs utilize unused Azure capacity and are less expensive than standard VMs. You can use Spot VMs for workloads that can tolerate interruptions, such as batch or stateless, horizontally scalable workloads.
endif::azure[]
ifdef::gcp[]
You can save on costs by creating a machine set running on GCP that deploys machines as non-guaranteed preemptible VM instances. Preemptible VM instances utilize excess Compute Engine capacity and are less expensive than normal instances. You can use preemptible VM instances for workloads that can tolerate interruptions, such as batch or stateless, horizontally scalable workloads.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is strongly recommended that control plane machines are not created on
ifdef::aws[Spot Instances]
ifdef::azure[Spot VMs]
ifdef::gcp[preemptible VM instances]
due to the increased likelihood of the instance being terminated. Manual intervention is required to replace a terminated control plane node.
====

ifdef::aws[]
AWS EC2 can terminate a Spot Instance at any time. AWS gives a two-minute warning to the user when an interruption occurs. {product-title} begins to remove the workloads from the affected instances when AWS issues the termination warning.

Interruptions can occur when using Spot Instances for the following reasons:

* The instance price exceeds your maximum price
* The demand for Spot Instances increases
* The supply of Spot Instances decreases

When AWS terminates an instance, a termination handler running on the Spot Instance node deletes the machine resource. To satisfy the machine set `replicas` quantity, the machine set creates a machine that requests a Spot Instance.
endif::aws[]
ifdef::azure[]
Azure can terminate a Spot VM at any time. Azure gives a 30-second warning to the user when an interruption occurs. {product-title} begins to remove the workloads from the affected instances when Azure issues the termination warning.

Interruptions can occur when using Spot VMs for the following reasons:

* The instance price exceeds your maximum price
* The supply of Spot VMs decreases
* Azure needs capacity back


When Azure terminates an instance, a termination handler running on the Spot VM node deletes the machine resource. To satisfy the machine set `replicas` quantity, the machine set creates a machine that requests a Spot VM.
endif::azure[]
ifdef::gcp[]
GCP Compute Engine can terminate a preemptible VM instance at any time. Compute Engine sends a preemption notice to the user indicating that an interruption will occur in 30 seconds. {product-title} begins to remove the workloads from the affected instances when Compute Engine issues the preemption notice. An ACPI G3 Mechanical Off signal is sent to the operating system after 30 seconds if the instance is not stopped. The preemptible VM instance is then transitioned to a `TERMINATED` state by Compute Engine.

Interruptions can occur when using preemptible VM instances for the following reasons:

* There is a system or maintenance event
* The supply of preemptible VM instances decreases
* The instance reaches the end of the allotted 24-hour period for preemptible VM instances

When GCP terminates an instance, a termination handler running on the preemptible VM instance node deletes the machine resource. To satisfy the machine set `replicas` quantity, the machine set creates a machine that requests a preemptible VM instance.
