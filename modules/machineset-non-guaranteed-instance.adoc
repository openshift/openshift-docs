= MachineSet Spot Instances

You can save costs by creating an AWS MachineSet that deploys machines as non-guaranteed,
Spot Instances. Spot Instances utilize unused AWS EC2 capacity and are less expensive
than On-Demand Instances. You can use Spot Instances for workloads that can tolerate
interruptions, such as batch or stateless, horizontally scalable workloads.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is strongly recommended that control plane machines are not created on Spot Instances due to the increased likelihood of the instance being terminated. Manual intervention is required to replace a terminated control plane node.
====

AWS EC2 can terminate a Spot Instance at any time. AWS gives a two-minute warning to
the user when an interruption occurs. The {product-title} begins to remove the workloads
from the affected instances when AWS issues the termination warning.

Interruptions can occur when using Spot Instances if:

* The instance price exceeds your maximum price.
* The demand for Spot Instances increases.
* The supply of Spot Instances decreases.

If AWS does not have capacity, the Machine Health Checker (MHC) can remove the machine.
The MHC also remediates a machine that fails if a request for a Spot Instance is not satisfied
when a machine is created. AWS does not replace a Spot Instance when the instance is terminated.
