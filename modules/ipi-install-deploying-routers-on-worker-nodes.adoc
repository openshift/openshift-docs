[id="deploying-routers-on-worker-nodes_{context}"]
= Optional: Deploying routers on worker nodes

During installation, the installer deploys router pods on worker nodes. By default, the installer installs two router pods. If a deployed cluster requires additional routers to handle external traffic loads destined for services within the {product-title} cluster, you can create a `yaml` file to set an appropriate number of router replicas.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deploying a cluster with only one worker node is not supported. While modifying the router replicas will address issues with the `degraded` state when deploying with one worker, the cluster loses high availability for the ingress API, which is not suitable for production environments.
====

[NOTE]
====
By default, the installer deploys two routers. If the cluster has no worker nodes, the installer deploys the two routers on the control plane nodes by default.
====

.Procedure

. Create a `router-replicas.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  replicas: <num-of-router-pods>
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    type: HostNetwork
  nodePlacement:
    nodeSelector:
      matchLabels:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Replace `<num-of-router-pods>` with an appropriate value. If working with just one worker node, set `replicas:` to `1`. If working with more than 3 worker nodes, you can increase `replicas:` from the default value `2` as appropriate.
====

. Save and copy the `router-replicas.yaml` file to the `clusterconfigs/openshift` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cp ~/router-replicas.yaml clusterconfigs/openshift/99_router-replicas.yaml
