= Deploying routers on worker nodes

During installation, the installer deploys router pods on worker nodes. By default, the installer installs two router pods. If the initial cluster has only one worker node, or if a deployed cluster requires additional routers to handle external traffic loads destined for services within the {product-title} cluster, you can create a `yaml` file to set an appropriate number of router replicas.

[NOTE]
====
By default, the installer deploys two routers. If the cluster has at least two worker nodes, you can skip this section.
====

[NOTE]
====
If the cluster has no worker nodes, the installer deploys the two routers on the control plane nodes by default. If the cluster has no worker nodes, you can skip this section.

.Procedure

. Create a `router-replicas.yaml` file.

[NOTE]
====
Replace `<num-of-router-pods>` with an appropriate value. If working with just one worker node, set `replicas:` to `1`. If working with more than 3 worker nodes, you can increase `replicas:` from the default value `2` as appropriate.
====

. Save and copy the `router-replicas.yaml` file to the `clusterconfigs/openshift` directory.
