= Configuring the AAQ Operator by using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure the AAQ Operator by specifying the fields of the `spec.applicationAwareConfig` object in the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure
* Update the `HyperConverged` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch hco kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv --type merge -p '{
  "spec": {
    "applicationAwareConfig": {
      "vmiCalcConfigName": "DedicatedVirtualResources",
      "namespaceSelector": {
        "matchLabels": {
          "app": "my-app"
        }
      },
      "allowApplicationAwareClusterResourceQuota": true
    }
  }
}'

+
where:

`vmiCalcConfigName`:: Specifies how resource counting is managed for pods that run virtual machine (VM) workloads. Possible values are:
+
--
* `VmiPodUsage`: Counts compute resources for pods associated with VMs in the same way as native resource quotas and excludes migration-related resources.
* `VirtualResources`: Counts compute resources based on the VM specifications, using the VM RAM size for memory and virtual CPUs for processing.
* `DedicatedVirtualResources` (default): Similar to `VirtualResources`, but separates resource tracking for pods associated with VMs by adding a `/vmi` suffix to CPU and memory resource names. For example, `requests.cpu/vmi` and `requests.memory/vmi`.
--
`namespaceSelector`:: Determines the namespaces for which an AAQ scheduling gate is added to pods when they are created. If a namespace selector is not defined, the AAQ Operator targets namespaces with the `application-aware-quota/enable-gating` label as default.
`allowApplicationAwareClusterResourceQuota`:: If set to `true`, you can create and manage the `ApplicationAwareClusterResourceQuota` object. Setting this attribute to `true` can increase scheduling time.
