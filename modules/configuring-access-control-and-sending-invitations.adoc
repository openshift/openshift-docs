. In the *Invite users* dialog box, provide the following information:

[IMPORTANT]
====
* If you have only one authentication provider available, it is selected by default.
* If multiple authentication providers are available and at least one of them is `Red Hat SSO` or `Default Internal SSO`, that provider is selected by default.
* If multiple authentication providers are available, but none of them is `Red Hat SSO` or `Default Internal SSO`, you are prompted to select one manually.
* If you have not yet set up an authentication provider, a warning message appears and the form is disabled. Click the link, which takes you to the *Access Control* section to configure an authentication provider.
====
* *Role*: From the drop-down list, select the role to assign to each invited user.

. Click *Invite users*.
. On the confirmation dialog box, you receive a confirmation that the users have been created with the selected role.
. Copy the one or more email addresses and the message into an email that you create in your own email client, and send it to the users.
. Click *Done*.
