= Installing the {product-title} Operator

[role="_abstract"]
Using the OperatorHub provided with {ocp} is the easiest way to install {product-title}.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to an {ocp} cluster using an account with Operator installation permissions.
* You must be using {ocp} 4.6 or later.

.Procedure
. Navigate in the web console to the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* page.

. Enter *Advanced Cluster Security* into the *Filter by keyword* box to find the {product-title} Operator.

. Select the *{product-title} Operator* to view the details page.

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

** Keep the default value for *Installation mode* as *All namespaces on the cluster*.
** Choose a specific namespace in which to install the Operator for the *Installed namespace* field. Red Hat recommends installing the {product-title} Operator in the *rhacs-operators* namespace.
** Select automatic or manual updates for *Approval strategy*.
+
If you choose automatic updates, when a new version of the Operator is available, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator.
+
If you choose manual updates, when a newer version of the Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to update the Operator to the new version.

. Click *Install*.

.Verification
* After the installation completes, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* to verify that the {product-title} Operator is listed with the status of *Succeeded*.
