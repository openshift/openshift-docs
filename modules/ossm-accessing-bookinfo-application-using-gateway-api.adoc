= Accessing the Bookinfo application by using Gateway API
:context: ossm-accessing-bookinfo-application-using-gateway-API

The {k8s} Gateway API deploys a gateway by creating a `Gateway` resource. In {ocp-product-title} 4.15 and later versions. If you want your cluster to use the Gateway API CRDs, you must enable the CRDs because they are disabled by default.  

[NOTE]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat provides support for using the {k8s} Gateway API with {SMProductName}. Red{nbsp}Hat does not provide support for the {k8s} Gateway API custom resource definitions (CRDs). In this procedure, the use of community Gateway API CRDs is shown for demonstration purposes only.
====

. Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console as `cluster-admin`.

* The {SMProductName} Operator must be installed.

* The {istio} resource must be deployed. 

.Procedure

. Enable the Gateway API CRDs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io &> /dev/null ||  { oc kustomize "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/config/crd?ref=v1.0.0" | oc apply -f -; }
----

. Create and configure a gateway using a `Gateway` resource and `HTTPRoute` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.23/samples/bookinfo/gateway-api/bookinfo-gateway.yaml -n bookinfo
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To configure a gateway with the `bookinfo` application by using the Gateway API, this example uses a sample gateway configuration file that must be applied in the namespace where the application is installed.
====

. Ensure that the Gateway API service is ready, and has an address allocated:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait --for=condition=programmed gtw bookinfo-gateway -n bookinfo
----

. Retrieve the host, port and gateway URL:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export INGRESS_HOST=$(oc get gtw bookinfo-gateway -n bookinfo -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
$ export INGRESS_PORT=$(oc get gtw bookinfo-gateway -n bookinfo -o jsonpath='{.spec.listeners[?(@.name=="http")].port}')
$ export GATEWAY_URL=$INGRESS_HOST:$INGRESS_PORT
----

. Obtain the gateway host name and the URL of the product page:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo "http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage"
----

. Verify that the `productpage` is accessible from a web browser.
