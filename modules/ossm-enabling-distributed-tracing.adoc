= Enabling and disabling tracing

You enable distributed tracing by specifying a tracing type and a sampling rate in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

.Default `all-in-one` Jaeger parameters
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  version: v2.0
  tracing:
    sampling: 100
    type: Jaeger
----

Currently, the only tracing type that is supported is `Jaeger`.

Jaeger is enabled by default. To disable tracing, set `type` to `None`.

The sampling rate determines how often the Envoy proxy generates a trace. You can use the sampling rate option to control what percentage of requests get reported to your tracing system. You can configure this setting based upon your traffic in the mesh and the amount of tracing data you want to collect. You configure `sampling` as a scaled integer representing 0.01% increments. For example, setting the value to `10` samples 0.1% of traces, setting the value to `500` samples 5% of traces, and a setting of `10000` samples 100% of traces.

[NOTE]
====
The SMCP sampling configuration option controls the Envoy sampling rate. You configure the Jaeger trace sampling rate in the Jaeger custom resource.
