= Manually importing a hosted cluster on {aws-short}

You can also import a hosted cluster on {aws-first} with the command-line interface.

.Procedure

. Create your `ManagedCluster` resource by using the following sample YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  annotations:
    import.open-cluster-management.io/hosting-cluster-name: local-cluster
    import.open-cluster-management.io/klusterlet-deploy-mode: Hosted
    open-cluster-management/created-via: hypershift
  labels:
    cloud: auto-detect
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: default
    name: <cluster_name>
    vendor: OpenShift
  name: <cluster_name>
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
  leaseDurationSeconds: 60
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Run the following command to apply the resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <file_name>
----
+
Replace `<file_name>` with the YAML file name you created in the previous step.

. If you have Red{nbsp}Hat Advanced Cluster Management installed, create your `KlusterletAddonConfig` resource by using the following sample YAML file. If you have installed {mce-short} only, skip this step:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: KlusterletAddonConfig
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name>
  namespace: <cluster_name>
spec:
  clusterName: <cluster_name>
  clusterNamespace: <cluster_name>
  clusterLabels:
    cloud: auto-detect
    vendor: auto-detect
  applicationManager:
    enabled: true
  certPolicyController:
    enabled: true
  iamPolicyController:
    enabled: true
  policyController:
    enabled: true
  searchCollector:
    enabled: false
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Run the following command to apply the resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <file_name>
----
+
Replace `<file_name>` with the YAML file name you created in the previous step.

. After the import process is complete, your hosted cluster becomes visible in the console. You can also check the status of your hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedcluster <cluster_name>
----
