= Uninstalling the Local Storage Operator

To uninstall the Local Storage Operator, you must remove the Operator and all created resources in the `openshift-local-storage` project.

[WARNING]
====
Uninstalling the Local Storage Operator while local storage PVs are still in use is not recommended. While the PVs will remain after the Operator's removal,
there might be indeterminate behavior if the Operator is uninstalled and reinstalled without removing the PVs and local storage resources.
