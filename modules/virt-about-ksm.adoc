= About using {VirtProductName} to activate KSM

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure {VirtProductName} to activate kernel samepage merging (KSM) when nodes experience memory overload.

[id="virt-ksm-configuration-methods"]
== Configuration methods

You can enable or disable the KSM activation feature for all nodes by using the {product-title} web console or by editing the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR). The `HyperConverged` CR supports more granular configuration.

[id="virt-ksm-cr-configuration"]
CR configuration::
+
You can configure the KSM activation feature by editing the `spec.configuration.ksmConfiguration` stanza of the `HyperConverged` CR.
+
--
* You enable the feature and configure settings by editing the `ksmConfiguration` stanza.

* You disable the feature by deleting the `ksmConfiguration` stanza.

* You can allow {VirtProductName} to enable KSM on only a subset of nodes by adding node selection syntax to the `ksmConfiguration.nodeLabelSelector` field.

[NOTE]
====
Even if the KSM activation feature is disabled in {VirtProductName}, an administrator can still enable KSM on nodes that support it.

[id="virt-ksm-node-labels"]
== KSM node labels

{VirtProductName} identifies nodes that are configured to support KSM and applies the following node labels:

`kubevirt.io/ksm-handler-managed: "false"`:: This label is set to `"true"` when {VirtProductName} activates KSM on a node that is experiencing memory overload. This label is not set to `"true"` if an administrator activates KSM.

`kubevirt.io/ksm-enabled: "false"`:: This label is set to `"true"` when KSM is activated on a node, even if {VirtProductName} did not activate KSM.

These labels are not applied to nodes that do not support KSM.
