= Generating a seed image with the {lcao}

Use the {lcao} to generate the seed image with the `SeedGenerator` CR. The Operator checks for required system configurations, performs any necessary system cleanup before generating the seed image, and launches the image generation. The seed image generation includes the following tasks:

* Stopping cluster Operators
* Preparing the seed image configuration
* Generating and pushing the seed image to the image repository specified in the `SeedGenerator` CR
* Restoring cluster Operators
* Expiring seed cluster certificates
* Generating new certificates for the seed cluster
* Restoring and updating the `SeedGenerator` CR on the seed cluster

.Prerequisites

* You have configured a shared container directory on the seed cluster.
* You have installed the minimum version of the {oadp-short} Operator and the {lcao} on the seed cluster.
* Ensure that persistent volumes are not configured on the seed cluster.
* Ensure that the `LocalVolume` CR does not exist on the seed cluster if the Local Storage Operator is used.
* Ensure that the `LVMCluster` CR does not exist on the seed cluster if {lvms} is used.
* Ensure that the `DataProtectionApplication` CR does not exist on the seed cluster if {oadp-short} is used.

.Procedure

. Detach the cluster from the hub to delete any {rh-rhacm}-specific resources from the seed cluster that must not be in the seed image:

.. Manually detach the seed cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete managedcluster sno-worker-example
----

... Wait until the `ManagedCluster` CR is removed. After the CR is removed, create the proper `SeedGenerator` CR. The {lcao} cleans up the {rh-rhacm} artifacts.

.. If you are using {ztp}, detach your cluster by removing the seed cluster's `SiteConfig` CR from the `kustomization.yaml`.

... If you have a `kustomization.yaml` file that references multiple `SiteConfig` CRs, remove your seed cluster's `SiteConfig` CR from the `kustomization.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

generators:
#- example-seed-sno1.yaml
- example-target-sno2.yaml
- example-target-sno3.yaml
----

... If you have a `kustomization.yaml` that references one `SiteConfig` CR, remove your seed cluster's `SiteConfig` CR from the `kustomization.yaml` and add the `generators: {}` line:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

generators: {}
----

... Commit the `kustomization.yaml` changes in your Git repository and push the changes to your repository.
+
The ArgoCD pipeline detects the changes and removes the managed cluster.

. Create the `Secret` object so that you can push the seed image to your registry.

.. Create the authentication file by running the following commands:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ MY_USER=myuserid
$ AUTHFILE=/tmp/my-auth.json
$ podman login --authfile ${AUTHFILE} -u ${MY_USER} quay.io/${MY_USER}
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ base64 -w 0 ${AUTHFILE} ; echo
----
--

.. Copy the output into the `seedAuth` field in the `Secret` YAML file named `seedgen` in the `openshift-lifecycle-agent` namespace:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: seedgen <1>
  namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent
type: Opaque
data:
  seedAuth: <encoded_AUTHFILE> <2>
----
<1> The `Secret` resource must have the `name: seedgen` and `namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent` fields.
<2> Specifies a base64-encoded authfile for write-access to the registry for pushing the generated seed images.
--

.. Apply the `Secret` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f secretseedgenerator.yaml
----

. Create the `SeedGenerator` CR:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1
kind: SeedGenerator
metadata:
  name: seedimage <1>
spec:
  seedImage: <seed_container_image> <2>
----
<1> The `SeedGenerator` CR must be named `seedimage`.
<2> Specify the container image URL, for example, `quay.io/example/seed-container-image:<tag>`. It is recommended to use the `<seed_cluster_name>:<ocp_version>` format.
--

. Generate the seed image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f seedgenerator.yaml
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The cluster reboots and loses API capabilities while the {lcao} generates the seed image.
Applying the `SeedGenerator` CR stops the `kubelet` and the CRI-O operations, then it starts the image generation.
====

If you want to generate more seed images, you must provision a new seed cluster with the version that you want to generate a seed image from.

.Verification

. After the cluster recovers and it is available, you can check the status of the `SeedGenerator` CR by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get seedgenerator -o yaml
----

.Example output
[source,yaml]
