= Generating a seed image with the {lcao}

Use the {lcao} to generate the seed image with the `SeedGenerator` CR. The Operator checks for required system configurations, performs any necessary system cleanup before generating the seed image, and launches the image generation. The seed image generation includes the following tasks:

* Stopping cluster operators
* Preparing the seed image configuration
* Generating and pushing the seed image to the image repository specified in the `SeedGenerator` CR
* Restoring cluster operators
* Expiring seed cluster certificates
* Generating new certificates for the seed cluster
* Restoring and updating the `SeedGenerator` CR on the seed cluster

.Prerequisites

* Install the OADP Operator on the seed cluster.

.Procedure

. Detach the cluster to delete any cluster-specific resources from the seed cluster that must not be in the seed image:

.. If you are using {rh-rhacm}, manually detach the seed cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete managedcluster sno-worker-example
----

... Wait until the `ManagedCluster` CR is removed. Once the CR is removed, create the proper `SeedGenerator` CR. The {lcao} cleans up the {rh-rhacm} artifacts.

.. If you are using GitOps ZTP, detach your cluster by removing the seed cluster's `SiteConfig` CR from the `kustomization.yaml`:

... Remove your seed cluster's `SiteConfig` CR from the `kustomization.yaml`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

generators:
#- example-seed-sno1.yaml
- example-target-sno2.yaml
- example-target-sno3.yaml
----

... Commit the `kustomization.yaml` changes in your Git repository and push the changes.

+
The ArgoCD pipeline detects the changes and removes the managed cluster.

. Create the `Secret`.

.. Create the authentication file by running the following command:
+
--
.Authentication file
[source,terminal]
----
$ MY_USER=myuserid
$ AUTHFILE=/tmp/my-auth.json
$ podman login --authfile ${AUTHFILE} -u ${MY_USER} quay.io/${MY_USER}
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ base64 -w 0 ${AUTHFILE} ; echo
----
--

.. Copy the output into the `seedAuth` field in the `Secret` YAML file named `seedgen` in the `openshift-lifecycle-agent` namespace.
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: seedgen <1>
  namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent
type: Opaque
data:
  seedAuth: <encoded_AUTHFILE> <2>
----
<1> The `Secret` resource must have the `name: seedgen` and `namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent` fields.
<2> Specifies a base64-encoded authfile for write-access to the registry for pushing the generated seed images.
--

.. Apply the `Secret`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f secretseedgenerator.yaml
----

. Create the `SeedGenerator` CR:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1
kind: SeedGenerator
metadata:
  name: seedimage <1>
spec:
  seedImage: <seed_container_image> <2>
----
<1> The `SeedGenerator` CR must be named `seedimage`.
<2> Specify the container image URL, for example, `quay.io/example/seed-container-image:<tag>`. It is recommended to use the `<seed_cluster_name>:<ocp_version>` format.
--

. Generate the seed image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f seedgenerator.yaml
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The cluster reboots and loses API capabilities while the {lcao} generates the seed image.
Applying the `SeedGenerator` CR stops the `kubelet` and the CRI-O operations, then it starts the image generation.
====

If you want to generate further seed images, you must provision a new seed cluster with the version you want to generate a seed image from.

.Verification

. Once the cluster recovers and it is available, you can check the status of the `SeedGenerator` CR:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get seedgenerator -oyaml
----

.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-02-13T21:24:26Z"
    message: Seed Generation completed
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Completed
    status: "False"
    type: SeedGenInProgress
  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-02-13T21:24:26Z"
    message: Seed Generation completed
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Completed
    status: "True"
    type: SeedGenCompleted <1>
  observedGeneration: 1
----
<1> The seed image generation is complete.
--

. Verify that the {sno} cluster is running and is attached to the {rh-rhacm} hub cluster:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedclusters sno-worker-example
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                 HUB ACCEPTED   MANAGED CLUSTER URLS                                  JOINED   AVAILABLE   AGE
sno-worker-example   true           https://api.sno-worker-example.example.redhat.com     True     True        21h <1>
----
<1> The cluster is attached if you see that the value is `True` for both `JOINED` and `AVAILABLE`.

[NOTE]
====
The cluster requires time to recover after restarting the `kubelet` operation.
