[id="kmm-setting-kernel-firmware-search-path_{context}"]
= Setting the kernel firmware search path

The Linux kernel accepts the `firmware_class.path` parameter as a search path for firmware, as explained in link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/firmware/fw_search_path.html[Firmware search paths].

KMM worker pods can set this value on nodes by writing to sysfs before attempting to load kmods.

.Procedure

* To define a firmware search path, set `worker.setFirmwareClassPath` to `/var/lib/firmware` in the Operator configuration.
