= About adding devices to a volume group

The `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR contains the configuration to specify the paths to the devices that you want to add to the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) volume group.

You can specify the device paths in the `deviceSelector.paths` field, the `deviceSelector.optionalPaths` field, or both. If you do not specify the device paths in both the `deviceSelector.paths` field and the `deviceSelector.optionalPaths` field, {lvms} adds the supported unused devices to the volume group (VG). 

You can add the path to the Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) arrays in the `deviceSelector` field to integrate the RAID arrays with {lvms}. You can create the RAID array by using the `mdadm` utility. {lvms} does not support creating a software RAID.

[NOTE]
====
You can create a RAID array only during an {product-title} installation. For information on creating a RAID array, see the following sections:

* "Configuring a RAID-enabled data volume" in "Additional resources".

====

If you do not add the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR, {lvms} automatically adds the new devices when the devices are available.

{lvms} adds the devices to the LVM volume group only if the following conditions are met:

* The device path exists.
* The device is supported by {lvms}.

You can also add the path to the RAID arrays to integrate the RAID arrays with {lvms}. For more information, see "Integrating RAID arrays with {lvms}" in the "Additional resources" section. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
After a device is added to the LVM volume group, it cannot be removed.
