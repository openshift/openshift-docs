= About adding devices to a volume group

The `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR contains the configuration to specify the paths to the devices that you want to add to the LVM volume group.

You can specify the device paths in the `deviceSelector.paths` field, the `deviceSelector.optionalPaths` field, or both. If you do not specify the device paths in both the `deviceSelector.paths` field and the `deviceSelector.optionalPaths` field, {lvms} adds the supported unused devices to the LVM volume group. 

The devices that you want to add to the volume group must be supported by {lvms}. For information about unsupported devices, see "Devices not supported by {lvms}" in the "Additional resources" section.

If you do not add the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR, {lvms} automatically adds the new devices when the devices are available.

{lvms} adds the devices to the LVM volume group only if the following conditions are met:

* The device path exists.
* The device is supported by {lvms}.

You can also add the path to the RAID arrays to integrate the RAID arrays with {lvms}. For more information, see "Integrating RAID arrays with {lvms}" in the "Additional resources" section. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
After a device is added to the LVM volume group, it cannot be removed.
