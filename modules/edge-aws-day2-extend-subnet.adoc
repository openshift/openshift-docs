= Creating the subnet

If you want a Machine API to create an Amazon ECS instance in a remote zone
location, you must create a subnet in a Local Zone location. You can use any
provisioning tool to create subnets in the existing VPC.

The following subsections include examples based on the use of CloudFormation templates
used in the installation process. Considering the limitation of NAT Gateways
in AWS Local Zones, only public subnets are supported by the CloudFormation templates.
You can adapt it to your needs.

You can reuse it to create subnets for each edge location you need to extend the cluster to.
