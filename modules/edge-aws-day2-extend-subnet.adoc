= Create a Local Zone subnet

If you want a Machine API to create an Amazon EC2 instance in a remote zone
location, you must create a subnet in a Local Zone location. You can use any
provisioning tool, such as Ansible or Terraform, to create subnets in the existing VPC.

The following subsections include steps using CloudFormation templates. Considering
the limitation of NAT Gateways in AWS Local Zones, CloudFormation templates suppor
 only public subnets. You can adapt it to your needs.

You can modify the CloudFormation template to meet your requirements. Additionally,
you can reuse the template to create public subnets for each edge location to where you
need to extend your cluster.
