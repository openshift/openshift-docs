== Purpose
endif::operators[]
The Node Feature Discovery Operator (NFD) manages the detection of hardware features and configuration in an {product-title} cluster by labeling the nodes with hardware-specific information. NFD labels the host with node-specific attributes, such as PCI cards, kernel, operating system version, and so on.

The NFD Operator can be found on the Operator Hub by searching for “Node Feature Discovery”.
