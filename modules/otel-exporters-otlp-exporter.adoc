----
<1> The OTLP gRPC endpoint. If the `+https://+` scheme is used, then client transport security is enabled and overrides the `insecure` setting in the `tls`.
<2> The client-side TLS configuration. Defines paths to TLS certificates.
<3> Disables client transport security when set to `true`. The default value is `false` by default.
<4> Skips verifying the certificate when set to `true`. The default value is `false`.
<5> Specifies the time interval at which the certificate is reloaded. If the value is not set, the certificate is never reloaded. The `reload_interval` accepts a string containing valid units of time such as `ns`, `us` or `µs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.
<6> Overrides the virtual hostname of authority such as the authority header field in requests. You can use this for testing.
<7> Headers are sent for every request performed during an established connection.
