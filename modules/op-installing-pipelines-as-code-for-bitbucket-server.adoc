= Install Pipelines-As-Code for Bitbucket Server

Pipelines-As-Code has a full support of Bitbucket Server.

Pipelines-As-Code has a full support on Bitbucket Cloud on https://bitbucket.org

You have to first install the Pipelines-as-Code infrastructure as detailled here : Install infrastructure

You will have to generate a personal token as the manager of the Project, follow the steps here :

https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/personal-access-tokens-939515499.html

The token will need to have the PROJECT_ADMIN and REPOSITORY_ADMIN permissions.

Note that the token needs to be able to have access to the forked repository in pull requests or it would not be able to process.

Make sure you note somewhere the generated token or otherwise you will have to recreate it.

Create a Webhook on the repository following this guide :
https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/manage-webhooks/

Add a Secret or generate a random one with :
  openssl rand -hex 20
Set the URL to the event listenner public URL. On OpenShift you can get the public URL of the Pipelines-as-Code eventlistenner like this :

echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code el-pipelines-as-code-interceptor -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
Install the secret in the pipelines-as-code namespace (we currently only supports one webhook secret per cluster ) :

kubectl -n pipelines-as-code create secret generic pipelines-as-code-secret \
        --from-literal webhook.secret="$WEBHOOK_SECRET_AS_GENERATED"
Refer to this screenshot on which events to handle on the Webhook. The individual events to select are :

Repository -> Push
Repository -> Modified
Pull Request -> Opened
Pull Request -> Source branch updated
Pull Request -> Comments added
And now create Repositry CRD with the secret field referencing it.

Here is an example of a Repository CRD :
---
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: my-repo
  namespace: target-namespace
spec:
  url: "https://bitbucket.com/workspace/repo"
  git_provider:
    url: "https://bitbucket.server.api.url"
    user: "yourbitbucketusername"
    secret:
      name: "bitbucket-server-token"
      # Set this if you have a different key in your secret
      # key: "token"
Notes
git_provider.secret cannot reference a secret in another namespace, Pipelines as code assumes always it will be the same namespace as where the repository has been created.

tkn-pac create and bootstrap is not supported on Bitbucket Server.

You can only reference user by the ACCOUNT_ID in owner file.
