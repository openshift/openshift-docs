.Error `pods is forbidden`

If you are a non-admin user trying to access a namespace that you do not have access to, you get the following error:

[source, terminal]
----
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "nac-user" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "openshift-adp"
----

The cluster administrator has not authorized the non-admin user to access the namespace.

.Solution

The cluster administrator must authorize the non-admin user to access the namespace.
