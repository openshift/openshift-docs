= Configuring a hard concurrency limit

You can specify a hard concurrency limit for your Knative service by modifying the `containerConcurrency` spec or by using the `kn service` command with the correct flags.

// However, a default value can be set for the Revision's containerConcurrency field in config-defaults.yaml.
// add note about this for admins to see? Need more details about config-defaults though

.Procedure

* Optional: Set the `containerConcurrency` spec for your Knative service in the spec of the `Service` custom resource:
+
.Example service spec
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
  namespace: default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containerConcurrency: 50
----
+
The default value is `0`, which means that there is no limit on the number of simultaneous requests that are permitted to flow into one replica of the service at a time.
+
A value greater than `0` specifies the exact number of requests that are permitted to flow into one replica of the service at a time. This example would enable a hard concurrency limit of 50 requests.

* Optional: Use the `kn service` command to specify the `--concurrency-limit` flag:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service create <service_name> --image <image_uri> --concurrency-limit <integer>
----
+
.Example command to create a service with a concurrency limit of 50 requests
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service create example-service --image quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:latest --concurrency-limit 50
