^1^ ReadOnlyMany

^2^ ReadWriteMany.

^3^ Prometheus is the underlying technology used for metrics.

^4^ This does not apply to physical disk, VM physical disk, VMDK, loopback over NFS, AWS EBS, and Azure Disk.

^5^ For metrics, using file storage with the ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode is unreliable. If you use file storage, do not configure the RWX access mode on any PersistentVolumeClaims that are configured for use with metrics.

^6^ For logging, using any shared
storage would be an anti-pattern. One volume per elasticsearch is required.

^7^ Object storage is not consumed through {product-title}'s PVs/persistent volume claims (PVCs). Apps must integrate with the object storage REST API.

[NOTE]
====
A scaled registry is an {product-title} registry where two or more Pod replicas are running.

== Specific application storage recommendations

[IMPORTANT]
====
Testing shows issues with using the NFS server on RHEL as storage backend for
core services. This includes the OpenShift Container Registry and Quay,
Prometheus for monitoring storage, and Elasticsearch for logging storage.
Therefore, using RHEL NFS to back PVs used by core services is not recommended.

Other NFS implementations on the marketplace might not have these issues.
Contact the individual NFS implementation vendor for more information on any
testing that was possibly completed against these {product-title} core
components.
====

=== Registry

In a non-scaled/high-availability (HA) {product-title} registry cluster deployment:

* The preferred storage technology is object storage followed by block storage. The
storage technology does not have to support RWX access mode.
* The storage technology must ensure read-after-write consistency. All NAS storage are not
recommended for {product-title} Registry cluster deployment with production workloads.
* While `hostPath` volumes are configurable for a non-scaled/HA {product-title} Registry, they are not recommended for cluster deployment.

=== Scaled registry

In a scaled/HA {product-title} registry cluster deployment:

* The preferred storage technology is object storage. The storage technology must support RWX access mode and must ensure read-after-write consistency.
* File storage and block storage are not recommended for a scaled/HA {product-title} registry cluster deployment with production workloads.

=== Metrics

In an {product-title} hosted metrics cluster deployment:

* The preferred storage technology is block storage.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Testing shows significant unrecoverable corruptions using file storage and,
therefore, file storage is not recommended for use with metrics.

There are file storage implementations in the marketplace that might not have
these issues. Contact the individual storage vendor for more information on any
testing that was possibly completed against these OpenShift core components.
====

=== Logging

In an {product-title} hosted logging cluster deployment:

* The preferred storage technology is block storage.
* It is not recommended to use NAS storage for a hosted metrics cluster deployment with production workloads.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Testing shows issues with using the NFS server on RHEL as storage backend for
core services. This includes Elasticsearch for logging storage. Therefore, using
RHEL NFS to back PVs used by core services is not recommended.

Other NFS implementations on the marketplace might not have these issues.
Contact the individual NFS implementation vendor for more information on any
testing that was possibly completed against these {product-title} core
components.

=== Applications

Application use cases vary from application to application, as described in the following examples:

* Storage technologies that support dynamic PV provisioning have low mount time latencies, and are not tied
to nodes to support a healthy cluster.
* Application developers are responsible for knowing and understanding the storage
requirements for their application, and how it works with the provided storage
to ensure that issues do not occur when an application scales or interacts
with the storage layer.

== Other specific application storage recommendations

* {product-title} Internal `etcd`: For the best `etcd` reliability, the lowest consistent latency storage technology is preferable.
* It is highly recommended that you use `etcd` with storage that handles serial
writes (fsync) quickly, such as NVMe or SSD. Ceph, NFS, and spinning disks are
not recommended.
* {rh-openstack-first} Cinder: {rh-openstack} Cinder tends to be adept in ROX access mode use cases.
* Databases: Databases (RDBMSs, NoSQL DBs, etc.) tend to perform best with dedicated block storage.
