^1^ ReadOnlyMany

^2^ ReadWriteMany.

^3^ Prometheus is the underlying technology used for metrics.

^4^ This does not apply to physical disk, VM physical disk, VMDK, loopback over NFS, AWS EBS, and Azure Disk.

^5^ For metrics, using file storage with the ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode is unreliable. If you use file storage, do not configure the RWX access mode on any PersistentVolumeClaims that are configured for use with metrics.

^6^ For logging, using any shared
storage would be an anti-pattern. One volume per elasticsearch is required.

^7^ Object storage is not consumed through {product-title}'s PVs/persistent volume claims (PVCs). Apps must integrate with the object storage REST API.

[NOTE]
====
A scaled registry is an {product-title} registry where two or more Pod replicas are running.

== Specific application storage recommendations

[IMPORTANT]
====
Testing shows issues with using the NFS server on RHEL as storage backend for
core services. This includes the OpenShift Container Registry and Quay,
Prometheus for monitoring storage, and Elasticsearch for logging storage.
Therefore, using RHEL NFS to back PVs used by core services is not recommended.

Other NFS implementations on the marketplace might not have these issues.
Contact the individual NFS implementation vendor for more information on any
testing that was possibly completed against these {product-title} core
components.
====

=== Registry

In a non-scaled/high-availability (HA) {product-title} registry cluster deployment:

* The storage technology does not have to support RWX access mode.
* The storage technology must ensure read-after-write consistency.
* The preferred storage technology is object storage followed by block storage.
* File storage is not recommended for {product-title} registry cluster deployment
with production workloads.

=== Scaled registry

In a scaled/HA {product-title} registry cluster deployment:

* The storage technology must support RWX access mode and must ensure
read-after-write consistency.
* The preferred storage technology is object storage.
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Microsoft
Azure Blob Storage, and OpenStack Swift are supported.
* Storage should be S3 or Swift compliant.
* File storage is not recommended for a scaled/HA {product-title} registry cluster
deployment with production workloads.
* For non-cloud platforms, such as vSphere and bare metal installations, the only
configurable technology is file storage.
* Block storage is not configurable.

=== Metrics

In an {product-title} hosted metrics cluster deployment:

* The preferred storage technology is block storage.
* Object storage is not configurable.


[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not recommended to use file storage for a hosted metrics cluster
deployment with production workloads.
====

=== Logging

In an {product-title} hosted logging cluster deployment:

* The preferred storage technology is block storage.
* File storage is not recommended for a scaled/HA {product-title} registry cluster
deployment with production workloads.
* Object storage is not configurable.

[IMPORTANT]

=== Applications

Application use cases vary from application to application, as described in the following examples:

* Storage technologies that support dynamic PV provisioning have low mount time latencies, and are not tied
to nodes to support a healthy cluster.
* Application developers are responsible for knowing and understanding the storage
requirements for their application, and how it works with the provided storage
to ensure that issues do not occur when an application scales or interacts
with the storage layer.

== Other specific application storage recommendations

* {product-title} Internal `etcd`: For the best `etcd` reliability, the lowest consistent latency storage technology is preferable.
* It is highly recommended that you use `etcd` with storage that handles serial
writes (fsync) quickly, such as NVMe or SSD. Ceph, NFS, and spinning disks are
not recommended.
* {rh-openstack-first} Cinder: {rh-openstack} Cinder tends to be adept in ROX access mode use cases.
* Databases: Databases (RDBMSs, NoSQL DBs, etc.) tend to perform best with dedicated block storage.
