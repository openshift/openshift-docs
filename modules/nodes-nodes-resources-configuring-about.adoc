= Understanding how to allocate resources for nodes

CPU and memory resources reserved for node components in {product-title} are based on two node settings:

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

|Setting |Description

|`kube-reserved`
| Resources reserved for node components. Default is none.

|`system-reserved`
| Resources reserved for the remaining system components. Default settings depend on the {product-title} and Machine Config Operator versions. Confirm the default `systemReserved` parameter on the `machine-config-operator` repository.
|===

If a flag is not set, the defaults are used. If none of the flags are set, the
allocated resource is set to the node's capacity as it was before the
introduction of allocatable resources.

[id="computing-allocated-resources_{context}"]
== How {product-title} computes allocated resources

An allocated amount of a resource is computed based on the following formula:

----
[Allocatable] = [Node Capacity] - [kube-reserved] - [system-reserved] - [Hard-Eviction-Thresholds]
----

[NOTE]
====
The withholding of `Hard-Eviction-Thresholds` from allocatable is a change in behavior to improve
system reliability now that allocatable is enforced for end-user pods at the node level.
The `experimental-allocatable-ignore-eviction` setting is available to preserve legacy behavior,
but it will be deprecated in a future release.
====

If `[Allocatable]` is negative, it is set to *0*.

Each node reports system resources utilized by the container runtime and kubelet.
To better aid your ability to configure `--system-reserved` and `--kube-reserved`,
you can introspect corresponding node's resource usage using the node summary API,
which is accessible at `/api/v1/nodes/<node>/proxy/stats/summary`.

[id="allocate-node-enforcement_{context}"]
== How nodes enforce resource constraints

The node is able to limit the total amount of resources that pods
may consume based on the configured allocatable value.  This feature significantly
improves the reliability of the node by preventing pods from starving
system services (for example: container runtime, node agent, etc.) for resources.
It is strongly encouraged that administrators reserve
resources based on the desired node utilization target
in order to improve node reliability.

The node enforces resource constraints using a new *cgroup* hierarchy
that enforces quality of service.  All pods are launched in a
dedicated cgroup hierarchy separate from system daemons.

Optionally, the node can be made to enforce kube-reserved and system-reserved by
specifying those tokens in the enforce-node-allocatable flag.  If specified, the
corresponding `--kube-reserved-cgroup` or `--system-reserved-cgroup` needs to be provided.
In future releases, the node and container runtime will be packaged in a common cgroup
separate from `system.slice`.  Until that time, we do not recommend users
change the default value of enforce-node-allocatable flag.

Administrators should treat system daemons similar to Guaranteed pods.  System daemons
can burst within their bounding control groups and this behavior needs to be managed
as part of cluster deployments.  Enforcing system-reserved limits
can lead to critical system services being CPU starved or OOM killed on the node. The
recommendation is to enforce system-reserved only if operators have profiled their nodes
exhaustively to determine precise estimates and are confident in their ability to
recover if any process in that group is OOM killed.

As a result, we strongly recommended that users only enforce node allocatable for
`pods` by default, and set aside appropriate reservations for system daemons to maintain
overall node reliability.

[id="allocate-eviction-thresholds_{context}"]
== Understanding Eviction Thresholds

If a node is under memory pressure, it can impact the entire node and all pods running on
it.  If a system daemon is using more than its reserved amount of memory, an OOM
event may occur that can impact the entire node and all pods running on it.  To avoid
(or reduce the probability of) system OOMs the node provides out-of-resource handling.

You can reserve some memory using the `--eviction-hard` flag. The node attempts to evict
pods whenever memory availability on the node drops below the absolute value or percentage.
If system daemons do not exist on a node, pods are limited to the memory
`capacity - eviction-hard`. For this reason, resources set aside as a buffer for eviction
before reaching out of memory conditions are not available for pods.

The following is an example to illustrate the impact of node allocatable for memory:

* Node capacity is `32Gi`
* --kube-reserved is `2Gi`
* --system-reserved is `1Gi`
* --eviction-hard is set to `100Mi`.

For this node, the effective node allocatable value is `28.9Gi`. If the node
and system components use up all their reservation, the memory available for pods is `28.9Gi`,
and kubelet will evict pods when it exceeds this usage.

If you enforce node allocatable (`28.9Gi`) via top level cgroups, then pods can never exceed `28.9Gi`.
Evictions would not be performed unless system daemons are consuming more than `3.1Gi` of memory.

If system daemons do not use up all their reservation, with the above example,
pods would face memcg OOM kills from their bounding cgroup before node evictions kick in.
To better enforce QoS under this situation, the node applies the hard eviction thresholds to
the top-level cgroup for all pods to be `Node Allocatable + Eviction Hard Thresholds`.

If system daemons do not use up all their reservation, the node will evict pods whenever
they consume more than `28.9Gi` of memory. If eviction does not occur in time, a pod
will be OOM killed if pods consume `29Gi` of memory.

[id="allocate-scheduler-policy_{context}"]
== How the scheduler determines resource availability

The scheduler uses the value of `*node.Status.Allocatable*` instead of
`*node.Status.Capacity*` to decide if a node will become a candidate for pod
scheduling.

By default, the node will report its machine capacity as fully schedulable by
the cluster.
