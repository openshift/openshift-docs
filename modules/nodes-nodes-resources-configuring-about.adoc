= Understanding how to allocate resources for nodes

CPU and memory resources reserved for node components in {product-title} are based on two node settings:

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Setting |Description

|`kube-reserved`
| This setting is not used with {product-title}. Add the CPU and memory resources that you planned to reserve to the `system-reserved` setting.

|`system-reserved`
| This setting identifies the resources to reserve for the node components and system components, such as CRI-O and Kubelet. The default settings depend on the {product-title} and Machine Config Operator versions. Confirm the default `systemReserved` parameter on the `machine-config-operator` repository.
|===

If a flag is not set, the defaults are used. If none of the flags are set, the
allocated resource is set to the node's capacity as it was before the
introduction of allocatable resources.

[NOTE]
====
Any CPUs specifically reserved using the `reservedSystemCPUs` parameter are not available for allocation using `kube-reserved` or `system-reserved`.

[id="computing-allocated-resources_{context}"]
== How {product-title} computes allocated resources

An allocated amount of a resource is computed based on the following formula:

----
[Allocatable] = [Node Capacity] - [system-reserved] - [Hard-Eviction-Thresholds]
----

[NOTE]
====
The withholding of `Hard-Eviction-Thresholds` from `Allocatable` improves system reliability because the value for `Allocatable` is enforced for pods at the node level.
====

If `Allocatable` is negative, it is set to `0`.

Each node reports the system resources that are used by the container runtime and kubelet. To simplify configuring the `system-reserved` parameter, view the resource use for the node by using the node summary API. The node summary is available at `/api/v1/nodes/<node>/proxy/stats/summary`.

[id="allocate-node-enforcement_{context}"]
== How nodes enforce resource constraints

The node is able to limit the total amount of resources that pods can consume based on the configured allocatable value. This feature significantly improves the reliability of the node by preventing pods from using CPU and memory resources that are needed by system services such as the container runtime and node agent. To improve node reliability, administrators should reserve resources based on a target for resource use.

The node enforces resource constraints by using a new cgroup hierarchy that enforces quality of service. All pods are launched in a dedicated cgroup hierarchy that is separate from system daemons.

Administrators should treat system daemons similar to pods that have a guaranteed quality of service. System daemons can burst within their bounding control groups and this behavior must be managed as part of cluster deployments. Reserve CPU and memory resources for system daemons by specifying the amount of CPU and memory resources in `system-reserved`.

Enforcing `system-reserved` limits can prevent critical system services from receiving CPU and memory resources. As a result, a critical system service can be ended by the out-of-memory killer. The recommendation is to enforce `system-reserved` only if you have profiled the nodes exhaustively to determine precise estimates and you are confident that critical system services can recover if any process in that group is ended by the out-of-memory killer.

[id="allocate-eviction-thresholds_{context}"]
== Understanding Eviction Thresholds

If a node is under memory pressure, it can impact the entire node and all pods running on the node. For example, a system daemon that uses more than its reserved amount of memory can trigger an out-of-memory event. To avoid or reduce the probability of system out-of-memory events, the node provides out-of-resource handling.

You can reserve some memory using the `--eviction-hard` flag. The node attempts to evict
pods whenever memory availability on the node drops below the absolute value or percentage.
If system daemons do not exist on a node, pods are limited to the memory
`capacity - eviction-hard`. For this reason, resources set aside as a buffer for eviction
before reaching out of memory conditions are not available for pods.

The following is an example to illustrate the impact of node allocatable for memory:

* Node capacity is `32Gi`
* --system-reserved is `3Gi`
* --eviction-hard is set to `100Mi`.

For this node, the effective node allocatable value is `28.9Gi`. If the node and system components use all their reservation, the memory available for pods is `28.9Gi`, and kubelet evicts pods when it exceeds this threshold.

If you enforce node allocatable, `28.9Gi`, with top-level cgroups, then pods can never exceed `28.9Gi`. Evictions are not performed unless system daemons consume more than `3.1Gi` of memory.

If system daemons do not use up all their reservation, with the above example,
pods would face memcg OOM kills from their bounding cgroup before node evictions kick in.
To better enforce QoS under this situation, the node applies the hard eviction thresholds to
the top-level cgroup for all pods to be `Node Allocatable + Eviction Hard Thresholds`.

If system daemons do not use up all their reservation, the node will evict pods whenever
they consume more than `28.9Gi` of memory. If eviction does not occur in time, a pod
will be OOM killed if pods consume `29Gi` of memory.

[id="allocate-scheduler-policy_{context}"]
== How the scheduler determines resource availability

The scheduler uses the value of `node.Status.Allocatable` instead of
`node.Status.Capacity` to decide if a node will become a candidate for pod
scheduling.

By default, the node will report its machine capacity as fully schedulable by
the cluster.
