= About the L2Advertisement custom resource

[role="_abstract"]
To configure how application services are announced over a Layer 2 network, define the properties in the `L2Advertisement` custom resource (CR). Establishing these parameters ensures that MetalLB correctly manages routing for your load-balancer IP addresses within the local network infrastructure

The following table details parameters for the `l2Advertisements` CR:

.L2 advertisements configuration

|Parameter
|Type
|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|Specifies the name for the L2 advertisement.

|`metadata.namespace`
|`string`
|Specifies the namespace for the L2 advertisement. Specify the same namespace that the MetalLB Operator uses.

|`spec.ipAddressPools`
|`string`
|Optional: The list of `IPAddressPools` to advertise with this advertisement, selected by name.

|`spec.ipAddressPoolSelectors`
|`string`
|Optional: A selector for the `IPAddressPools` to advertise with this advertisement. This is for associating the `IPAddressPool` to the advertisement based on the label assigned to the `IPAddressPool` instead of the name itself. If no `IPAddressPool` is selected by this or by the list, the advertisement is applied to all the `IPAddressPools`.

|`spec.nodeSelectors`
|`string`
|Optional: `NodeSelectors` limits the nodes to announce as next hops for the load balancer IP. If empty, MetalLB announces all nodes as next hops.
