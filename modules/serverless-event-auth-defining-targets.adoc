= Defining targets in an EventPolicy

The `.spec.to` section determines the consumers to which an EventPolicy applies. If the field is omitted, the EventPolicy applies to all resources within the namespace. You can specify multiple targets in this section to broaden the scope of the policy. There are two main ways to define targets.

[id="serverless-event-auth-specific-resource-reference_{context}"]
== Specific resource reference

The `to.ref` method directly references a specific resource by name. For example, referencing a Broker named `my-broker` applies the EventPolicy only to that specific Broker. This method is most appropriate when you want to protect or restrict access to a well-defined, individual resource.

to:
  - ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Broker
      name: my-broker

[id="serverless-event-auth-label-based-resource-selection_{context}"]
== Label-based resource selection

The `to.selector` method uses label selectors to match multiple resources of a specific type. For example, specifying a label selector with `app: special-app` applies the EventPolicy to all Brokers that share that label. This method is suitable when you want the same authorization rules applied across a group of similar resources.
