= Advanced filtering in the flow table

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability flow table supports complex filtering scenarios to help you isolate specific traffic patterns and reduce data noise.

While filters are managed through the user interface as individual criteria, they allow for sophisticated analysis, such as:

* *Excluding specific IP ranges*: You can suppress internal health check traffic or known-safe subnets to focus on anomalous connections.
* *Isolating nested workloads*: You can filter by specific resource tiers to see how traffic flows between interconnected applications.
* *Infrastructure-based filtering*: You can filter by SDN-specific metadata, such as availability zones or logical switches, to verify cross-zone traffic efficiency.

Combined with *Quick filters* for common tasks like viewing external ingress or dropped packets, these filtering capabilities allow for deep forensic auditing of the cluster network.
