= Hub cluster disaster recovery

Hub clusters disaster recovery is supported through {rh-rhacm} backup and restore functionality.
This feature allows CRs containing critical configuration and managed cluster data to be backed up to an off-cluster S3 storage bucket.
This data can be used to restore hub cluster management when restored onto a standby cluster or a rebuild of the current hub cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Loss of the hub cluster does not usually create a service outage on the managed clusters.

The loss of the hub cluster affects functions such as observability, configuration, lifecycle management updates, and so on.
====

Limits and requirements::

* Backup/restore and disaster recovery are provided by the cluster backup and restore Operator which depends on OpenShift APIs for Data Protection (OADP).

Engineering considerations::

* You can configure the cluster backup and restore Operator to use third-party resources.
* The cluster backup and restore Operator is not enabled by default in {rh-rhacm}.
* The hub cluster reference configuration enables the cluster backup and restore Operator by default.
