= Hub cluster disaster recovery

Note that loss of the hub cluster does not typically create a service outage on the managed clusters.
Functions provided by the hub cluster will be lost, such as observability, configuration, lifecycle management updates being driven through the hub cluster, and so on.

Limits and requirements::

* Backup,restore and disaster recovery are offered by the cluster backup and restore Operator, which depends on the {oadp-first} Operator.

Engineering considerations::

* You can extend the cluster backup and restore operator to third party resources of the hub cluster based on your configuration.
* The cluster backup and restore operator is not enabled by default in {rh-rhacm-first}.
The reference configuration enables this feature.
