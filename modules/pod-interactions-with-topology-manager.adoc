= Pod interactions with Topology Manager policies

The example Pod specs below help illustrate Pod interactions with Topology Manager.

The following Pod runs in the `BestEffort` QoS class because no resource requests or
limits are specified.

----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
----

The next Pod runs in the `Burstable` QoS class because requests are less than limits.

----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
      requests:
        memory: "100Mi"
----

If the selected policy is anything other than `none`, Topology Manager would
not consider either of these Pod specifications.

The last example Pod below runs in the Guaranteed QoS class because requests are equal to limits.

----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
        example.com/device: "1"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
        example.com/device: "1"
----

Topology Manager would consider this Pod. The Topology Manager consults the
CPU Manager static policy, which returns the topology of available CPUs. Topology
Manager also consults Device Manager to discover the topology of available devices
for example.com/device.

Topology Manager will use this information to store the best Topology for this
container. In the case of this Pod, CPU Manager and Device Manager will use this stored
information at the resource allocation stage.
