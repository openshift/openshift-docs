= Generating the image in the Red{nbsp}Hat {ai-full}

Create a cluster and generate the {product-title} Discovery ISO image in the {ai-full} on the Red{nbsp}Hat portal. You can perform this step on your local machine, rather than on the bastion server or within environments such as Oracle Solution Center.

.Prerequisites

* You have run the `createInfraResources.tf` Terraform script to create the Dynamic Group Identity resources on your {oci-first-no-rt} Home region.

.Procedure

. Log in to link:https://console.redhat.com/[{ai-full} web console] with your credentials.

. In the *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift* tile, select *OpenShift*. 

. In the *Red{nbsp}Hat {product-title}* tile, select *Create Cluster*.

. On the *Cluster Type* page, scroll to the end of the *Cloud* tab, and select *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (virtual machines)*. 

. On the *Create an OpenShift Cluster* page, select the *Interactive* tile.

. On the *Cluster Details* page, complete the following fields:
+
[cols="1,3",options="header",subs="quotes"]
|===
|Field |Action required

|*Cluster name*
|Specify the name of your {product-title} cluster. This name is the same name you used to create the resource via the Terraform scripts. The name must be between 1-54 characters. It can use lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-), but must start and end with a lowercase letter or a number.

|*Base domain*
|Specify the base domain of the cluster. This is the value used for the `zone_dns` variables in the Terraform scripts that run on {oci-c3-short}. Make a note of the value for later use.

|*OpenShift version*
| Select *OpenShift 4.16.20*. If it is not immediately visible, scroll to the end of the dropdown menu, select *Show all available versions*, and type the version in the search box.

|*Integrate with external partner platforms*
|Select *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure*.

After you specify this value, the *Include custom manifests* checkbox is selected by default and the *Custom manifests* page is added to the wizard.
|===

. Leave the default settings for the remaining fields, and click *Next*.

. On the *Operators* page, click *Next*.

. On the *Host Discovery* page, click *Add hosts* and complete the following steps:
+
[NOTE]
====
The minimal ISO image is the mandatory *Provisioning type* for the {oci-first-no-rt}, and cannot be changed.
====

.. Create the SSH public key by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.put
----

.. Copy the output from the previous step into the *SSH public key* field. The SSH public key will be installed on all {product-title} control plane and compute nodes.

.. Click the *Show proxy settings* checkbox.

.. Add the proxy variables from the `/etc/environment` file of the bastion server that you configured earlier:
+
.Proxy variables

[source,terminal]
----
http_proxy=http://www-proxy.<your_domain>.com:80 
https_proxy=http://www-proxy.<your_domain>.com:80 
no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,.<your_domain>.com 
#(ie.oracle.com,.oraclecorp.com) 
---- 

.. Click *Generate Discovery ISO* to generate the Discovery ISO image file.

. Click *Download Discovery ISO* to save the file to your local system. After you download the Discovery ISO file, you can rename it as required, for example `discovery_image_<your_cluster_name>.iso`.
