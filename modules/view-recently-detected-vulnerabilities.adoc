= Viewing recently detected vulnerabilities by using the dashboard

The *Recently Detected Vulnerabilities* widget on the *Vulnerability Management* -> *Dashboard* view shows a list of recently discovered vulnerabilities in your scanned images, based on the scan time and CVSS score.
It also includes information about the number of images affected by the CVE and its impact (percentage) on your environment.

* When you hover over a CVE in the list, you see an overview of the CVE, which includes scan time, CVSS score, description, impact, and whether it's scored by using CVSS v2 or v3.
* When you select a CVE, the *CVE* details view opens for the selected CVE.
The *CVE* details view shows in-depth details of the CVE and the components, images, and deployments and deployments in which it appears.
* Select *View All* on the *Recently Detected Vulnerabilities* widget header to view a list of all the CVEs in your infrastructure.
You can also filter the list of CVEs.
