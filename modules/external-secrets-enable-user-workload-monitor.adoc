= Enabling user workload monitoring

[role="_abstract"]
To enable metrics collection for user-defined projects, configure user workload monitoring in the {product-title} cluster. With this configuration, you can maintain visibility into the performance and status of your specific project workloads.

For more information, see "Setting up metrics collection for user-defined projects".

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Create the `cluster-monitoring-config.yaml` YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true
----

. Apply the `ConfigMap` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cluster-monitoring-config.yaml
----

.Verification

* Verify that the monitoring components for user workloads are running in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get pod
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prometheus-operator-5f79cff9c9-67pjb   2/2     Running   0          25h

thanos-ruler-user-workload-0           4/4     Running   0          25h
----
+
The status of the pods such as `prometheus-operator`, `prometheus-user-workload`, and `thanos-ruler-user-workload` must be `Running`.
