Deprecation of Fujitsu Integrated Remote Management Controller (iRMC) driver for bare-metal machines::
+
As of {product-title} 4.21, support for the Fujitsu iRMC baseboard management controller (BMC) driver has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
If a `BareMetalHost` resource contains a BMC address with `irmc://` as its URI scheme, the resource must be updated to use another BMC scheme, such as `redfish://` or `ipmi://`.
Once support for this driver is removed, hosts that use `irmc://` URI schemes will become unmanageable.
+
For information about updating the `BareMetalHost` resource, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/bare-metal-postinstallation-configuration.adoc#bmo-editing-a-baremetalhost-resource_bare-metal-postinstallation-configuration[Editing a BareMetalHost resource].
