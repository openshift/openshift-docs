= Troubleshooting latency when deleting a BareMetalHost resource

When the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) deletes a `BareMetalHost` resource, Ironic deprovisions the bare-metal host. For example, this might happen when scaling down a machine set. Deprovisioning involves a process known as "cleaning", which performs the following steps:

* Powering off the bare-metal host
* Booting a service RAM disk on the bare-metal host
* Removing partitioning metadata from all disks
* Powering off the bare-metal host again

If cleaning does not succeed, the deletion of the `BareMetalHost` resource will take a long time and might not finish.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not remove the finalizers to force deletion of a `BareMetalHost` resource. The provisioning back-end has its own database, which maintains a host record. Running actions will continue to run even if you try to force the deletion by removing the finalizers. You might face unexpected issues when attempting to add the bare-metal host later.
====

.Procedure

. If the cleaning process can recover, wait for it to finish.

. If cleaning cannot recover, disable the cleaning process by modifying the `BareMetalHost` resource and setting the `automatedCleaningMode` field to `disabled`.

See "Editing a BareMetalHost resource" for additional details.
