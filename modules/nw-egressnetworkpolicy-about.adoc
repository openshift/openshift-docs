= How an egress firewall works in a project

As a cluster administrator, you can use an _egress firewall_ to
limit the external hosts that some or all pods can access from within the
cluster. An egress firewall supports the following scenarios:

- A pod can only connect to internal hosts and cannot initiate connections to
the public Internet.
- A pod can only connect to the public Internet and cannot initiate connections
to internal hosts that are outside the {product-title} cluster.
- A pod cannot reach specified internal subnets or hosts outside the {product-title} cluster.
- A pod can connect to only specific external hosts.

For example, you can allow one project access to a specified IP range but deny the same access to a different project. Or you can restrict application developers from updating from Python pip mirrors, and force updates to come only from approved sources.

You configure an egress firewall policy by creating an {kind} custom resource (CR) object. The egress firewall matches network traffic that meets any of the following criteria:

- An IP address range in CIDR format
ifdef::openshift-sdn[]
- A DNS name that resolves to an IP address
endif::openshift-sdn[]
ifdef::ovn[]
- A port number
- A protocol that is one of the following protocols: TCP, UDP, and SCTP
endif::ovn[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must have OpenShift SDN configured to use either the network policy or multitenant mode to configure an egress firewall.

If you use network policy mode, an egress firewall is compatible with only one policy per namespace and will not work with projects that share a network, such as global projects.

[WARNING]
====
Egress firewall rules do not apply to traffic that goes through routers. Any user with permission to create a Route CR object can bypass egress firewall policy rules by creating a route that points to a forbidden destination.

[id="limitations-of-an-egress-firewall_{context}"]
== Limitations of an egress firewall

An egress firewall has the following limitations:

* No project can have more than one {kind} object.

ifdef::openshift-sdn[]
* A maximum of one {kind} object with a maximum of 1,000 rules can be defined per project.

* The `default` project cannot use an egress firewall.

* When using the OpenShift SDN default Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider in multitenant mode, the following limitations apply:

  - Global projects cannot use an egress firewall. You can make a project global by using the `oc adm pod-network make-projects-global` command.

  - Projects merged by using the `oc adm pod-network join-projects` command cannot use an egress firewall in any of the joined projects.
endif::openshift-sdn[]

Violating any of these restrictions results in a broken egress firewall for the project, and may cause all external network traffic to be dropped.

[id="policy-rule-order_{context}"]
== Matching order for egress firewall policy rules

The egress firewall policy rules are evaluated in the order that they are defined, from first to last. The first rule that matches an egress connection from a pod applies. Any subsequent rules are ignored for that connection.

ifdef::openshift-sdn[]
[id="domain-name-server-resolution_{context}"]
== How Domain Name Server (DNS) resolution works

If you use DNS names in any of your egress firewall policy rules, proper resolution of the domain names is subject to the following restrictions:

* Domain name updates are polled based on the TTL (time to live) value of the domain returned by the local non-authoritative servers.

* The pod must resolve the domain from the same local name servers when necessary. Otherwise the IP addresses for the domain known by the egress firewall controller and the pod can be different. If the IP addresses for a host name differ, the egress firewall might not be enforced consistently.

* Because the egress firewall controller and pods asynchronously poll the same local name server, the pod might obtain the updated IP address before the egress controller does, which causes a race condition. Due to this current limitation, domain name usage in {kind} objects is only recommended for domains with infrequent IP address changes.

[NOTE]
====
The egress firewall always allows pods access to the external interface of the node that the pod is on for DNS resolution.

If you use domain names in your egress firewall policy and your DNS resolution is not handled by a DNS server on the local node, then you must add egress firewall rules that allow access to your DNS serverâ€™s IP addresses. if you are using domain names in your pods.
