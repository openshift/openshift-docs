[id="migration-compatibility-guidelines_{context}"]
= Compatibility guidelines

You must install the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) version that is compatible with your {product-title} version.

You cannot install {mtc-short} 1.6.x on {product-title} versions 3.7 to 4.5 because the custom resource definition API versions are incompatible.

You can migrate workloads from a source cluster with {mtc-short} 1.5.1 to a target cluster with {mtc-short} 1.6.x as long as the `MigrationController` custom resource and the {mtc-short} web console are running on the target cluster.
