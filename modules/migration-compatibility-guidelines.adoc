= Compatibility guidelines

You must install the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) version that is compatible with your {product-title} version.

|4.6 or later |1.6.x

1. Install the latest z-stream version.

You can migrate workloads from a source cluster with {mtc-short} 1.5.x installed to a target cluster with {mtc-short} 1.6.x installed as long as the `MigrationController` custom resource and the {mtc-short} web console are running on the target cluster.

You cannot install {mtc-short} 1.6.x on a cluster with {product-title} 3.7 to 4.5 installed because the custom resource definition API versions are incompatible.
