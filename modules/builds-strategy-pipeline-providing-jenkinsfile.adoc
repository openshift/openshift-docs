= Providing the Jenkinsfile for pipeline builds

The `jenkinsfile` uses the standard groovy language syntax to allow fine grained control over the configuration, build, and deployment of your application.

You can supply the `jenkinsfile` in one of the following ways:

* A file located within your source code repository.
* Embedded as part of your build configuration using the `jenkinsfile` field.

When using the first option, the `jenkinsfile` must be included in your applications source code repository at one of the following locations:

* A file named `jenkinsfile` at the root of your repository.
* A file named `jenkinsfile` at the root of the source `contextDir` of your repository.
* A file name specified via the `jenkinsfilePath` field of the `JenkinsPipelineStrategy` section of your BuildConfig, which is relative to the source `contextDir` if supplied, otherwise it defaults to the root of the repository.

The `jenkinsfile` is executed on the Jenkins slave pod, which must have the
{product-title} Client binaries available if you intend to use the {product-title} DSL.

.Procedure

To provide the Jenkinsfile, you can either:

. Embed the Jenkinsfile in the build configuration.
. Include in the build configuration a reference to the Git repository that contains the Jenkinsfile.

<1> The optional `jenkinsfilePath` field specifies the name of the file to use, relative to the source `contextDir`. If `contextDir` is omitted, it defaults to the root of the repository. If `jenkinsfilePath` is omitted, it defaults to `Jenkinsfile`.
