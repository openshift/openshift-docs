= Creating a hosted cluster on OpenStack

You can create a hosted cluster on {rh-openstack-first} by using the `hcp` CLI.

.Prerequisites

* You completed all prerequisite steps in "Preparing to deploy hosted control planes".
* You reviewed "Prerequisites for OpenStack".
* You completed all steps in "Preparing the management cluster for etcd local storage".
* You have access to the management cluster.
* You have access to the {rh-openstack} cloud.

.Procedure

* Create a hosted cluster by running the `hcp create` command. For example, for a cluster that takes advantage of the performant etcd configuration detailed in "Preparing the management cluster for etcd local storage", enter:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ hcp create cluster openstack \
  --name my-hcp-cluster \
  --openstack-node-flavor m1.xlarge \
  --base-domain example.com \
  --pull-secret /path/to/pull-secret.json \
  --release-image quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.19.0-x86_64 \
  --node-pool-replicas 3 \
  --etcd-storage-class lvms-etcd-class
----

NOTE: Many options are available at cluster creation. For {rh-openstack}-specific options, see "Options for creating a Hosted Control Planes cluster on OpenStack". For general options, see the `hcp` documentation.

.Verification
. Verify that the hosted cluster is ready by running the following command on it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n clusters-<cluster_name> get pods
----
+
--
where:

`<cluster_name>`:: Specifies the name of the cluster.
--
+
After several minutes, the output should show that the hosted control plane pods are running.

. To validate the etcd configuration of the cluster:

.. Validate the etcd persistent volume claim (PVC) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pvc -A
----

.. Inside the {hcp} etcd pod, confirm the mount path and device by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ df -h /var/lib
----

[NOTE]
====
The {rh-openstack} resources that the cluster API (CAPI) provider creates are tagged with the label `openshiftClusterID=<infraID>`. 

You can define additional tags for the resources as values in the `HostedCluster.Spec.Platform.OpenStack.Tags` field of a YAML manifest that you use to create the hosted cluster. The tags are applied when you scale up the node pool.
