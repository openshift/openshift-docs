= About bound service account tokens

You can use bound service account tokens to limit the scope of permissions for a given service account token. These tokens are audience and time-bound. This facilitates the authentication of a service account to an IAM role and the generation of temporary credentials mounted to a pod. You can request bound service account tokens by using volume projection and the TokenRequest API.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the cluster installation process does not use them, bound service account tokens are configured post-installation.
