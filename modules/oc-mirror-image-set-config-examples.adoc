= Image set configuration examples

The following `ImageSetConfiguration` file examples show the configuration for various mirroring use cases.

[id="oc-mirror-image-set-examples-helm_{context}"]
== Use case: Including arbitrary images and helm charts

The following `ImageSetConfiguration` file uses a registry storage backend and includes helm charts and an additional Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI).

[id="oc-mirror-image-set-examples-operator-versions_{context}"]
== Use case: Including Operator versions from a minimum to the latest

The following `ImageSetConfiguration` file uses a local storage backend and includes only the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes Operator, versions starting at 3.68.0 and later in the `latest` channel.

[id="oc-mirror-image-set-examples-shortest-upgrade-path_{context}"]
== Use case: Including the shortest {product-title} upgrade path

The following `ImageSetConfiguration` file uses a local storage backend and includes all {product-title} versions along the shortest upgrade path from the minimum version of `4.9.37` to the maximum version of `4.10.22`.

[id="oc-mirror-image-set-examples-minimum-to-latest_{context}"]
== Use case: Including all versions of {product-title} from a minimum to the latest

The following `ImageSetConfiguration` file uses a registry storage backend and includes all {product-title} versions starting at a minimum version of `4.10.10` to the latest version in the channel.

On every invocation of oc-mirror with this image set configuration, the latest release of the `stable-4.10` channel is evaluated, so running oc-mirror at regular intervals ensures that you automatically receive the latest releases of {product-title} images.

[id="oc-mirror-image-set-examples-operator-min-max_{context}"]
== Use case: Including Operator versions from a minimum to a maximum

The following `ImageSetConfiguration` file uses a local storage backend and includes only an example Operator, versions starting at `1.0.0` through `2.0.0` in the `stable` channel.

This allows you to only mirror a specific version range of a particular Operator. As time progresses, you can use these settings to adjust the version to newer releases, for example when you no longer have version `1.0.0` running anywhere anymore. In this scenario, you can increase the `minVersion` to something newer, for example `1.5.0`. When oc-mirror runs again with the updated version range, it automatically detects that any releases older than `1.5.0` are no longer required and deletes those from the registry to conserve storage space.
