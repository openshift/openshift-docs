== {ProductShortName} fixed issues

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-797[OSSM-797] Kiali Operator pod generates `CreateContainerConfigError` while installing or updating the operator.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-722[OSSM-722]
Namespace starting with `kube` is hidden from Kiali.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-569[OSSM-569] There is no CPU memory limit for the Prometheus `istio-proxy` container. The Prometheus `istio-proxy` sidecar now uses the resource limits defined in `spec.proxy.runtime.container`.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-449[OSSM-449] VirtualService and Service causes an error "Only unique values for domains are permitted. Duplicate entry of domain."

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-419[OSSM-419] Namespaces with similar names will all show in Kiali namespace list, even though namespaces may not be defined in Service Mesh Member Role.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-296[OSSM-296] When adding health configuration to the Kiali custom resource (CR) is it not being replicated to the Kiali configmap.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-291[OSSM-291] In the Kiali console, on the Applications, Services, and Workloads pages, the "Remove Label from Filters" function is not working.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-289[OSSM-289] In the Kiali console, on the Service Details pages for the 'istio-ingressgateway' and 'jaeger-query' services there are no Traces being displayed. The traces exist in Jaeger.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-287[OSSM-287] In the Kiali console there are no traces being displayed on the Graph Service.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-2687[MAISTRA-2687] {ProductName} 2.1 federation gateway does not send the full certificate chain when using external certificates. The {ProductShortName} federation egress gateway only sends the client certificate. Because the federation ingress gateway only knows about the root certificate, it cannot verify the client certificate unless you add the root certificate to the federation import `ConfigMap`.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2635[MAISTRA-2635] Replace deprecated Kubernetes API. To remain compatible with {product-title} 4.8, the `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1` API was deprecated as of {ProductName} 2.0.8.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2631[MAISTRA-2631] The WASM feature is not working because podman is failing due to nsenter binary not being present. {ProductName} generates the following error message: `Error: error configuring CNI network plugin exec: "nsenter": executable file not found in $PATH`. The container image now contains nsenter and WASM works as expected.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2534[MAISTRA-2534] When istiod attempted to fetch the JWKS for an issuer specified in a JWT rule, the issuer service responded with a 502.  This prevented the proxy container from becoming ready and caused deployments to hang. The fix for the link:https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/24629[community bug] has been included in the  {ProductShortName} 2.0.7 release.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2401[MAISTRA-2401] CVE-2021-3586 servicemesh-operator: NetworkPolicy resources incorrectly specified ports for ingress resources. The NetworkPolicy resources installed for {Productname} did not properly specify which ports could be accessed. This allowed access to all ports on these resources from any pod. Network policies applied to the following resources are affected:

** Galley
** Grafana
** Istiod
** Jaeger
** Kiali
** Prometheus
** Sidecar injector

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2378[MAISTRA-2378] When the cluster is configured to use OpenShiftSDN with `ovs-multitenant` and the mesh contains a large number of namespaces (200+), the {product-title} networking plugin is unable to configure the namespaces quickly. {ProductShortName} times out causing namespaces to be continuously dropped from the service mesh and then reenlisted.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2370[MAISTRA-2370] Handle tombstones in listerInformer. The updated cache codebase was not handling tombstones when translating the events from the namespace caches to the aggregated cache, leading to a panic in the go routine.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2117[MAISTRA-2117] Add optional `ConfigMap` mount to operator. The CSV now contains an optional `ConfigMap` volume mount, which mounts the `smcp-templates` `ConfigMap` if it exists. If the `smcp-templates` `ConfigMap` does not exist, the mounted directory is empty. When you create the `ConfigMap`, the directory is populated with the entries from the `ConfigMap` and can be referenced in `SMCP.spec.profiles`. No restart of the Service Mesh operator is required.
+
Customers using the 2.0 operator with a modified CSV to mount the smcp-templates ConfigMap can upgrade to {ProductName} 2.1. After upgrading, you can continue using an existing ConfigMap, and the profiles it contains, without editing the CSV. Customers that previously used ConfigMap with a different name will either have to rename the ConfigMap or update the CSV after upgrading.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2010[MAISTRA-2010] AuthorizationPolicy does not support `request.regex.headers` field. The `validatingwebhook` rejects any AuthorizationPolicy with the field, and even if you disable that, Pilot tries to validate it using the same code, and it does not work.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-1979[MAISTRA-1979] _Migration to 2.0_ The conversion webhook drops the following important fields when converting `SMCP.status` from v2 to v1:

** conditions
** components
** observedGeneration
** annotations
+
Upgrading the operator to 2.0 might break client tools that read the SMCP status using the maistra.io/v1 version of the resource.
+
This also causes the READY and STATUS columns to be empty when you run `oc get servicemeshcontrolplanes.v1.maistra.io`.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-1983[MAISTRA-1983] _Migration to 2.0_ Upgrading to 2.0.0 with an existing invalid `ServiceMeshControlPlane` cannot easily be repaired. The invalid items in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource caused an unrecoverable error. The fix makes the errors recoverable. You can delete the invalid resource and replace it with a new one or edit the resource to fix the errors. For more information about editing your resource, see [Configuring the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh installation].

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-1502[Maistra-1502] As a result of CVEs fixes in version 1.0.10, the Istio dashboards are not available from the *Home Dashboard* menu in Grafana. The Istio dashboards still exist. To access them, click the *Dashboard* menu in the navigation panel and select the *Manage* tab.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-1399[MAISTRA-1399] {ProductName} no longer prevents you from installing unsupported CNI protocols. The supported network configurations has not changed.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-1089[MAISTRA-1089] _Migration to 2.0_ Gateways created in a non-control plane namespace are automatically deleted. After removing the gateway definition from the SMCP spec, you need to manually delete these resources.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-858[MAISTRA-858] The following Envoy log messages describing link:https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/deprecated[deprecated options and configurations associated with Istio 1.1.x] are expected:
+
** [2019-06-03 07:03:28.943][19][warning][misc] [external/envoy/source/common/protobuf/utility.cc:129] Using deprecated option 'envoy.api.v2.listener.Filter.config'. This configuration will be removed from Envoy soon.
** [2019-08-12 22:12:59.001][13][warning][misc] [external/envoy/source/common/protobuf/utility.cc:174] Using deprecated option 'envoy.api.v2.Listener.use_original_dst' from file lds.proto. This configuration will be removed from Envoy soon.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-193[MAISTRA-193] Unexpected console info messages are visible when health checking is enabled for citadel.

* link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821432[Bug 1821432] Toggle controls in {product-title} Control Resource details page do not update the CR correctly. UI Toggle controls in the Service Mesh Control Plane (SMCP) Overview page in the {product-title} web console sometimes update the wrong field in the resource. To update a SMCP, edit the YAML content directly or update the resource from the command line instead of clicking the toggle controls.
