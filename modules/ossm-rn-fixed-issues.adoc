== {ProductName} fixed issues

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-684[MAISTRA-684] The default Jaeger version in the `istio-operator` is 1.12.0, which does not match Jaeger version 1.13.1 that shipped in {ProductName} 0.12.TechPreview.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-572[MAISTRA-572] Jaeger cannot be used with Kiali. In this release Jaeger is configured to use the OAuth proxy, but is also only configured to work through a browser and does not allow service access. Kiali cannot properly communicate with the Jaeger endpoint and it considers Jaeger to be disabled. See also link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/TRACING-591[TRACING-591].

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-357[MAISTRA-357] In OpenShift 4 Beta on AWS, it is not possible, by default, to access a TCP or HTTPS service through the ingress gateway on a port other than port 80. The AWS load balancer has a health check that verifies if port 80 on the service endpoint is active.
+
The load balancer health check only checks the first port defined in the Istio ingress gateway ports list. This port is configured as 80/HTTP:31380/TCP. Without a service running on this port, the load balancer health check fails.
+
To check HTTPS or TCP traffic by using an ingress gateway, you must have an existing HTTP service, for example, the Bookinfo sample application product page running on the ingress gateway port 80. Alternatively, using the AWS EC2 console, you can change the port that the load balancer uses to perform the health check, and replace 80 with the port your service actually uses.

== Kiali fixed issues

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3096[KIALI-3096] Runtime metrics fail in {ProductShortName}. There is an oauth filter between the {ProductShortname} and Prometheus, requiring a bearer token to be passed to Prometheus before access will be granted. Kiali has been updated to use this token when communicating to the Prometheus server, but the application metrics are currently failing with 403 errors.
+
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSSM-90[OSSM-90] Traces not available on the service details page.
+
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSSM-92[OSSM-92] Cancelling unsaved changes on the VS/DR YAML edit page does not cancel the changes.
+
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSSM-93[OSSM-93] IstioConfigList can't filter by two or more names.
+
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSSM-99[OSSM-99] Workloads generated from direct Pod without labels may crash Kiali.

[id="ossm-rn-fixed-issues-maistra_{context}"]
== Maistra fixed issues

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-932[MAISTRA-932] Added the `requires` metadata to add dependency relationship between Jaeger operator and Elasticsearch operator. Ensures that when the Jaeger operator is installed, it automatically deploys the Elasticsearch operator if it is not available.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-1001[MAISTRA-1001] Closing HTTP/2 connections could lead to segmentation faults in `istio-proxy`.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-833[MAISTRA-833] Pilot stopped delivering configuration after many namespace deletions and re-creations. 

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-862[MAISTRA-862] Galley dropped watches and stopped providing configuration to other components after many namespace deletions and re-creations.
