* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2401[MAISTRA-2401] CVE-2021-3586 servicemesh-operator: NetworkPolicy resources incorrectly specified ports for ingress resources. The NetworkPolicy resources installed for {Productname} did not properly specify which ports could be accessed. This allowed access to all ports on these resources from any pod. Network policies applied to the following resources are affected:

* Galley
* Grafana
* Istiod
* Jaeger
* Kiali
* Prometheus
* Sidecar injector

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2378[MAISTRA-2378] When the cluster is configured to use OpenShiftSDN with `ovs-multitenant` and the mesh contains a large number of namespaces (200+), the {product-title} networking plugin is unable to configure the namespaces quickly. {ProductShortName} times out causing namespaces to be continuously dropped from the service mesh and then reenlisted.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2370[MAISTRA-2370] Handle tombstones in listerInformer. The updated cache codebase was not handling tombstones when translating the events from the namespace caches to the aggregated cache, leading to a panic in the go routine.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-449[OSSM-449] VirtualService and Service causes an error "Only unique values for domains are permitted. Duplicate entry of domain."

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-419[OSSM-419] Namespaces with similar names will all show in Kiali namespace list, even though namespaces may not be defined in Service Mesh Member Role.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-296[OSSM-296] When adding health configuration to the Kiali custom resource (CR) is it not being replicated to the Kiali configmap.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-291[OSSM-291] In the Kiali console, on the Applications, Services, and Workloads pages, the "Remove Label from Filters" function is not working.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-289[OSSM-289] In the Kiali console, on the Service Details pages for the 'istio-ingressgateway' and 'jaeger-query' services there are no Traces being displayed. The traces exist in Jaeger.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-287[OSSM-287] In the Kiali console there are no traces being displayed on the Graph Service.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2010[MAISTRA-2010] AuthorizationPolicy does not support `request.regex.headers` field. The `validatingwebhook` rejects any AuthorizationPolicy with the field, and even if you disable that, Pilot tries to validate it using the same code, and it does not work.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-1979[MAISTRA-1979] _Migration to 2.0_ The conversion webhook drops the following important fields when converting `SMCP.status` from v2 to v1:

** conditions
** components
** observedGeneration
** annotations
+
Upgrading the operator to 2.0 might break client tools that read the SMCP status using the maistra.io/v1 version of the resource.
+
This also causes the READY and STATUS columns to be empty when you run `oc get servicemeshcontrolplanes.v1.maistra.io`.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-1089[MAISTRA-1089] _Migration to 2.0_ Gateways created in a non-control plane namespace are automatically deleted.  Users will need to manually delete these resources after removing the gateway definition from the SMCP spec.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-1983[MAISTRA-1983]  _Migration to 2.0_ Upgrading to 2.0.0 with an existing invalid `ServiceMeshControlPlane` cannot easily be repaired. The invalid items in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource caused an unrecoverable error. The fix makes the errors recoverable. You can delete the invalid resource and replace it with a new one or edit the resource to fix the errors. For more information about editing your resource, see [Configuring the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh installation].

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-1502[Maistra-1502] As a result of CVEs fixes in version 1.0.10, the Istio dashboards are not available from the *Home Dashboard* menu in Grafana. The Istio dashboards still exist. To access them, click the *Dashboard* menu in the navigation panel and select the *Manage* tab.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-858[MAISTRA-858] The following Envoy log messages describing link:https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/deprecated[deprecated options and configurations associated with Istio 1.1.x] are expected:
+
** [2019-06-03 07:03:28.943][19][warning][misc] [external/envoy/source/common/protobuf/utility.cc:129] Using deprecated option 'envoy.api.v2.listener.Filter.config'. This configuration will be removed from Envoy soon.
** [2019-08-12 22:12:59.001][13][warning][misc] [external/envoy/source/common/protobuf/utility.cc:174] Using deprecated option 'envoy.api.v2.Listener.use_original_dst' from file lds.proto. This configuration will be removed from Envoy soon.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-193[MAISTRA-193] Unexpected console info messages are visible when health checking is enabled for citadel.

* link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821432[Bug 1821432] Toggle controls in {product-title} Control Resource details page do not update the CR correctly. UI Toggle controls in the Service Mesh Control Plane (SMCP) Overview page in the {product-title} web console sometimes update the wrong field in the resource. To update a SMCP, edit the YAML content directly or update the resource from the command line instead of clicking the toggle controls.
