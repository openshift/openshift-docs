* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2010[MAISTRA-2010] AuthorizationPolicy does not support `request.regex.headers` field. The `validatingwebhook` rejects any AuthorizationPolicy with the field, and even if you disable that, Pilot tries to validate it using the same code, and it does not work.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-1979[MAISTRA-1979] _Migration to 2.0_ The conversion webhook drops the following important fields when converting `SMCP.status` from v2 to v1:

** conditions
** components
** observedGeneration
** annotations
+
Upgrading the operator to 2.0 might break client tools that read the SMCP status using the maistra.io/v1 version of the resource.
+
This also causes the READY and STATUS columns to be empty when you run `oc get servicemeshcontrolplanes.v1.maistra.io`.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-1983[MAISTRA-1983] Upgrading to 2.0.0 with an existing invalid `ServiceMeshControlPlane` cannot easily be repaired. The invalid items in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource caused an unrecoverable error. The fix makes the errors recoverable. You can delete the invalid resource and replace it with a new one or edit the resource to fix the errors. For more information about editing your resource, see [Configuring the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh installation].

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-1502[Maistra-1502] As a result of CVEs fixes in version 1.0.10, the Istio dashboards are not available from the *Home Dashboard* menu in Grafana. The Istio dashboards still exist. To access them, click the *Dashboard* menu in the navigation panel and select the *Manage* tab.

* link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821432[Bug 1821432] Toggle controls in {product-title} Control Resource details page do not update the CR correctly. UI Toggle controls in the Service Mesh Control Plane (SMCP) Overview page in the {product-title} web console sometimes update the wrong field in the resource. To update a SMCP, edit the YAML content directly or update the resource from the command line instead of clicking the toggle controls.
