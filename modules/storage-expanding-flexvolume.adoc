= Expanding FlexVolume with a supported driver

When using FlexVolume to connect to your back-end storage system, you can expand persistent storage volumes after they have already been created. This is done by manually updating the persistent volume claim (PVC) in {product-title}.

FlexVolume allows expansion if the driver is set with `RequiresFSResize` to `true`. The FlexVolume can be expanded on pod restart.

Similar to other volume types, FlexVolume volumes can also be expanded when in use by a pod.

.Prerequisites

* The underlying volume driver supports resize.
* The driver is set with the `RequiresFSResize` capability to `true`.
* Dynamic provisioning is used.
* The controlling `StorageClass` object has `allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true`.

.Procedure

* To use resizing in the FlexVolume plugin, you must implement the `ExpandableVolumePlugin` interface using these methods:

`RequiresFSResize`::
If `true`, updates the capacity directly. If `false`, calls the `ExpandFS` method to finish the filesystem resize.

`ExpandFS`::
If `true`, calls `ExpandFS` to resize filesystem after physical volume expansion is done. The volume driver can also perform physical volume resize together with filesystem resize.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because {product-title} does not support installation of FlexVolume plugins on master nodes, it does not support control-plane expansion of FlexVolume.
