= Expanding FlexVolume with a supported driver

When using FlexVolume to connect to your backend storage system, you can expand persistent storage volumes after they have already been created. This is done by manually updating the persistent volume claim (PVC) in {product-title}.

FlexVolume allows expansion if the driver is set with `RequiresFSResize` to `true`. The FlexVolume can be expanded on Pod restart.

Similar to other volume types, FlexVolume volumes can also be expanded when in use by a pod.

.Prerequisites

* The underlying volume driver supports resize.
* The driver is set with the `RequiresFSResize` capability to `true`.
* Dynamic provisioning is used.
* The controlling StorageClass has `allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true`.

.Procedure

* To use resizing in the FlexVolume plugin, you must implement the `ExpandableVolumePlugin` interface using these methods:

`RequiresFSResize`::
If `true`, updates the capacity directly. If `false`, calls the `ExpandFS` method to finish the filesystem resize.

`ExpandFS`::
If `true`, calls `ExpandFS` to resize filesystem after physical volume expansion is done. The volume driver can also perform physical volume resize together with filesystem resize.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because {product-title} does not support installation of FlexVolume plugins on master nodes, it does not support control-plane expansion of FlexVolume.
