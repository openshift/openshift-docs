= Install Pipelines-as-Code as a GitHub Webhook

If you are not able to create a GitHub application you can install Pipelines-as-Code on your repository as a GitHub Webhook.

Using Pipelines as Code via Github webhook does not give you access to the GitHub CheckRun API, therefore the status of the tasks will be added as a Comment of the PR and not via the Checks Tab.

You have to first install the Pipelines-as-Code infrastructure as detailled here : Install infrastructure

You will have to generate a personal token for Pipelines-as-Code Github API operations. Follow this guide to create a personal token :

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

The only permission needed is the repo permission. Make sure you note somewhere the generated token or otherwise you will have to recreate it.

. Go to you repository or organisation setting and click on Hooks and "Add webhook" links.

. Set the payload URL to the event listenner public URL. On OpenShift you can get the public URL of the Pipelines-as-Code eventlistenner like this :

----
echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code el-pipelines-as-code-interceptor -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

. Add a secret or generate a random one with this command :

----
openssl rand -hex 20
----

. Refer to this screenshot on how to configure the Webhook. The individual events to select are :

.. Commit comments
.. Issue comments
.. Pull request reviews
.. Pull request
..  Pushes

. On your cluster you need create the webhook secret as generated previously in the pipelines-as-code namespace.

----

kubectl -n pipelines-as-code create secret generic pipelines-as-code-secret \
        --from-literal webhook.secret="$WEBHOOK_SECRET_AS_GENERATED"
----

You are now able to create a Repository CRD. The repository CRD will have a Secret that contains the Personal token as generated and Pipelines as Code will know how to use it for GitHub API operations.

First create the secret with the personal token in the target-namespace :
kubectl -n target-namespace create secret generic github-personal-token \
        --from-literal token="TOKEN_AS_GENERATED_PREVIOUSLY"
And now create Repositry CRD with the secret field referencing it.
Here is an example of a Repository CRD :

---
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: my-repo
  namespace: target-namespace
spec:
  url: "https://github.com/owner/repo"
  git_provider:
    url: "https://github.enterprise.com"
    secret:
      name: "github-personal-token"
      # Set this if you have a different key in your secret
      # key: "token"
Note that git_provider.secret cannot reference a secret in another namespace, Pipelines as code assumes always it will be the same namespace as where the repository has been created.
