= Sharing a private offer

[role="_abstract"]
You can share a private offer with other team members that are within your Red{nbsp}Hat organization account.

.Procedure
. Clicking the *Set up your account* button in the previous step takes you to the AWS and Red{nbsp}Hat account linking step. At this time, you are already logged in with the AWS account that accepted the offer. If you are not logged in with a Red{nbsp}Hat account, you will be prompted to do so.
+
{product-title} entitlement is shared with other team members through your Red{nbsp}Hat organization account. All existing users in the same Red{nbsp}Hat organization are able to select the billing AWS account that accepted the private offer by following the above described steps. You can link:https://www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/protected/usermgt/userList.html[manage users in your Red{nbsp}Hat organization], when logged in as the Red{nbsp}Hat organization administrator, and invite or create new users.
+
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} private offer cannot be shared with AWS linked accounts through the AWS License Manager.
====

. Add any users that you want to deploy {product-title} clusters. Check link:https://access.redhat.com/customer-service-users[this user management FAQ] for more details about Red{nbsp}Hat account user management tasks. 

. Verify that the already logged in Red{nbsp}Hat account includes all users that are meant to be {product-title} cluster deployers benefiting from the accepted private offer.

. Verify that the Red{nbsp}Hat account number and the AWS account ID are the desired accounts that are to be linked. This linking is unique and a Red{nbsp}Hat account can be connected only with a single AWS (billing) account.

. If you want to link the AWS account with another Red{nbsp}Hat account than is shown on this page in Figure 9, log out from the {hybrid-console} before connecting the accounts and repeat the step of setting the account by returning to the private offer URL that is already accepted.
+
An AWS account can be connected with a single Red{nbsp}Hat account only. Once Red{nbsp}Hat and AWS accounts are connected, this cannot be changed by the user. If a change is needed, the user must create a support ticket.

. Agree to the terms and conditions and then click *Connect accounts*.
