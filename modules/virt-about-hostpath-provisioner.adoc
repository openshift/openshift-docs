= About the hostpath provisioner

When you install the {VirtProductName} Operator, the Hostpath Provisioner (HPP) Operator is automatically installed. The HPP is a local storage provisioner designed for {VirtProductName} that is created by the Hostpath Provisioner Operator. To use the HPP, you must create an HPP custom resource (CR).
