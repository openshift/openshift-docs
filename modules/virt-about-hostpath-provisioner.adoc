= About the hostpath provisioner (HPP)

When you install the {VirtProductName} Operator, the Hostpath Provisioner Operator is automatically installed. The HPP is a local storage provisioner designed for {VirtProductName} that is created by the Hostpath Provisioner Operator. To use the HPP, you must create a HPP custom resource.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {VirtProductName} 4.10, the HPP Operator configures the Kubernetes CSI driver. The Operator also recognizes the existing (legacy) format of the custom resource.

The legacy HPP and the CSI host path driver are supported in parallel for a number of releases. However, at some point, the legacy HPP will no longer be supported. If you use the HPP, plan to create a storage class for the CSI driver as part of your migration strategy.
====

If you upgrade to {VirtProductName} version 4.10 on an existing cluster, the HPP Operator is upgraded and the system performs the following actions:

* The CSI driver is installed.
* The CSI driver is configured with the contents of your legacy custom resource.

If you install {VirtProductName} version 4.10 on a new cluster, you must perform the following actions:

* Create the HPP custom resource including a `storagePools` stanza in the HPP custom resource.
* Create a storage class for the CSI driver.
