= Editing a network policy

You can edit a network policy in a namespace.

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster is using a default CNI network provider that supports `NetworkPolicy` objects, such as the OpenShift SDN network provider with `mode: NetworkPolicy` set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Optional: List the current `NetworkPolicy` objects.
.. If you want to list the policy objects in a specific namespace, enter the following command. Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace for a project.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get networkpolicy -n <namespace>
----

.. If you want to list the policy objects for the entire cluster, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get networkpolicy --all-namespaces
----

. Edit the `NetworkPolicy` object.

.. If you saved the network policy definition in a file, edit the file and make any necessary changes, and then enter the following command. Replace `<policy-file>` with the name of the file containing the object definition.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <policy-file>.yaml
----

.. If you need to update the `NetworkPolicy` object directly, you can enter the following command. Replace `<policy-name>` with the name of the `NetworkPolicy` object and `<namespace>` with the name of the project where the object exists.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit <policy-name> -n <namespace>
----

. Confirm that the `NetworkPolicy` object is updated. Replace `<namespace>` with the name of the project where the object exists.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get networkpolicy -n <namespace> -o yaml
----
