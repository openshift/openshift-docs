+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> secret/<hosted_cluster_name>-admin-kubeconfig --to=- > kubeconfig-<hosted_cluster_name>
----

. Use the `kubeconfig` file to view the cluster Operators of the hosted cluster. Enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get co --kubeconfig=kubeconfig-<hosted_cluster_name>
