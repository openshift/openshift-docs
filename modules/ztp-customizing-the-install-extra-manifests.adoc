= Customizing the ZTP GitOps pipeline with extra manifests

You can customize the ZTP GitOps pipeline by specifying extra manifests for the cluster installation `SiteConfig` custom resources (CRs). The extra manifests are applied to the cluster during installation. This enables workload partitioning and `MachineConfig` changes that makes the installation process more efficient.

.Prerequisites

* Create a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repo must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for ArgoCD.
* Extract the contents of the `/home/ztp` folder from the `ztp-site-generate` reference architecture container image.


.Procedure

. Create a set of extra manifest CRs that the ZTP pipeline uses to customize the cluster installs.

. In your custom `/siteconfig` directory, create an `/extra-manifest` folder for your extra manifests. The following example illustrates a sample `/siteconfig` with `/extra-manifest` folder:
+
[source,text]
----
siteconfig
├── site1-sno-du.yaml
├── site2-standard-du.yaml
└── extra-manifest
    └── 01-example-machine-config.yaml
----

. Add your custom extra manifest CRs to the `siteconfig/extra-manifest` directory.

. In your `SiteConfig` CR, enter the directory name in the `extraManifestPath` field, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
clusters:
- clusterName: "example-sno"
  networkType: "OVNKubernetes"
  extraManifestPath: siteconfig/extra-manifest
----

. Save the `SiteConfig` CRs  and `/extra-manifest` CRs and push them to the site configuration repo.

The ZTP pipeline appends the CRs in the `/extra-manifest` directory to the default set of extra manifests during cluster provisioning.
