= Example: VLAN interface node network configuration policy

Create a VLAN interface on nodes in the cluster by applying a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest
to the cluster.

The following YAML file is an example of a manifest for a VLAN interface.
It includes samples values that you must replace with your own information.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: vlan-eth1-policy <1>
spec:
  nodeSelector: <2>
    kubernetes.io/hostname: <node01> <3>
  desiredState:
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1.102 <4>
      description: VLAN using eth1 <5>
      type: vlan <6>

      vlan:
        base-iface: eth1 <8>
        id: 102 <9>
----
<1> Name of the policy.

<4> Name of the interface.
<5> Optional: Human-readable description of the interface.
<6> The type of interface. This example creates a VLAN.
