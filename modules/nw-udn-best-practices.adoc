= Best practices for UserDefinedNetwork

Before setting up a `UserDefinedNetwork` (UDN) resource, users should consider the following information:

//These will not go live till 4.18 GA
//* To eliminate errors and ensure connectivity, you should create a namespace scoped UDN CR before creating any workload in the namespace.

//* You might want to allow access to any Kubernetes services on the cluster default  network. By default, KAPI and DNS are accessible.

* `openshift-*` namespaces should not be used to set up a UDN.

* 2 masquerade IPs are required for user defined networks. You must reconfigure your masquerade subnet to be large enough to hold the required number of networks. For {product-title} 4.17 and later versions, clusters use `169.254.0.0/17` for IPv4 and `fd69::/112` for IPv6 as the default masquerade subnet. These ranges should also be avoided by users. For upgraded clusters, there is no change to the default masquerade subnet.
// May be something that is downstream only.
//* No active primary UDN managed pod can also be a candidate for `v1.multus-cni.io/default-network`

* Ensure tenants are using the `UserDefinedNetwork` resource and not the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) resource. This can create security risks between tenants.

* When creating network segmentation, you should only use the NAD resource if user-defined network segmentation cannot be completed using the UDN resource.

* The cluster subnet and services CIDR for a UDN cannot overlap with the default cluster subnet CIDR. OVN-Kubernetes network plugin uses `100.64.0.0/16` as the default network's join subnet, you must not use that value to configure a UDN `JoinSubnets` field.
