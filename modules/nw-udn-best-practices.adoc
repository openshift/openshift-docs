= Best practices for UserDefinedNetwork

Before setting up a `UserDefinedNetwork` (UDN) resource, users should consider the following information:

//These will not go live till 4.18 GA
//* To eliminate errors and ensure connectivity, you should create a namespace scoped UDN CR before creating any workload in the namespace.

//* You might want to allow access to any Kubernetes services on the cluster default  network. By default, KAPI and DNS are accessible.

* `openshift-*` namespaces should not be used to set up a UDN.

* 2 masquerade IPs are required for user defined networks. You must reconfigure your masquerade subnet to be large enough to hold the required number of networks. For {product-title} 4.17 and later versions, clusters use `169.254.0.0/17` for IPv4 and `fd69::/112` for IPv6 as the default masquerade subnet. These ranges should also be avoided by users. For upgraded clusters, there is no change to the default masquerade subnet.
// May be something that is downstream only.
//* No active primary UDN managed pod can also be a candidate for `v1.multus-cni.io/default-network`

* Ensure tenants are using the `UserDefinedNetwork` resource and not the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) resource. This can create security risks between tenants.

* When creating network segmentation, you should only use the NAD resource if user-defined network segmentation cannot be completed using the UDN resource.

* The cluster subnet and services CIDR for a UDN cannot overlap with the default cluster subnet CIDR. OVN-Kubernetes network plugin uses `100.64.0.0/16` as the default network's join subnet, you must not use that value to configure a UDN `JoinSubnets` field.

* When setting up primary networks, you might consider reviewing the support matrix for creating primary networks using the UDN resource and Network Attachment Definition (NAD). For more information on feature support, see the "Support matrix".
