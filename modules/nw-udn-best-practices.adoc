= Best practices for UserDefinedNetwork CRs

Before setting up a `UserDefinedNetwork` custom resource (CR), you should consider the following information:

//These will not go live till 4.18 GA
//* To eliminate errors and ensure connectivity, you should create a namespace scoped UDN CR before creating any workload in the namespace.

//* You might want to allow access to any Kubernetes services on the cluster default  network. By default, KAPI and DNS are accessible.

* `openshift-*` namespaces should not be used to set up a `UserDefinedNetwork` CR.

* `UserDefinedNetwork` CRs should not be created in the default namespace. This can result in no isolation and, as a result, could introduce security risks to the cluster.

* For primary networks, the namespace used for the `UserDefinedNetwork` CR must include the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label. This label cannot be updated, and can only be added when the namespace is created. The following conditions apply with the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` namespace label:

** If the namespace is missing the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label and a pod is created, the pod attaches itself to the default network.

** If the namespace is missing the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label and a primary `UserDefinedNetwork` CR is created that matches the namespace, a status error is reported and the network is not created.

** If the namespace is missing the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label and a primary `UserDefinedNetwork` CR already exists, a pod in the namespace is created and attached to the default network.

** If the namespace _has_ the label, and a primary `UserDefinedNetwork` CR does not exist, a pod in the namespace is not created until the `UserDefinedNetwork` CR is created.

* 2 masquerade IP addresses are required for user defined networks. You must reconfigure your masquerade subnet to be large enough to hold the required number of networks.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* For {product-title} 4.17 and later, clusters use `169.254.0.0/17` for IPv4 and `fd69::/112` for IPv6 as the default masquerade subnet. These ranges should be avoided by users. For updated clusters, there is no change to the default masquerade subnet.
* Changing the cluster's masquerade subnet is unsupported after a user-defined network has been configured for a project. Attempting to modify the masquerade subnet after a `UserDefinedNetwork` CR has been set up can disrupt the network connectivity and cause configuration issues.
====
// May be something that is downstream only.
//* No active primary UDN managed pod can also be a candidate for `v1.multus-cni.io/default-network`

* Ensure tenants are using the `UserDefinedNetwork` resource and not the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) CR. This can create security risks between tenants.

* When creating network segmentation, you should only use the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CR if user-defined network segmentation cannot be completed using the `UserDefinedNetwork` CR.

* The cluster subnet and services CIDR for a `UserDefinedNetwork` CR cannot overlap with the default cluster subnet CIDR. OVN-Kubernetes network plugin uses `100.64.0.0/16` as the default join subnet for the network. You must not use that value to configure a `UserDefinedNetwork` CR's `joinSubnets` field. If the default address values are used anywhere in the network for the cluster you must override the default values by setting the `joinSubnets` field. For more information, see "Additional configuration details for user-defined networks".

* A layer 2 topology creates a virtual switch that is distributed across all nodes in a cluster. Virtual machines and pods connect to this virtual switch so that all these components can communicate with each other within the same subnet. If you decide not to specify a layer 2 subnet, then you must manually configure IP addresses for each pod in your cluster. When not specifying a layer 2 subnet, port security is limited to preventing Media Access Control (MAC) spoofing only, and does not include IP spoofing. A layer 2 topology creates a single broadcast domain that can be challenging in large network environments, whereby the topology might cause a broadcast storm that can degrade network performance. 

* A layer 3 topology creates a unique layer 2 segment for each node in a cluster. The layer 3 routing mechanism interconnects these segments so that virtual machines and pods that are hosted on different nodes can communicate with each other. A layer 3 topology can effectively manage large broadcast domains by assigning each domain to a specific node, so that broadcast traffic has a reduced scope. To configure a layer 3 topology, you must configure `cidr` and `hostSubnet` parameters.
