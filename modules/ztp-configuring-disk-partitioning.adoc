= Configuring disk partitioning with SiteConfig

Configure disk partitioning for a managed cluster using a `SiteConfig` CR and {ztp-first}. The  disk partition details in the `SiteConfig` CR must match the underlying disk.

[NOTE]
====
Use persistent naming for devices to avoid device names such as `/dev/sda` and `/dev/sdb` being switched at every reboot. You can use `rootDeviceHints` to choose the bootable device and then use same device for further partitioning.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data for use with {ztp-first}.

.Procedure

. Add the following YAML that describes the host disk partitioning to the `SiteConfig` CR that you use to install the managed cluster:
+
[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
    rootDeviceHints:
      wwn: "0x62cea7f05c98c2002708a0a22ff480ea"
    diskPartition:
      - device: /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x62cea7f05c98c2002708a0a22ff480ea <1>
        partitions:
          - mount_point: /var/imageregistry
            size: 102500 <2>
            start: 344844 <3>
----
<1> This setting depends on the hardware. The setting can be a serial number or device name. The value must match the value set for `rootDeviceHints`.
<2> The minimum value for `size` is 102500 MiB.
<3> The minimum value for `start` is 25000 MiB. The total value of `size` and `start` must not exceed the disk size, or the installation will fail.

. Save the `SiteConfig` CR and push it to the site configuration repo.

The {ztp} pipeline provisions the cluster using the `SiteConfig` CR and configures the disk partition.
