= Uninstalling the {external-secrets-operator} using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can uninstall the {external-secrets-operator} from your cluster using the {product-title} web console. Uninstalling the Operator does not automatically delete the `ExternalSecrets` custom resources or the running `external-secrets` application workload. These resources remain in the cluster to prevent accidental data loss and must be removed manually if they are no longer needed.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.
* The {external-secrets-operator-short} is installed.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Uninstall the {external-secrets-operator} using the following steps:

.. Navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators*.

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the *{external-secrets-operator}* entry and click *Uninstall Operator*.

.. In the confirmation dialog, click *Uninstall*.
