= Adding taints and tolerations

You add taints to nodes and tolerations to pods allow the node to control which pods should (or should not) be scheduled on them.

.Procedure

. Use the following command using the parameters described in the taint and toleration components table:
+
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoExecute
----
+
This example places a taint on `node1` that has key `key1`, value `value1`, and taint effect `NoExecute`.

. Add a toleration to a pod by editing the pod specification to include a `tolerations` section:
+
.Sample pod configuration file with `Equal` operator
[source,yaml]
----
tolerations:
- key: "key1" <1>
  operator: "Equal" <1>
  value: "value1" <1>
  effect: "NoExecute" <1>
  tolerationSeconds: 3600 <2>
----
<1> The toleration parameters, as described in the taint and toleration components table.
<2> The `tolerationSeconds` parameter specifies how long a pod can remain bound to a node before being evicted.
+
For example:
+
.Sample pod configuration file with `Exists` operator
[source,yaml]
----
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 3600
----
+
Both of these tolerations match the taint created by the `oc adm taint` command above. A pod with either toleration would be able to schedule onto `node1`.
