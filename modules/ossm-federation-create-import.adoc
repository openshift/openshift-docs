= Creating an ImportedServiceSet

You create an `ImportedServiceSet` resource to explicitly declare the services that you want to import into your mesh.

Services are imported with the name `<exported-name>.<exported-namespace>.svc.<ServiceMeshPeer.name>.remote` which is a "hidden" service, visible only within the egress gateway namespace and is associated with the exported service's hostname. The service will be available locally as `<export-name>.<export-namespace>.<domainSuffix>`, where `domainSuffix` is `svc.<ServiceMeshPeer.name>-imports.local` by default, unless `importAsLocal` is set to `true`, in which case `domainSuffix` is `svc.cluster.local`.  If `importAsLocal` is set to `false`, the domain suffix in the import rule will be applied.  You can treat the local import just like any other service in the mesh. It automatically routes through the egress gateway, where it is redirected to the exported service's remote name.

.Prerequisites

* The cluster and `ServiceMeshControlPlane` have been configured for mesh federation.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

[NOTE]
====
You can configure services for import even if they haven't been exported yet. When a service that matches the value specified in the ImportedServiceSet is deployed and exported, it will be automatically imported.

.Procedure from the Console
This is conjecture about what the flow might look like.

Follow this procedure to create an `ImportedServiceSet` with the web console. This example shows the green-mesh importing the ratings service that was exported by the red-mesh.

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.
. Navigate to *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators*.
. Click the *Project* menu and select the project where you installed the {SMProductShortName} control plane for the mesh you want to import services into. For example, `green-mesh-system`.
. Click the {SMProductName} Operator, then click *Istio Service Mesh ImportedServiceSet*.
. On the *Istio Service Mesh ImportedServiceSet* tab, click *Create ImportedServiceSet*.
. On the *Create ImportedServiceSet* page, click *YAML* to modify your configuration.
. Modify the default configuration with values for your import.
. Click *Create*. The Operator creates the import the based on your configuration parameters.
. To verify the `ImportedServiceSet` resource was created, click the *Istio Service Mesh ImportedServiceSet* tab.
.. Click the name of the new `ImportedServiceSet`; for example, `import-from-red-mesh`.
.. Click the *Resources* tab to see the `ImportedServiceSet` resource the Operator created and configured.

.Procedure from the CLI

Follow this procedure to create an `ImportedServiceSet` from the command line.

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. Enter the following command. Then, enter your username and password when prompted.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --username=<NAMEOFUSER> <API token> https://<HOSTNAME>:6443
----
+
. Change to the project where you installed the {SMProductShortName} control plane; for example, `green-mesh-system`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project green-mesh-system
----
+
. Create an `ImportedServiceSet` file based on the following example where `green-mesh` is importing services previously exported by `red-mesh`.
+
.Example ImportedServiceSet resource from red-mesh to green-mesh
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ImportedServiceSet
apiVersion: federation.maistra.io/v1
metadata:
  name: red-mesh
  namespace: green-mesh-system
spec:
  importRules:
  - type: NameSelector
    importAsLocal: false
    nameSelector:
      namespace: bookinfo
      name: red-ratings
      alias:
        namespace: bookinfo
        name: ratings
----
+
. Run the following command to upload and create the `ImportedServiceSet` resource in the green-mesh-system namespace.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n <ControlPlaneNamespace> -f <ImportedServiceSet.yaml>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n green-mesh-system -f import-from-red-mesh.yaml
----
+
. Create additional `ImportedServiceSet` resources as needed for each mesh peer in your federated mesh.
//TODO - Add sample output after the validation
. To validate the services you've imported into `green-mesh`, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get importedserviceset <PeerMeshImportedInto> -o yaml
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get importedserviceset green-mesh -o yaml
----
+
. Run the following command to validate the services imported into a mesh.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get importedserviceset <PeerMeshImportedInto> -o yaml
----
+
.Example validating that the services exported from the red mesh have been imported into the green mesh using the status section of the `importedserviceset/red-mesh' object in the 'green-mesh-system` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n green-mesh-system get importedserviceset/red-mesh -o yaml
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
status:
  importedServices:
  - exportedName: red-ratings.bookinfo.svc.green-mesh-exports.local
    localService:
      hostname: ratings.bookinfo.svc.red-mesh-imports.local
      name: ratings
      namespace: bookinfo
  - exportedName: reviews.red-mesh-bookinfo.svc.green-mesh-exports.local
    localService:
      hostname: ""
      name: ""
      namespace: ""
----
+
In the preceding example only the ratings service is imported, as indicated by the populated fields under `localService`. The reviews service is available for import, but isn't currently imported because it does not match any `importRules` in the `ImportedServiceSet` object.
