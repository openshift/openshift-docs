= Network observability 1.2.0 new features and enhancements

This release of network observability and the Network Observability Operator includes the following new features and enhancements:

[id="network-observability-operator-preparing-to-update_{context}"]
== Preparing for the next update

The subscription of an installed Operator specifies an update channel that tracks and receives updates for the Operator. Until the 1.2 release of the Network Observability Operator, the only channel available was `v1.0.x`. The 1.2 release of the Network Observability Operator introduces the `stable` update channel for tracking and receiving updates. You must switch your channel from `v1.0.x` to `stable` to receive future Operator updates. The `v1.0.x` channel is deprecated and planned for removal in a following release.

[id="histogram-feature-1-2_{context}"]
== Histogram in Traffic Flows view

You can now choose to show a histogram of flows over time. The histogram enables you to visualize the history of flows without hitting the Loki query limit. For more information, see "Using the histogram".


[id="conversation-tracking-feature-1-2_{context}"]
== Conversation tracking

You can now query flows by *Log Type*, which enables grouping network flows that are part of the same conversation. For more information, see "Working with conversations".

[id="health-alerts-feature-1-2_{context}"]
== Network observability health alerts

The Network Observability Operator now creates automatic alerts if the `flowlogs-pipeline` is dropping flows because of errors at the write stage or if the Loki ingestion rate limit has been reached. For more information, see "Health dashboards".
