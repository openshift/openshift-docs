= Installing extensions into an on-cluster custom layered image

You can install {op-system-first} extensions into your on-cluster custom layered image by creating a machine config that lists the extensions that you want to install. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) installs the extensions onto the nodes associated with a specific machine config pool (MCP).

For a list of the currently supported extensions, see "Adding extensions to RHCOS."

After you make the change, the MCO reboots the nodes associated with the specified machine config pool.

.Prerequisites

* You have opted in to on-cluster layering by creating a `MachineOSConfig` object.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for the machine config similar to the following example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1 <1>
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker <2>
  name: 80-worker-extensions
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
  extensions: <3>
    - usbguard
    - kerberos
----
<1> Specifies the `machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1` API that is required for `MachineConfig` CRs.
<2> Specifies the machine config pool to apply the `MachineConfig` object to.
<3> Lists the {op-system-first} extensions that you want to install.

. Create the MCP object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
----

.Verification

. You can watch the build progress by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineosbuilds
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                       PREPARED   BUILDING   SUCCEEDED   INTERRUPTED   FAILED
layered-f8ab2d03a2f87a2acd449177ceda805d   False      True       False       False         False <1>
----
<1> The value `True` in the `BUILDING` column indicates that the `MachineOSBuild` object is building. When the `SUCCEEDED` column reports `TRUE`, the build is complete. 

. You can watch as the new machine config is rolled out to the nodes by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfigpools
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

----
<1> The value `FALSE` in the `UPDATED` column indicates that the `MachineOSBuild` object is building. When the `UPDATED` column reports `FALSE`, the new custom layered image has rolled out to the nodes.

. When the associated machine config pool is updated, check that the extensions were installed:

.. Open an `oc debug` session to the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----

.. Set `/host` as the root directory within the debug shell by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-5.1# chroot /host
----

.. Use an appropriate command to verify that the extensions were installed. The following example shows that the usbguard extension was installed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-5.1# rpm -qa |grep usbguard
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
usbguard-selinux-1.0.0-15.el9.noarch
usbguard-1.0.0-15.el9.x86_64
----
