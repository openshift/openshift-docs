= Fibre Channel volume security
Users request storage with a PersistentVolumeClaim. This claim only lives in
the user's namespace, and can only be referenced by a pod within that same
namespace. Any attempt to access a PersistentVolume across a namespace causes
the pod to fail.

Each Fibre Channel LUN must be accessible by all nodes in the cluster.
