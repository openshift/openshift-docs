= Configuring IPsec encryption for multi-node clusters using {ztp} and SiteConfig resources

You can enable IPsec encryption in managed multi-node clusters that you install using {ztp} and {rh-rhacm-first}.
You can encrypt traffic between the managed cluster and IPsec endpoints external to the managed cluster. All network traffic between nodes on the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network is encrypted with IPsec in Transport mode.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have configured {rh-rhacm} and the hub cluster for generating the required installation and policy custom resources (CRs) for managed clusters.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the Argo CD application.

* You have installed the `butane` utility version 0.20.0 or later.

* You have a PKCS#12 certificate for the IPsec endpoint and a CA cert in PEM format.

* You have installed the NMState Operator.

.Procedure

. Extract the latest version of the `ztp-site-generate` container source and merge it with your repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.

. Configure the `optional-extra-manifest/ipsec/ipsec-config-policy.yaml` file with the required values that configure IPsec in the cluster.

<1> The value of this field must match with the name of the certificate used on the remote system.
<2> Replace `<external_host>` with the external host IP address or DNS hostname.
<3> Replace `<external_address>` with the IP subnet of the external host on the other side of the IPsec tunnel.
<4> Use the IKEv2 VPN encryption protocol only. Do not use IKEv1, which is deprecated.

. Add the following certificates to the `optional-extra-manifest/ipsec` folder:

** `left_server.p12`: The certificate bundle for the IPsec endpoints

** `ca.pem`: The certificate authority that you signed your certificates with
+
The certificate files are required for the Network Security Services (NSS) database on each host. These files are imported as part of the Butane configuration in later steps.

. Open a shell prompt at the `optional-extra-manifest/ipsec` folder of the Git repository where you maintain your custom site configuration data.

. Run the `optional-extra-manifest/ipsec/import-certs.sh` script to generate the required Butane and `MachineConfig` CRs to import the external certs.
+
If the PKCS#12 certificate is protected with a password, set the `-W` argument.

<1> The `ipsec/import-certs.sh` script generates the Butane and endpoint configuration CRs.
<2> Add the `ca.pem` and `left_server.p12` certificate files that are relevant to your network.

. Create a `custom-manifest/` folder in the repository where you manage your custom site configuration data and add the `enable-ipsec.yaml` and `99-ipsec-*` YAML files to the directory.

. In your `SiteConfig` CR, add the `custom-manifest/` directory to the `extraManifests.searchPaths` field, as in the following example:

  networkType: "OVNKubernetes"
  extraManifests:
    searchPaths:
      - extra-manifest/
      - custom-manifest/
----

. Include the `ipsec-config-policy.yaml` config policy file in the `source-crs` directory in GitOps and reference the file in one of the `PolicyGenerator` CRs.

. Commit the `SiteConfig` CR changes and updated files in your Git repository and push the changes to provision the managed cluster and configure IPsec encryption.
+
The Argo CD pipeline detects the changes and begins the managed cluster deployment.
+
During cluster provisioning, the {ztp} pipeline appends the CRs in the `custom-manifest/` directory to the default set of extra manifests stored in the `extra-manifest/` directory.
