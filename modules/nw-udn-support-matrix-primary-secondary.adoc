= UserDefinedNetwork and NetworkAttachmentDefinition support matrix

The `UserDefinedNetwork` and `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resources (CRs) provide cluster administrators and users the ability to create customizable network configurations and define their own network topologies, ensure network isolation, manage IP addressing for workloads, and configure advanced network features. A third CR, `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork`, is also available, which allows administrators the ability to create and define additional networks spanning multiple namespaces at the cluster level. 

User-defined networks and network attachment definitions can serve as both the primary and secondary network interface, and each support `layer2` and `layer3` topologies; a third network topology, Localnet, is also supported with network attachment definitions with secondary networks. 

[NOTE]
====
As of {product-title} 4.18, the Localnet topology is unavailable for use with the `UserDefinedNetwork` and `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CRs. It is only available for `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRs that leverage secondary networks.
====

The following section highlights the supported features of the `UserDefinedNetwork` and `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRs when they are used as either the primary or secondary network. A separate table for the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR is also included.

1. Multicast must be enabled in the namespace, and it is only available between OVN-Kubernetes network pods. For more information about multicast, see "Enabling multicast for a project".
2. When creating a `UserDefinedNetwork` CR with a primary network type, network policies must be created _after_ the `UserDefinedNetwork` CR.
