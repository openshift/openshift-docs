= Configuring a three-node cluster

You configure a three-node cluster by setting the number of worker nodes to `0` in the `install-config.yaml` file before deploying the cluster. Setting the number of worker nodes to `0` ensures that the control plane machines are schedulable. This allows application workloads to be scheduled to run from the control plane nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Because application workloads run from control plane nodes, additional subscriptions are required, as the control plane nodes are considered to be compute nodes.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure
