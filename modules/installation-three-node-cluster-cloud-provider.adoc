= Configuring a three-node cluster

You configure a three-node cluster by setting the number of worker nodes to `0` in the `install-config.yaml` file before deploying the cluster. Setting the number of worker nodes to `0` ensures that the control plane machines are schedulable. This allows application workloads to be scheduled to run from the control plane nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Because application workloads run from control plane nodes, additional subscriptions are required, as the control plane nodes are considered to be compute nodes.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

* Set the number of compute replicas to `0` in your `install-config.yaml` file, as shown in the following `compute` stanza:

** Configure your application ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes. In a three-node cluster, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. For more information, see the "Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure".
** After you create the Kubernetes manifest files, make sure that the `spec.mastersSchedulable` parameter is set to `true` in `cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` file. You can locate this file in `<installation_directory>/manifests`.
