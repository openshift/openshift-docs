= Network Observability Operator 1.2.0 new features and enhancements

[role="_abstract"]
You can view the following new features and enhancements for the Network Observability Operator 1.2.0 release.

[id="histogram-feature-1-2_{context}"]
== Histogram in Traffic Flows view

You can now choose to show a histogram of flows over time. The histogram enables you to visualize the history of flows without hitting the Loki query limit. For more information, see "Using the histogram".

[id="conversation-tracking-feature-1-2_{context}"]
== Conversation tracking

You can now query flows by *Log Type*, which enables grouping network flows that are part of the same conversation. For more information, see "Working with conversations".

[id="health-alerts-feature-1-2_{context}"]
== Network observability health alerts

The Network Observability Operator now creates automatic alerts if the `flowlogs-pipeline` is dropping flows because of errors at the write stage or if the Loki ingestion rate limit has been reached. For more information, see "Health dashboards".
