= Configuring the API Audit Log level


You can configure the audit feature to set log level, retention policy, and the type of events to log.

//This is a best guess attempt inspired by https://github.com/openshift/api/pull/279

.Procedure

. Set the audit log level:

.. Get the name of the API server Custom Resource (CR):
+
----
$ oc get APIServer

NAME      AGE
cluster   18h
----
 
.. Edit the API server CR: 
+
----
$ oc edit APIServer cluster
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: APIServer
metadata:
  annotations:
    release.openshift.io/create-only: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2019-05-09T18:56:37Z
  generation: 2
  name: cluster
  resourceVersion: "562502"
  selfLink: /apis/config.openshift.io/v1/apiservers/cluster
  uid: 2c4e980b-728c-11e9-967d-0a973adad40e
spec:
  logLevel: "Normal" <1>
  operatorloglevel: "TraceAll" <2>
----
<1> Specify the log level for an overall component.  
<2> Specify the log level for the API server Operator.
+
You can set the log level for both settings to one of the following. The setting can be different for each setting:
+
* *Normal*. Normal is the default.  Normal working log information, including helpful notices for auditing or common operations. Similar to `glog=2`.
* *Debug*. Debug is for troubleshooting problems. A greater quanitity of notices than *Normal*, but contain less information than *Trace*. Common operations might be logged.  Similar to `glog=4`.
* *Trace*. Trace is for troubleshooting problems when *Debug* is not verbose enough. Logs every function call as part of a common operation, including tracing execution of a query.  Similar to `glog=6`.
* *TraceAll*. TraceAll is troubleshoting at the level of API content/decoding. Contains complete body content. In production clusters, this setting causes performance degradation and results in a significant number of logs. Similar to ` glog=8`.

. Configure the audit parameters

.. Edit the auditing configuration file on a API server pod in the `openshift-kube-apiserver` project:
+
----
$ oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver exec <kube-api-server-name> cat /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/config/config.yaml |json_reformat 
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver exec kube-apiserver-ip-10-0-129-10.ec2.internal cat /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/config/config.yaml |json_reformat 
----

.. Edit the `auditConfig` stanza as needed:
+
----
    "auditConfig": {
        "auditFilePath": "/var/log/kube-apiserver/audit.log", <1>
        "enabled": true, <2>

        "maximumFileSizeMegabytes": 100, <4>
        "maximumRetainedFiles": 10, <5>
        "policyConfiguration": {  <6>

            "kind": "Policy",
            "omitStages": [
                "RequestReceived"
            ],
            "rules": [
                {

                                "events"
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "level": "None",
                    "nonResourceURLs": [
                        "/api*",

                        "/readyz"
                    ],
                    "userGroups": [
                        "system:authenticated",
                        "system:unauthenticated"
                    ]
                },
                {

                    "omitStages": [
                        "RequestReceived"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    },

----
<1> File path where the requests should be logged to. If not set, logs are printed to master logs.
<2> A boolean to enable or disable audit logs. Default is `true`.
<3> Specifies maximum number of days to retain old audit log files based on the time stamp encoded in their filename.
<4> Specifies the maximum number of old audit log files to retain.
<5> Specifies maximum size in megabytes of the log file before it gets rotated. Defaults to 100MB.
<6> Configure the audit policy, described in the next step.

.. Configure the audit policy setting:
+
----
        "policyConfiguration": {
            "apiVersion": "audit.k8s.io/v1beta1",
            "kind": "Policy",
            "omitStages": [

            "rules": [
                {

                                "events"
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "level": "None",
                    "nonResourceURLs": [ <3>
                        "/api*",
                        "/version",
                        "/healthz",
                        "/readyz"
                    ],
                    "userGroups": [  <4>
                        "system:authenticated",

                    ]

                    "omitStages": [
                        "RequestReceived"
                    ]
----
<1> Configure whether to generate audit events for all requests in RequestReceived stage.
<2> Configure whether to log API server events.
<3> Configure whether to log authenticated requests to certain non-resource URL paths.
<4> Configure a list of users the rule applies to.
<5> Configure a catch-all rule to log all other requests at the Metadata level. Long-running requests like watches that fall under this rule will not generate an audit event in RequestReceived.
+
For each rule, set `level` to one of the following:
* None. Do not log events that match this rule.
* Metadata - Log request metadata: requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb, and so forth. Do not request or response body.
* Request - Log event metadata and request body but not response body. This does not apply for non-resource requests.
* RequestReceived - Log event metadata, request and response bodies. This does not apply for non-resource requests.
