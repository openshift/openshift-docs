= Configuring the API Audit Log


To configure the basic audit....

//This is a best guess attempt inspired by https://github.com/openshift/api/pull/279

.Prerequisite

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

* Set cluster logging to the unmanaged state.

* If needed, get the name of the Cluster Logging Custom Resource in the `openshift-logging` project:
+
----
$ oc get ClusterLogging
NAME       AGE
instance   112m
----

.Procedure

. Set the audit log level:
 
.. Edit the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) in the `openshift-logging` project: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "clusterlogging"

....

spec:
  logLevel: "Normal" <1>
  operatorloglevel: "TraceAll" <2>
----
<1> Specify the log level for an overall component.  
<2> Specify the log level for the operator itself.
+
You can set the log level for both settings to one of the following. The setting can be different for each setting:
+
* *Normal* Normal is the default.  Normal, working log information, everything is fine, but helpful notices for auditing or common operations. Similar to `glog=2`.
* *Debug*. Debug is for troubleshooting problems. Even common operations may be logged, and less helpful but more quantity of notices.  Similar to `glog=4`.
* *Trace*. Trace is for troubleshooting problems when *Debug* is not verbose enough. Logging every function call as part of a common operation, to tracing execution of a query.  Similar to `glog=6`.
* *TraceAll*. TraceAll is troubleshoting at the level of API content/decoding.  It will dump complete body content. In production clusters, this setting causess performance degradation and results in a significant number of logs.
Similar to ` glog=8`.

. Configure the audit parameters

.. Edit the auditing configuration file on the API server pod:
+
----
$ oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver exec <kube-api-server-name> cat /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/config/config.yaml |json_reformat 
----

.. Edit the `auditConfig` stanza as needed:
+
----

                        }

----
<1> File path where the requests should be logged to. If not set, logs are printed to master logs.
<2> A boolean to enable or disable audit logs. Default is `false`.
<3> Specifies maximum number of days to retain old audit log files based on the time stamp encoded in their filename.
<4> Specifies the maximum number of old audit log files to retain.
<5> Specifies maximum size in megabytes of the log file before it gets rotated. Defaults to 100MB.
<6> Configure the audit policy, described in the next step.

.. Configure the audit policy setting:

----
<1> Configure whether to generate audit events for all requests in RequestReceived stage.
<2> Configure whether to log API server events.
<3> Configure whether to log authenticated requests to certain non-resource URL paths.
<4> Configure a list of users the rule applies to.
<5> Configure a catch-all rule to log all other requests at the Metadata level. Long-running requests like watches that fall under this rule will not generate an audit event in RequestReceived.
+
For each rule, set `level` to one of the following:
* None. Do not log events that match this rule.
* Metadata - Log request metadata: requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb, and so forth. Do not request or response body.
* Request - Log event metadata and request body but not response body. This does not apply for non-resource requests.
* RequestResponse - Log event metadata, request and response bodies. This does not apply for non-resource requests.
