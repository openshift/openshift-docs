{product-title} follows Semantic Versioning for all product releases. Semantic Versioning uses a three-part version number in the format `X.Y.Z` to communicate the nature of changes in each release.

X (Major version):: Indicates significant updates that might include breaking changes, such as architectural shifts, API changes, or schema modifications.

Y (Minor version):: Introduces new features and enhancements while maintaining backward compatibility.

Z (Patch version or z-stream release):: Delivers critical bug fixes and security updates, such as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) resolutions. Patch versions do not include new features.
