= Creating an IntegrationSink for the Logger

You can create an `IntegrationSink` API resource to log CloudEvents by applying a YAML manifest.

.Prerequisites

* You have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed and are logged in to the cluster.
* You know the namespace where the `IntegrationSink` resource will be created.
* A Knative broker or another event source exists to produce CloudEvents to be delivered to this sink.

.Procedure

. Save the following YAML manifest as `integration-log-sink.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sinks.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationSink
metadata:
  name: integration-log-sink
  namespace: knative-samples
spec:
  log:
    showHeaders: true
    level: INFO
----

. Apply the manifest by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f integration-log-sink.yaml
----
+
This manifest configures the `IntegrationSink` API resource to log all CloudEvents it receives at the `INFO` level. The `showHeaders` option is set to `true`, which means the HTTP headers of the event will also be logged.
