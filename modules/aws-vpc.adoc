= Configuring AWS VPC peering


A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. You can configure an {AWS} VPC containing an {product-title} cluster to peer with another AWS VPC network.

[WARNING]
====
Private clusters cannot be fully deleted by the {OCM} if the VPC the cluster is installed in is peered.

AWS supports inter-region VPC peering between all commercial regions link:https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#Peering_Connections[excluding China].

.Prerequisites

* Gather the following information about the Customer VPC that is required to initiate the peering request:
** Customer AWS account number
** Customer VPC ID
** Customer VPC Region
** Customer VPC CIDR
* Check the CIDR block used by the {product-title} Cluster VPC. If it overlaps or matches the CIDR block for the Customer VPC, then peering between these two VPCs is not possible; see the Amazon VPC link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/invalid-peering-configurations.html[Unsupported VPC peering configurations] documentation for details. If the CIDR blocks do not overlap, you can proceed with the procedure.
