= Recommended compute resources

By default, `spec.proxy` has the settings `cpu:10m` and  `memory:128M`.  If you are using Pilot, `spec.runtime.components.pilot` has the same default values.
The settings in the following example are based on 1,000 services and 1,000 requests per second. You can change the values for `cpu` and `memory` as necessary based on your environment.
