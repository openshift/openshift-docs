= Deploying your first image

The simplest way to deploy an application in {product-title} is to run an existing container image. The following procedure deploys a front end component of an application called `national-parks-app`. The web application displays an interactive map. The map displays the location of major national parks across the world.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console.
* You are in the *Developer* perspective.
* You have the appropriate roles and permissions in a project to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

.Procedure

. From the *+Add* view in the *Developer* perspective, click *Container images* to open a dialog.
. In the *Image Name* field, enter the following: `quay.io/openshiftroadshow/parksmap:latest`
. Ensure that you have the current values for the following:
.. Application: `national-parks-app`
.. Name: `parksmap`
. Select *Deployment* as the *Resource*.
. Select *Create route to the application*.
. In the *Advanced Options* section, click *Labels* and add labels to better identify this deployment later. Labels help identify and filter components in the web console and in the command line. Add the following labels:
** `app=national-parks-app`
** `component=parksmap`
** `role=frontend`
. Click *Create*.

You are redirected to the *Topology* page where you can see the `parksmap` deployment in the `national-parks-app` application.
