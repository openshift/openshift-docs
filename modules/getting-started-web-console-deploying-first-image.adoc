= Deploying the front-end application

The simplest way to deploy an application in {product-title} is to run a provided container image.

The following procedure deploys `parksmap`, which is the front-end component of the `national-parks-app` application. The web application displays an interactive map of the locations of national parks across the world.

.Procedure

. From the *Quick create* (image:fa-plus-circle.png[title="Quick create menu"]) menu in the upper right corner, click *Container images*.
. Select *Image name from external registry* and enter `quay.io/openshiftroadshow/parksmap:latest`.
. Scroll to the *General* section.
. In the *Application name* field, enter `national-parks-app`.
. In the *Name* field, ensure that the value is `parksmap`.
. Scroll to the *Deploy* section.
. In the *Resource type* field, ensure that *Deployment* is selected.
. In the *Advanced options* section, ensure that *Create a route* is selected.
+
By default, services running on {product-title} are not accessible externally. You must select this option to create a route so that external clients can access your service.

. Click the *Labels* hyperlink.
+
The application code requires certain labels to be set.

. Add the following labels to the text area and press Enter after each key/value pair:

** `app=national-parks-app`
** `component=parksmap`
** `role=frontend`

. Click *Create*.

You are redirected to the *Topology* page where you can see the `parksmap` deployment in the `national-parks-app` application.
