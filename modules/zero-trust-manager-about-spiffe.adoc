Establish trust between software workloads in distributed systems with {spiffe-full}. SPIFFE assigns unique IDs to workloads, allowing them to verify identities and communicate securely. This ensures secure authentication across dynamic environments.

The SPIFFE IDs are contained in the {svid-full}. SVIDs are used by workloads to verify their identity to other workloads so that the workloads can communicate with each other. The two main SVID formats are:

* X.509-SVIDs: X.509 certificates where the SPIFFE ID is embedded in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field.
* JWT-SVIDs: JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) where the SPIFFE ID is included as the `sub` claim.
