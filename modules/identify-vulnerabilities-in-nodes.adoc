= Identifying vulnerabilities in nodes by using the dashboard

You can use the *Vulnerability Management* view to identify vulnerabilities in your nodes.
The identified vulnerabilities include vulnerabilities in core Kubernetes components and container runtimes such as Docker, CRI-O, runC, and containerd. For more information on operating systems that {product-title-short} can scan, see "Supported operating systems".

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Vulnerability Management* -> *Dashboard*.
. Select *Nodes* on the header to view a list of all the CVEs affecting your nodes.
. Select a node from the list to view details of all CVEs affecting that node.
.. When you select a node, the *Node* details panel opens for the selected node.
The *Node* view shows in-depth details of the node and includes information about CVEs by CVSS score and fixable CVEs for that node.
.. Select *View All* on the *CVEs by CVSS score* widget header to view a list of all the CVEs in the selected node.
You can also filter the list of CVEs.
//TODO: link to Local page filtering
.. To export the fixable CVEs as a CSV file, select *Export as CSV* under the *Node Findings* section.
