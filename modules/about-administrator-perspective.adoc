= About the Administrator perspective in the web console

The *Administrator* perspective enables you to view the cluster inventory, capacity, general and specific utilization information, and the stream of important events, all of which help you to simplify planning and troubleshooting tasks. Both project administrators and cluster administrators can view the *Administrator* perspective.

Cluster administrators can also open an embedded command line terminal instance with the web terminal Operator in {product-title} 4.7 and later.

[NOTE]
====
The default web console perspective that is shown depends on the role of the user. The *Administrator* perspective is displayed by default if the user is recognized as an administrator.
====

The *Administrator* perspective provides workflows specific to administrator use cases, such as the ability to:

* Manage workload, storage, networking, and cluster settings.
* Install and manage Operators using the Operator Hub.
* Add identity providers that allow users to log in and manage user access through roles and role bindings.
* View and manage a variety of advanced settings such as cluster updates, partial cluster updates, cluster Operators, custom resource definitions (CRDs), role bindings, and resource quotas.
* Access and manage monitoring features such as metrics, alerts, and monitoring dashboards.
* View and manage logging, metrics, and high-status information about the cluster.
* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with the *Administrator* perspective in {product-title}.
