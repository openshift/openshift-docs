= About the Administrator perspective in the web console

The {product-title} web console provides two perspectives; the *Administrator* perspective and the *Developer* perspective. The *Administrator* perspective enables you to view logging, metrics, and high-status information about the cluster. You can view the cluster inventory, capacity, general and specific utilization information, and the stream of important events, all of which help you to simplify planning and troubleshooting tasks. You can also view and manage a wide variety of settings that are of particular interest to the cluster administrators, such as cluster updates, cluster operators, CRDs, role bindings, and resource quotas. Both project administrators and cluster administrators can view the *Administrator* perspective.


[NOTE]
====
The default web console perspective that is shown depends on the role of the user. The *Administrator* perspective is displayed by default if the user is recognized as an administrator.
====

The *Administrator* perspective provides workflows specific to administrator use cases, such as the ability to:

* Manage workload storage, networking, and cluster settings.
* Add users and groups with different levels of permissions to use or modify clusters.
* View and manage a variety of advanced settings such as cluster updates, partial cluster updates, cluster Operators, custom resource definitions (CRDs), role bindings, and resource quotas.
* Access and manage monitoring features such as metrics, alerts, and monitoring dashboards.
* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with *Administrator* perspective in the OpenShift platform.


Cluster administrators can also launch an embedded command line terminal instance in the web console in {product-title} 4.7 and later. The terminal instance is preinstalled with common CLI tools for interacting with the cluster, such as `oc`, `kubectl`,`odo`, `kn`, `tkn`, `helm`, `kubens`, and `kubectx`. It also has the context of the project you are working on and automatically logs you in using your credentials.
