[id="builds-source-code_{context}"]
= Git source

When specified, source code is fetched from the supplied location.

ifndef::openshift-builds-v1[]
If you supply an inline Dockerfile, it overwrites the Dockerfile in the `contextDir` of the Git repository.
endif::[]

The source definition is part of the `spec` section in the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
source:
  git: <1>
    uri: "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
    ref: "master"
  contextDir: "app/dir" <2>
ifndef::openshift-builds-v1[]
  dockerfile: "FROM openshift/ruby-22-centos7\nUSER example" <3>
endif::[]
----
<1> The `git` field contains the URI to the remote Git repository of the source code. Optionally, specify the `ref` field to check out a specific Git reference. A valid `ref` can be a SHA1 tag or a branch name.
<2> The `contextDir` field allows you to override the default location inside the source code repository where the build looks for the application source code. If your application exists inside a sub-directory, you can override the default location (the root folder) using this field.
ifndef::openshift-builds-v1[]
<3> If the optional `dockerfile` field is provided, it should be a string containing a Dockerfile that overwrites any Dockerfile that may exist in the source repository.
endif::[]

If the `ref` field denotes a pull request, the system uses a `git fetch` operation and then checkout `FETCH_HEAD`.

When no `ref` value is provided, {product-title} performs a shallow clone (`--depth=1`). In this case, only the files associated with the most recent commit on the default branch (typically `master`) are downloaded. This results in repositories downloading faster, but without the full commit history. To perform a full `git clone` of the default branch of a specified repository, set `ref` to the name of the default branch (for example `master`).

Git clone operations that go through a proxy that is performing man in the middle (MITM) TLS hijacking or reencrypting of the proxied connection do not work.
