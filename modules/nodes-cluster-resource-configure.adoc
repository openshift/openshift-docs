= Configuring cluster-level overcommit


The Cluster Resource Override Operator requires a `ClusterResourceOverride` custom resource (CR)
and a label for each project where you want the Operator to control overcommit.

ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
By default, the installation process creates two Cluster Resource Override pods on the control plane nodes in the `clusterresourceoverride-operator` namespace. You can move these pods to other nodes, such as infrastructure nodes, as needed. Infrastructure nodes are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment. For more information, see "Moving the Cluster Resource Override Operator pods".

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Resource Override Operator has no effect if limits have not
been set on containers. You must specify default limits for a project using a `LimitRange` object or configure limits in `Pod` specs for the overrides to apply.

.Procedure

To modify cluster-level overcommit:

. Edit the `ClusterResourceOverride` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.autoscaling.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterResourceOverride
metadata:
    name: cluster
spec:
  podResourceOverride:
    spec:
      memoryRequestToLimitPercent: 50 <1>
      cpuRequestToLimitPercent: 25 <2>
      limitCPUToMemoryPercent: 200 <3>
# ...
----
<1> Optional: Specify the percentage to override the container memory limit, if used, between 1-100. The default is `50`.
<2> Optional: Specify the percentage to override the container CPU limit, if used, between 1-100. The default is `25`.
<3> Optional: Specify the percentage to override the container memory limit, if used. Scaling 1Gi of RAM at 100 percent is equal to 1 CPU core. This is processed before overriding the CPU request, if configured. The default is `200`.

. Ensure the following label has been added to the Namespace object for each project where you want the Cluster Resource Override Operator to control overcommit:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:

# ...

  labels:
    clusterresourceoverrides.admission.autoscaling.openshift.io/enabled: "true" <1>

# ...
----
<1> Add this label to each project.
