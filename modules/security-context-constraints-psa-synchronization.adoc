= Security context constraint synchronization with pod security standards

{product-title} includes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission[Kubernetes pod security admission]. Globally, the `privileged` profile is enforced, and the `restricted` profile is used for warnings and audits.

In addition to the global pod security admission control configuration, a controller exists that applies pod security admission control `warn` and `audit` labels to namespaces according to the SCC permissions of the service accounts that are in a given namespace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Namespaces that are defined as part of the cluster payload have pod security admission synchronization disabled permanently. You can enable pod security admission synchronization on other namespaces as necessary.
====

The controller examines `ServiceAccount` object permissions to use security context constraints in each namespace. Security context constraints (SCCs) are mapped to pod security profiles based on their field values; the controller uses these translated profiles. Pod security admission `warn` and `audit` labels are set to the most privileged pod security profile found in the namespace to prevent warnings and audit logging as pods are created.

Namespace labeling is based on consideration of namespace-local service account privileges.

Applying pods directly might use the SCC privileges of the user who runs the pod. However, user privileges are not considered during automatic labeling.
