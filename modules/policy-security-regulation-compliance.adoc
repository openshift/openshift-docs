= Security and regulation compliance

[role="_abstract"]
Security and regulation compliance includes tasks such as the implementation of security controls  and compliance certification.


== Data classification
Red Hat defines and follows a data classification standard to determine the sensitivity of data and highlight inherent risk to the confidentiality and integrity of that data while it is collected, used, transmitted stored, and processed. Customer-owned data is classified at the highest level of sensitivity and handling requirements.


== Data management
{product-title} uses cloud provider services to help securely manage keys for encrypted data (AWS KMS and Google Cloud KMS). These keys are used for control plane data volumes which are encrypted by default. Persistent volumes for customer applications also use these cloud services for key management.

When a customer deletes their {product-title} cluster, all cluster data is permanently deleted, including control plane data volumes, customer application data volumes (PVs), and backup data.


== Vulnerability management
Red Hat performs periodic vulnerability scanning of {product-title} using industry standard tools. Identified vulnerabilities are tracked to their remediation according to timelines based on severity. Vulnerability scanning and remediation activities are documented for verification by third party assessors in the course of compliance certification audits.


== Network security

=== Firewall and DDoS protection
Each {product-title} cluster is protected by a secure network configuration at the cloud infrastructure level using firewall rules (AWS Security Groups or Google Cloud Compute Engine firewall rules). {product-title} customers on AWS are also protected against DDoS attacks with link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-overview.html[AWS Shield Standard].

=== Private clusters and network connectivity
Customers can optionally configure their {product-title} cluster endpoints (web console, API, and application router) to be made private so that the cluster control plane and/or applications are not accessible from the Internet.

For AWS customers can configure a private network connection to their {product-title} cluster through AWS VPC peering, AWS VPN, or AWS Direct Connect.

[NOTE]
====
At this time, private clusters are not supported for {product-title} clusters on Google Cloud.
====

=== Cluster network access controls
Fine-grained network access control rules can be configured by customers per-project using NetworkPolicy objects and the OpenShift SDN.


== Penetration testing
Red Hat performs periodic penetration tests against {product-title}. Tests are performed by an independent internal team using industry standard tools and best practices.

Any issues that may be discovered are prioritized based on severity. Any issues found belonging to open source projects are shared with the community for resolution.


== Compliance
{product-title} follows common industry best practices for security and controls.

{product-title} is certified for SOC 2 Type I on AWS.

{product-title} is ISO 27001 certified for both AWS and Google Cloud.
