= Using the web console to install the SR-IOV Network Operator

[role="_abstract"]
To install the SR-IOV Network Operator, use the web console. By using the web console, you can deploy the Operator and manage SR-IOV network devices and attachments directly from a graphical interface without having to the CLI.

.Prerequisites

* You have an account with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You installed a cluster on bare-metal hardware, and you ensured that cluster nodes have hardware that supports SR-IOV.

.Procedure

. Install the SR-IOV Network Operator:
+
.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Ecosystem* -> *Software Catalog*.
+
.. Select *SR-IOV Network Operator* from the list of available Operators, and then click *Install*.
+
.. On the *Install Operator* page, under *Installed Namespace*, select *Operator recommended Namespace*.
+
.. Click *Install*.

.Verification

. Navigate to the *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators* page.

. Ensure that *SR-IOV Network Operator* is listed in the *openshift-sriov-network-operator* project with a *Status* of *InstallSucceeded*.
+
[NOTE]
====
During installation an Operator might display a *Failed* status. If the installation later succeeds with an *InstallSucceeded* message, you can ignore the *Failed* message.
====

. If the Operator does not show as installed, complete any of the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:
+
* Inspect the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors under *Status*.
* Navigate to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page and check the logs for pods in the `openshift-sriov-network-operator` project.
* Check the namespace of the YAML file. If the annotation is missing, you can add the annotation `workload.openshift.io/allowed=management` to the Operator namespace with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate ns/openshift-sriov-network-operator workload.openshift.io/allowed=management
----
+
[NOTE]
====
For {sno} clusters, the annotation `workload.openshift.io/allowed=management` is required for the namespace.
