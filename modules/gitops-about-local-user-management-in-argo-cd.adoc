= About local user management in Argo CD

[role="_abstract"]
Local users are intended for automation scenarios that require API tokens or for small teams where configuring single sign-on (SSO) is not necessary.

The Argo CD Operator manages local users by performing the following actions:

* Creating and managing user accounts defined in the Argo CD CR
* Generating JSON Web Token (JWT) API tokens
* Configuring token lifetimes and automatic renewal
* Storing tokens securely in Kubernetes secrets
* Cleaning up users and tokens when they are removed from the configuration
