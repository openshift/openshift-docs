== Bug fixes
* Before this update, a problem with the Fluentd collector caused it to not capture OAuth login events stored in `/var/log/auth-server/audit.log`. This led to incomplete collection of login events from the OAuth service. With this update, the Fluentd collector now resolves this issue by capturing all login events from the OAuth service, including those stored in `/var/log/auth-server/audit.log`, as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3731[LOG-3731])
