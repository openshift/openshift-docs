[id="migration-upgrading-from-mtc-1-3_{context}"]
= Upgrading {mtc-short} 1.3 to {mtc-version}

If you are upgrading {mtc-first} version 1.3.x to {mtc-version}, you must update the `MigPlan` custom resource (CR) manifest on the cluster on which the `MigrationController` pod is running.

Because the `indirectImageMigration` and `indirectVolumeMigration` parameters do not exist in {mtc-short} 1.3, their default value in version 1.4 is `false`, which means that direct image migration and direct volume migration are enabled. Because the direct migration requirements are not fulfilled, the migration plan cannot reach a `Ready` state unless these parameter values are changed to `true`.

[IMPORTANT]

====
* Migrating from {product-title} 3 to {product-title} 4 requires a legacy {mtc-short} Operator and {mtc-short} 1.7.x.
* Upgrading {mtc-short} 1.7.x to 1.8.x requires manually updating the OADP channel from `stable-1.0` to `stable-1.2` in order to successfully complete the upgrade from 1.7.x to 1.8.x.

.Procedure

. Log in to the cluster on which the `MigrationController` pod is running.

----

. Update the following parameter values and save the file as `migplan.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  indirectImageMigration: true
  indirectVolumeMigration: true
----

. Replace the `MigPlan` CR manifest to apply the changes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc replace -f migplan.yaml -n openshift-migration
----

. Get the updated `MigPlan` CR manifest to verify the changes:
