= Emitting a test event to a deployed function

You can use the `kn func emit` CLI command to emit a CloudEvent to a function that is either deployed locally or deployed to your {product-title} cluster. This command can be used to test that a function is working and able to receive events correctly.

.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn func emit
----

The `kn func emit` command executes on the local directory by default, and assumes that this directory is a function project.
