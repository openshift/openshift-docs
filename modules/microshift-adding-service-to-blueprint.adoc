[id="adding-microshift-service-to-blueprint_{context}"]
= Adding the {microshift-short} service to a blueprint

Adding the {microshift-short} RPM package to an image builder blueprint enables the build of a {op-system-ostree} image with {microshift-short} embedded.

* Start with step 1 to create your own minimal blueprint file which results in a faster {microshift-short} installation.
* Start with step 2 to use the generated blueprint for installation which includes all the RPM packages and container images. This is a longer installation process, but a faster start up because container references are accessed locally.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* Replace `_<microshift_blueprint.toml>_` in the following procedures with the name of the TOML file you are using.
* Replace `_<microshift_blueprint>_` in the following procedures with the name you want to use for your blueprint.

.Procedure

. Use the following example to create your own blueprint file:

[NOTE]
====
The wildcard `*` in the commands uses the latest {microshift-short} RPMs. If you need a specific version, substitute the wildcard for the version you want. For example, insert `4.17.1` to download the {microshift-short} 4.17.1 RPMs.

. Optional. Use the blueprint installed in the `/usr/share/microshift/blueprint` directory that is specific to your platform architecture. See the following example snippet for an explanation of the blueprint sections:
