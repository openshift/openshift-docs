= Configuring SR-IOV network devices

The SR-IOV Network Operator adds the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy.sriovnetwork.openshift.io` CustomResourceDefinition to {product-title}.
You can configure an SR-IOV network device by creating a SriovNetworkNodePolicy custom resource (CR).

[NOTE]
=====
When applying the configuration specified in a `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` object, the SR-IOV Operator might drain the nodes, and in some cases, reboot nodes.
It might take several minutes for a configuration change to apply.
Ensure that there are enough available nodes in your cluster to handle the evicted workload beforehand.
=====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* An account with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You must have installed the SR-IOV Operator.

.Procedure

. Create an SriovNetworkNodePolicy object, and then save the YAML in the `<name>-sriov-node-network.yaml` file. Replace `<name>` with the name for this configuration.

. Create the SriovNetworkNodePolicy CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <name>-sriov-node-network.yaml
----
+
where `<name>` specifies the name for this configuration.
+
After applying the configuration update, all the pods in `sriov-network-operator` namespace transition to the `Running` status.

. To verify that the SR-IOV network device is configured, enter the following command. Replace `<node_name>` with the name of a node with the SR-IOV network device that you just configured.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get sriovnetworknodestates -n openshift-sriov-network-operator <node_name> -o jsonpath='{.status.syncStatus}'
----
