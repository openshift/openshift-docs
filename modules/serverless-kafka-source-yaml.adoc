= Creating a Kafka event source by using YAML

Creating Knative resources by using YAML files uses a declarative API, which enables you to describe applications declaratively and in a reproducible manner. To create a Kafka source by using YAML, you must create a YAML file that defines a `KafkaSource` object, then apply it by using the `oc apply` command.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Eventing, and the `KnativeKafka` custom resource are installed on your cluster.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* You have access to a Red Hat AMQ Streams (Kafka) cluster that produces the Kafka messages you want to import.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a `KafkaSource` object as a YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: KafkaSource
metadata:
  name: <source_name>
spec:
  consumerGroup: <group_name> <1>
  bootstrapServers:
  - <list_of_bootstrap_servers>
  topics:
  - <list_of_topics> <2>
  sink:
  - <list_of_sinks> <3>
----
<1> A consumer group is a group of consumers that use the same group ID, and consume data from a topic.
<2> A topic provides a destination for the storage of data. Each topic is split into one or more partitions.
<3> A sink specifies where events are sent to from a source.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Only the `v1beta1` version of the API for `KafkaSource` objects on {ServerlessProductName} is supported. Do not use the `v1alpha1` version of this API, as this version is now deprecated.

.Example `KafkaSource` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: KafkaSource
metadata:
  name: kafka-source
spec:
  consumerGroup: knative-group
  bootstrapServers:
  - my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.kafka:9092
  topics:
  - knative-demo-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
----

. Apply the `KafkaSource` YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

.Verification

* Verify that the Kafka event source was created by entering the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----
+
.Example output
[source, terminal]
