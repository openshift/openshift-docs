= Creating a Kafka event source by using YAML

You can create a Kafka event source by using YAML.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Eventing, and the `KnativeKafka` custom resource are installed on your cluster.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file containing the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: KafkaSource
metadata:
  name: <source-name>
spec:
  consumerGroup: <group-name> <1>
  bootstrapServers:
  - <list-of-bootstrap-servers>
  topics:
  - <list-of-topics> <2>
  sink:
----
<1> A consumer group is a group of consumers that use the same group ID, and consume data from a topic.
<2> A topic provides a destination for the storage of data. Each topic is split into one or more partitions.
+
.Example `KafkaSource` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: KafkaSource
metadata:
  name: kafka-source
spec:
  consumerGroup: knative-group
  bootstrapServers:
  - my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.kafka:9092
  topics:
  - knative-demo-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
----

. Apply the YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

.Verification

* Verify that the Kafka event source was created:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----
+
.Example output
[source, terminal]
---
