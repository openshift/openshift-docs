= About the descheduler

You can use the descheduler to evict Pods based on specific strategies so that the Pods can be rescheduled onto more appropriate nodes.

You can benefit from descheduling running Pods in situations such as the following:

* Nodes are underutilized or overutilized.
* Pod and node affinity requirements, such as taints or labels, have changed and the original scheduling decisions are no longer appropriate for certain nodes.
* Node failure requires Pods to be moved.
* New nodes are added to clusters.
* Pods have been restarted too many times.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The descheduler does not schedule replacement of evicted Pods. The scheduler automatically performs this task for the evicted Pods.
====

When the descheduler decides to evict Pods from a node, it employs the following general mechanism:

* Critical Pods with `priorityClassName` set to `system-cluster-critical` or `system-node-critical` are never evicted.
* Static, mirrored, or stand-alone Pods that are not part of a ReplicationController, ReplicaSet, Deployment or Job are never evicted because these Pods will not be recreated.
* Pods associated with DaemonSets are never evicted.
* Pods with local storage are never evicted.
* `BestEffort` Pods are evicted before `Burstable` and `Guaranteed` Pods.
* All types of Pods with the `descheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/evict` annotation are evicted. This annotation is used to override checks that prevent eviction, and the user can select which Pod is evicted. Users should know how and if the Pod will be recreated.
* Pods subject to Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) are not evicted if descheduling violates its Pod disruption budget (PDB). The Pods are evicted by using eviction subresource to handle PDB.
