[id="microshift-low-latency-install-kernelrt-rhel-edge_{context}"]
= Installing the {op-system-rt-kernel} in a {op-system-ostree-first} image

You can include the real-time kernel in a {op-system-ostree} image deployment using image builder. The following example blueprint sections include references gathered from the previous steps required to configure low latency for a {microshift-short} cluster.

.Prerequisites
* You have a Red Hat subscription enabled on the host that includes {op-system-rt-kernel}.
* You are using the x86_64 architecture.
* You configured `osbuild` to use the `kernel-rt` repository.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A subscription that includes the {op-system-rtk} must be enabled on the host used to build the commit.
====

.Procedure

* Add the following example blueprint sections to your complete installation blueprint for installing the real-time kernel in a {op-system-ostree} image:

.Next steps
. Complete the image building process.
. If you have not completed the previous steps for enabling low latency for your {microshift-short} cluster, do so now. Update the blueprint with the information gathered in those steps.
. If you have not configured workload partitioning, do so now.
. Prepare your {microshift-short} workloads for low latency.
