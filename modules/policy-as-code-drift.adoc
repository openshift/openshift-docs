= About policy drift

[role="_abstract"]
Because policies can be edited, deleted, and created in the {product-title-short} portal and also externally, sometimes _policy drift_ can occur. Drift occurs when the version of a policy in Central in {product-title-short} does not match the version of the policy in Kubernetes.

Drift can occur when a change is applied to an externally-managed policy by using the {product-title-short} portal or the API instead of by modifying its Kubernetes custom resource. {product-title-short} does not prevent drift, but it is not recommended. Drift is automatically resolved within ten hours after it was introduced.
