1. When running {product-title} on {ibm-z-name} without a hypervisor use the Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) to manage your machine.
2. The {op-system-base} KVM host in your environment must meet certain requirements to host the virtual machines that you plan for the {product-title} environment. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_and_managing_virtualization/getting-started-with-virtualization-in-rhel-8_configuring-and-managing-virtualization[Getting started with virtualization].

== Hardware requirements

* The equivalent of six Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFL), which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* At least one network connection to both connect to the `LoadBalancer` service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* You can use dedicated or shared IFLs to assign sufficient compute resources. Resource sharing is one of the key strengths of {ibm-z-name}. However, you must adjust the capacity correctly on each hypervisor layer and ensure that there are sufficient resources for every {product-title} cluster.

* Since the overall performance of the cluster can be impacted, the LPARs that are used to set up the {product-title} clusters must provide sufficient compute capacity. In this context, LPAR weight management, entitlements, and CPU shares on the hypervisor level play an important role. For more information, see "Recommended host practices for {ibm-z-title} & {ibm-linuxone-title} environments".
