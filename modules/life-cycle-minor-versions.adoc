= Minor Versions [.small]#x.Y.z#

Red Hat supports two minor versions of the major release.

* Y: The latest available minor release. For example 4.8
* Y - 1: The previous minor version. For example 4.7

Once an upgrade path from the previous minor version (Y-1)
to the latest minor version (Y) is available, clusters running
Y-2 must upgrade their cluster within a thirty day grace period.
Any cluster remaining on Y-2 thirty days after notification of
upgrade availability will be classified as being in
xref:../rosa_policy/rosa-life-cycle.adoc#life-cycle-limited-support[limited support status]
until the cluster is upgraded to a supported release.

Example:
____
Customerâ€™s cluster currently running on 4.5.18.

Latest version for 4.6 is 4.6.27.


On February 25th, 4.7.2 is released as an available upgrade path
from 4.6.27 and customer is notified.

The cluster must be upgraded to at least 4.6.27 by March 25th.

If the upgrade has not been performed then the cluster will have
SRE alerting disabled and will be unsupported until it's upgraded to
at least 4.6.27.
