= Minor versions (x.Y.z)

Starting with the 4.8 OpenShift Container Platform minor version, Red Hat supports all minor
versions for at least a 14 month period following general availability of the given minor version. Patch
versions are not affected by the support period.

Customers are notified 60, 30, and 15 days prior to the end of the support period. Clusters must be upgraded to
a supported minor version prior to the end of the support period, or the cluster will enter
a "Limited Support" status.

.Example
. A customer's cluster is currently running on 4.8.14. The 4.8 minor version became generally
  available on July 27, 2021.
. On July 29, August 28, and September 12, 2022, the customer is notified that their cluster will enter "Limited Support" status
  on September 27, 2022 if the cluster has not already been upgraded to a supported minor version.
. The cluster must be upgraded to 4.9 or later by September 27, 2022.
. If the upgrade has not been performed, the cluster will be flagged as being in a "Limited Support" status.
