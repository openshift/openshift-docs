= Validating sidecar injection

The Kiali console offers several ways to validate whether or not your applications, services, and workloads have a sidecar proxy.

.Missing sidecar badge

The *Graph* page displays a node badge indicating a *Missing Sidecar* on the following graphs:

* App graph
* Versioned app graph
* Workload graph

.Missing sidecar icon

The *Applications* page displays a *Missing Sidecar* icon in the *Details* column for any applications in a namespace that do not have a sidecar.

The *Workloads* page displays a *Missing Sidecar* icon in the *Details* column for any applications in a namespace that do not have a sidecar.

The *Services* page displays a *Missing Sidecar* icon in the *Details* column for any applications in a namespace that do not have a sidecar. When there are multiple versions of a service, you use the *Service Details* page to view *Missing Sidecar* icons.

The *Workload Details* page has a special unified *Logs* tab that lets you view and correlate application and proxy logs. You can view the Envoy logs as another way to validate sidecar injection for your application workloads.

The *Workload Details* page also has an *Envoy* tab for any workload that is an Envoy proxy or has been injected with an Envoy proxy. This tab displays a built-in Envoy dashboard that includes subtabs for *Clusters*, *Listeners*, *Routes*, *Bootstrap*, *Config*, and *Metrics*.
