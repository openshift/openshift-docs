= Configuring MetalLB with an L2 advertisement for selected interfaces

By default, the IP addresses from IP address pool that has been assigned to the service, is advertised from all the network interfaces. The `interfaces` field in the `L2Advertisement` custom resource definition is used to restrict those network interfaces that advertise the IP address pool.

This example shows how to configure MetalLB so that the IP address pool is advertised only from the network interfaces listed in the `interfaces` field of all nodes.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You are logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create an IP address pool.

.. Create a file, such as `ipaddresspool.yaml`, and enter the configuration details like the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: doc-example-l2
spec:
  addresses:
    - 4.4.4.0/24
  autoAssign: false
----

.. Apply the configuration for the IP address pool like the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ipaddresspool.yaml
----

. Create a L2 advertisement advertising the IP with `interfaces` selector.

.. Create a YAML file, such as `l2advertisement.yaml`, and enter the configuration details like the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: l2advertisement
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
   - doc-example-l2
   interfaces:
   - interfaceA
   - interfaceB
----

.. Apply the configuration for the advertisement like the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f l2advertisement.yaml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The interface selector does not affect how MetalLB chooses the node to announce a given IP by using L2. The chosen node does not announce the service if the node does not have the selected interface.
