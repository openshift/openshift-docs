[id="ossm-enhancements-3-1-3_{context}"]
== Enhancements

* This enhancement updates Kiali Operator and Kiali server to version 2.11.4.

[id="ossm-bug-fixes-3-1-3_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Before this update, images were incorrectly switched to use the newer manifest format, causing mirroring issues with older registries. As a consequence, the users experienced mirroring failures due to incompatible manifest formats. With this release, images now use the expected, older manifest format for mirroring to older registries. As a result, end users can now successfully mirror images to older registries.
