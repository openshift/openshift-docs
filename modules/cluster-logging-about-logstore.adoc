= About the log store 

By default, {product-title} uses link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch (ES)] to store log data. Optionally, you can use the log forwarding features to forward logs to external log stores using Fluentd protocols, syslog protocols, or the {product-title} Log Forwarding API.

The cluster logging Elasticsearch instance is optimized and tested for short term storage, approximately seven days. If you want to retain your logs over a longer term, it is recommended you move the data to a third-party storage system. 

Elasticsearch organizes the log data from Fluentd into datastores, or _indices_, then subdivides each index into multiple pieces called _shards_, which it spreads across a set of Elasticsearch nodes in an Elasticsearch cluster. You can configure Elasticsearch to make copies of the shards, called _replicas_, which Elasticsearch also spreads across the Elasticsearch nodes. The Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) allows you to specify how the shards are replicated to provide data redundancy and resilience to failure. You can also specify how long the different types of logs are retained using a retention policy in the Cluster Logging CR. 

[NOTE]
====
The number of primary shards for the index templates is equal to the number of Elasticsearch data nodes.
====

The Cluster Logging Operator and companion Elasticsearch Operator ensure that each Elasticsearch node is deployed using a unique Deployment that includes its own storage volume.
You can use a Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) to increase the number of Elasticsearch nodes, as needed.
Refer to the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/hardware.html[Elasticsearch documentation] for considerations involved in configuring storage.

[NOTE]
====
A highly-available Elasticsearch environment requires at least three Elasticsearch nodes,
each on a different host.
====

Role-based access control (RBAC) applied on the Elasticsearch indices enables the controlled access of the logs to the developers. Administrators can acccess all logs and developers can access only the logs in their projects.
