= Third-party registries

{product-title} can create containers using images from third-party registries,
but it is unlikely that these registries offer the same image notification
support as the integrated {product-title} registry. In this situation,
{product-title} will fetch tags from the remote registry upon imagestream
creation.

Refreshing the fetched tags is as simple as running `oc import-image
<stream>`. When new images are detected, the previously described build and
deployment reactions occur.
