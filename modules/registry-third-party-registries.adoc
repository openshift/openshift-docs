[id="registry-third-party-registries_{context}"]
= Third-party registries

{product-title} can create containers using images from third-party registries,
but it is unlikely that these registries offer the same image notification
support as the integrated {product-title} registry. In this situation,
{product-title} will fetch tags from the remote registry upon imagestream
creation.

Refreshing the fetched tags is as simple as running `oc import-image
<stream>`. When new images are detected, the previously described build and
deployment reactions occur.

[id="authentication_{context}"]
== Authentication
{product-title} can communicate with registries to access private image
repositories using credentials supplied by the user. This allows {product-title}
to push and pull images to and from private repositories.
