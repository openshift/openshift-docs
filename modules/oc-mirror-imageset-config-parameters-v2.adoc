= `ImageSet` configuration parameters for oc-mirror plugin v2

The oc-mirror plugin v2 requires an image set configuration file that defines what images to mirror. The following table lists the available parameters for the `ImageSetConfiguration` resource.

[NOTE]
====
Using the `minVersion` and `maxVersion` properties to filter for a specific Operator version range can result in a multiple channel heads error. The error message states that there are `multiple channel heads`. This is because when the filter is applied, the update graph of the Operator is truncated.

OLM requires that every Operator channel contains versions that form an update graph with exactly one end point, that is, the latest version of the Operator. When the filter range is applied, that graph can turn into two or more separate graphs or a graph that has more than one end point.

To avoid this error, do not filter out the latest version of an Operator. If you still run into the error, depending on the Operator, either the `maxVersion` property must be increased or the `minVersion` property must be decreased. Because every Operator graph can be different, you might need to adjust these values until the error resolves.
