= About the {secondary-scheduler-operator}

The {secondary-scheduler-operator-full} provides a way to deploy a custom secondary scheduler in {product-title}. The secondary scheduler runs alongside the default scheduler to schedule pods. Pod configurations can specify which scheduler to use.

The custom scheduler must have the `/bin/kube-scheduler` binary and be based on the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/[Kubernetes scheduling framework].

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can use the {secondary-scheduler-operator} to deploy a custom secondary scheduler in {product-title}, but Red Hat does not directly support the functionality of the custom secondary scheduler.
====

The {secondary-scheduler-operator} creates the default roles and role bindings required by the secondary scheduler. You can specify which scheduling plugins to enable or disable by configuring the `KubeSchedulerConfiguration` resource for the secondary scheduler.
