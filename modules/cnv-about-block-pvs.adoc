= About block PersistentVolumes

A block PersistentVolume (PV) is a PV that is backed by a raw block device. These volumes
do not have a filesystem and can provide performance benefits for
virtual machines that either write to the disk directly or implement their own
storage service.

Raw block volumes are provisioned by specifying `volumeMode: Block` in the
PV and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) specification.
