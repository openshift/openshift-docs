= Monitoring managed cluster policy deployment progress

The ArgoCD pipeline uses `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs in Git to generate the {rh-rhacm} policies and then sync them to the hub cluster. You can monitor the progress of the managed cluster policy synchronization after the assisted service installs {product-title} on the managed cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. The {cgu-operator-first} applies the configuration policies that are bound to the cluster.
+
After the cluster installation is complete and the cluster becomes `Ready`, a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR corresponding to this cluster, with a list of ordered policies defined by the `ran.openshift.io/ztp-deploy-wave annotations`, is automatically created by the {cgu-operator}. The cluster's policies are applied in the order listed in `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.
+
You can monitor the high-level progress of configuration policy reconciliation by using the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTER=<clusterName>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clustergroupupgrades -n ztp-install $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[-1:]}' | jq
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{
  "lastTransitionTime": "2022-11-09T07:28:09Z",
  "message": "The ClusterGroupUpgrade CR has upgrade policies that are still non compliant",
  "reason": "InProgress",
  "status": "True",
  "type": "Progressing"
}
----

. You can monitor the detailed cluster policy compliance status by using the {rh-rhacm} dashboard or the command line.

.. To check policy compliance by using `oc`, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies -n $CLUSTER
----

.. To check policy status from the {rh-rhacm} web console, perform the following actions:

... Click *Governance* -> *Find policies*.
... Click on a cluster policy to check it's status.

When all of the cluster policies become compliant, {ztp} installation and configuration for the cluster is complete. The `ztp-done` label is added to the cluster.

In the reference configuration, the final policy that becomes compliant is the one defined in the `*-du-validator-policy` policy. This policy, when compliant on a cluster, ensures that all cluster configuration, Operator installation, and Operator configuration is complete.
