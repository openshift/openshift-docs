[id="cert-manager-acme-dns01-ambient-gcp_{context}"]
= Configuring an ACME issuer by using ambient credentials on GCP

You can use the {cert-manager-operator} to set up an ACME issuer to solve DNS-01 challenges by using ambient credentials on GCP. This procedure uses _Let's Encrypt_ as the ACME CA server and shows how to solve DNS-01 challenges with Google CloudDNS.

.Prerequisites

* If your cluster is configured to use GCP Workload Identity, you followed the instructions from the _Configuring cloud credentials for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift with GCP Workload Identity_ section.
* If your cluster does not use GCP Workload Identity, you followed the instructions from the _Configuring cloud credentials for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift on GCP_ section.

.Procedure

. Modify the `CertManager` resource to add the `--issuer-ambient-credentials` argument:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch certmanager/cluster \
  --type=merge \
  -p='{"spec":{"controllerConfig":{"overrideArgs":["--issuer-ambient-credentials"]}}}'
----

. Create an issuer:

.. Create a YAML file that defines the `Issuer` object:
+
.Example `issuer.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: <acme_dns01_clouddns_issuer> <1>
  namespace: <issuer_namespace>
spec:
  acme:
    preferredChain: ""
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: <secret_private_key> <2>
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory <3>
    solvers:
    - dns01:
        cloudDNS:
          project: <gcp_project_id> <4>
----
<1> Provide a name for the issuer.
<2> Replace `<secret_private_key>` with the name of the secret to store the ACME account private key in.
<3> Specify the URL to access the ACME server's `directory` endpoint. This example uses the _Let's Encrypt_ staging environment.
<4> Replace `<gcp_project_id>` with the name of the GCP project that contains the Cloud DNS zone.

.. Create the `Issuer` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f issuer.yaml
----
