= Understanding the Device Manager

Device Manager provides a mechanism for advertising specialized node hardware resources
with the help of plugins known as device plugins.

You can advertise specialized hardware without requiring any upstream code changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} supports the device plugin API, but the device plugin
Containers are supported by individual vendors.

Device Manager advertises devices as *Extended Resources*. User pods can consume
devices, advertised by Device Manager, using the same *Limit/Request* mechanism,
which is used for requesting any other *Extended Resource*.

Upon start, the device plugin registers itself with Device Manager invoking `Register` on the
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/kubelet.sock_* and starts a gRPC service at
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/<plugin>.sock_* for serving Device Manager
requests.

Device Manager, while processing a new registration request, invokes
`ListAndWatch` remote procedure call (RPC) at the device plugin service. In
response, Device Manager gets a list of *Device* objects from the plugin over a
gRPC stream. Device Manager will keep watching on the stream for new updates
from the plugin. On the plugin side, the plugin will also keep the stream
open and whenever there is a change in the state of any of the devices, a new
device list is sent to the Device Manager over the same streaming connection.

While handling a new pod admission request, Kubelet passes requested `Extended
Resources` to the Device Manager for device allocation. Device Manager checks in
its database to verify if a corresponding plugin exists or not. If the plugin exists
and there are free allocatable devices as well as per local cache, `Allocate`
RPC is invoked at that particular device plugin.

Additionally, device plugins can also perform several other device-specific
operations, such as driver installation, device initialization, and device
resets. These functionalities vary from implementation to implementation.
