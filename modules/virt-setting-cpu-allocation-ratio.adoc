= Setting the CPU allocation ratio

The CPU Allocation Ratio specifies the degree of overcommitment by mapping vCPUs to time slices of physical CPUs.

For example, a mapping or ratio of 10:1 maps 10 virtual CPUs to 1 physical CPU by using time slices.

To change the default number of vCPUs mapped to each physical CPU, set the `vmiCPUAllocationRatio` value in the `HyperConverged` CR. The pod CPU request is calculated by multiplying the number of vCPUs by the reciprocal of the CPU allocation ratio. For example, if `vmiCPUAllocationRatio` is set to 10, {VirtProductName} will request 10 times fewer CPUs on the pod for that VM.

.Procedure

Set the `vmiCPUAllocationRatio` value in the `HyperConverged` CR to define a node CPU allocation ratio.

. Open the `HyperConverged` CR in your default editor by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv
----

. Set the `vmiCPUAllocationRatio`:

+
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  resourceRequirements:
    vmiCPUAllocationRatio: 1 <1>
# ...
----
<1> When `vmiCPUAllocationRatio` is set to `1`, the maximum amount of vCPUs are requested for the pod.
