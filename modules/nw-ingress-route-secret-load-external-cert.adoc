:FeatureName: Securing route with external certificates in TLS secrets
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

You can configure {product-title} routes with third-party certificate management solutions by using the `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` field of the route API. You can reference externally managed TLS certificates via secrets, eliminating the need for manual certificate management. Using the externally managed certificate reduces errors ensuring a smoother rollout of certificate updates, enabling the OpenShift router to serve renewed certificates promptly. 

[NOTE]
====
This feature applies to both edge routes and re-encrypt routes.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must enable the `RouteExternalCertificate` feature gate.
* You must have the `create` and `update` permissions on the `routes/custom-host`.
* You must have a secret containing a valid certificate/key pair in PEM-encoded format of type `kubernetes.io/tls`, which includes both `tls.key` and `tls.crt` keys.
* You must place the referenced secret in the same namespace as the route you want to secure.

.Procedure

. Create a `role` in the same namespace as the secret to allow the router service account read access by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create role secret-reader --verb=get,list,watch --resource=secrets --resource-name=<secret-name> \ <1> 
--namespace=<current-namespace> <2>
----
<1> Specify the actual name of your secret.
<2> Specify the namespace where both your secret and route reside.

. Create a `rolebinding` in the same namespace as the secret and bind the router service account to the newly created role by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create rolebinding secret-reader-binding --role=secret-reader --serviceaccount=openshift-ingress:router --namespace=<current-namespace> <1>
----
<1> Specify the namespace where both your secret and route reside.

. Create a YAML file that defines the `route` and specifies the secret containing your certificate using the following example. 
+
.YAML definition of the secure route
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: myedge
  namespace: test
spec:
  host: myedge-test.apps.example.com
  tls:
    externalCertificate:
      name: <secret-name> <1>
    termination: edge
    [...]
[...]
----
<1> Specify the actual name of your secret.

. Create a `route` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <route.yaml> <1>
----
<1> Specify the generated YAML filename.

If the secret exists and has a certificate/key pair, the router will serve the generated certificate if all prerequisites are met.

[NOTE]
====
If `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` is not provided, the router will use default generated certificates. 

You cannot provide the `.spec.tls.certificate` field  or the `.spec.tls.key` field when using the `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` field.
