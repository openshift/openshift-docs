[id="hcp-update-ocp-hc_{context}"]
= Updating a control plane in a hosted cluster

On {hcp}, you can upgrade your version of {product-title} by updating the hosted cluster. The `.spec.release` in the `HostedCluster` custom resource (CR) shows the version of the control plane. The `HostedCluster` updates the `.spec.release` field to the `HostedControlPlane.spec.release` and runs the appropriate Control Plane Operator version.

The `HostedControlPlane` resource orchestrates the rollout of the new version of the control plane components along with the {product-title} component in the data plane through the new version of the Cluster Version Operator (CVO). The `HostedControlPlane` includes the following artifacts:

* CVO
* Cluster Network Operator (CNO)
* Cluster Ingress Operator
* Manifests for the Kube API server, scheduler, and manager
* Machine approver
* Autoscaler
* Infrastructure resources to enable ingress for control plane endpoints such as the Kube API server, ignition, and konnectivity

You can set the `.spec.release` field in the `HostedCluster` CR to update the control plane by using the information from the `status.version.availableUpdates` and `status.version.conditionalUpdates` fields.

.Procedure

. Add the `hypershift.openshift.io/force-upgrade-to=<openshift_release_image>` annotation to the hosted cluster by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate hostedcluster -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> <hosted_cluster_name> "hypershift.openshift.io/force-upgrade-to=<openshift_release_image>" --overwrite <1> <2>
----
+
<1> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` and `<hosted_cluster_namespace>` with your hosted cluster name and hosted cluster namespace, respectively.
<2> The `<openshift_release_image>` variable specifies the new {product-title} release image that you want to upgrade to, for example, `quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.y.z-x86_64`. Replace `<4.y.z>` with the supported {product-title} version.


. Change the `spec.release.image` value in the hosted cluster by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch hostedcluster <hosted_cluster_name> -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"release":{"image":"<openshift_release_image>"}}}'
----


.Verification

* To verify that the new version was rolled out, check the `.status.conditions` and `.status.version` values in the hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> hostedcluster <hosted_cluster_name> -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
