= Creating a snapshot by using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can create a virtual machine (VM) snapshot for an offline or online VM by creating a `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure the `Snapshot` feature gate is enabled for the `kubevirt` CR by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get kubevirt kubevirt-hyperconverged -n {CNVNamespace} -o yaml
----
+
Truncated output:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  developerConfiguration:
    featureGates:
      - Snapshot
----

* Ensure that the VM snapshot includes disks that meet the following requirements:
** The disks are data volumes or persistent volume claims.
** The disks belong to a storage class that supports Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots.
** The disks are _bound_ to a persistent volume (PV) and _populated_ with a datasource. 

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Optional: Power down the VM for which you want to create a snapshot.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file to define a `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object that specifies the name of the new `VirtualMachineSnapshot` and the name of the source VM as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: snapshot.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualMachineSnapshot
metadata:
  name: <snapshot_name>
spec:
  source:
    apiGroup: kubevirt.io
    kind: VirtualMachine
    name: <vm_name>
----

. Create the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <snapshot_name>.yaml
----
+
The snapshot controller creates a `VirtualMachineSnapshotContent` object, binds it to the `VirtualMachineSnapshot`, and updates the `status` and `readyToUse` fields of the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object.

.Verification

. Optional: During the snapshot creation process, you can use the `wait` command to monitor the status of the snapshot and wait until it is ready for use:
.. Enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait <vm_name> <snapshot_name> --for condition=Ready
----

.. Verify the status of the snapshot:
* `InProgress` - The snapshot operation is still in progress.
* `Succeeded` - The snapshot operation completed successfully.
* `Failed` - The snapshot operaton failed.
+
[NOTE]
====
Online snapshots have a default time deadline of five minutes (`5m`). If the snapshot does not complete successfully in five minutes, the status is set to `failed`. Afterwards, the file system will be thawed and the VM unfrozen but the status remains `failed` until you delete the failed snapshot image.

To change the default time deadline, add the `FailureDeadline` attribute to the VM snapshot spec with the time designated in minutes (`m`) or in seconds (`s`) that you want to specify before the snapshot operation times out.

To set no deadline, you can specify `0`, though this is generally not recommended, as it can result in an unresponsive VM.

If you do not specify a unit of time such as `m` or `s`, the default is seconds (`s`).
====

. Verify that the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object is created and bound with `VirtualMachineSnapshotContent` and that the `readyToUse` flag is set to `true`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe vmsnapshot <snapshot_name>
----
+

<1> The `status` field of the `Progressing` condition specifies if the snapshot is still being created.
<2> The `status` field of the `Ready` condition specifies if the snapshot creation process is complete.
<3> Specifies if the snapshot is ready to be used.
<4> Specifies that the snapshot is bound to a `VirtualMachineSnapshotContent` object created by the snapshot controller.
<5> Specifies additional information about the snapshot, such as whether it is an online snapshot, or whether it was created with QEMU guest agent running.
<6> Lists the storage volumes that are part of the snapshot, as well as their parameters.

. Check the `includedVolumes` section in the snapshot description to verify that the expected PVCs are included in the snapshot.
