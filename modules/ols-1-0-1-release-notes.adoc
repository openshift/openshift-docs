== Enhancements

The following enhancements are made with {ols-official} 1.0.1:

* This release makes {ols-official} 1.0.1 generally available, and is supported on {ocp-product-title} 4.15 and later.

* This release introduces the BYO Knowledge tool as a Technology Preview feature. You can use this tool to add your own custom content as a knowledge source so that a large language model (LLM) can make use of information that is unique to your environment. By using this information, the tool creates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) database to enhance the knowledge that is available to the LLM.
