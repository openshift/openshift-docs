= Fetching vulnerability definitions

In online mode, Central fetches the vulnerability definitions every 5 minutes from a single feed.
This feed combines vulnerability definitions from upstream sources, and it refreshes every 3 hours. The address of the feed is `\https://definitions.stackrox.io`.

You can change the frequency of the default query from Central to the `definitions.stackrox.io` feed by setting the `ROX_SCANNER_VULN_UPDATE_INTERVAL` environment variable. Run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox set env deploy/central ROX_SCANNER_VULN_UPDATE_INTERVAL=<value> <1>
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.

This variable applies to the connection between Central and the `definitions.stackrox.io` feed. Both the StackRox Scanner and Scanner V4 use vulnerability data from Central that is obtained from this feed. The StackRox Scanner's config map still has an `updater.interval` parameter for configuring the scanner's updating frequency, but it no longer includes the `fetchFromCentral` parameter.

For more information about the vulnerability sources that {product-title-short} uses, see "Vulnerability sources" in "{product-title} architecture".

//Future work when time permits:
// Take instructions for changing the frequency of fetching definitions and put them into a procedure module. Call that module from the operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.adoc module.
