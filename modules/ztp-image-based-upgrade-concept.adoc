= Managing the image-based upgrade at scale using the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR on the hub

The `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR combines the `ImageBasedUpgrade` and `ClusterGroupUpgrade` APIs.
For example, you can define the cluster selection and rollout strategy with the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` API in the same way as the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` API.
The stage transitions are different from the `ImageBasedUpgrade` API.
The `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` API allows you to combine several stage transitions, also called actions, into one step that share one rollout strategy.

[id="ztp-image-based-upgrade-supported-combinations_{context}"]
== Supported action combinations

Actions are the list of stage transitions that {cgu-operator} completes in the steps of an upgrade plan for the selected group of clusters.
Each `action` entry in the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR is a separate step and a step contains one or several actions that share the same rollout strategy.
You can achieve more control over the rollout strategy for each action by separating actions into steps.

These actions can be combined differently in your upgrade plan and you can add subsequent steps later.
Wait until the previous steps either complete or fail before adding a step to your plan.
The first action of an added step for clusters that failed a previous steps must be either `Abort` or `Rollback`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot remove actions or steps from an ongoing plan.

The following table shows example plans for different levels of control over the rollout strategy:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Clusters that fail one of the actions will skip the remaining actions in the same step.
====

The `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` API accepts the following actions:

`Prep`:: Start preparing the upgrade resources by moving to the `Prep` stage.
`Upgrade`:: Start the upgrade by moving to the `Upgrade` stage.
`FinalizeUpgrade`:: Finalize the upgrade on selected clusters that completed the `Upgrade` action by moving to the `Idle` stage.
`Rollback`:: Start a rollback only on successfully upgraded clusters by moving to the `Rollback` stage.
`FinalizeRollback`:: Finalize the rollback by moving to the `Idle` stage.
`AbortOnFailure`:: Cancel the upgrade on selected clusters that failed the `Prep` or `Upgrade` actions by moving to the `Idle` stage.
`Abort`:: Cancel an ongoing upgrade only on clusters that are not yet upgraded by moving to the `Idle` stage.

The following action combinations are supported. A pair of brackets signifies one step in the `plan` section:

* `["Prep"]`, `["Abort"]`
* `["Prep", "Upgrade", "FinalizeUpgrade"]`
* `["Prep"]`, `["AbortOnFailure"]`, `["Upgrade"]`, `["AbortOnFailure"]`, `["FinalizeUpgrade"]`
* `["Rollback", "FinalizeRollback"]`

Use one of the following combinations when you need to resume or cancel an ongoing upgrade from a completely new `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR:

* `["Upgrade","FinalizeUpgrade"]`
* `["FinalizeUpgrade"]`
* `["FinalizeRollback"]`
* `["Abort"]`
* `["AbortOnFailure"]`

[id="ztp-image-based-upgrade-cluster-labeling_{context}"]
== Labeling for cluster selection

Use the `spec.clusterLabelSelectors` field for initial cluster selection.
In addition, {cgu-operator} labels the managed clusters according to the results of their last stage transition.

When a stage completes or fails, {cgu-operator} marks the relevant clusters with the following labels:

* `lcm.openshift.io/ibgu-<stage>-completed`
* `lcm.openshift.io/ibgu-<stage>-failed`

Use these cluster labels to cancel or roll back an upgrade on a group of clusters after troubleshooting issues that you might encounter.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR to upgrade your clusters, ensure that the `lcm.openshift.io/ibgu-<stage>-completed` or `lcm.openshift.io/ibgu-<stage>-failed` cluster labels are updated properly after performing troubleshooting or recovery steps on the managed clusters.
This ensures that the {cgu-operator} continues to manage the image-based upgrade for the cluster.
====

For example, if you want to cancel the upgrade for all managed clusters except for clusters that successfully completed the upgrade, you can add an `Abort` action to your plan.
The `Abort` action moves back the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR to `Idle` stage, which cancels the upgrade on not yet upgraded clusters.
Adding a separate `Abort` action ensures that the {cgu-operator} does not perform the `Abort` action on clusters that have the `lcm.openshift.io/ibgu-upgrade-completed` label.

The cluster labels are removed after successfully canceling or finalizing the upgrade.

[id="ztp-image-based-upgrade-status-monitoring_{context}"]
== Status monitoring

The `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR ensures better monitoring experience with a comprehensive status reporting for all clusters that is aggregated in one place.
You can monitor the following actions:

`status.clusters.completedActions`:: Shows all completed actions defined in the `plan` section.
`status.clusters.currentAction`:: Shows all actions that are currently in progress.
`status.clusters.failedActions`:: Shows all failed actions along with a detailed error message.
