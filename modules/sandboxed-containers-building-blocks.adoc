= {sandboxed-containers-first} building blocks

The {sandboxed-containers-operator} encapsulates all of the components from Kata containers. It manages installation, lifecycle, and configuration tasks.

The {sandboxed-containers-operator} is packaged in the xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-working-bundle-images.adoc#osdk-working-bundle-images[Operator bundle format] as two container images. The bundle image contains metadata and is required to make the operator OLM-ready. The second container image contains the actual controller that monitors and manages the `KataConfig` resource.
