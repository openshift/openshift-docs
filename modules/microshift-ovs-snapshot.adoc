<1> The `patch-br-ex_localhost.localdomain-to-br-int` and `patch-br-int-to-br-ex_localhost.localdomain` are OVS patch ports that connect `br-ex` and `br-int`.
<2> The `patch-br-ex_localhost.localdomain-to-br-int` and `patch-br-int-to-br-ex_localhost.localdomain` are OVS patch ports that connect `br-ex` and `br-int`.
<3> The pod interface `eebee1ce5568761` is named with the first 15 bits of the pod sandbox ID and is plugged into the `br-int` bridge.
<4> The pod interface `b47b1995ada84f4` is named with the first 15 bits of the pod sandbox ID and is plugged into the `br-int` bridge.
<5> The pod interface `3031f43d67c167f` is named with the first 15 bits of the pod sandbox ID and is plugged into the `br-int` bridge.
