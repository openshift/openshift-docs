<1> The `patch-br-ex_localhost.localdomain-to-br-int` and `patch-br-int-to-br-ex_localhost.localdomain` are OVS patch ports that connect `br-ex` and `br-int`.
<2> The pod interfaces `eebee1ce5568761`, `b47b1995ada84f4` and `3031f43d67c167f` are named with the first 15 bits of pod sandbox ID and are plugged in the `br-int` bridge.
<3> The OVS internal port for hairpin traffic,`ovn-k8s-mp0` is created by the `ovnkube-master` container.
