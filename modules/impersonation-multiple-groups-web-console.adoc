= Impersonating a user with multiple group memberships in the web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can start user impersonation from multiple locations in the {product-title} Console. Depending on where you start, you can impersonate a single user, a single group, or a user with one or more group memberships.

.Prerequisites
* You must be logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with permission to impersonate other users.
* The user or group that you want to impersonate must already exist.

[NOTE]
====
The impersonated user can belong to zero or more groups.
====

.Procedure
. From the **Overview** page in the {product-title} console, click your user name and select **Impersonate User**.
. In the **Username** field in the **Impersonate** dialog, enter the name of the user you want to impersonate.
. Optional: In the **Groups** field, choose one or more groups that are associated with the user.
+
The dialog displays a warning message explaining that impersonation applies the effective permissions of the specified user and any selected groups.

. Click **Impersonate** to impersonate your selected user, groups, or both.

[NOTE]
====
Selecting one group uses the existing single-group impersonation behavior. Selecting no groups uses regular single-user impersonation.
