= Webhook support

[role="_abstract"]
{olmv1-first} supports Operators that use webhooks for validation, mutation, or conversion. Operators use webhooks to enforce security policies or inject configurations into resources.

The OpenShift Service CA Operator automatically manages webhook certificates. When you install an Operator that includes webhooks, the OpenShift Service CA Operator completes the following actions:

* Applies Service CA annotations to webhook configurations and services.
* Generates TLS certificates in the namespace where you install the cluster extension.
* Mounts certificate secrets to the Operator deployment.
* Configures webhook services with proper TLS settings.
