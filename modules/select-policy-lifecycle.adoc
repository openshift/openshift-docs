= Selecting the policy lifecycle stage

[role="_abstract"]
Select the lifecycle stage when the policy is used. For more information, see "Understanding the {product-title-short} policy evaluation engine".

.Procedure

. Select the *Lifecycle stages* when the policy is used: *Build*, *Deploy*, or *Runtime*.
You can select more than one stage from the following choices:
* Build-time policies apply to image fields such as CVEs and Dockerfile instructions.
* Deploy-time policies can include all build-time policy criteria but they can also include user-pod interaction that has been configured in your cluster, such as running in privileged mode or mounting the Docker socket.
* Runtime policies can include all build-time and deploy-time policy criteria but they can also include data about process executions during runtime. You can further configure runtime policies to trigger policy violations based on the deployment events or audit logs.
+
. If you selected the *Runtime* lifecycle stage, you must select one of the following *Event sources*:
* *Deployment*: {product-title-short} triggers policy violations when events occur during deployment, such as process activity in running pods, network or process deviations from the baseline, and user pod interaction such as using the `exec` command in a pod or pod port forwarding.
* *Audit logs*: {product-title-short} triggers policy violations when event sources match Kubernetes audit log records.
