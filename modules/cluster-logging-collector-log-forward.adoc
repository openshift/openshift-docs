= Forwarding logs using the Log Forwarding API

The Log Forwarding API enables you to configure custom pipelines to send container and node logs to specific endpoints within or outside of your cluster. You can send logs by type to the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance and to remote destinations not managed by {product-title} cluster logging, such as an existing logging service, an external Elasticsearch cluster, external log aggregation solutions, or a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.

You can send different types of logs to different systems allowing you to control who in your organization can access each type. Optional TLS support ensures that you can send logs using secure communication as required by your organization.

[NOTE]
====
Using the Log Forwarding API is optional. If you want to forward logs to only the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance, do not configure the Log Forwarding API.
