= Forwarding logs using the Log Forwarding API

The Log Forwarding API enables you to configure custom pipelines to send container and node logs to specific endpoints within or outside of your cluster. You can send logs by type to the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance and to remote destinations not managed by {product-title} cluster logging, such as an existing logging service, an external Elasticsearch cluster, an external log aggregator, or a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to forward logs to only the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance, do not configure the Log Forwarding API.  
====

You can send different types of logs to different systems allowing you to control who in your organization can access each type. Optional TLS support ensures that you can send logs using secure communication as required by your organization.

When you use the Log Forwarding API, the Cluster Logging Operator creates or modifies a Fluentd ConfigMap to send logs using your desired protocols. You are responsible to configure the protocol on the external log aggregator.
