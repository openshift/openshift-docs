= Setting annotations mapping to be optional

You can have optional fields in the annotations. For example, a path to the credentials might not be present if the service endpoint does not require authentication. In such cases, a field might not exist in the target path of the annotations. As a result, {servicebinding-title} generates an error, by default.

As a service provider, to indicate whether you require annotations mapping, you can set a value for the `optional` flag in your annotations when enabling services. {servicebinding-title} provides annotations mapping only if the target path is available. When the target path is not available, the {servicebinding-title} skips the optional mapping and continues with the projection of the existing mappings without throwing any errors.

.Procedure

* To make a field in the annotations optional, set the `optional` flag value to `true`:

apiVersion: apps.example.org/v1beta1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: my-db
  namespace: my-petclinic
  annotations:
    service.binding/username: path={.spec.name},optional=true
    ...

[NOTE]
====
* If you set the `optional` flag value to `false` and the {servicebinding-title} is unable to find the target path, the Operator fails the annotations mapping.
* If the `optional` flag has no value set, the {servicebinding-title} considers the value as `false` by default and fails the annotations mapping.
