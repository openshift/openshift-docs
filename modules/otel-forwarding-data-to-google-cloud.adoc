= Forwarding telemetry data to Google Cloud

[role="_abstract"]
To forward telemetry data to Google Cloud Operations Suite, use the OpenTelemetry Collector with the Google Cloud Exporter. The exporter sends metrics to Google Cloud Monitoring, logs to Google Cloud Logging, and traces to Google Cloud Trace.

// Currently, this docs repository does not permit linking from here to the Google Cloud Exporter section. See the xref to the "Exporters" page placed in observability/otel/otel-forwarding-telemetry-data.adoc.
