[id="distr-tracing-otel-send-traces-and-metrics-to-otel-collector-without-sidecar_{context}"]
= Sending traces and metrics to the OpenTelemetry Collector without sidecar injection

You can set up sending telemetry data to an OpenTelemetryCollector instance without sidecar injection, which involves manually setting several environment variables.

.Prerequisites

* The {TempoName} is installed and a TempoStack instance is deployed.

* You have access to the cluster through the OpenShift web console or the OpenShift CLI (`oc`):

** You are logged in to the OpenShift web console as a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

** An active OpenShift CLI (`oc`) session by a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

** For {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Create an OpenShift project for the OpenTelemtry Collector.
