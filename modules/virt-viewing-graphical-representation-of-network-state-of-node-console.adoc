= Viewing a graphical representation of the network state of a node (NNS) topology from the web console

To make the configuration of the node network in the cluster easier to understand, you can view it in the form of a diagram. The NNS topology diagram displays all node components (network interface controllers, bridges, bonds, and VLANs), their properties and configurations, and connections between the nodes.

To open the topology view of the cluster, use the following steps:

* In the *Administrator* view of the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Networking* -> *Node Network Configuration*.
+
The NNS topology diagram opens. Each group of components represents a single node.
+
** To display the configuration and properties of a node, click inside the border of the node.
** To display the features or the YAML file of a specific component (for example, an interface or a bridge), click the icon of the component.
** The icons of active components have green borders; the icons of disconnected components have red borders.
