= Viewing a graphical representation of the network state of a node (NNS) topology from the web console

[role="_abstract"]
To make the configuration of the node network in the cluster easier to understand, you can view it in the form of a diagram.

The NNS topology diagram displays all node components (network interface controllers, bridges, bonds, and VLANs), their properties and configurations, and connections between the nodes.

.Procedure

* In the *Administrator* view of the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Networking* -> *Node Network Configuration*.
+
The NNS topology diagram opens. Each group of components represents a single node.
+
** To display the configuration and properties of a node, click inside the border of the node.
** To display the features or the YAML file of a specific component (for example, an interface or a bridge), click the icon of the component.
** The icons of active components have green borders; the icons of disconnected components have red borders.
