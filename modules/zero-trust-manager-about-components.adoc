= {zero-trust-full} components

The following components are available as part of the initial release of {zero-trust-full}.

[id="spiffe-csi-driver_{context}"]
== SPIFFE CSI Driver

The SPIFFE Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a plugin that helps pods securely obtain their {svid-full} by delivering the Workload API socket into the pod. The SPIFFE CSI driver is deployed as a daemonset on the cluster ensuring that a driver instance runs on each node. The driver uses the ephemeral inline volume capability of Kubernetes allowing pods to request volumes directly provided by the SPIFFE CSI driver. This simplifies their use by applications that need temporary storage.

When the pod starts, the Kubelet calls the SPIFFE CSI driver to provision and mount a volume into the pod's containers. The SPIFFE CSI driver mounts a directory that contains the SPIFFE Workload API into the pod. Applications in the pod then communicate with the Workload API to obtain their SVIDs. The driver guarantees that each SVID is unique.

[id="spire-oidc-federation_{context}"]
== SPIRE OpenID Connect Discovery Provider

The SPIRE OpenID Connect Discovery Provider is a standalone component that makes SPIRE-issued JWT-SVIDs compatible with standard OpenID Connect (OIDC) users by exposing a open ID configuration endpoint and a JWKS URI for token verification. It is essential for integrating SPIRE-based workload identity with systems that require OIDC-compliant tokens, especially, external APIs. While SPIRE primarily issues identities for workloads, additional workload-related claims can be embedded into JWT-SVIDs through the configuration of SPIRE, which these claims to be included in the token and verified by OIDC-compliant clients.

[id="spire-controller-manager_{context}"]
== SPIRE Controller Manager

The SPIRE Controller Manager uses custom resource definitions (CRDs) to facilitate the registration of workloads. To facilitate workload registration, the SPIRE Controller Manager registers controllers against pods and CRDs. When changes are detected on these resources, a workload reconciliation process is triggered. This process determines which SPIRE entries should exist based on the existing pods and CRDs. The reconciliation process creates, updates, and deletes entries on the SPIRE server as appropriate.

The SPIRE Controller Manager is designed to be deployed on the same pod as the SPIRE server. The manager communicates with the SPIRE server API using a private UNIX Domain Socket within a shared volume.
