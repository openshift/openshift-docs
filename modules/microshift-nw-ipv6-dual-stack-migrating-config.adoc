= Migrating a {microshift-short} cluster to IPv6 dual-stack networking

You can convert a single-stack cluster to dual-stack cluster networking that supports IPv4 and IPv6 address families by setting two entries in the service and cluster network parameters in the {microshift-short} configuration file.

* The first IP family in the configuration is the primary IP stack in the cluster.
* {microshift-short} system pods and services are automatically updated upon {microshift-short} restart.
* After the cluster is migrated to dual-stack networking and has restarted, enable workload pods and services for dual-stack networking by restarting them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin requires that both IPv4 and IPv6 default routes be on the same network device. IPv4 and IPv6 default routes on separate network devices is not supported.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using dual-stack networking where IPv6 is required, you cannot use IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, such as `::FFFF:198.51.100.1`.
====

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have root access to the cluster.
* Your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* The host has both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and routes, including a default for each.
* The host has at least two L3 networks, IPv4 and IPv6.

.Procedure

. If you have not done so, make a copy of the provided `config.yaml.default` file in the `/etc/microshift/` directory, renaming it `config.yaml`.

. Keep the new {microshift-short} `config.yaml` in the `/etc/microshift/` directory. Your `config.yaml` file is read every time the {microshift-short} service starts.
+
[NOTE]
====
After you create it, the `config.yaml` file takes precedence over built-in settings.
====

. Add IPv6 configurations to the `network` section of the {microshift-short} YAML with your valid values:
+
[WARNING]
====
You must keep the same first entry across restarts and migrations. This is true for any migration: single-to-dual stack, or dual-to-single stack. A complete wipe of the etcd database is required if a change to the first entry is needed. This might result in application data loss and is not supported.
====
+
.. Add an IPv6 configuration for a second network in the `network` section of the {microshift-short} YAML with your valid values.

.. Add network assignments to the `network` section of the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` to enable dual stack with IPv6 as secondary network.

<1> The IPv6 node address.

<3> IPv6 network. Specify a `clusterNetwork` with a CIDR value that is less than `64`.
<4> Specify an IPv6 CIDR with a prefix of `112`. Kubernetes uses only the lowest 16 bits. For a prefix of `112`, IP addresses are assigned from `112` to `128` bits.
<5> Example node IP address. Maintain the previous IPv4 IP address.
<6> Example node IP address. Must be an IPv6 address family.

. Complete any other configurations you require, then restart {microshift-short} by running the following command:

$ sudo systemctl restart microshift

. Reset the IP family policy for application pods and services as needed, then restart those application pods and services to enable dual-stack networking. See "Resetting the IP family policy for application pods and services" for a simple example.

.Verification

You can verify that all of the system services and pods to have two IP addresses, one for each family, by using the following steps:

. Retrieve the status of the pods by running the following command:
