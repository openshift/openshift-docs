= Creating {op-system} machines by PXE or iPXE booting

You can create more {op-system-first} compute machines for your bare metal cluster by using PXE or iPXE booting.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.
* Obtain the URLs of the {op-system} ISO image, compressed metal BIOS, `kernel`, and `initramfs` files that you uploaded to your HTTP server during cluster installation.
* You have access to the PXE booting infrastructure that you used to create the machines for your {product-title} cluster during installation. The machines must boot from their local disks after {op-system} is installed on them.
* If you use UEFI, you have access to the `grub.conf` file that you modified during {product-title} installation.

.Procedure

. Confirm that your PXE or iPXE installation for the {op-system} images is correct.

** For PXE:

----
<1> Specify the location of the live `kernel` file that you uploaded to your HTTP server.
<2> Specify locations of the {op-system} files that you uploaded to your HTTP server. The `initrd` parameter value is the location of the live `initramfs` file, the `coreos.inst.ignition_url` parameter value is the location of the worker Ignition config file, and the `coreos.live.rootfs_url` parameter value is the location of the live `rootfs` file. The `coreos.inst.ignition_url` and `coreos.live.rootfs_url` parameters only support HTTP and HTTPS.

[NOTE]
====
This configuration does not enable serial console access on machines with a graphical console. To configure a different console, add one or more `console=` arguments to the `APPEND` line. For example, add `console=tty0 console=ttyS0` to set the first PC serial port as the primary console and the graphical console as a secondary console. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7212[How does one set up a serial terminal and/or console in Red Hat Enterprise Linux?].

<1> Specify the locations of the {op-system} files that you uploaded to your
HTTP server. The `kernel` parameter value is the location of the `kernel` file,
the `initrd=main` argument is needed for booting on UEFI systems,
the `coreos.live.rootfs_url` parameter value is the location of the `rootfs` file,
and the `coreos.inst.ignition_url` parameter value is the
location of the worker Ignition config file.
<2> If you use multiple NICs, specify a single interface in the `ip` option.
For example, to use DHCP on a NIC that is named `eno1`, set `ip=eno1:dhcp`.
<3> Specify the location of the `initramfs` file that you uploaded to your HTTP server.
