IAM resources are tagged by default with a `red-hat-managed=true` policy tag. This enables you to create tagging policies that provide fine grained restrictions for cluster IAM resources in your AWS account. The policies allow Red Hat to manage only the cluster resources.

For more information about policy tagging, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_iam-tags.html[Controlling access to and for IAM users and roles using tags] in the AWS documentation.

For detailed steps to create the tagging policies, see _Creating tagging policies to restrict cluster permissions in AWS accounts_.
