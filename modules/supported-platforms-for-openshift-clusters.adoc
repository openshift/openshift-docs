= Supported platforms for OpenShift clusters

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure on the following platforms:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Microsoft Azure
* {rh-openstack-first} version 13 and 16
** The latest {product-title} release supports both the latest {rh-openstack} long-life release and intermediate release. For complete {rh-openstack} release compatibility, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4679401[{product-title} on {rh-openstack} support matrix].
* {rh-virtualization-first}
* VMware vSphere

For these clusters, all machines, including the computer that you run the installation process on, must have direct internet access to pull images for platform containers and provide telemetry data to Red Hat.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After installation, the following changes are not supported:

* Mixing cloud provider platforms
* Mixing cloud provider components, such as using a persistent storage framework from a differing platform than what the cluster is installed on
====

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster that uses user-provisioned infrastructure on the following platforms:

* AWS
* Azure
* GCP
* {rh-openstack}
* {rh-virtualization}
* VMware vSphere
* Bare metal
* IBM Z or LinuxONE
* IBM Power Systems

With installations on user-provisioned infrastructure, each machine can have full internet access, you can place your cluster behind a proxy, or you can perform a _restricted network installation_. In a restricted network installation, you can download the images that are required to install a cluster, place them in a mirror registry, and use that data to install your cluster. While you require internet access to pull images for platform containers, with a restricted network installation on vSphere or bare metal infrastructure, your cluster machines do not require direct internet access.

The link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4128421[OpenShift Container Platform 4.x Tested Integrations] page contains details about integration testing for different platforms.
