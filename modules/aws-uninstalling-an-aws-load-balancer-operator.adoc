= Uninstalling an AWS Load Balancer Operator

[role="_abstract"]
To remove the AWS Load Balancer Operator and clean up associated resources, uninstall the operator from the cluster. This ensures a complete cleanup of the environment and prevents unused resources from persisting.

.Procedure

. Clean up the sample application by deleting the Load Balancers created and managed by the ALBO.

. Clean up the AWS VPC tags by removing the VPC tags that were added to the subnets for discovering subnets and for creating Application Load Balancers (ALBs).

. Clean up AWS Load Balancer Operator components by deleting both the AWS Load Balancer Operator and the Application Load Balancer Controller.
