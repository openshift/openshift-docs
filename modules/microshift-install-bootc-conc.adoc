= About image mode for {op-system-base-full}

Image mode for {op-system-base-full} is a Technology Preview deployment method that uses a container-native approach to build, deploy, and manage the operating system as a bootc image. By using bootc, you can build, deploy, and manage the operating system as if it is any other container.

* This container image uses standard OCI or Docker containers as a transport and delivery format for base operating system updates.
* A bootc image includes a Linux kernel that is used to start the operating system.
* By using bootc containers, developers, operations administrators, and solution providers can all use the same container-native tools and techniques.

Image mode splits the creation and installation of software changes into two steps: one on a build system and one on a running target system.

* In the build-system step, a Podman build inspects the RPM files available for installation, determines any dependencies, and creates an ordered list of chained steps to complete, with the end result being a new operating system available to install.

* In the running-target-system step, a bootc update downloads, unpacks, and makes the new operating system bootable alongside the currently running system. Local configuration changes are carried forward to the new operating system, but do not take effect until the system is rebooted and the new operating system image replaces the running image.
