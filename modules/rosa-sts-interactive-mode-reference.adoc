= Understanding the interactive cluster creation mode options

You can create a {product-title} cluster with the AWS Security Token Service (STS) by using the interactive mode. You can enable the mode by specifying the `--interactive` option when you run `rosa create cluster`. The following table describes the interactive mode options.

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===

|Field|Description

|`Cluster name`
|Enter a name for your cluster, for example `my-rosa-cluster`.

|`Deploy cluster using AWS STS`
|Create an OpenShift cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to allocate temporary, limited-privilege credentials for component-specific AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. The service enables cluster components to make AWS API calls using secure cloud resource management practices.

|`OpenShift version`
|Select the version of OpenShift to install, for example `4.3.12`. The default is the latest version.

|`External ID (optional)`
|Specify an unique identifier that is passed by OpenShift Cluster Manager and the OpenShift installer when an account role is assumed. This option is only required for custom account roles that expect an external ID.

|`Operator roles prefix`
|Enter a prefix to assign to the cluster-specific Operator IAM roles. The default is the name of the cluster and a 4-digit random string, for example `my-rosa-cluster-a0b1`.

|`Multiple availability zones`
|Deploy the cluster to multiple availability zones in the AWS region. The default is `No`, which results in a cluster being deployed to a single availability zone. If you deploy a cluster into multiple availability zones, the AWS region must have at least 3 availability zones. Multiple availability zones are recommended for production workloads.

|`AWS region`
|Specify the AWS region to deploy the cluster in. This overrides the `AWS_REGION` environment variable.

|`PrivateLink cluster`
|Create a cluster using AWS PrivateLink. This option provides private connectivity between Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), AWS services, and your on-premise networks, without exposing your traffic to the public internet. To provide support, Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) can connect to the cluster by using AWS PrivateLink Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoints. This option cannot be changed after a cluster is created. The default is `No`.

|`Install into an existing VPC`
|Install a cluster into an existing AWS VPC. To use this option, your VPC must have 2 subnets for each availability zone that you are installing the cluster into. The default is `No`.

|`Enable customer managed key` 
|Enable this option to use the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to help securely manage keys for encrypted data. The keys are used for control plane data volumes that are encrypted by default. Persistent volumes (PVs) for customer applications also use AWS KMS for key management. When enabled, the account KMS key for the region is used by default. The default is `No`.

|`Compute nodes instance type`
|Select a compute node instance type. The default is `m5.xlarge`.

|`Enable autoscaling`
|Enable compute node autoscaling. The autoscaler adjusts the size of the cluster to meet your deployment demands. The default is `No`. 

|`Compute nodes`
|Specify the number of compute nodes to provision into each availability zone. Clusters deployed in a single availability zone require at least 2 nodes. Clusters deployed in multiple zones must have at least 3 nodes. The default is `2`.

|`Machine CIDR`
|Specify the machine IP address range. A minimum IP address range of 128 addresses, using the subnet prefix `/25`, is supported for single availability zone deployments. A minimum address range of 256 addresses, using the subnet prefix `/24`, is supported for deployments that use multiple availability zones. The default is `10.0.0.0/16`.

|`Service CIDR`
|Specify the IP address range for services. The OpenShift SDN allows only one address block for services. The address block must not overlap with any other address block. The default is `172.30.0.0/16`.

|`Pod CIDR`
|Specify the pod IP address range. The OpenShift SDN network plug-in supports multiple cluster networks. The address blocks for multiple cluster networks must not overlap. The ranges must be large enough to accommodate your workload. The default is `10.128.0.0/14`.

|`Host prefix`
|Specify the subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if the host prefix is set to `23`, each node is assigned a `/23` subnet in the CIDR address range. The default is `23`.

|`Disable workload monitoring`
|Disable monitoring for user-defined projects. Monitoring for user-defined projects is enabled by default.
