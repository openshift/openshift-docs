= Understanding the interactive cluster creation mode options

You can create a {product-title} cluster with the AWS Security Token Service (STS) by using the interactive mode. You can enable the mode by specifying the `--interactive` option when you run `rosa create cluster`. The following table describes the interactive mode options.

.`--interactive` mode options
[cols=".^2,.^3a",options="header"]
|===

|Field|Description

|`Cluster name`
|Enter a name for your cluster, for example `my-rosa-cluster`.

|`Deploy cluster using AWS STS`
|Create an OpenShift cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to allocate temporary, limited-privilege credentials for component-specific AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. The service enables cluster components to make AWS API calls using secure cloud resource management practices.

|`OpenShift version`
|Select the version of OpenShift to install, for example `4.3.12`. The default is the latest version.

|`External ID (optional)`
|Specify an unique identifier that is passed by OpenShift Cluster Manager and the OpenShift installer when an account role is assumed. This option is only required for custom account roles that expect an external ID.

|`Operator roles prefix`
|Enter a prefix to assign to the cluster-specific Operator IAM roles. The default is the name of the cluster and a 4-digit random string, for example `my-rosa-cluster-a0b1`.

|`Multiple availability zones`
|Deploy the cluster to multiple availability zones in the AWS region. The default is `No`, which results in a cluster being deployed to a single availability zone. If you deploy a cluster into multiple availability zones, the AWS region must have at least 3 availability zones. Multiple availability zones are recommended for production workloads.

|`AWS region`
|Specify the AWS region to deploy the cluster in. This overrides the `AWS_REGION` environment variable.

|`PrivateLink cluster`
|Create a cluster using AWS PrivateLink. This option provides private connectivity between Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), AWS services, and your on-premise networks, without exposing your traffic to the public internet. To provide support, Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) can connect to the cluster by using AWS PrivateLink Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoints. This option cannot be changed after a cluster is created. The default is `No`.

|`Install into an existing VPC`
|Install a cluster into an existing AWS VPC. To use this option, your VPC must have 2 subnets for each availability zone that you are installing the cluster into. The default is `No`.

|`Enable customer managed key`
|Enable this option to use the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to help securely manage keys for encrypted data. The keys are used for control plane data volumes that are encrypted by default. Persistent volumes (PVs) for customer applications also use AWS KMS for key management. When enabled, the account KMS key for the region is used by default. The default is `No`.

|`Compute nodes instance type`
|Select a compute node instance type. The default is `m5.xlarge`.

|`Enable autoscaling`
|Enable compute node autoscaling. The autoscaler adjusts the size of the cluster to meet your deployment demands. The default is `No`.

|`Compute nodes`
|Specify the number of compute nodes to provision into each availability zone. Clusters deployed in a single availability zone require at least 2 nodes. Clusters deployed in multiple zones must have at least 3 nodes. The default is `2`.

|`Machine CIDR`
|Specify the IP address range for machines (cluster nodes), which must encompass all CIDR address ranges for your VPC subnets. Subnets must be contiguous. A minimum IP address range of 128 addresses, using the subnet prefix `/25`, is supported for single availability zone deployments. A minimum address range of 256 addresses, using the subnet prefix `/24`, is supported for deployments that use multiple availability zones. The default is `10.0.0.0/16`. This range must not conflict with any connected networks.

|`Service CIDR`
|Specify the IP address range for services. The range must be large enough to accommodate your workload. The address block must not overlap with any external service accessed from within the cluster. The default is `172.30.0.0/16`. It is recommended that they are the same between clusters.

|`Pod CIDR`
|Specify the IP address range for pods. The range must be large enough to accommodate your workload. The address block must not overlap with any external service accessed from within the cluster. The default is `10.128.0.0/14`. It is recommended that they are the same between clusters.

|`Host prefix`
|Specify the subnet prefix length assigned to pods scheduled to individual machines. The host prefix determines the pod IP address pool for each machine. For example, if the host prefix is set to `/23`, each machine is assigned a `/23` subnet from the pod CIDR address range. The default is `/23`, allowing 512 cluster nodes and 512 pods per node, both of which are beyond our supported maximums. For information on the supported maximums, see the Additional Resources section below.

|`Encrypt etcd data (optional)`
|In {product-title}, the control plane storage is encrypted at rest by default and this includes encryption of the etcd volumes. You can additionally enable the `Encrypt etcd data` option to encrypt the key values for some resources in etcd, but not the keys.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By enabling etcd encryption for the key values in etcd, you will incur a performance overhead of approximately 20%. The overhead is a result of introducing this second layer of encryption, in addition to the default control plane storage encryption that encrypts the etcd volumes. Red Hat recommends that you enable etcd encryption only if you specifically require it for your use case.
====

|`Disable workload monitoring`
|Disable monitoring for user-defined projects. Monitoring for user-defined projects is enabled by default.
