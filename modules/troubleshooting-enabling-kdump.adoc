= Enabling kdump

{op-system} ships with the `kexec-tools` package, but manual configuration is required to enable the `kdump` service.

.Procedure

Perform the following steps to enable kdump on {op-system}.

. To reserve memory for the crash kernel during the first kernel booting, provide kernel arguments by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# rpm-ostree kargs --append='crashkernel=256M'
----

. Optional: To write the crash dump over the network or to some other location, rather than to the default local `/var/crash` location, edit the `/etc/kdump.conf` configuration file.
+
[NOTE]
====
If your node uses LUKS-encrypted devices, you must use network dumps as kdump does not support saving crash dumps to LUKS-encrypted devices.
====
+
For details on configuring the `kdump` service, see the comments in `/etc/sysconfig/kdump`, `/etc/kdump.conf`, and the `kdump.conf` manual page.

. Enable the `kdump` systemd service.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl enable kdump.service
----

. Reboot your system.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl reboot
----

. Ensure that kdump has loaded a crash kernel by checking that the `kdump.service` systemd service has started and exited successfully and that the command, `cat /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_loaded`, prints the value `1`.
