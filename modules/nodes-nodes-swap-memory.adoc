= Allowing swap memory use on nodes

You can allow workloads on the cluster nodes to use swap memory.

:FeatureName: Swap memory support on nodes
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
Swap memory support is available only for container-native virtualization (CNV) users or use cases.
====

To allow swap memory usage on your nodes, create a `kubeletconfig` custom resource (CR) to set the `failSwapOn` parameter to `false`. 

Optionally, you can control swap memory usage by {product-title} workloads on those nodes by setting the `swapBehavior` parameter to one of the following values:

* `NoSwap` prevents {product-title} worloads from using swap memory.  
* `LimitedSwap` allows {product-title} workloads that fall under the Burstable QoS class to use swap memory.

Regardless of the `swapBehavior` setting, any workloads that are not managed by {product-title} on that node can still use swap memory if the `failSwapOn` parameter is `false`.

Because the kubelet will not start in the presence of swap memory without this configuration, you must allow swap memory in {product-title} before enabling swap memory on the nodes. If there is no swap memory present on a node, enabling swap memory in {product-title} has no effect.

[WARNING]
====
Using swap memory can negatively impact workload performance and out-of-resource handling. Do not enable swap memory on control plane nodes.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have a running {product-title} cluster that uses version 4.10 or later.

* Your cluster is configured to use cgroup v2. Swap memory is not supported on nodes in clusters that use cgroup v1.

* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

* You have enabled the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on the cluster (see _Nodes -> Working with clusters -> Enabling features using feature gates_).
+
[NOTE]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. These feature sets are not recommended on production clusters.
====

.Procedure

. Apply a custom label to the machine config pool where you want to allow swap memory.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker kubelet-swap=enabled
----

. Create a custom resource (CR) to enable and configure swap settings.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: swap-config
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      kubelet-swap: enabled
  kubeletConfig:
    failSwapOn: false <1>
    memorySwap:
      swapBehavior: LimitedSwap <2>
#...
----
<1> Set to `false` to enable swap memory use on the associated nodes. Set to `true` to disable swap memory use.
<2> Optional: Specify the swap memory behavior for {product-title} pods.
+
* `NoSwap`: {product-title} pods cannot use swap. This is the default.
* `LimitedSwap`: {product-title} pods of Burstable QoS class only are permitted to employ swap.

. Enable swap memory on the nodes by setting the `swapaccount=1` kernel argument and configure swap memory as needed.
