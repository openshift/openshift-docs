= Understanding how to use pod disruption budgets to specify the number of pods that must be up

A _pod disruption budget_ is part of the
link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/disruptions/[Kubernetes] API, which can be
managed with `oc` commands like other object types. They
allow the specification of safety constraints on pods during operations, such as
draining a node for maintenance.

`PodDisruptionBudget` is an API object that specifies the minimum number or
percentage of replicas that must be up at a time. Setting these in projects can
be helpful during node maintenance (such as scaling a cluster down or a cluster
upgrade) and is only honored on voluntary evictions (not on node failures).

A `PodDisruptionBudget` object's configuration consists of the following key
parts:

* A label selector, which is a label query over a set of pods.
* An availability level, which specifies the minimum number of pods that must be
 available simultaneously, either:
** `minAvailable` is the number of pods must always be available, even during a disruption.
** `maxUnavailable` is the number of pods can be unavailable during a disruption.

[NOTE]
====
A `maxUnavailable` of `0%` or `0` or a `minAvailable` of `100%` or equal to the number of replicas
is permitted but can block nodes from being drained.
====

You can check for pod disruption budgets across all projects with the following:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get poddisruptionbudget --all-namespaces
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE         NAME          MIN-AVAILABLE   SELECTOR
another-project   another-pdb   4               bar=foo
test-project      my-pdb        2               foo=bar
----

The `PodDisruptionBudget` is considered healthy when there are at least
`minAvailable` pods running in the system. Every pod above that limit can be evicted.

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your pod priority and preemption settings,
lower-priority pods might be removed despite their pod disruption budget requirements.
