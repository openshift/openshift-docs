= Understanding how to use pod disruption budgets to specify the number of pods that must be up

A _pod disruption budget_ allows the specification of safety constraints on pods during operations, such as draining a node for maintenance.

`PodDisruptionBudget` is an API object that specifies the minimum number or
percentage of replicas that must be up at a time. Setting these in projects can
be helpful during node maintenance (such as scaling a cluster down or a cluster
upgrade) and is only honored on voluntary evictions (not on node failures).

A `PodDisruptionBudget` object's configuration consists of the following key
parts:

* A label selector, which is a label query over a set of pods.
* An availability level, which specifies the minimum number of pods that must be
 available simultaneously, either:
** `minAvailable` is the number of pods must always be available, even during a disruption.
** `maxUnavailable` is the number of pods can be unavailable during a disruption.

[NOTE]
====
`Available` refers to the number of pods that has condition `Ready=True`.
`Ready=True` refers to the pod that is able to serve requests and should be added to the load balancing pools of all matching services.

A `maxUnavailable` of `0%` or `0` or a `minAvailable` of `100%` or equal to the number of replicas
is permitted but can block nodes from being drained.
====

[WARNING]
====
The default setting for `maxUnavailable` is `1` for all the machine config pools in {product-title}. It is recommended to not change this value and update one control plane node at a time. Do not change this value to `3` for the control plane pool.
====

You can check for pod disruption budgets across all projects with the following:

The `PodDisruptionBudget` is considered healthy when there are at least
`minAvailable` pods running in the system. Every pod above that limit can be evicted.

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your pod priority and preemption settings,
lower-priority pods might be removed despite their pod disruption budget requirements.
