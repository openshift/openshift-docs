= Downloading a Sensor bundle

[role="_abstract"]
The Sensor bundle includes the necessary configuration files and scripts to install Sensor. You can download the Sensor bundle from the RHACS portal.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the RHACS portal.
. Go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
. Click *New Cluster* and specify a name for the cluster.
. If you are deploying the Sensor in the same cluster, accept the default values for all the fields.
Otherwise, if you are deploying into a different cluster, replace the address `central.stackrox.svc:443` with a load balancer, node port, or other address (including the port number) that is accessible from the other cluster in which you are planning to install.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using a non-gRPC capable load balancer, such as HAProxy, AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB), or AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) use the WebSocket Secure (`wss`) protocol.
To use `wss`:

. Prefix the address with `wss://`, and
. Add the port number after the address, for example, `wss://stackrox-central.example.com:443`.

. Click *Next* to continue.
. Click *Download YAML File and Keys*.
