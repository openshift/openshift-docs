= Configuring an external load balancer

You can configure an {product-title} cluster
ifeval::["{context}" == "load-balancing-openstack"]
on {rh-openstack-first}
endif::[]
to use an external load balancer in place of the default load balancer.

// Maybe an About mod in support



.Prerequisites

* On your load balancer, TCP over ports 6443, 443, and 80 must be available to any users of your system.

* Load balance the API port, 6443, between each of the control plane nodes.

* Load balance the application ports, 443 and 80, between all of the compute nodes.

* On your load balancer, port 22623, which is used to serve ignition startup configurations to nodes, is not exposed outside of the cluster.

* Your load balancer must be able to access every machine in your cluster. Methods to allow this access include:
** Attaching the load balancer to the cluster's machine subnet.
** Attaching floating IP addresses to machines that use the load balancer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
External load balancing services and the control plane nodes must run on the same L2 network, and on the same VLAN when using VLANs to route traffic between the load balancing services and the control plane nodes.
====

.Procedure

. Enable access to the cluster from your load balancer on ports 6443, 443, and 80.

As an example, note this HAProxy configuration:

----

. Add records to your DNS server for the cluster API and apps over the load balancer. For example:
+
[source,dns]
----
<load_balancer_ip_address> api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
<load_balancer_ip_address> apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
----

. From a command line, use `curl` to verify that the external load balancer and DNS configuration are operational.

.. Verify that the cluster API is accessible:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl https://<loadbalancer_ip_address>:6443/version --insecure
----
+
If the configuration is correct, you receive a JSON object in response:

You can also verify application accessibility by opening the {product-title} console in a web browser.
