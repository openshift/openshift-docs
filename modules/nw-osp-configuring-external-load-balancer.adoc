= Configuring an external load balancer

You can configure a {product-title} cluster on {rh-openstack-first} to use an external load balancer in place of the default load balancer.

// Maybe an About mod in support

.Prerequisites

* On your load balancer, TCP over ports 6443, 443, and 80 must be available to any users of your system.

* Load balance the API port, 6443, between each of the control plane nodes.

* Load balance the application ports, 443 and 80, between all of the compute nodes.

* On your load balancer, port 22623, which is used to serve ignition start-up configurations to nodes, is not exposed outside of the cluster.

* Your load balancer must be able to access every machine in your cluster. Methods to allow this access include:
** Attaching the load balancer to the cluster's machine subnet.
** Attaching floating IP addresses to machines that use the load balancer.

.Procedure

. Enable access to the cluster from your load balancer on ports 6443, 443, and 80.

----

. Add records to your DNS server for the cluster API and apps over the load balancer. For example:
+
[source,dns]
----
<load_balancer_ip_address> api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
<load_balancer_ip_address> apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
----

. From a command line, use `curl` to verify that the external load balancer and DNS configuration are operational. 

.. Verify that the cluster API is accessible:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl https://<loadbalancer_ip_address>:6443/version --insecure
----
+
If the configuration is correct, you receive a JSON object in response:
