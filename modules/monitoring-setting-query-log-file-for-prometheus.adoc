= Enabling the query log file for Prometheus

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure Prometheus to write all queries that have been run by the engine to a log file.
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
You can do so for default platform monitoring and for user-defined workload monitoring.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because log rotation is not supported, only enable this feature temporarily when you need to troubleshoot an issue. After you finish troubleshooting, disable query logging by reverting the changes you made to the `ConfigMap` object to enable the feature.
====

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* *If you are enabling the query log file feature for Prometheus in the `openshift-monitoring` project*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are enabling the query log file feature for Prometheus in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* The `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap object exists. This object is created by default when the cluster is created.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
** *To set the query log file for Prometheus in the `openshift-monitoring` project*:
. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----
+
. Add `queryLogFile: <path>` for `prometheusK8s` under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      queryLogFile: <path> <1>
----
<1> The full path to the file in which queries will be logged.
+
. Save the file to apply the changes.
+
[WARNING]
====
When you save changes to a monitoring config map, pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
====
+
. Verify that the pods for the component are running. The following sample command lists the status of pods in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring get pods
----
+
. Read the query log:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring exec prometheus-k8s-0 -- cat <path>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Revert the setting in the config map after you have examined the logged query information.

[NOTE]

Configurations applied to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object are not activated unless a cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
