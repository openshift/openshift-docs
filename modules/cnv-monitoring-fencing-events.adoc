= Monitoring fencing events

If a node is unhealthy for longer than 5 minutes, and the node is permitted to be 
fenced, the `MachineHealthCheck` controller drains and then deletes the node. 

Monitor the fencing event by observing the events in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace. 

.Procedure

* List the events in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace that involve `Machine` objects:
+
----
$ oc get events -n openshift-machine-api --field-selector involvedObject.kind=Machine
----

The events will report when the unhealthy node is queued for remediation, drained, and deleted.
