= Applying objects in the management cluster

After the mirroring process is complete, you need to apply two objects in the management cluster:

* `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) or `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS)
* Catalog sources

When you use the `oc-mirror` tool, the output artifacts are in a folder named `oc-mirror-workspace/results-XXXXXX/`.

The ICSP or IDMS initiates a `MachineConfig` change that does not restart your nodes but restarts the kubelet on each of them. After the nodes are marked as `READY`, you need to apply the newly generated catalog sources.

The catalog sources initiate actions in the `openshift-marketplace` Operator, such as downloading the catalog image and processing it to retrieve all the `PackageManifests` that are included in that image.

.Procedure

. To check the new sources, run the following command by using the new `CatalogSource` as a source:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get packagemanifest
----

. To apply the artifacts, complete the following steps:

.. Create the ICSP or IDMS artifacts by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f oc-mirror-workspace/results-XXXXXX/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----

.. Wait for the nodes to become ready, and then enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f catalogSource-XXXXXXXX-index.yaml
----

. Mirror the OLM catalogs and configure the hosted cluster to point to the mirror.
+
When you use the `management` (default) OLMCatalogPlacement mode, the image stream that is used for OLM catalogs is not automatically amended with override information from the ICSP on the management cluster.
+
.. If the OLM catalogs are properly mirrored to an internal registry by using the original name and tag, add the `hypershift.openshift.io/olm-catalogs-is-registry-overrides` annotation to the `HostedCluster` resource. The format is `"sr1=dr1,sr2=dr2"`, where the source registry string is a key and the destination registry is a value.

.. To bypass the OLM catalog image stream mechanism, use the following four annotations on the `HostedCluster` resource to directly specify the addresses of the four images to use for OLM Operator catalogs:

** `hypershift.openshift.io/certified-operators-catalog-image`
** `hypershift.openshift.io/community-operators-catalog-image`
** `hypershift.openshift.io/redhat-marketplace-catalog-image`
** `hypershift.openshift.io/redhat-operators-catalog-image`

In this case, the image stream is not created, and you must update the value of the annotations when the internal mirror is refreshed to pull in Operator updates.
