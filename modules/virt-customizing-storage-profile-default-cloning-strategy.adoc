= Setting a default cloning strategy by using a storage profile

[role="_abstract"]
You can use storage profiles to set a default cloning method for a storage class by creating a cloning strategy. This can be helpful, for example, if your storage vendor supports only certain cloning methods. It also allows you to select a method that limits resource usage or maximizes performance.

Cloning strategies are specified by setting the `cloneStrategy` attribute in a storage profile to one of the following values:

* `snapshot` is used by default when snapshots are configured. The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) will use the snapshot method if it recognizes the storage provider and the provider supports Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots. This cloning strategy uses a temporary volume snapshot to clone the volume.
* `copy` uses a source pod and a target pod to copy data from the source volume to the target volume. Host-assisted cloning is the least efficient method of cloning.
* `csi-clone` uses the CSI clone API to efficiently clone an existing volume without using an interim volume snapshot. Unlike `snapshot` or `copy`, which are used by default if no storage profile is defined, CSI volume cloning is only used when you specify it in the `StorageProfile` object for the provisioner's storage class.

[NOTE]
====
You can set clone strategies using the CLI without modifying the default `claimPropertySets` in your YAML `spec` section.

Example storage profile:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: StorageProfile
metadata:
  name: <provisioner_class>
# ...
spec:
  claimPropertySets:
  - accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce <1>
    volumeMode:  Filesystem <2>
  cloneStrategy: csi-clone <3>
status:
  provisioner: <provisioner>
  storageClass: <provisioner_class>
----
<1> Specify the `accessModes`.
<2> Specify the `volumeMode`.
<3> Specify the default `cloneStrategy`.
