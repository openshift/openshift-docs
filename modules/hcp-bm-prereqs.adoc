= Prerequisites to configure a management cluster

* You need the {mce} 2.2 and later installed on an {product-title} cluster. You can install {mce-short} as an Operator from the {product-title} OperatorHub.

* The {mce-short} must have at least one managed {product-title} cluster. The `local-cluster` is automatically imported in {mce-short} 2.2 and later. For more information about the `local-cluster`, see _Advanced configuration_ in the Red{nbsp}Hat Advanced Cluster Management documentation. You can check the status of your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedclusters local-cluster
----

* You must add the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` label to your bare metal hosts on your management cluster. Otherwise, all of the hosted control plane pods are scheduled on a single node, causing single point of failure.

* To provision {hcp} on bare metal, you can use the Agent platform. The Agent platform uses the central infrastructure management service to add worker nodes to a hosted cluster. For more information, see _Enabling the central infrastructure management service_.

* You need to install the hosted control plane command line interface.
