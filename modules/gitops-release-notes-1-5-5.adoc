== New features

The current release adds the following improvements:

* With this update, the bundled Argo CD has been updated to version 2.3.7.

[id="fixed-issues-1-5-5_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

The following issues have been resolved in the current release:

* Before this update, the `redis-ha-haproxy` pods of an ArgoCD instance failed when more restrictive SCCs were present in the cluster. This update fixes the issue by updating the security context in workloads. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-2034[GITOPS-2034]

[id="known-issues-1-5-5_{context}"]
== Known issues

*  {gitops-title} Operator can use RHSSO (KeyCloak) with OIDC and Dex. However, with a recent security fix applied, the Operator cannot validate the RHSSO certificate in some scenarios. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-2214[GITOPS-2214]
+
As a workaround, disable TLS validation for the OIDC (Keycloak/RHSSO) endpoint in the ArgoCD specification.
