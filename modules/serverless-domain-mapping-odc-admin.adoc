= Mapping a custom domain to a service by using the Administrator perspective

If you have cluster administrator permissions, you can create a `DomainMapping` custom resource (CR) by using the *Administrator* perspective in the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the web console.
* You are in the *Administrator* perspective.
* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName}.
* You have installed Knative Serving.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* You have created a Knative service and control a custom domain that you want to map to that service.
+
[NOTE]
====
Your custom domain must point to the IP address of the {product-title} cluster.
====

.Procedure

. Navigate to *CustomResourceDefinitions* and use the search box to find the *DomainMapping* custom resource definition (CRD).

. Click the *DomainMapping* CRD, then navigate to the *Instances* tab.

. Click *Create DomainMapping*.

. Modify the YAML for the `DomainMapping` CR so that it includes the following information for your instance:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: DomainMapping
metadata:
 name: <domain_name> <1>
 namespace: <namespace> <2>
spec:
 ref:
   name: <target_name> <3>
   kind: <target_type> <4>
   apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
----
<1> The custom domain name that you want to map to the target CR.
<2> The namespace of both the `DomainMapping` CR and the target CR.
<3> The name of the target CR to map to the custom domain.
<4> The type of CR being mapped to the custom domain.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: DomainMapping
metadata:
 name: custom-ksvc-domain.example.com
 namespace: default
spec:
 ref:
   name: example-service
   kind: Service
   apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1

.Verification

* Access the custom domain by using a `curl` request. For example:
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl custom-ksvc-domain.example.com

.Example output
[source,terminal]
