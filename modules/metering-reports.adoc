= Reports

The Report custom resource is used to manage the execution and status of reports.
Metering produces reports derived from usage data sources, which can be used in further analysis and filtering.

A single Report resource represents a job that manages a database table and updates it with new information according to a schedule. The Report exposes the data in that table via the reporting-operator HTTP API.
Reports with a `spec.schedule` field set are always running and track what time periods it has collected data for. This ensures that if metering is shutdown or unavailable for an extended period of time, it will backfill the data starting where it left off.
If the schedule is unset, then the Report will run once for the time specified by the `reportingStart` and `reportingEnd`.
By default, reports wait for ReportDataSources to have fully imported any data covered in the reporting period.
If the Report has a schedule, it will wait to run until the data in the period currently being processed has finished importing.

ReportQueries with the `-raw` suffix are used by other ReportQueries to build more complex queries, and should not be used directly for reports.

`namespace-` prefixed queries aggregate Pod CPU/memory requests by namespace, providing a list of namespaces and their overall usage based on resource requests.

`pod-` prefixed queries are similar to `namespace-` prefixed queries but aggregate information by Pod rather than namespace. These queries include the Pod's namespace and node.

`node-` prefixed queries return information about each node's total available resources.

`aws-` prefixed queries are specific to AWS. Queries suffixed with `-aws` return the same data as queries of the same name without the suffix, and correlate usage with the EC2 billing data.

The `aws-ec2-billing-data` report is used by other queries, and should not be used as a standalone report. The `aws-ec2-cluster-cost` report provides a total cost based on the nodes included in the cluster, and the sum of their costs for the time period being reported on.

For a complete list of fields, use the `oc` CLI to get the ReportQuery as YAML, and check the `spec.columns` field:

For example, run:

----
$ oc -n openshift-metering get reportqueries namespace-memory-request -o yaml
----

You should see output like:

----
apiVersion: metering.openshift.io/v1
kind: ReportQuery

  name: namespace-memory-request
  labels:
    operator-metering: "true"
spec:

[id="metering-schedule_{context}"]
== schedule

The `spec.schedule` configuration block defines when the report runs.
The main fields in the `schedule` section are `period`, and then depending on the value of `period`, the fields `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, and `monthly` allow you to fine-tune when the report runs.

For example, if `period` is set to `weekly`, you can add a `weekly` field to the `spec.schedule` block.
The following example will run once a week on Wednesday, at 1 PM (hour 13 in the day).

----
...
  schedule:
    period: "weekly"
    weekly:
      dayOfWeek: "wednesday"
      hour: 13
...
----

[id="metering-period_{context}"]
=== period

Valid values of `schedule.period` are listed below, and the options available to set for a given period are also listed.

* `hourly`
** `minute`
** `second`
* `daily`
** `hour`
** `minute`
** `second`
* `weekly`
** `dayOfWeek`
** `hour`
** `minute`
** `second`
* `monthly`
** `dayOfMonth`
** `hour`
** `minute`
** `second`
* `cron`
** `expression`

Generally, the `hour`, `minute`, `second` fields control when in the day the report runs, and `dayOfWeek`/`dayOfMonth` control what day of the week, or day of month the report runs on, if it is a weekly or monthly report period.

For each of these fields, there is a range of valid values:

* `hour` is an integer value between 0-23.
* `minute` is an integer value between 0-59.
* `second` is an integer value between 0-59.
* `dayOfWeek` is a string value that expects the day of the week (spelled out).
* `dayOfMonth` is an integer value between 1-31.

For cron periods, normal cron expressions are valid:

* `expression: "*/5 * * * *"`

[id="metering-reportingStart_{context}"]
== reportingStart

To support running a Report against existing data, you can set the `spec.reportingStart` field to a link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8[RFC3339 timestamp] to tell the Report to run according to its `schedule` starting from `reportingStart` rather than the current time.
One important thing to understand is that this will result in the reporting-operator running many queries in succession for each interval in the schedule that is between the `reportingStart` time and the current time.
This could be thousands of queries if the period is less than daily and the `reportingStart` is more than a few months back.
If `reportingStart` is left unset, the Report will run at the next full reportingPeriod after the time the report is created.

As an example of how to use this field, if you had data already collected dating back to January 1st, 2019, which you wanted to be included in your Report, you could create a report with the following values:

----
apiVersion: metering.openshift.io/v1
kind: Report
metadata:
  name: pod-cpu-request-hourly
spec:
  query: "pod-cpu-request"
  schedule:
    period: "hourly"
  reportingStart: "2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"
----

[id="metering-reportingEnd_{context}"]
== reportingEnd

To configure a Report to only run until a specified time, you can set the `spec.reportingEnd` field to an link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8[RFC3339 timestamp].
The value of this field will cause the Report to stop running on its schedule after it has finished generating reporting data for the period covered from its start time until `reportingEnd`.
Because a schedule will most likely not align with reportingEnd, the last period in the schedule will be shortened to end at the specified reportingEnd time.
If left unset, then the Report will run forever, or until a `reportingEnd` is set on the Report.

For example, if you wanted to create a report that runs once a week for the month of July:

----
apiVersion: metering.openshift.io/v1
kind: Report
metadata:
  name: pod-cpu-request-hourly
spec:
  query: "pod-cpu-request"
  schedule:
    period: "weekly"
  reportingStart: "2019-07-01T00:00:00Z"
  reportingEnd: "2019-07-31T00:00:00Z"
----

[id="metering-runImmediately_{context}"]
== runImmediately

Set `spec.runImmediately` to `true` to run the report immediately with all available data, regardless of the `reportingStart` or `reportingEnd` values, and without checking if there is any data for the report period.
For reports with a schedule set, it will not wait for each period's reportingEnd to elapse before processing and all reportPeriods between `reportingStart` and `reportingEnd`.

[id="metering-inputs_{context}"]
== inputs

The `spec.inputs` field of a Report can be used to override or set values defined in a ReportQuery's `spec.inputs` field.

It is a list of name-value pairs:

----
spec:
  inputs:
  - name: "NamespaceCPUUsageReportName"
    value: "namespace-cpu-usage-hourly"
----

The `name` of an input must exist in the ReportQuery's `inputs` list.
The `value` of the input must be the correct type for the input's `type`.

[id="metering-roll-up-reports_{context}"]
== Roll-up Reports

Report data is stored in the database much like metrics themselves, and therefore, can be used in aggregated or roll-up reports.
A simple use case for a roll-up report is to spread the time required to produce a report over a longer period of time; instead of: requiring a monthly report to query and add all data over an entire month, the task can be split into daily reports that each run over a thirtieth of the data.

A custom roll-up report requires a custom report query.
The ReportQuery template processor provides a function: `reportTableName` that can get the necessary table name from a Report's `metadata.name`.

Below is an snippet taken from a built-in query:

----
# Taken from pod-cpu.yaml
spec:
...
  inputs:
  - name: ReportingStart
    type: time
  - name: ReportingEnd
    type: time
  - name: NamespaceCPUUsageReportName
    type: Report
  - name: PodCpuUsageRawDataSourceName
    type: ReportDataSource
    default: pod-cpu-usage-raw
...

  query: |
...
    {|- if .Report.Inputs.NamespaceCPUUsageReportName |}
      namespace,
      sum(pod_usage_cpu_core_seconds) as pod_usage_cpu_core_seconds
    FROM {| .Report.Inputs.NamespaceCPUUsageReportName | reportTableName |}
...
----

----
# aggregated-report.yaml
spec:
  query: "namespace-cpu-usage"
  inputs:
  - name: "NamespaceCPUUsageReportName"
    value: "namespace-cpu-usage-hourly"
----

// TODO(chance): replace the comment below with an include on the modules/metering-rollup-report.adoc
// For more information on setting up a roll-up report, see the [roll-up report guide](rollup-reports.md).

[id="metering-report-status_{context}"]
=== Report Status

The execution of a scheduled report can be tracked using its status field. Any errors occurring during the preparation of a report will be recorded here.

The `status` field of a Report currently has two fields:

* `conditions`: Conditions is a list of conditions, each of which have a `type`, `status`, `reason`, and `message` field. Possible values of a condition's `type` field are `Running` and `Failure`, indicating the current state of the scheduled report. The `reason` indicates why its `condition` is in its current state with the `status` being either `true`, `false` or, `unknown`. The `message` provides a human readable indicating why the condition is in the current state. For detailed information on the `reason` values see link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-metering/blob/master/pkg/apis/metering/v1/util/report_util.go#L10[`pkg/apis/metering/v1/util/report_util.go`].
* `lastReportTime`: Indicates the time Metering has collected data up to.
