= Engineering considerations for the RAN DU use model

The RAN DU use model configures an {product-title} cluster running on commodity hardware for hosting RAN distributed unit (DU) workloads.
Model and system level considerations are described below.
Specific limits, requirements and engineering considerations for individual components are detailed in later sections.

[NOTE]
====
For details of the RAN DU KPI test results, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7107302[Telco RAN DU reference design specification KPI test results for OpenShift {product-version}].
This information is only available to customers and partners.
====

Workloads::
* DU workloads are described in "Telco RAN DU application workloads".
* DU worker nodes are Intel 3rd Generation Xeon (IceLake) 2.20 GHz or better with host firmware tuned for maximum performance.

Resources::
The maximum number of running pods in the system, inclusive of application workload and {product-title} pods, is 120.

Resource utilization::
+
--
{product-title} resource utilization varies depending on many factors such as the following application workload characteristics:

* Pod count
* Type and frequency of probes
* Messaging rates on the primary or secondary CNI with kernel networking
* API access rate
* Logging rates
* Storage IOPS

Resource utilization is measured for clusters configured as follows:

. The cluster is a single host with {sno} installed.
. The cluster runs the representative application workload described in "Reference application workload characteristics".
. The cluster is managed under the constraints detailed in "Hub cluster management characteristics".
. Components noted as "optional" in the use model configuration are not included.

[NOTE]
====
Configuration outside the scope of the RAN DU RDS that do not meet these criteria requires additional analysis to determine the impact on resource utilization and ability to meet KPI targets.
You might need to allocate additional cluster resources to meet these requirements.
====

Reference application workload characteristics::
. Uses 15 pods and 30 containers for the vRAN application including its management and control functions
. Uses an average of 2 `ConfigMap` and 4 `Secret` CRs per pod
. Uses a maximum of 10 exec probes with a frequency of not less than 10 seconds
. Incremental application load on the kube-apiserver is less than or equal to 10% of the cluster platform usage
+
[NOTE]
====
You can extract CPU load can from the platform metrics.
For example:
[source,terminal]
----
$ query=avg_over_time(pod:container_cpu_usage:sum{namespace="openshift-kube-apiserver"}[30m])
----
====
. Application logs are not collected by the platform log collector
. Aggregate traffic on the primary CNI is less than 8 MBps

Hub cluster management characteristics::
+
--
{rh-rhacm}  is the recommended cluster management solution and is configured to these limits:

. Use a maximum of 5 {rh-rhacm} configuration policies with a compliant evaluation interval of not less than 10 minutes.
. Use a minimal number (up to 10) of managed cluster templates in cluster policies.
Use hub-side templating.
. Disable {rh-rhacm} addons with the exception of the `policyController` and configure observability with the default configuration.

The following table describes resource utilization under reference application load.

|OpenShift platform CPU usage
|Less than 4000mc â€“ 2 cores (4HT)
|Platform CPU is pinned to reserved cores, including both hyper-threads of each reserved core.
The system is engineered to 3 CPUs (3000mc) at steady-state to allow for periodic system tasks and spikes.

|OpenShift Platform memory
|Less than 16G
