= Scaling worker nodes


Worker nodes can be scaled manually if you do not want to configure node autoscaling.

.Procedure

. To get a list of the machine pools in a cluster, enter the following command. Each cluster has a default machine pool that is created when you create a cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list machinepools --cluster=<cluster_name>
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
ID        AUTOSCALING   REPLICAS    INSTANCE TYPE  LABELS    TAINTS   AVAILABILITY ZONES
default   No            2           m5.xlarge                        us-east-1a
mp1       No            2           m5.xlarge                        us-east-1a
----

. Review the output from the `rosa list machinepools` command to find the ID of the machine pool you want to scale and see the current number of replicas.

. To change the scale, enter the following command and increase or decrease the number of replicas:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa edit machinepool --cluster=<cluster_name> --replicas=<number_worker_nodes> <machinepool_ID>
----

. To verify that the change has taken effect, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe cluster --cluster=<cluster_name>
----
+
The response output shows the number of worker nodes, or replicas, as `Compute` nodes.

. Optional: To view this change in the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[OCM console]:
.. Select the cluster.
.. From the *Overview* tab, in the `Details` pane, review the `Compute` node number.
