= Deploying the {DTShortName} streaming strategy from the web console

The `streaming` deployment strategy is intended for production environments that require a more scalable and highly available architecture, and where long-term storage of trace data is important.

The `streaming` strategy provides a streaming capability that sits between the Collector and the Elasticsearch storage. This reduces the pressure on the storage under high load situations, and enables other trace post-processing capabilities to tap into the real-time span data in  directly from the Kafka streaming platform.

[NOTE]
====
The streaming strategy requires an additional Red Hat subscription for AMQ Streams. If you do not have an AMQ Streams subscription, contact your sales representative for more information.
====

[NOTE]
====
The streaming deployment strategy is currently unsupported on IBM Z.
====

.Prerequisites

* The AMQ Streams Operator has been installed. If using version 1.4.0 or higher you can use self-provisioning. Otherwise you must create the Kafka instance.
* The {JaegerName} Operator has been installed.
* You have reviewed the instructions for how to customize the deployment.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Create a new project, for example `tracing-system`.

+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing as part of Service Mesh, the {DTShortName} resources must be installed in the same namespace as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, for example `istio-system`.

.. Navigate to *Home* -> *Projects*.

.. Click *Create Project*.

.. Enter `tracing-system` in the *Name* field.

.. Click *Create*.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. If necessary, select `tracing-system` from the *Project* menu. You may have to wait a few moments for the Operators to be copied to the new project.

. Click the {JaegerName} Operator. On the *Overview* tab, under *Provided APIs*, the Operator provides a single link.

. Under *Jaeger*, click *Create Instance*.

. On the *Create Jaeger* page, replace the default `all-in-one` YAML text with your streaming YAML configuration, for example:

. Click *Create* to create the {JaegerShortName} instance.

. On the *Jaegers* page, click the name of the {JaegerShortName} instance, for example, `jaeger-streaming`.

. On the *Jaeger Details* page, click the *Resources* tab. Wait until all the pods have a status of "Running" before continuing.

== Deploying the {DTShortName} streaming strategy from the CLI

Follow this procedure to create an instance of {JaegerShortName} from the command line.

.Prerequisites

* The AMQ Streams Operator has been installed. If using version 1.4.0 or higher you can use self-provisioning. Otherwise you must create the Kafka instance.
* The {JaegerName} Operator has been installed.
* You have reviewed the instructions for how to customize the deployment.
* You have access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) that matches your {product-title} version.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login https://<HOSTNAME>:8443
----

. Create a new project named `tracing-system`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project tracing-system
----

. Create a custom resource file named `jaeger-streaming.yaml` that contains the text of the example file in the previous procedure.

. Run the following command to deploy Jaeger:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n tracing-system -f jaeger-streaming.yaml
----
+
. Run the following command to watch the progress of the pods during the installation process:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n tracing-system -w
----
+
After the installation process has completed, you should see output similar to the following example:
