= Using GitLab webhooks

GitLab webhooks handle the call made by GitLab when a repository is updated. As with the GitHub triggers, you must specify a secret. The following example is a trigger definition YAML within the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
type: "GitLab"
gitlab:
  secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
----

The payload URL is returned as the GitLab Webhook URL by the `oc describe` command, and is structured as follows:

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/gitlab
----

.Procedure

. Configure a GitLab Webhook.

.. Get the webhook URL by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe bc <name>
----

.. Copy the webhook URL, replacing `<secret>` with your secret value.

.. Follow the link:https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#webhooks[GitLab setup instructions]
to paste the webhook URL into your GitLab repository settings.

. Given a file containing a valid JSON payload, such as `payload.json`, you can
manually trigger the webhook with the following `curl` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -H "X-GitLab-Event: Push Hook" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/gitlab
----
+
The `-k` argument is only necessary if your API server does not have a properly
signed certificate.
