= Finding the load balancer IP of the load balancer in your cluster

[role="_abstract"]
When you create a cluster, the service creates a load balancer and generates a load balancer IP for that load balancer. We need to know the load balancer IP in order to create DNS records for our cluster.

You can find the load balancer IP by running the `oc get svc` command against the `openshift-ingress` namespace. The load balancer IP of the load balancer is the `EXTERNAL-IP` associated with the `router-default` service in the `openshift-ingress` namespace.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get svc -n openshift-ingress
NAME            TYPE          CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP        PORT(S)                     AGE
router-default  LoadBalancer  172.30.237.88  34.85.169.230      80:31175/TCP,443:31554/TCP  76d
----

In our case, the load balancer IP is `34.85.169.230`.

Save this value for later, as we will need it to configure DNS records for our new component route hostnames.
