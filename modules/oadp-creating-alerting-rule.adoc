= Creating an alerting rule

The {product-title} monitoring stack allows to receive Alerts configured using Alerting Rules. To create an Alerting rule for the OADP project, use one of the Metrics which are scraped with the user workload monitoring.

.Procedure

. Create a `PrometheusRule` YAML file with the sample `OADPBackupFailing` alert and save it as `4_create_oadp_alert_rule.yaml`.

.Sample `OADPBackupFailing` alert
[source,yaml]
+
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: sample-oadp-alert
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  groups:
  - name: sample-oadp-backup-alert
    rules:
    - alert: OADPBackupFailing
      annotations:
        description: 'OADP had {{$value | humanize}} backup failures over the last 2 hours.'
        summary: OADP has issues creating backups
      expr: |
        increase(velero_backup_failure_total{job="openshift-adp-velero-metrics-svc"}[2h]) > 0
      for: 5m
      labels:
        severity: warning
----
+
In this sample, the Alert displays under the following conditions:
+
* There is an increase of new failing backups during the 2 last hours that is greater than 0 and the state persists for at least 5 minutes.
* If the time of the first increase is less than 5 minutes, the Alert will be in a `Pending` state, after which it will turn into a `Firing` state.
+
. Apply the `4_create_oadp_alert_rule.yaml` file, which creates the `PrometheusRule` object in the `openshift-adp` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f 4_create_oadp_alert_rule.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
prometheusrule.monitoring.coreos.com/sample-oadp-alert created
----

.Verification
* After the Alert is triggered, you can view it in the following ways:
** In the *Developer* perspective, select the *Observe* menu.
** In the *Administrator* perspective under the *Observe* -> *Alerting* menu, select *User* in the *Filter* box. Otherwise, by default only the *Platform* Alerts are displayed.
