= Creating an alerting rule

[role="_abstract"]
The {product-title} monitoring stack receives Alerts configured by using Alerting Rules. To create an Alerting rule for the {oadp-short} project, use one of the Metrics scraped with the user workload monitoring.

.Procedure

. Create a `PrometheusRule` YAML file with the sample `OADPBackupFailing` alert and save it as `4_create_oadp_alert_rule.yaml`:
+
.Sample `OADPBackupFailing` alert
[source,yaml]
+
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: sample-oadp-alert
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  groups:
  - name: sample-oadp-backup-alert
    rules:
    - alert: OADPBackupFailing
      annotations:
        description: 'OADP had {{$value | humanize}} backup failures over the last 2 hours.'
        summary: OADP has issues creating backups
      expr: |
        increase(velero_backup_failure_total{job="openshift-adp-velero-metrics-svc"}[2h]) > 0
      for: 5m
      labels:
        severity: warning
----
+
In this sample, the Alert displays under the following conditions:
+
* During the last 2 hours, the number of new failing backups was greater than 0 and the state persisted for at least 5 minutes.
* If the time of the first increase is less than 5 minutes, the Alert is in a `Pending` state, after which it turns into a `Firing` state.

. Apply the `4_create_oadp_alert_rule.yaml` file, which creates the `PrometheusRule` object in the `openshift-adp` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f 4_create_oadp_alert_rule.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
prometheusrule.monitoring.coreos.com/sample-oadp-alert created
----

.Verification

* After the Alert is triggered, you can view it in the following ways:
** In the *Developer* perspective, select the *Observe* menu.
** In the *Administrator* perspective under the *Observe* -> *Alerting* menu, select *User* in the *Filter* box. Otherwise, by default only the *Platform* Alerts are displayed.
