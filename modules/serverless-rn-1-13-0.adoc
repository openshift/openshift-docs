= Release Notes for Red Hat {ServerlessProductName} 1.13.0

[id="new-features-1-13-0_{context}"]
== New features

* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving 0.19.0.
* {ServerlessProductName} uses Knative Eventing 0.19.2.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Kourier 0.19.0.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative `kn` CLI 0.19.1.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Kafka 0.19.1.
* A `DomainMapping` custom resource (CR) has been added to {ServerlessProductName} to enable users to map a custom domain name to a Knative Service. See the Knative documentation on https://knative.dev/docs/serving/creating-domain-mappings/[Creating a mapping between a custom domain name and a Knative Service].
* In Knative Serving 0.19.0, `v1alpha1` and `v1beta1` versions of the `Service`, `Route`, `Configuration`, and `Revision` resources have been removed. The {ServerlessOperatorName} automatically upgrades older resources to `v1`, so no user action is required.

[NOTE]
====
New resources must not be created as `v1alpha1` or `v1beta1` versions, since this can cause errors and these resources will not be upgraded automatically.
