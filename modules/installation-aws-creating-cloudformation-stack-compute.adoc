= Creating the CloudFormation stack for compute machines

You can create a stack of {aws-short} resources for the compute machines by using the CloudFormation template that was previously shared.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you use the CloudFormation template for the control plane machines, the template provisions all three control plane machines with a single stack; however, when you use the CloudFormation template to deploy the compute machines, you must create the number of stacks based on the number that you defined in the `install-config.yaml` file. Each stack is provisioned once for each machine. To provision a new compute machine, you must change the stack name.
====

.Procedure
* To create the CloudFormation stack for compute machines, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name <name> \// <1>
     --template-body file://<template>.yaml \// <2>
     --parameters file://<parameters>.json <3>
----
<1> Specify the `<name>` with the name for the CloudFormation stack, such as `cluster-worker-1`. You need the name of this stack if you remove the cluster.
<2> Specify the relative path and the name of the CloudFormation template YAML file that you saved.
<3> Specify the relative path and the name of the JSON file for the CloudFormation parameters.
