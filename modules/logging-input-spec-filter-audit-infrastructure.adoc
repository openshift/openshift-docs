= Filtering the audit and infrastructure log inputs by source

You can define the list of `audit` and `infrastructure` sources to collect the logs by using the `input` selector.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {clo}.
* You have administrator permissions.
* You have created a `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

. Add a configuration to define the `audit` and `infrastructure` sources in the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR.

+
The following example shows how to configure the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR to define `aduit` and `infrastructure` sources:

.Example `ClusterLogForwarder` CR

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
# ...
spec:
  inputs:
    - name: mylogs1
      infrastructure:
        sources: # <1>
          - node
    - name: mylogs2
      audit:
        sources: # <2>
          - kubeAPI
          - openshiftAPI
          - ovn
# ...
----
<1> Specifies the list of infrastructure sources to collect. The valid sources include:
** `node`: Journal log from the node
** `container`: Logs from the workloads deployed in the namespaces
<2> Specifies the list of audit sources to collect. The valid sources include:
** `kubeAPI`: Logs from the Kubernetes API servers
** `openshiftAPI`: Logs from the OpenShift API servers
** `auditd`: Logs from a node auditd service
** `ovn`: Logs from an open virtual network service

. Apply the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR by running the following command:
