= Deleting a RolloutManager custom resource

Uninstalling the {gitops-title} Operator does not remove the resources that were created during installation. You must manually delete the `RolloutManager` custom resource (CR) before you uninstall the {gitops-title} Operator.

.Prerequisites

* {gitops-title} 1.9.0 or a newer version is installed in your cluster.
* A `RolloutManager` CR exists in your namespace.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a cluster administrator.

. In the *Administrator* perspective, click *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the *Project* drop-down menu and select the project that contains the `RolloutManager` CR.

. Select *OpenShift GitOps Operator* from the installed operators.

. Click the *RolloutManager* tab to find RolloutManager instances under the *RolloutManagers* section.

. Click the instance.

. Click *Actions* -> *Delete RolloutManager* from the drop-down menu, and click *Delete* to confirm in the dialog box.

. In the *RolloutManager* tab, under the *RolloutManagers* section, verify that the RolloutManager instance is not available anymore.

. In the left navigation pane, verify the deletion of the namespace-scoped supporting resources:
+
* Click *Workloads* -> *Deployments* to verify that the `argo-rollouts` deployment is deleted.
* Click *Workloads* -> *Secrets* to verify that the `argo-rollouts-notification-secret` secret is deleted.
* Click *Networking* -> *Services* to verify that the `argo-rollouts-metrics` service is deleted.
* Click *User Management* -> *Roles* to verify that the `argo-rollouts` role and `argo-rollouts-aggregate-to-admin`, `argo-rollouts-aggregate-to-edit`, and `argo-rollouts-aggregate-to-view` cluster roles are deleted.
* Click *User Management* -> *RoleBindings* to verify that the `argo-rollouts` role binding is deleted.
