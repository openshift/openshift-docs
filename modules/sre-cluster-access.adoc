clusters is controlled through several layers of required authentication, all of which are managed by strict company policy. All authentication attempts to access a cluster, as well as changes made within a cluster, are recorded within audit logs, along with the specific account identity of the SRE responsible for those actions. These audit logs help ensure that all changes made by SREs to a customer's cluster adhere to the strict policies and procedures that make up Red Hat's managed services guidelines.

The information presented below is an overview of the process an SRE must perform to access a customer's cluster.

** SRE requests a refreshed ID token from the Red Hat SSO (Cloud Services). This request is authenticated. The token is valid for fifteen minutes. After the token expires, you can refresh the token again and receive a new token. The ability to refresh to a new token is indefinite; however, the ability to refresh to a new token is revoked after 30 days of inactivity.

** SRE connects to the Red Hat VPN. The authentication to the VPN is completed by the Red Hat Corporate Identity and Access Management system (RH IAM). With RH IAM, SREs can be managed internally per organization via groups and existing on-boarding/off-boarding processes, and is multi-factor. After an SRE is authenticated and connected, the SRE can access the cloud services fleet management plane. Changes to the cloud services fleet management plane require many layers of approval and are maintained by strict company policy.

** After authorization is complete, the SRE logs into the fleet management plane and receives a service account token that the fleet management plane created. The token is valid for 15 minutes. After the token is no longer valid, it is deleted.

** With access granted to the fleet management plane, SRE uses various methods to access clusters, depending on network configuration.

*** Accessing a private or public cluster: Request is sent through a specific Network Load Balancer (NLB) by using an encrypted HTTP connection on port 6443.

*** Accessing a PrivateLink cluster: Request is sent to the Red Hat Transit Gateway, which then connects to a Red Hat VPC per region. The VPC that receives the request will be dependent on the target private cluster’s region. Within the VPC, there is a private subnet which contains the PrivateLink endpoint to the customer’s PrivateLink cluster.
