= Installing the policy resources into the cluster

Mirroring the {product-title} content using the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin creates resources, which include `catalogSource-certified-operator-index.yaml` and `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml`.

* The `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource associates the mirror registry with the source registry and redirects image pull requests from the online registries to the mirror registry.
* The `CatalogSource` resource is used by {olmv0-first} to retrieve information about the available Operators in the mirror registry, which lets users discover and install Operators.
+
[NOTE]
====
{olmv1} uses the `ClusterCatalog` resource to retrieve information about the available cluster extensions in the mirror registry.

The oc-mirror plugin v1 does not generate `ClusterCatalog` resources automatically; you must manually create them. The oc-mirror plugin v2 does, however, generate `ClusterCatalog` resources automatically.

For more information on creating and applying `ClusterCatalog` resources, see "Adding a catalog to a cluster" in "Extensions".
====

After you install the cluster, you must install these resources into the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have mirrored the image set to the registry mirror in the disconnected environment.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the OpenShift CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Apply the YAML files from the results directory to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ./oc-mirror-workspace/results-<id>/
----

.Verification

. Verify that the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resources were successfully installed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get imagecontentsourcepolicy
----

. Verify that the `CatalogSource` resources were successfully installed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get catalogsource --all-namespaces
