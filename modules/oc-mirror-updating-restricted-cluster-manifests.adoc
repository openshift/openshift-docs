= Installing the policy resources into the cluster

Mirroring the {product-title} content using the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin creates resources, which include `catalogSource-certified-operator-index.yaml` and `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml`.

* The `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource associates the mirror registry with the source registry and redirects image pull requests from the online registries to the mirror registry.
* The `CatalogSource` resource is used by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to retrieve information about the available Operators in the mirror registry, which lets users discover and install Operators.

After you install the cluster, you must install these resources into the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have mirrored the image set to the registry mirror in the disconnected environment.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the OpenShift CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Apply the YAML files from the results directory to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ./oc-mirror-workspace/results-<id>/
----

.Verification

. Verify that the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resources were successfully installed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get imagecontentsourcepolicy --all-namespaces
----

. Verify that the `CatalogSource` resources were successfully installed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get catalogsource --all-namespaces
----
