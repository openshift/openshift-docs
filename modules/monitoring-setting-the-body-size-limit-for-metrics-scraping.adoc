= Setting the body size limit for metrics scraping

By default, no limit is enforced on the uncompressed body size of scraped metrics targets.
You can set a body size limit to help avoid situations in which Prometheus consumes excessive amounts of memory when scraped targets return a response that contains a large amount of data.
In addition, by setting a body size limit, you can reduce the impact that a malicious target could have on Prometheus and on the cluster as a whole.

After you set a value for `enforcedBodySizeLimit`, the alert `PrometheusScrapeBodySizeLimitHit` fires when at least one Prometheus scrape target replies with a response body larger than the configured value.

[NOTE]
====
Metrics scraped from targets that respond with an uncompressed body size exceeding the configured size limit cause the scrape to fail.
The targets are considered to be down and have their `up` metric set to `0`, which could trigger the `TargetDown` alert.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Add a value for `enforcedBodySizeLimit` to `data/config.yaml/prometheusK8s` to limit the body size that can be accepted per target scrape:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |-
    prometheusK8s:
      enforcedBodySizeLimit: 40MB <1>
----
<1> Specify the maximum body size for scraped metrics targets.
This `enforcedBodySizeLimit` example limits the uncompressed size per target scrape to 40 megabytes.
Valid numeric values use the Prometheus data size format.
The default value is `0`, which specifies no limit.
You can also set the value to `automatic` to calculate the limit automatically based on cluster capacity.

. Save the file to apply the changes automatically.
+
[WARNING]
====
When you save changes to a `cluster-monitoring-config` config map, the pods and other resources in the `openshift-monitoring` project might redeploy. 
The running monitoring processes in that project might also restart.
