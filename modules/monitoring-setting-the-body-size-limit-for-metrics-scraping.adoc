= Setting the body size limit for metrics scraping

[role="_abstract"]
By default, no limit exists for the uncompressed body size for data returned from scraped metrics targets.
You can set a body size limit to help avoid situations in which Prometheus consumes excessive amounts of memory when scraped targets return a response that contains a large amount of data.

In addition, by setting a body size limit, you can reduce the impact that a malicious target might have on Prometheus and on the cluster as a whole.

After you set a value for `enforcedBodySizeLimit`, the alert `PrometheusScrapeBodySizeLimitHit` fires when at least one Prometheus scrape target replies with a response body larger than the configured value.

[NOTE]
====
If metrics data scraped from a target has an uncompressed body size exceeding the configured size limit, the scrape fails.
Prometheus then considers this target to be down and sets its `up` metric value to `0`, which can trigger the `TargetDown` alert.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Add a value for `enforcedBodySizeLimit` to `data/config.yaml/prometheusK8s` to limit the body size that can be accepted per target scrape:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |-
    prometheusK8s:
      enforcedBodySizeLimit: 40MB
----
+
where:

`enforcedBodySizeLimit`::
Defines the maximum body size for scraped metrics targets. This example limits the uncompressed size per target scrape to 40 megabytes.
+
Valid numeric values use the Prometheus data size format: B (bytes), KB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes), GB (gigabytes), TB (terabytes), PB (petabytes), and EB (exabytes).
+ 
The default value is `0`, which specifies no limit. You can also set the value to `automatic` to calculate the limit automatically based on cluster capacity.

. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.
