[id="virt-enlarging-vm-disk_{context}"]
= Enlarging a virtual machine disk

VM disk enlargement makes extra space available to the virtual machine. However, it is the responsibility of the VM owner to decide how to consume the storage.

If the disk is a `Filesystem` PVC, the matching file expands to the remaining size while reserving some space for file system overhead.

.Procedure

. Edit the `PersistentVolumeClaim` manifest of the VM disk that you want to expand:
+
[source,terminal]

----
$ oc edit pvc <pvc_name>
----

. Change the value of `spec.resource.requests.storage` attribute to a larger size.
+
[source,yaml]
