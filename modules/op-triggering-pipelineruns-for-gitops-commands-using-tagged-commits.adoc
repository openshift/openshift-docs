[role="_abstract"]
You can trigger a `PipelineRun` using a Git tag for tagged commits.

.Procedure

. Open your GitHub repository.
. Navigate to the *Tags* view or the *Releases* section.
. Select the required tag, for example `v1.0.0`, to view its associated commit.
. Click the commit SHA for the selected tag.
. In the comment field of the commit, enter a supported GitOps command, such as `/test tag:v1.0.0` or `/cancel tag:v1.0.0`.
. Verify that {pac} processes the comment and triggers or updates the corresponding `PipelineRun`.
