= Adding annotations to a function

You can add annotations to a function. Similar to a label, an annotation is defined as a key-value map. Annotations are useful, for example, for providing metadata about a function, such as the function's author.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on the cluster.
* You have installed the Knative (`kn`) CLI.
* You have created a function.

.Procedure

. Open the `func.yaml` file for your function.

. For every annotation that you want to add, add the following YAML to the `annotations` section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: test
namespace: ""
runtime: go
...
annotations:
  <annotation_name>: "<annotation_value>" <1>
----
<1> Substitute `<annotation_name>: "<annotation_value>"` with your annotation.
+
For example, to indicate that a function was authored by Alice, you might include the following annotation:
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: test
namespace: ""
runtime: go
...
annotations:
  author: "alice@example.com"
----

. Save the configuration.

The next time you deploy your function to the cluster, the annotations are added to the corresponding Knative service.
