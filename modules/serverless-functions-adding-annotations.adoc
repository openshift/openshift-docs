= Adding annotations to a function

.Procedure

. Open the `func.yaml` file for your function.

. For every annotation that you want to add, add the following YAML to the `annotations` section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: test
namespace: ""
runtime: go
...
annotations:
  <annotation_name>: "<annotation_value>" <1>
----
<1> Substitute `<annotation_name>: "<annotation_value>"` with your annotation.
+
For example, to indicate that a function was authored by Alice, you might include the following annotation:
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: test
namespace: ""
runtime: go
...
annotations:
  author: "alice@example.com"
----

. Save the configuration.

The next time you deploy your function to the cluster, the annotations are added to the corresponding Knative service.
