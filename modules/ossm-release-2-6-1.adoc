== Fixed issues

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-6766[OSSM-6766] Previously, the {SMPlugin} failed if the user wanted to update a namespace (for example, enabling or disabling injection), or create any Istio object (for example, creating traffic policies). Now, the {SMPlugin} does not fail if the user  updates a namespace or creates any Istio object.

// Removed from ossm-rn-known-issues file. ossm-rn-known-issues remains a separate file and is not part of the new OSSM release notes format where fixed issues and known issues are included in the file relating to a specific release.
