= Installing the web terminal

You can install the web terminal using the Web Terminal Operator listed in the {product-title} OperatorHub. When you install the Web Terminal Operator, the custom resource definitions (CRDs) that are required for the command line configuration, such as the `DevWorkspace` CRD, are automatically installed. The web console creates the required resources when you open the web terminal.

.Prerequisites
* Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators -> OperatorHub*.
. Use the *Filter by keyword* box to search for the `Web Terminal` Operator in the catalog, and then click the *Web Terminal* tile.
. Read the brief description about the Operator on the *Web Terminal*  page, and then click *Install*.
. On the *Install Operator* page, retain the default values for all fields.

** The *alpha* option in the *Update Channel* menu enables installation of the latest release of the Web Terminal Operator.
** The *All namespaces on the cluster* option in the *Installation Mode* menu  enables the Operator to watch and be available to all namespaces in the cluster.
** The *openshift-operators* option in the *Installed Namespace* menu installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace.
** The *Automatic* option in the *Approval Strategy* menu ensures that the future upgrades to the Operator are handled automatically by the Operator Lifecycle Manager.

. Click *Install*.
. In the *Installed Operators* page, click the *View operator* to verify that the Operator is listed on the *Installed Operators* page.
. After the Operator is installed, refresh your page to see the command line terminal icon on the upper right of the console.
