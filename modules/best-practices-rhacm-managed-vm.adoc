= Best practices when defining an {rh-rhacm}-managed VM

When creating an {rh-rhacm}-managed application that includes a VM, you must use a GitOps workflow and create an {rh-rhacm} application or `ApplicationSet` resource.

You can take several actions to improve your experience and chance of success when defining an {rh-rhacm}-managed VM.

Use a PVC and populator to define storage for the VM:: Because data volumes create persistent volume claims (PVCs) implicitly, data volumes and VMs with data volume templates do not fit as neatly into the GitOps model.

Use the import method when choosing a population source for your VM disk:: Select a {op-system-base} image from the software catalog to use the import method. Red{nbsp}Hat recommends using a specific version of the image rather than a floating tag for consistent results. The KubeVirt community maintains container disks for other operating systems in a Quay repository.

Use `pullMethod: node`:: Use the pod `pullMethod: node` when creating a data volume from a registry source to take advantage of the {product-title} pull secret, which is required to pull container images from the Red{nbsp}Hat registry.
