= Installing the {OTELName} Operator

:FeatureName: The {OTELName} Operator
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

To install {OTELName}, you use the link:https://operatorhub.io/[OperatorHub] to install the {OTELName} Operator.

By default, the Operator is installed in the `openshift-operators` project.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

[WARNING]
====
Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type *distributed tracing data collection* into the filter to locate the {OTELName} Operator.

. Click the *{OTELName} Operator* provided by Red Hat to display information about the Operator.

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page, accept the default *stable* Update channel. This automatically updates your Operator as new versions are released.

. Accept the default *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` project and makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.

. Accept the default *Automatic* approval strategy. By accepting the default, when a new version of this Operator is available, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention. If you select *Manual* updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.

[NOTE]
====
The *Manual* approval strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator install and subscription process.
====

. Click *Install*.

. Go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. On the *Installed Operators* page, select the `openshift-operators` project. Wait until you see that the {OTELName} Operator shows a status of "Succeeded" before continuing.
