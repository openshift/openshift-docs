= Adding a real-time kernel to nodes

Some {product-title} workloads require a high degree of determinism.While Linux is not a real-time operating system, the Linux real-time
kernel includes a preemptive scheduler that provides the operating system with real-time characteristics.

If your {product-title} workloads require these real-time characteristics, you can switch your machines to the Linux real-time kernel. For {product-title}, {product-version} you can make this switch using a `MachineConfig` object. Although making the change is as simple as changing a machine config `kernelType` setting to `realtime`, there are a few other considerations before making the change:

* Currently, real-time kernel is supported only on worker nodes, and only for radio access network (RAN) use.
* The following procedure is fully supported with bare metal installations that use systems that are certified for Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Real Time 8.
* Real-time support in {product-title} is limited to specific subscriptions.
* The following procedure is also supported for use with Google Cloud Platform.

.Prerequisites
* Have a running {product-title} cluster (version 4.4 or later).
* Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a machine config for the real-time kernel: Create a YAML file (for example, `99-worker-realtime.yaml`) that contains a `MachineConfig`
object for the `realtime` kernel type. This example tells the cluster to use a real-time kernel for all worker nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF > 99-worker-realtime.yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "worker"
  name: 99-worker-realtime
spec:
  kernelType: realtime
EOF
----

. Add the machine config to the cluster. Type the following to add the machine config to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f 99-worker-realtime.yaml
----

. Check the real-time kernel: Once each impacted node reboots, log in to the cluster and run the following commands to make sure that the real-time kernel has replaced the regular kernel for the set of nodes you configured:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes

The kernel name contains `rt` and text “PREEMPT RT” indicates that this is a real-time kernel.

. To go back to the regular kernel, delete the `MachineConfig` object:

$ oc delete -f 99-worker-realtime.yaml
