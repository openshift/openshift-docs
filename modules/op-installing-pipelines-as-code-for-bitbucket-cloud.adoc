= Install Pipelines-As-Code for Bitbucket Cloud

Pipelines-As-Code has a full support on Bitbucket Cloud on https://bitbucket.org

You have to first install the Pipelines-as-Code infrastructure as detailled here : Install infrastructure

You will have to generate an app password for Pipelines-as-Code Bitbucket API operations. Follow this guide to create an app password :

https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/

Make sure you note somewhere the generated token or otherwise you will have to recreate it.

Go to you "Repository setting" tab on your Repository and click on the WebHooks tab and "Add webhook" button.

Set a Title (i.e: Pipelines as Code)

Set the URL to the event listenner public URL. On OpenShift you can get the public URL of the Pipelines-as-Code eventlistenner like this :

echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code el-pipelines-as-code-interceptor -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
Refer to this screenshot on how to configure the Webhook. The individual events to select are :

Repository -> Push
Pull Request -> Created
Pull Request -> Updated
Pull Request -> Comment created
Pull Request -> Comment updated
You are now able to create a Repository CRD. The repository CRD will have a Secret and Username that contains the App Password as generated and Pipelines as Code will know how to use it for Bitbucket API operations.

First create the secret with the app password in the target-namespace :
kubectl -n target-namespace create secret generic bitbucket-app-password \
        --from-literal token="TOKEN_AS_GENERATED_PREVIOUSLY"
And now create Repositry CRD with the secret field referencing it.

Here is an example of a Repository CRD :

---
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: my-repo
  namespace: target-namespace
spec:
  url: "https://bitbucket.com/workspace/repo"
  branch: "main"
  git_provider:
    user: "yourbitbucketusername"
    secret:
      name: "bitbucket-cloud-token"
      # Set this if you have a different key in your secret
      # key: "token"



== Bitbucket Cloud Notes
git_provider.secret cannot reference a secret in another namespace, Pipelines as code assumes always it will be the same namespace as where the repository has been created.

tkn-pac create and bootstrap is not supported on Bitbucket Server.

There is no Webhook secret support in Bitbucket Cloud. To be able to secure the payload and not let a user hijack the CI, Pipelines-as-Code will fetch the ip addresses list from https://ip-ranges.atlassian.com/ and make sure the webhook only comes from the Bitbucket Cloud IPS.

If you want to add some ips address or networks you can add them to the key bitbucket-cloud-additional-source-ip in the pipelines-as-code configmap in the pipelines-as-code namespace. You can added multiple network or ips separated by a comma.

If you want to disable this behaviour you can set the key bitbucket-cloud-check-source-ip to false in the pipelines-as-code configmap in the pipelines-as-code namespace.

You can only reference user by ACCOUNT_ID in owner file, see here for the reasoning :
