= Installing platform Operators during cluster creation

As a cluster administrator, you can install platform Operators by providing `FeatureGate` and `PlatformOperator` manifests during cluster creation.

.Procedure

. Choose a platform Operator from the supported set of OLM-based Operators. For the list of this set and details on current limitations, see "Technology Preview restrictions for platform Operators".

. Select a cluster installation method and follow the instructions through creating an `install-config.yaml` file. For more details on preparing for a cluster installation, see "Selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users".

. After you have created the `install-config.yaml` file and completed any modifications to it, change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the name of the directory that contains the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster.

. Create a `FeatureGate` object YAML file in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/` directory that enables the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set, for example a `feature-gate.yaml` file:
+
.Example `feature-gate.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  annotations:
    include.release.openshift.io/self-managed-high-availability: "true"
    include.release.openshift.io/single-node-developer: "true"
    release.openshift.io/create-only: "true"
  name: cluster
spec:
  featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade <1>
----
<1> Enable the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set.

. Create a `PlatformOperator` object YAML file for your chosen platform Operator in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/` directory, for example a `service-mesh-po.yaml` file for the {SMProductName} Operator:
+
.Example `service-mesh-po.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: platform.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: PlatformOperator
metadata:
  name: service-mesh-po
spec:
  package:
    name: servicemeshoperator
----

. When you are ready to complete the cluster install, refer to your chosen installation method and continue through running the `openshift-install create cluster` command.
+
During cluster creation, your provided manifests are used to enable the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set and install your chosen platform Operator.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Failure of the platform Operator to successfully install will block the cluster installation process.
====

.Verification

. Check the status of the `service-mesh-po` platform Operator by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get platformoperator service-mesh-po -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
...
status:
  activeBundleDeployment:
    name: service-mesh-po
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-10-24T17:24:40Z"
    message: Successfully applied the service-mesh-po BundleDeployment resource
    reason: InstallSuccessful
    status: "True" <1>
    type: Installed
----
<1> Wait until the `Installed` status condition reports `True`.

. Verify that the `platform-operators-aggregated` cluster Operator is reporting an `Available=True` status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusteroperator platform-operators-aggregated -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
...
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-10-24T17:43:26Z"
    message: All platform operators are in a successful state
    reason: AsExpected
    status: "False"
    type: Progressing
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-10-24T17:43:26Z"
    status: "False"
    type: Degraded
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-10-24T17:43:26Z"
    message: All platform operators are in a successful state
    reason: AsExpected
    status: "True"
    type: Available
