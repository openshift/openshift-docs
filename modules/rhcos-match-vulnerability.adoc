= Vulnerability matching

[role="_abstract"]
Central services, which include Central and Scanner, perform vulnerability matching. Scanner uses Red{nbsp}Hat's Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) v2 security data streams to match vulnerabilities on {op-system-first} software components.

Unlike the earlier versions, {product-title-short} 4.0 no longer uses the Kubernetes node metadata to find the kernel and container runtime versions. Instead, it uses the installed {op-system} RPMs to assess that information.
