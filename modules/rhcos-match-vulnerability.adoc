= Vulnerability matching on RHCOS nodes

[role="_abstract"]
Central services, which include Central and Scanner, perform vulnerability matching. Node scanning is performed using the following scanners:

* StackRox Scanner: This is the default scanner. StackRox Scanner uses Red{nbsp}Hat's Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) v2 security data streams to match vulnerabilities on {op-system-first} software components.
* Scanner V4: Scanner V4 is available for node scanning as a Technology Preview feature. Scanner V4 must be explicitly enabled. See the documentation in "Additional resources" for more information.

When scanning {op-system} nodes, {product-title-short} releases after 4.0 no longer use the Kubernetes node metadata to find the kernel and container runtime versions. Instead, {product-title-short} uses the installed {op-system} RPMs to assess that information.
