== Fixed issues

.Operator 

Webhook validation no longer disrupts unrelated cluster components::
* Before this update, the `tekton-operator-proxy-webhook` admission webhook validated all namespaces, including control-plane namespaces (`kube-\*`, `openshift-*`). This behavior could cause webhook certificate issues to affect unrelated system components, such as the Network Operator, during namespace reconciliation. With this update, the webhook excludes control-plane namespaces from validation. This change prevents certificate issues from impacting other cluster operators, keeps the existing certificate renewal logic intact, and improves isolation between Tekton and system components.

.{pac}

GitLab PipelineRun custom resource no longer fails or shows incorrect commit status for forked projects::
* Before this update, commit status handling and pipeline execution for GitLab forks could fail unexpectedly. {pac} fell back to posting comments for status updates when permissions were restricted on forked projects. Execution of `PipelineRun` custom resources (CR) could fail when the configured token lacked read access to the source repository.
With this update, {pac} attempts to set commit status on both the source (fork) and target (upstream) projects. A status comment is posted only if both attempts fail. Additionally, {pac} attempts to proactively verify that the configured token includes the `read_repository` scope before executing a `PipelineRun` CR, failing early with a clear error message in the `controller-logs` output if access is insufficient.

revision variable no longer returns incorrect commit SHA::
* Before this update, the {pac} dynamic variable `revision` returned the SHA of the original commit instead of the latest HEAD merge commit after upgrading to {pipelines-shortname} 1.19. With this update, the changes introduced in 1.19 are reverted and the `revision` variable always fetches the SHA of the HEAD merge commit as expected.

hub-catalog-name no longer defaults to deprecated Tekton Hub catalog::
* Before this update, when upgrading to 1.20.0, the `hub-catalog-name` field in the {pac} config map was set to the deprecated {tekton-hub} catalog name `tekton`. With this update, the field defaults to the {artifact-hub} catalog name, and you can override it with a custom value.

.User interface

Navigation tab no longer disappears and installation UI no longer crashes after {OCP} upgrade::
* Before this update, after upgrading {OCP} to 4.19.15 or greater, the *Navigation* tab intermittently disappeared, and the Pipeline Operator installation UI could crash after creating a `PipelineRun` CR on Sandbox clusters. These issues were caused by a race condition introduced by new flags in {OCP}. With this update, the race condition is resolved on {OCP} 4.19.18.
