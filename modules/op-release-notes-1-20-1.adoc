== Fixed issues

.Operator 

* Before this update, the `tekton-operator-proxy-webhook` admission webhook validated all namespaces, including control-plane namespaces (`kube-\*`, `openshift-*`), which could cause webhook certificate issues to affect unrelated system components, such as the Network Operator, during namespace reconciliation. With this update, the webhook excludes control-plane namespaces from validation, preventing certificate issues from impacting other cluster operators while keeping the existing certificate renewal logic intact and improving isolation.

.{pac}

* Before this update, commit status handling and pipeline execution for GitLab forks would fail unexpectedly when {pac} fell back to posting comments for status updates when permissions were restricted on forked projects, and PipelineRuns would fail if the configured token lacked read access to the source repository. With this update, {pac} attempts to set commit status on both the source (fork) and target (upstream) projects, only posting a comment if both attempts fail. Additionally, {pac} attempts to proactively verify that the configured token includes the `read_repository` scope before running a pipeline, failing early with a clear error message if access is insufficient.

* Before this update, the {pac} dynamic variable `revision` returned the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) of the original commit instead of the latest HEAD merge commit after upgrading to {pipelines-shortname} 1.19. With this update, the changes introduced in 1.19 are reverted and the revision variable always fetches the SHA of the HEAD merge commit as expected.

* Before this update, when upgrading to 1.20.0, the `hub-catalog-name` field in the {pac} config map was set to the deprecated {tekton-hub} catalog name `tekton`. With this update, the field defaults to the {artifact-hub} catalog name, and you can override it with a custom value.

.User interface

* Before this update, after upgrading {OCP} to 4.19.15 or greater, the *Navigation* tab intermittently disappeared, and the Pipeline Operator installation UI could crash after creating a PipelineRun on Sandbox clusters. These issues were caused by a race condition introduced by new flags in {OCP}. With this update, the race condition is resolved.
