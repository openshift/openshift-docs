= About htpasswd authentication

Using htpasswd authentication in {product-title} allows you to identify users based on an htpasswd file. An htpasswd file is a flat file that contains the user name and hashed password for each user. You can use the `htpasswd` utility to create this file.

[WARNING]
====
Do not use htpasswd authentication in {product-title} for production environments. Use htpasswd authentication only for development environments.
