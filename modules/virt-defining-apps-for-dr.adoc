[id="virt-defining-apps-for-dr_{context}"]
= Defining applications for disaster recovery

Define applications for disaster recovery by using VMs that {rh-rhacm-first} manages or discovers.

[id="best-practices-{rh-rhacm}-managed-vm_{context}"]
== Best practices when defining an {rh-rhacm}-managed VM

An {rh-rhacm}-managed application that includes a VM must be created by using a GitOps workflow and by creating an {rh-rhacm} application or `ApplicationSet`.

There are several actions you can take to improve your experience and chance of success when defining an {rh-rhacm}-managed VM.

[discrete]
[id="use-a-pvc-and-populator_{context}"]
=== Use a PVC and populator to define storage for the VM
Because data volumes create persistent volume claims (PVCs) implicitly, data volumes and VMs with data volume templates do not fit as neatly into the GitOps model.

[discrete]
[id="use-import-method_{context}"]
=== Use the import method when choosing a population source for your VM disk
Select a {op-system-base} image from the software catalog to use the import method. Red{nbsp}Hat recommends using a specific version of the image rather than a floating tag for consistent results. The KubeVirt community maintains container disks for other operating systems in a Quay repository.

[discrete]
[id="use-pull-node_{context}"]
=== Use `pullMethod: node`
Use the pod `pullMethod: node` when creating a data volume from a registry source to take advantage of the {product-title} pull secret, which is required to pull container images from the Red{nbsp}Hat registry.

[id="best-practices-{rh-rhacm}-discovered-vm_{context}"]
== Best practices when defining an {rh-rhacm}-discovered VM

You can configure any VM in the cluster that is not an {rh-rhacm}-managed application as an {rh-rhacm}-discovered application. This includes VMs imported by using the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV), VMs created by using the {product-title} web console, or VMs created by any other means, such as the CLI.

There are several actions you can take to improve your experience and chance of success when defining an {rh-rhacm}-discovered VM.

[discrete]
[id="protect-the-vm_{context}"]
=== Protect the VM when using MTV, the {product-title} web console, or a custom VM
Because automatic labeling is not currently available, the application owner must manually label the components of the VM application when using MTV, the {product-title} web console, or a custom VM.

After creating the VM, apply a common label to the following resources associated with the VM: `VirtualMachine`, `DataVolume`, `PersistentVolumeClaim`, `Service`, `Route`, `Secret`, `ConfigMap`, `VirtualMachinePreference`, and `VirtualMachineInstancetype`. Do not label virtual machine instances (VMIs) or pods; {VirtProductName} creates and manages these automatically.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must apply the common label to everything in the namespace that you want to protect, including objects that you added to the VM that are not listed here.
====

[discrete]
[id="working-vm-contains_{context}"]
=== Include more than the `VirtualMachine` object in the VM
Working VMs typically also contain data volumes, persistent volume claims (PVCs), services, routes, secrets, `ConfigMap` objects, and `VirtualMachineSnapshot` objects.

[discrete]
[id="part-of-larger-app_{context}"]
=== Include the VM as part of a larger logical application
This includes other pod-based workloads and VMs.
