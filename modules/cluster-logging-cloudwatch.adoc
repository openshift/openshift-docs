== Logging requirements

Hosting your own logging stack requires a large amount of compute resources and storage, which might be dependent on your cloud service quota. The compute resource requirements can start at 48 GB or more, while the storage requirement can be as large as 1600 GB or more. The logging stack runs on your worker nodes, which reduces your available workload resource. With these considerations, hosting your own logging stack increases your cluster operating costs.
