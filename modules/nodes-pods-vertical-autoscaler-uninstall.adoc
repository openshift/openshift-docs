= Uninstalling the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator

You can remove the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA) from your {product-title} cluster. After uninstalling, the resource requests for the pods already modified by an existing VPA CR do not change. Any new pods get the resources defined in the workload object, not the previous recommendations made by the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator.

[NOTE]
====
You can remove a specific VPA using the `oc delete vpa <vpa-name>` command. The same actions apply for resource requests as uninstalling the vertical pod autoscaler.
