{mtc-first} 1.8.12 has the following resolved issues:

Live migration of virtual machine instance with RWO configuration fails in `MigMigration`::

With this release, the live migration of virtual machine instances (VMIs) no longer fails for `MigMigration` when the persistent volume claims (PVC) of VMIs are not shared with the access mode configuration `ReadWriteMany`. The migration plan does not prevent you from migrating the VMIs because of the RWO volumes. As a result, you can migrate VMs with `ReadWriteOnce` volumes.
