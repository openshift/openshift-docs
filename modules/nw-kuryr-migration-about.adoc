= Migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network provider

You can manually migrate a cluster that runs on {rh-openstack-first} to the OVN-Kubernetes network provider.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Migration to OVN-Kubernetes is a one-way process.
During migration, your cluster will be unreachable for a brief time.
====

[id="considerations-kuryr-migrating-network-provider_{context}"]
== Considerations when migrating to the OVN-Kubernetes network provider

Kubernetes namespaces are kept by Kuryr in separate {rh-openstack} networking service (Neutron) subnets. Those subnets and the IP addresses that are assigned to individual pods are not preserved during the migration.

[id="how-the-kuryr-migration-process-works_{context}"]
== How the migration process works

The following table summarizes the migration process by relating the steps that you perform with the actions that your cluster and Operators take.

|User-initiated steps|Migration activity

|
Set the `migration` field of the `Network.operator.openshift.io` custom resource (CR) named `cluster` to `OVNKubernetes`. Verify that the value of the `migration` field prints the `null` value before setting it to another value.
|
Cluster Network Operator (CNO):: Updates the status of the `Network.config.openshift.io` CR named `cluster` accordingly.
Machine Config Operator (MCO):: Deploys an update to the systemd configuration that is required by OVN-Kubernetes. By default, the MCO updates a single machine per pool at a time. As a result, large clusters have longer migration times.

|Update the `networkType` field of the `Network.config.openshift.io` CR.
|
CNO:: Performs the following actions:
+
--
* Destroys the Kuryr control plane pods: Kuryr CNIs and the Kuryr controller.
* Deploys the OVN-Kubernetes control plane pods.
* Updates the Multus objects to reflect the new network plugin.
--

|
Reboot each node in the cluster.
|
Cluster:: As nodes reboot, the cluster assigns IP addresses to pods on the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network.

|
Clean up remaining resources Kuryr controlled.
|
Cluster:: Holds {rh-openstack} resources that need to be freed, as well as {product-title} resources to configure.
