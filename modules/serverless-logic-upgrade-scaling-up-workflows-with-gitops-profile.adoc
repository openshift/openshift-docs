= Scaling up workflows with the gitops profile

Workflows with the `gitops` profile that were previously scaled down must be scaled back up to continue operation.

.Procedure

. Modify the `my-workflow.yaml` CRD and scale up each workflow to `one` before upgrading as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  podTemplate:
    replicas: 1
----

. Apply the updated CRD by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <my-workflow.yaml> -n <target_namespace>
----

. (Optional) Scale the workflow back to `1` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch sonataflow <my-workflow> -n <target_namespace> --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"podTemplate": {"replicas": 1}}}'
