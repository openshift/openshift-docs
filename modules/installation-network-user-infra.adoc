= Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

All the {op-system-first} machines require network in `initramfs` during boot
to fetch Ignition config from the Machine Config Server.

ifdef::ibm-z[]
During the initial boot, the machines require an FTP server in order to
establish a network connection to download their Ignition config files.

Ensure that the machines have persistent IP
addresses and host names.
endif::ibm-z[]
ifndef::ibm-z[]
During the initial boot, the machines require a DHCP server in order to
establish a network connection, which allows them to download their Ignition config files.

It is recommended to use the DHCP server to manage the machines for the cluster
long-term. Ensure that the DHCP server is configured to provide persistent IP
addresses and host names to the cluster machines.
endif::ibm-z[]

The Kubernetes API server must be able to resolve the node names of the cluster
machines. If the API servers and worker nodes are in different zones, you can
configure a default DNS search zone to allow the API server to resolve the
node names. Another supported approach is to always refer to hosts by their
fully-qualified domain names in both the node objects and all DNS requests.

You must configure the network connectivity between machines to allow cluster
components to communicate. Each machine must be able to resolve the host names
of all other machines in the cluster.

== Network topology requirements

The infrastructure that you provision for your cluster must meet the following
network topology requirements.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} requires all nodes to have internet access to pull images
for platform containers and provide telemetry data to Red Hat.
====

.Load balancers

Before you install {product-title}, you must provision two layer-4 load
balancers. The API requires one load balancer and the default Ingress Controller
needs the second load balancer to provide ingress to applications.

A working configuration for the Ingress router is required for an
{product-title} cluster. You must configure the Ingress router after the control
plane initializes.

== Ethernet adaptor hardware address requirements

When provisioning VMs for the cluster, the ethernet interfaces configured for
each VM must use a MAC address from the VMware Organizationally Unique
Identifier (OUI) allocation ranges:

* `00:05:69:00:00:00` to `00:05:69:FF:FF:FF`
* `00:0c:29:00:00:00` to `00:0c:29:FF:FF:FF`
* `00:1c:14:00:00:00` to `00:1c:14:FF:FF:FF`
* `00:50:56:00:00:00` to `00:50:56:FF:FF:FF`

If a MAC address outside the VMware OUI is used, the cluster installation will
not succeed.
