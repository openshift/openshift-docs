= Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

All the {op-system-first} machines require network in `initramfs` during boot
to fetch Ignition config from the Machine Config Server.

During the initial boot, the machines require a DHCP server in order to
establish a network connection to download their Ignition config files.

It is recommended to use the DHCP server to manage the machines for the cluster
long-term. Ensure that the DHCP server is configured to provide persistent IP
addresses and host names to the cluster machines. DHCP must also configure
a default DNS search zone. The Kubernetess API server must be able to resolve
the node names of the cluster machines.

You must configure the network connectivity between machines to allow cluster
components to communicate. Each machine must be able to resolve the host names
of all other machines in the cluster.

== Network topology requirements

The infrastructure that you provision for your cluster must meet the following
network topology requirements.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} requires all nodes to have internet access to pull images
for platform containers and provide telemetry data to Red Hat.
====

.Load balancers

Before you install {product-title}, you must provision two layer-4 load
balancers.

A working configuration for the Ingress router is required for an
{product-title} cluster. You must configure the Ingress router after the control
plane initializes.
