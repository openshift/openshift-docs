= DNS configuration for {hcp} on {ibm-z-title}

The API server for the hosted cluster is exposed as a `NodePort` service. A DNS entry must exist for the `api.<hosted_cluster_name>.<base_domain>` that points to the destination where the API server is reachable.

The DNS entry can be as simple as a record that points to one of the nodes in the managed cluster that is running the hosted control plane.

The entry can also point to a load balancer deployed to redirect incoming traffic to the Ingress pods.

See the following example of a DNS configuration:

<1> The record refers to the IP address of the API load balancer that handles ingress and egress traffic for hosted control planes.

For {ibm-title} z/VM, add IP addresses that correspond to the IP address of the agent.
