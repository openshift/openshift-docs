= Creating alerts
You can create custom Prometheus rules for the Netobserv dashboard metrics to trigger alerts when some defined conditions are met.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role or with view permissions for all projects.
* You have the Network Observability Operator installed.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file by clicking the import icon, *+*.
. Add an alerting rule configuration to the YAML file. In the YAML sample that follows, an alert is created for when the cluster ingress traffic reaches a given threshold of 10 MBps per destination workload.
