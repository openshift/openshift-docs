= Creating a ClusterGroupUpgrade CR with pre-caching

For {sno}, the pre-cache feature allows the required container images to be present on the spoke cluster before the update starts.

[NOTE]
====
For pre-caching, {cgu-operator} uses the `spec.remediationStrategy.timeout` value from the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. You must set a `timeout` value that allows sufficient time for the pre-caching job to complete. When you enable the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR after pre-caching has completed, you can change the `timeout` value to a duration that is appropriate for the update.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the {cgu-operator-first}.
* Provision one or more managed clusters.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Save the contents of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `preCaching` field set to `true` in the `clustergroupupgrades-group-du.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: du-upgrade-4918
  namespace: ztp-group-du-sno
spec:
  preCaching: true <1>
  clusters:
  - cnfdb1
  - cnfdb2
  enable: false
  managedPolicies:
  - du-upgrade-platform-upgrade
  remediationStrategy:
    maxConcurrency: 2
    timeout: 240
----
<1> The `preCaching` field is set to `true`, which enables {cgu-operator} to pull the container images before starting the update.

. When you want to start pre-caching, apply the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f clustergroupupgrades-group-du.yaml
----

.Verification

. Check if the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR exists in the hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu -A
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----

----
<1> The CR is created.

. Check the status of the pre-caching task by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu -n ztp-group-du-sno du-upgrade-4918 -o jsonpath='{.status}'
