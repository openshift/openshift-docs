= Installing cluster-scoped Operators

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) uses a default `global-operators` Operator group in the `openshift-operators` namespace for cluster-scoped Operators. Hence you do not have to manage the `OperatorGroup` resource in your Gitops repository. However, for namespace-scoped Operators, you must manage the `OperatorGroup` resource in that namespace.

To install cluster-scoped Operators, create and place the `Subscription` resource of the required Operator in your Git repository.

.Example: Grafana Operator subscription
