= Runtime configuration for an Ethernet-based SR-IOV attachment

When attaching a pod to an additional network, you can specify a runtime configuration to make specific customizations for the pod. For example, you can request a specific MAC hardware address.

You specify the runtime configuration by setting an annotation in the pod specification. The annotation key is `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks`, and it accepts a JSON object that describes the runtime configuration.

The following JSON describes the runtime configuration options for an Ethernet-based SR-IOV network attachment.

    "name": "<name>", <1>

----
<1> The name of the SR-IOV network attachment definition CR.
<2> Optional: The MAC address for the SR-IOV device that is allocated from the resource type defined in the SR-IOV network attachment definition CR. To use this feature, you also must specify `{ "mac": true }` in the `SriovNetwork` object.
<3> Optional: IP addresses for the SR-IOV device that is allocated from the resource type defined in the SR-IOV network attachment definition CR. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported. To use this feature, you also must specify `{ "ips": true }` in the `SriovNetwork` object.
