= View the status of an external gateway

You can view the status of an external gateway that is configured for your cluster. The `status` field for the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` custom resource reports recent status messages whenever you update the resource, subject to a few limitations:

- Namespaces impacted are not reported in status messages
- Pods selected as part of a dynamic next hop configuration do not trigger status updates as a result of pod lifecycle events, such as pod termination

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* To access the status logs for a secondary external gateway, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get adminpolicybasedexternalroutes <name> -o yaml
----

--
where:

`<name>`:: Specifies the name of an `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` object.
