:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="accessing-microshift-cluster-remotely_{context}"]
= Accessing the {microshift-short} cluster remotely

Use the following procedure to access the {microshift-short} cluster from a remote workstation by using a `kubeconfig` file.

The `user@workstation` login is used to access the host machine remotely. The `<user>` value in the procedure is the name of the user that `user@workstation` logs in with to the {microshift-short} host.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the `oc` binary.

* The `@user@microshift` has opened the firewall from the local host.

.Procedure

. As `user@workstation`, create a `~/.kube/` folder if your {op-system} machine does not have one by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
[user@workstation]$ mkdir -p ~/.kube/
----

. As `user@workstation`, set a variable for the hostname of your {microshift-short} host by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
[user@workstation]$ MICROSHIFT_MACHINE=<name or IP address of {microshift-short} machine>
----

. As `user@workstation`, copy the generated `kubeconfig` file that contains the host name or IP address you want to connect with from the {op-system} machine running {microshift-short} to your local machine by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[user@workstation]$ ssh <user>@$MICROSHIFT_MACHINE "sudo cat /var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/$MICROSHIFT_MACHINE/kubeconfig" > ~/.kube/config
----

[NOTE]
====
To generate `kubeconfig` files for this step, see the "Generating additional kubeconfig files for remote access" link in the additional resources section.
====

. As `user@workstation`, update the permissions on your `~/.kube/config` file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ chmod go-r ~/.kube/config
----

.Verification

* As `user@workstation`, verify that {microshift-short} is running by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[user@workstation]$ oc get all -A
----
