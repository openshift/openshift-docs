= Accessing the {product-title} cluster remotely

Use the following procedure to access the {product-title} cluster from a remote workstation. The procedure assumes that there are two users:

* The first user, `user@microshift`, is the user on the {product-title} host machine and is responsible for setting up the `op-system` machine so that it can be accessed by a remote user on a separate workstation.

* The second user, `user@workstation`, accesses the {op-system} machine remotely from their workstation. The `<user>` value in the procedure is the name of the user that `user@workstation` uses to log in to the {product-title} host.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the the `oc` binary.

.Procedure

. As `user@microshift` on the {product-title} host, open the firewall port for the Kubernetes API server (`6443/tcp`) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[user@microshift]$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=6443/tcp && sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----

. Optional: As `user@workstation`, to create a `~/.kube/` folder if your {op-system} machine does not have one, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[user@workstation]$ mkdir -p ~/.kube/
----

. As `user@workstation`, set a variable for the hostname of your {product-title} host by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[user@microshift]$ MICROSHIFT_MACHINE=<name or IP address of {product-title} machine>
----

. As `user@workstation`, copy the generated `kubeconfig` file from the {op-system} machine running {product-title} to your local machine by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[user@workstation]$ ssh <user>@$MICROSHIFT_MACHINE "sudo cat /var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/kubeconfig" > ~/.kube/config
----

. As `user@workstation`, replace the `server` field in your `kubeconfig` file with the name or IP address of your {op-system} machine running {product-title} by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[user@workstation]$ sed -i "s|server: https://127.0.0.1:6443|server: https://$MICROSHIFT_MACHINE:6443|" ~/.kube/config
----

.Verify {product-title} is running

. As `user@workstation`, verify that {product-title} is running by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[user@workstation]$ oc get all -A
----
