:_content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="accessing-microshift-cluster-remotely_{context}"]
= Accessing the {product-title} cluster remotely

Use the following procedure to access the {product-title} cluster from a remote workstation by using a `kubeconfig` file.

* The `user@workstation` login is used to access the host machine remotely. The `<user>` value in the procedure is the name of the user that `user@workstation` logs in with to the {product-title} host.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the `oc` binary.

* The `@user@microshift` has opened the firewall from the local host.

.Procedure

. As `user@workstation`, create a `~/.kube/` folder if your {op-system} machine does not have one by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
[user@workstation]$ mkdir -p ~/.kube/
----

. As `user@workstation`, set a variable for the hostname of your {product-title} host by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
[user@workstation]$ MICROSHIFT_MACHINE=<name or IP address of {product-title} machine>
----

. As `user@workstation`, copy the generated `kubeconfig` file that contains the host name or IP address you want to connect with from the {op-system} machine running {product-title} to your local machine by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[user@workstation]$ ssh <user>@$MICROSHIFT_MACHINE "sudo cat /var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/$MICROSHIFT_MACHINE/kubeconfig" > ~/.kube/config
----

. As `user@workstation`, update the permissions on your `~/.kube/config` file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ chmod go-r ~/.kube/config
----

.Verify {product-title} is running

. As `user@workstation`, verify that {product-title} is running by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[user@workstation]$ oc get all -A
----
