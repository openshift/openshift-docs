= Installation command options

The installation program uses
link:https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[Semantic Versioning] for its
user-facing API to ensure that commands are stable across versions. While most
of the `openshift-install` command options comply with semantic versioning
practices, some do not.

.Commands that comply with semantic versioning
The following commands are covered by the versioning:

`openshift-install [options] create install-config`::
Creates the `install-config.yaml` file in the asset directory. The version of
the generated `install-config` might change.
`openshift-install [options] create ignition-configs`::
Creates the `bootstrap.ign`, `master.ign`, and `worker.ign` files in the asset
directory,. The content of the generated files might change between versions.
`openshift-install [options] create cluster`::
Launches a new cluster.
`openshift-install [options] destroy bootstrap`::
Destroys any bootstrap resources created for the cluster.
`openshift-install [options] destroy cluster`::
Destroys the cluster resources.
`openshift-install [options] help`::
Shows help for the command. The available options and unstable commands might
change between versions
`openshift-install [options] version`::
Displays sufficient version information for maintainers to identify the
installation program version. The format and content of its output might change
between versions.
The install-config format itself::
New versions of this format might be released, but within a minor version
series, the `openshift-install` command can read previous versions.

.Commands that do not comply with semantic versioning
The following commands are not covered by the versioning:

`openshift-install [options] graph`::

`openshift-install [options] create manifest-templates`::

`openshift-install [options] create manifests`::

If you need to alter, add, or remove Kubernetes objects, you must perform those
actions after you install the cluster..
