= Preparing the {oci} environment - 1

Before installing OpenShift Container Platform using Assisted Installer, create the necessary resources and download the configuration file in the {oci} environment.

.Prerequisites

* You have an {oci} account to host the cluster. 
* You have names for the following: cluster, compartment, DNS zone ({oci})/domain name ({ai}), object storage bucket.
* If you use a firewall and you plan to use a Telemetry service, you configured your firewall to allow {product-title} to access the sites required.
* If you are installing on a virtual machines (VM), see link:https://catalog.redhat.com/cloud/detail/216977[Cloud instance types (Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog portal)] to identify the supported {oci} VM shapes. 

.Procedure

. Log in to your link:https://cloud.oracle.com/a/[{oci-first-no-rt}] account with administrator privileges.

. Configure the account by defining the link:https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/openshift-on-oci/install-prereq.htm[Cloud Accounts and Resources]. Pay attention to the following:

.. Create a child compartment for organizing, restricting access, and setting usage limits to {oci} resources. For details, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/compartments/To_create_a_compartment.htm#To[Creating a Compartment].

.. Create a new public DNS zone in the new child compartment. In the *Create in Compartment* field, select the new compartment. For details, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/DNS/Concepts/gettingstarted_topic-Creating_a_Zone.htm#top[Creating a Public DNS zone].

.. Create a new object storage bucket into which you will upload the discovery ISO image. 
For details, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/managingbuckets_topic-To_create_a_bucket.htm#top[Creating an Object Storage Bucket].

. Download the `create-cluster-vX.X.X.zip` configuration file from the link:https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-openshift[`oracle-quickstart/oci-openshift`] repository. This file contains the following: 
+
--
** *Terraform Stacks*: The Terraform stack code for provisioning OCI resources to create and manage {product-title} clusters on OCI.

** *Custom Manifests*: The manifest files needed for the installation of {product-title} clusters on OCI.
