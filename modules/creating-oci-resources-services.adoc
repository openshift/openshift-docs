= Preparing the {oci} environment

Before installing {product-title} using Assisted Installer, create the necessary resources and download the configuration file in the {oci} environment.

.Prerequisites

* You have an {oci} account to host the cluster. 
* If you use a firewall and you plan to use a Telemetry service, you configured your firewall to allow {product-title} to access the sites required.

.Procedure

. Log in to your link:https://cloud.oracle.com/a/[{oci-first-no-rt}] account with administrator privileges.

. Configure the account by defining the link:https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/openshift-on-oci/install-prereq.htm[Cloud Accounts and Resources (Oracle documentation)]. Ensure that you create the following resources:

.. Create a child compartment for organizing, restricting access, and setting usage limits to {oci} resources. For the full procedure, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/compartments/To_create_a_compartment.htm#To[Creating a Compartment (Oracle documentation)].

.. Create a new object storage bucket into which you will upload the discovery ISO image. 
For the full procedure, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/managingbuckets_topic-To_create_a_bucket.htm#top[Creating an Object Storage Bucket (Oracle documentation)].

. Download the latest version of the `create-cluster-vX.X.X.zip` configuration file from the link:https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-openshift[`oracle-quickstart/oci-openshift`] repository. This file
provides the infrastructure for the cluster and contains configurations for the following: 
+
--
** *Terraform Stacks*: The Terraform stack code for provisioning {oci} resources to create and manage {product-title} clusters on {oci}.  

** *Custom Manifests*: The manifest files needed for the installation of {product-title} clusters on {oci}.

[NOTE]
====
To make any changes to the manifests, you can clone the entire Oracle GitHub repository and access the `custom_manifests` and `terraform-stacks` directories directly.
