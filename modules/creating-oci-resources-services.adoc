= Preparing the {oci} environment 


To install OpenShift Container Platform using either Assisted Installer, prepare the {oci} environment as follows.

.Prerequisites

* You have an {oci} account to host the cluster. 
* If you use a firewall and you plan to use a Telemetry service, you configured your firewall to allow {product-title} to access the sites required.
* If you are installing on a virtual machines (VM), see link:https://catalog.redhat.com/cloud/detail/216977[Cloud instance types (Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog portal)] to identify the supported {oci} VM shapes. 

== Preparing resources

Create cloud accounts and resources, including a child compartment, a public DNS zone, and an object storage bucket.

.Procedure

. Log in to your link:https://cloud.oracle.com/a/[{oci-first-no-rt}] account with administrator privileges.

. Configure the account by defining the link:https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/openshift-on-oci/install-prereq.htm[Cloud Accounts and Resources] in the {oci} documentation. Pay attention to the steps below.

. Create a compartment for organizing, restricting access, and setting usage limits to {oci} resources: 
+
--
.. From the navigation menu, select *Identity & Security* > *Identity* > *Compartments*.

.. Select the compartment under which you want to create a child compartment, and click *Create Compartment*. 

.. Enter the following information:

*** *Name*: A unique name for the compartment. 

*** *Description*: A description for the compartment. You can change this later.

*** *Parent Compartment*: The compartment that you're in is displayed. Change the compartment by selecting it from the list.

*** *Tags*: Apply free-form tags to that resource, if you have the correct permissions. This step is optional.

.. Click *Create Compartment*.

== Preparing configuration files

Download the `create-cluster-vX.X.X.zip` configuration file to your local drive. This file contains the following: 

* *Terraform Stacks*: The Terraform stack code for provisioning OCI resources to create and manage {product-title} clusters on {oci}. For details, see the link:https://github.com/dfoster-oracle/oci-openshift/blob/v1.0.0-release-preview/terraform-stacks/README.md[Terraform Defined Resources for OpenShift on OCI
README file].

* *Custom Manifests*: The manifest files needed for the installation of {product-title} clusters on {oci}. For details, see the link:https://github.com/dfoster-oracle/oci-openshift/blob/v1.0.0-release-preview/custom_manifests/README.md[Custom Manifests README] file.

[NOTE]
====
