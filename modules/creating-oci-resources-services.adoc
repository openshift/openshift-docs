= Creating OCI resources and services

Create {oci-first} resources and services so that you can establish infrastructure with governance standards that meets your organization's requirements.

By creating a compartment, you can better organize, restrict access, and set usage limits to {oci} resources. Additionally, by creating an object storage bucket, you can safely and securely store the ISO image. You can access the image at a later stage for the purposes of booting the instances, so that you can then create your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You configured an {oci} account to host the cluster. See link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/get-started/subscriptions-cloud/csgsg/create-users-and-assign-roles.html#GUID-1041AC78-9E43-42CF-B5A5-73F8B8FEB39A[Create Users and Assign Roles] in the Oracle documentation.

.Procedure

. Log in to your link:https://cloud.oracle.com/a/[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure] account with administrator privileges.

. Create a child compartment. See link:https://docs.public.oneportal.content.oci.oraclecloud.com/en-us/iaas/process-automation/oci-process-automation/create-compartment.html[Create a compartment] in the Oracle documentation.

[NOTE]
====
When creating the child compartment, specify the default parent compartment or any other parent compartment from the list.
====

. Record the name and the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/libraries/glossary/ocid.htm[{ocid-first}] of the compartment.

. Create a bucket resource for your child compartment. Ensure that you specify your child compartment in the *Create in compartment* field for the bucket resource.

. Go to *Object Storage & Archive Storage* -> *Buckets* and create a bucket, where *Bucket name* refers to your cluster's name.
