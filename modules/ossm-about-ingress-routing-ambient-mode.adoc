= About ingress traffic routing approaches in ambient mode

[role="_abstract"]
When using the {istio} ambient mode, you can use the {k8s} Gateway API to configure ingress traffic routing.

Waypoint proxies for Layer 7 routing::
You can deploy a waypoint proxy in the namespace that has your service to apply Layer 7 (L7) routing policies, such as path-based routing or header matching. In ambient mode, waypoint proxies process L7 traffic and enforce `HTTPRoute` and `GRPCRoute` rules.

[IMPORTANT]
====
`VirtualService` resources are considered technology preview in ambient mode and should not be mixed with Gateway API configuration. The recommended approach in ambient mode is to use {k8s} Gateway API resources.
