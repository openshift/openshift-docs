= Installing the Cluster Logging Operator

You can use the {product-title} console to install cluster logging, which creates the Cluster Logging Operator.

.Procedure

To install cluster logging:

. Using the CLI, create the `openshifdt-logging` project with an empty node selector:
+
----
$ oc adm new-project openshift-logging --node-selector=""
----

. In the {product-title} console, click *Catalog* -> *Operator Hub*. 

. Select *cluster-logging* from the list of available Operators, and click Install.

. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page: 

.. Under *Installation Mode* select *All namespaces on the cluster*. This makes the Operator available to all users and projects that use this {product-title} cluster.

.. Under *Approval Strategy* select Automatic or Manual updates. 

.. Click *Subscribe*.

. Click *Catalog* -> *Installed Operators* page. 

. On the *Operator Management* page, use the *Project* drop-down to select *all projects* or *openshift-operators*. 

. On the *Installed Operators* page, on the far right side of the *Cluster Logging* object listing, select *Edit Cluster Service Version*.

. On the *Cluster Logging* page, click *Cluster Logging.*

. On the *Cluster Logging* page, click *Create Cluster Logging* to create a cluster logging instance.

. On the *Create Cluster Logging* page, edit the YAML code:
+
----

----

. Click *Create*.

. Verify that Cluster Logging installed:

.. Check the `openshift-logging` Project for `elasticsearch-*`, `fluentd-*` and `kibana-*` pods.
+
----


----





. On the *Catalog* → *Installed Operators* page, verify that the ClusterLogging (CSV) eventually shows up and its *Status* ultimately resolves to *InstallSucceeded*.

If it does not, switch to the *Catalog* → *Operator Management* page and inspect the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors under *Status*. Then, check the logs in any Pods in the openshift-operators project (on the *Workloads* → *Pods* page) that are reporting issues to troubleshoot further.
