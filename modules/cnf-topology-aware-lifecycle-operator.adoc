== Requirements for using TALO

To use TALO, you need to set up your environment and your clusters accordingly.

* TALO requires a disconnected environment. For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp-deploying-disconnected.adoc#ztp-acm-preparing-to-install-disconnected-acm_ztp-deploying-disconnected[Preparing the disconnected environment].

* ZTP depends on TALO to configure the cluster. For more information, see xref: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a8FbkK13g-5o5sTJXNSF-oWAR34YRuKoa5rHnYGJRzM/edit#heading=h.tuuop2mc4rq3
