= OVN-Kubernetes network plugin JSON configuration table

The following table describes the configuration parameters for the OVN-Kubernetes CNI network plugin:

.OVN-Kubernetes network plugin JSON configuration table
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`cniVersion`
|`string`
|
The CNI specification version. The required value is `0.3.1`.

|`name`
|`string`
|
The name of the network. These networks are not namespaced. For example, a network named `l2-network` can be referenced by `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resources (CRs) that exist in different namespaces.
This configuration allows pods that use the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CR in different namespaces to communicate over the same secondary network.
However, the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRs must share the same network-specific parameters, such as `topology`, `subnets`, `mtu`, `excludeSubnets`, and `vlanID`. The `vlanID` parameter applies only when the `topology` field is set to `localnet`.

|`type`
|`string`
|
The name of the CNI plugin to configure. This value must be set to `ovn-k8s-cni-overlay`.

|`topology`
|`string`
|
The topological configuration for the network. Must be one of `layer2` or `localnet`.

|`subnets`
|`string`
|
The subnet to use for the network across the cluster.

For `"topology":"layer2"` deployments, IPv6 (`2001:DBB::/64`) and dual-stack (`192.168.100.0/24,2001:DBB::/64`) subnets are supported.

When omitted, the logical switch implementing the network only provides layer 2 communication, and users must configure IP addresses for the pods. Port security only prevents MAC spoofing.

|`mtu`
|`string`
a|
The maximum transmission unit (MTU). If you do not set a value, the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) sets a default MTU value by calculating the difference among the underlay MTU of the primary network interface, the overlay MTU of the pod network, such as the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation), and byte capacity of any enabled features, such as IPsec.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the `topology` field is set to `localnet`, the MTU value must match the MTU value of the underlying network. If left unset, the default value is the MTU of the overlay network, not the underlay network.
====

|`netAttachDefName`
|`string`
|
The metadata `namespace` and `name` of the network attachment definition CRD where this
configuration is included. For example, if this configuration is defined in a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRD in namespace `ns1` named `l2-network`, this should be set to `ns1/l2-network`.

|`excludeSubnets`
|`string`
|
A comma-separated list of CIDRs and IP addresses. IP addresses are removed from the assignable IP address pool and are never passed to the pods.

|`vlanID`
|`integer`
|
If topology is set to `localnet`, the specified VLAN tag is assigned to traffic from this secondary network. The default is to not assign a VLAN tag.

|`physicalNetworkName`
|`string`
|
If topology is set to `localnet`, you can reuse the same physical network mapping with multiple network overlays. Specifies the name of the physical network to which the OVN overlay connects. When omitted, the default value is the `name` of the `localnet` network. To isolate the different networks, ensure that a different VLAN tag is used when sharing the same physical network between overlays.
