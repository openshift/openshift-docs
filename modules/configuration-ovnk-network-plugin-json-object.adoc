= OVN-Kubernetes network plugin JSON configuration table

The following table describes the configuration parameters for the OVN-Kubernetes CNI network plugin:

.OVN-Kubernetes network plugin JSON configuration table
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`cniVersion`
|`string`
|
The CNI specification version. The required value is `0.3.1`.

|`name`
|`string`
|
The name of the network. These networks are not namespaced. For example, you can have a network named
`l2-network` referenced from two different `NetworkAttachmentDefinitions` that exist on two different
namespaces. This ensures that pods making use of the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` on their own different
namespaces can communicate over the same secondary network. However, those two different `NetworkAttachmentDefinitions` must also share the same network specific parameters such as `topology`, `subnets`, `mtu`, and `excludeSubnets`.

|`type`
|`string`
|
The name of the CNI plugin to configure. This value must be set to `ovn-k8s-cni-overlay`.

|`topology`
|`string`
|
The topological configuration for the network. Must be one of `layer2` or `localnet`.

|`subnets`
|`string`
|
The subnet to use for the network across the cluster. When specifying `layer2` for the `topology`, only include the CIDR for the node. For example, `10.100.200.0/24`.

For `"topology":"layer2"` deployments, IPv6 (`2001:DBB::/64`) and dual-stack (`192.168.100.0/24,2001:DBB::/64`) subnets are supported.

When omitted, the logical switch implementing the network only provides layer 2 communication, and users must configure IP addresses for the pods. Port security only prevents MAC spoofing.

|`mtu`
|`string`
|
The maximum transmission unit (MTU). The default value, `1300`, is automatically set by the kernel.

|`netAttachDefName`
|`string`
|
The metadata `namespace` and `name` of the network attachment definition object where this
configuration is included. For example, if this configuration is defined in a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` in namespace `ns1` named `l2-network`, this should be set to `ns1/l2-network`.

|`excludeSubnets`
|`string`
|
A comma-separated list of CIDRs and IP addresses. IP addresses are removed from the assignable IP address pool and are never passed to the pods.

|`vlanID`
|`integer`
|
If topology is set to `localnet`, the specified VLAN tag is assigned to traffic from this additional network. The default is to not assign a VLAN tag.
