The images view organizes the information into the following groups:

* *Image*: Displays the name or identifier of each container image.
ifdef::observedcves[]
* *CVEs by severity*: Groups the vulnerabilities associated with each image based on their severity.
endif::observedcves[]
* *Operating system*: Highlights the operating system that the image uses and helps identify potential vulnerabilities specific to that operating system.
* *Deployments*: Shows all deployments where the image is actively running so you can assess the impact and prioritize remediation based on usage.
* *Age*: Shows how long the image has been in use and provides information about potential risks associated with outdated images.
* *Scan time*: Shows the timestamp of the last scan.

To review and triage the details associated with an image, click on the image.

A window opens with information about the vulnerabilities associated with the image.
