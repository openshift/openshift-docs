= Configuring metrics collection for SPIRE Server by using a ServiceMonitor

[role="_abstract"]
To collect custom metrics from the SPIRE Server, create a ServiceMonitor custom resource (CR). This configuration enables the Prometheus Operator to scrape metrics from the default endpoint, which helps you monitor your SPIRE deployment.

The SPIRE Server operand exposes metrics by default on port `9402` at the `/metrics` endpoint. You can configure metrics collection for the SPIRE Server by creating a `ServiceMonitor` custom resource (CR) that enables the Prometheus Operator to collect custom metrics.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.

* You have installed the {zero-trust-full}.

* You have deployed the SPIRE Server operand in the cluster.

* You have enabled the user workload monitoring.

.Procedure

. Create the `ServiceMonitor` CR:

.. Create the YAML file that defines the `ServiceMonitor` CR:
+
.Example `servicemonitor-spire-server` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
labels:
  app.kubernetes.io/name: server
  app.kubernetes.io/instance: spire
name: spire-server-metrics
namespace: zero-trust-workload-identity-manager
spec:
endpoints:
- port: metrics
  interval: 30s
  path: /metrics
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: server
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: spire
namespaceSelector:
  matchNames:
  - zero-trust-workload-identity-manager
----

.. Create the `ServiceMonitor` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f servicemonitor-spire-server.yaml
----
+
After the `ServiceMonitor` CR is created, the user workload Prometheus instance begins metrics collection from the SPIRE Server. The collected metrics are labeled with `job="spire-server"`.

.Verification

. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Observe* -> *Targets*.

. In the *Label* filter field, enter the following label to filter the metrics targets:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ service=zero-trust-workload-identity-manager-metrics-service
----

. Confirm that the *Status* column shows `Up` for the `spire-server-metrics` entry.
