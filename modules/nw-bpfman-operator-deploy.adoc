[id="nw-bpfman-operator-deploy_{context}"]
= Deploying a containerized eBPF program

As a cluster administrator, you can deploy an eBPF program to nodes on your cluster. In this procedure, a sample containerized eBPF program is installed in the `go-xdp-counter` namespace.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have an account with administrator privileges.
* You have installed the eBPF Manager Operator.

.Procedure

. To download the manifest, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -L https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/releases/download/v0.5.1/go-xdp-counter-install-selinux.yaml -o go-xdp-counter-install-selinux.yaml
----

. To deploy the sample eBPF application, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f go-xdp-counter-install-selinux.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----

. To confirm that the eBPF sample application deployed successfully, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get all -o wide -n go-xdp-counter

. To confirm that the XDP program is collecting data, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs <pod_name> -n go-xdp-counter
----
+
Replace `<pod_name>` with the name of a XDP program pod, such as `go-xdp-counter-ds-4m9cw`.
