= Restoring a degraded Insights Operator

Disconnecting the cluster from the network necessarily causes the cluster to lose the Internet connection. The Insights Operator becomes degraded because it requires access to link:https://console.redhat.com[Red Hat Insights].

This topic describes how to recover from a degraded Insights Operator.

.Procedure

. Edit your `.dockerconfigjson` file to remove the `cloud.openshift.com` entry, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
"cloud.openshift.com":{"auth":"<hash>","email":"user@example.com"}
----

. Save the file.

. Update the cluster secret with the edited `.dockerconfigjson` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=./.dockerconfigjson
----

. Verify that the Insights Operator is no longer degraded:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get co insights
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
