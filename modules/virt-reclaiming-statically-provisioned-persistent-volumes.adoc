= Reclaiming statically provisioned persistent volumes

Reclaim a statically provisioned persistent volume (PV) by unbinding the persistent volume claim (PVC) and deleting the PV. You might also need to manually delete the shared storage.

Reclaiming a statically provisioned PV is dependent on the underlying storage.
This procedure provides a general approach that might need to be customized depending on your storage.

.Procedure

. Ensure that the reclaim policy of the PV is set to `Retain`:

.. Check the reclaim policy of the PV:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pv <pv_name> -o yaml | grep 'persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy'
----

.. If the `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy` is not set to `Retain`, edit the reclaim policy with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch pv <pv_name> -p '{"spec":{"persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy":"Retain"}}'
----

. Ensure that no resources are using the PV:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe pvc <pvc_name> | grep 'Mounted By:'
----
+
Remove any resources that use the PVC before continuing.

. Delete the PVC to release the PV:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pvc <pvc_name>
----

. Optional: Export the PV configuration to a YAML file. If you manually remove the shared storage later in this procedure, you can refer to this configuration.
You can also use `spec` parameters in this file as the basis to create a new PV with the same storage configuration after you reclaim the PV:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pv <pv_name> -o yaml > <file_name>.yaml
----

. Delete the PV:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pv <pv_name>
----

. Optional: Depending on the storage type, you might need to remove the contents of the shared storage folder:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rm -rf <path_to_share_storage>
----

. Optional: Create a PV that uses the same storage configuration as the deleted PV. If you exported the reclaimed PV configuration earlier, you can use the `spec` parameters of that file as the basis for a new PV manifest:
+
[NOTE]
====
To avoid possible conflict, it is good practice to give the new PV object a different name than the one that you deleted.

[source,terminal]

$ oc create -f <new_pv_name>.yaml
