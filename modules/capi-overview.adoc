= Cluster API overview

You can use the Cluster API to create and manage compute machine sets and compute machines in your {product-title} cluster.
This capability is in addition or an alternative to managing machines with the Machine API.

For {product-title} {product-version} clusters, you can use the Cluster API to perform node host provisioning management actions after the cluster installation finishes.
This system enables an elastic, dynamic provisioning method on top of public or private cloud infrastructure.

With the Cluster API Technology Preview, you can create compute machines and compute machine sets on {product-title} clusters for supported providers.
You can also explore the features that are enabled by this implementation that might not be available with the Machine API.
