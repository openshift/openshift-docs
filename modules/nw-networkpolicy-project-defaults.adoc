= Adding network policy objects to the new project template

As a cluster administrator, you can add network policy objects to the default template for new projects.
{product-title} will automatically create all the NetworkPolicy CRs specified in the template in the project.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster using the OpenShift SDN network plug-in with `mode: NetworkPolicy`
set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.
* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* You must log in to the cluster with a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You must have created a custom default project template for new projects.

.Procedure

. Edit the default template for a new project by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc edit template <project_template> -n openshift-config
----
+
Replace `<project_template>` with the name of the default template that you
configured for your cluster. The default template name is `project-request`.

. In the template, add each NetworkPolicy object as an element to the `objects`
parameter. The `objects` parameter accepts a collection of one or more objects.
+
In the following example, the `objects` parameter collection includes several
NetworkPolicy objects:
+
[source,yaml]
----
objects:
- apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-from-same-namespace
  spec:
    podSelector:
    ingress:
    - from:
      - podSelector: {}
- apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
  spec:
    ingress:
    - from:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
    podSelector: {}
    policyTypes:
    - Ingress
...
----

. Optional: Create a new project to confirm that your network policy objects are created successfully by running the following commands:

.. Create a new project:
+
----
$ oc new-project <project> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<project>` with the name for the project you are creating.

.. Confirm that the network policy objects in the new project template exist in the new project:
+
----
$ oc get networkpolicy
NAME                           POD-SELECTOR   AGE
allow-from-openshift-ingress   <none>         7s
allow-from-same-namespace      <none>         7s
----
