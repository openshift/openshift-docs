= Network Observablity Operator architecture

The Network Observability Operator provides the `FlowCollector` API, which is instantiated at installation and configured to reconcile the `eBPF agent`, the `flowlogs-pipeline`, and the `netobserv-plugin` components. Only a single `FlowCollector` per cluster is supported.

The `eBPF agent` runs on each cluster node with some privileges to collect network flows. The `flowlogs-pipeline` receives the network flows data and enriches the data with Kubernetes identifiers. If you are using Loki, the `flowlogs-pipeline` sends flow logs data to Loki for storing and indexing. The `netobserv-plugin`, which is a dynamic {product-title} web console plugin, queries Loki to fetch network flows data. Cluster-admins can view the data in the web console.

If you are using the Kafka option, the eBPF agent sends the network flow data to Kafka, and the `flowlogs-pipeline` reads from the Kafka topic before sending to Loki, as shown in the following diagram.
