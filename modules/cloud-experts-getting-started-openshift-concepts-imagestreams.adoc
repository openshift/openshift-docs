= Image streams

[role="_abstract"]
An image stream stores a mapping of tags to images, metadata overrides that are applied when images are tagged in a stream, and an optional reference to a Docker image repository on a registry.

== Image stream benefits
Using an image stream makes it easier to change a tag for a container image. Otherwise, to manually change a tag, you must download the image, change it locally, then push it all back. Promoting applications by manually changing a tag and then updating the deployment object entails many steps.

With image streams, you upload a container image once and then you manage its virtual tags internally in OpenShift. In one project you might use the developer tag and only change a reference to it internally, while in production you might use a production tag and also manage it internally. You do not have to deal with the registry.

You can also use image streams in conjunction with deployment configs to set a trigger that will start a deployment as soon as a new image appears or a tag changes its reference.

== Builds
A build is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting object. Most often, the process is used to transform input parameters or source code into a runnable image. A `BuildConfig` object is the definition of the entire build process.

OpenShift Container Platform leverages Kubernetes by creating Docker-formatted containers from build images and pushing them to a container image registry.

Build objects share common characteristics:

* Inputs for a build
* Requirements to complete a build process
* Logging the build process
* Publishing resources from successful builds
* Publishing the final status of the build

Builds take advantage of resource restrictions, specifying limitations on resources such as CPU usage, memory usage, and build or pod execution time.
