= Configuring syslog integration with {product-title}

Create a new syslog integration in {rh-rhacs-first}.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, click the *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations* -> *Notifier* tab.
. Select *Syslog*.
. Click *New integration*.
. In the *Create integration* page, provide the following information:
.. Enter a name for your integration.
.. Select the *Logging facility* value from `local0` through `local7`.
.. Enter your *Receiver host* address and *Receiver port* number.
.. Enter a value for the *Maximum message size*.
+
Enter a value between `0` and `1048576`, which corresponds to the number of bytes used to chunk messages. You can adjust the value by using the up and down arrows in the spin button.
+
If you do not want to chunk messages, enter `0`.
.. Select the appropriate *Message format*:
** If you are creating a new integration, select *CEF*.
** If you have an existing integration that relies on the old behavior, select *CEF (legacy field order)*.
.. Select the appropriate checkboxes:
** If you are using TLS, select the *Use TLS* checkbox.
** If your syslog receiver uses a certificate that is not trusted, select the *Disable TLS Certificate Validation (insecure)* checkbox.
.. To add extra fields, click *Add new extra field*.
+
For example, if your syslog receiver accepts objects from multiple sources, type `source` and `rhacs` in the *Key* and *Value* fields.
+
You can filter by using the custom values in your syslog receiver to identify all alerts from {product-title-short}.
. To send a test message to verify that the integration with your generic webhook is working, click *Test*.
. To create the configuration, click *Save*.
