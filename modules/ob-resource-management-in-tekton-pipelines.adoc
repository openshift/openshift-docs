= Resource management in Tekton pipelines

[role="_abstract"]
The build controller works with the Tekton pipeline controller to schedule pods that run strategy steps. At runtime, it creates a Tekton TaskRun, which executes a Task and records status and results. The TaskRun creates a pod in the target namespace that runs all steps sequentially.
