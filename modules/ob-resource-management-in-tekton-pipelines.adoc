= Resource management in Tekton pipelines

The build controller works with the Tekton pipeline controller so that it can schedule pods for executing the strategy steps. At runtime, the build controller creates a Tekton `TaskRun` resource, and the `TaskRun` resource creates a new pod in the specific namespace. This pod then sequentially executes all of the strategy steps to build an image.
