= Resource management in Tekton pipelines

[role="_abstract"] 

The build controller works with the Tekton pipeline controller so that it can schedule pods for executing the strategy steps. At runtime, the build controller creates a Tekton `TaskRun` resource, and the `TaskRun` resource creates a new pod in the specific namespace. This pod then sequentially executes all of the strategy steps to build an image.
