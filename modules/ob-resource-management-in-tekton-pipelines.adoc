= Resource management in Tekton pipelines

[role="_abstract"]
The build controller works with the Tekton pipeline controller so that it can schedule pods for executing the strategy steps. At runtime, the build controller creates a Tekton `TaskRun` resource. A TaskRun is a Tekton resource that executes a specific Task and records its status, results, and execution details. The `TaskRun` resource creates a new pod in the specific namespace. This pod then sequentially executes all of the strategy steps to build an image.
