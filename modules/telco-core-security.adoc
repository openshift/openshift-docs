New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
Telco operators are security conscious and require clusters to be hardened against multiple attack vectors. Within {product-title}, there is no single component or feature responsible for securing a cluster. This section provides details of security-oriented features and configuration for the use models covered in this specification.

* **SecurityContextConstraints**: All workload pods should be run with restricted-v2 or restricted SCC.
* **Seccomp**: All pods should be run with the `RuntimeDefault` (or stronger) seccomp profile.
* **Rootless DPDK pods**: Many user-plane networking (DPDK) CNFs require pods to run with root privileges. With this feature, a conformant DPDK pod can be run without requiring root privileges.
Rootless DPDK pods create a tap device in a rootless pod that injects traffic from a DPDK application to the kernel.
* **Storage**: The storage network should be isolated and non-routable to other cluster networks. See the "Storage" section for additional details.

Limits and requirements::
* Rootless DPDK pods requires the following additional configuration steps:
** Configure the TAP plugin with the `container_t` SELinux context.
** Enable the `container_use_devices` SELinux boolean on the hosts.

Engineering considerations::
* For rootless DPDK pod support, the SELinux boolean `container_use_devices` must be enabled on the host for the TAP device to be created. This introduces a security risk that is acceptable for short to mid-term use. Other solutions will be explored.
