Description::

--
Telco customers are security conscious and require clusters to be hardened against multiple attack vectors.
In {product-title}, there is no single component or feature responsible for securing a cluster.
Described below are various security oriented features and configurations for the use models covered in the telco core RDS.

* SecurityContextConstraints (SCC): All workload pods should be run with `restricted-v2` or `restricted` SCC.
* Seccomp: All pods should run with the `RuntimeDefault` (or stronger) seccomp profile.
* Rootless DPDK pods: Many user-plane networking (DPDK) CNFs require pods to run with root privileges.
With this feature, a conformant DPDK pod can be run without requiring root privileges.
Rootless DPDK pods create a tap device in a rootless pod that injects traffic from a DPDK application to the kernel.
* Storage: The storage network should be isolated and non-routable to other cluster networks.
See the "Storage" section for additional details.

See the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution article link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7090422[Custom nftable firewall rules in {product-title}] for a supported method for implementing custom nftables firewall rules in {product-title} cluster nodes. This article is intended for cluster administrators who are responsible for managing network security policies in {product-title} environments.

It is crucial to carefully consider the operational implications before deploying this method, including:

* Early application: The rules are applied at boot time, before the network is fully operational.
Ensure the rules don't inadvertently block essential services required during the boot process.
* Risk of misconfiguration: Errors in your custom rules can lead to unintended consequences, potentially leading to performance impact or blocking legitimate traffic or isolating nodes.
Thoroughly test your rules in a non-production environment before deploying them to your main cluster.
* External endpoints: {product-title} requires access to external endpoints to function.
For more information about the firewall allowlist, see "Configuring your firewall for {product-title}". Ensure that cluster nodes are permitted access to those endpoints. Ensure that cluster nodes are permitted access to those endpoints.

* Node reboot: Unless node disruption policies are configured, applying the `MachineConfig` CR with the required firewall settings causes a node reboot.
Be aware of this impact and schedule a maintenance window accordingly. For more information, see "Using node disruption policies to minimize disruption from machine config changes".

[NOTE]
====
Node disruption policies are available in {product-title} 4.17 and later.
====

* Network flow matrix: For more information about managing ingress traffic, see {product-title} network flow matrix.
You can restrict ingress traffic to essential flows to improve network security.
The matrix provides insights into base cluster services but excludes traffic generated by Day-2 Operators.

* Cluster version updates and upgrades: Exercise caution when updating or upgrading {product-title} clusters.
Recent changes to the platform's firewall requirements might require adjustments to network port permissions.
While the documentation provides guidelines, note that these requirements can evolve over time.
To minimize disruptions, you should test any updates or upgrades in a staging environment before applying them in production.
This helps you to identify and address potential compatibility issues related to firewall configuration changes.

Limits and requirements::
* Rootless DPDK pods requires the following additional configuration:
** Configure the `container_t` SELinux context for the tap plugin.
** Enable the `container_use_devices` SELinux boolean for the cluster host.

Engineering considerations::
* For rootless DPDK pod support, enable the SELinux `container_use_devices` boolean on the host to allow the tap device to be created.
This introduces an acceptable security risk.
