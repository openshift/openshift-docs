= Configuration for scraping custom metrics

Custom metrics scraping is performed by an instance of Prometheus purposed for user workload monitoring. After you enable user workload monitoring and create the application, you need a configuration that defines how the monitoring stack will scrape the metrics.

The following sample configuration defines the `ksvc` for your application and configures the service monitor. The exact configuration depends on your application and how it exports the metrics.
