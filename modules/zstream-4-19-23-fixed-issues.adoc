= Fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
The following issues are fixed with this release:

* Before this update, the console relied on the full name for user identification, which created potential ambiguity when users shared similar names. With this release, the display logic is updated to prioritize unique identifiers. As a result, the console now shows the user name instead of the full name as the display name. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-70335[OCPBUGS-70335])

* Before this update, the CA certificate reference to `HelmChartRepository` caused chart installation failure. As a consequence, Helm Chart installation failed because it could not find the chart. With this release, the issue has been fixed. As a result, the CA certificate configuration no longer breaks the Helm Chart installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-72399[OCPBUGS-72399])
