= About Using the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator

To use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA), you create a VPA custom resource (CR) for a workload object in your cluster. The VPA learns and applies the optimal CPU and memory resources for the pods associated with that workload object. You can use a VPA with a deployment, stateful set, job, daemon set, replica set, or replication controller workload object. The VPA CR must be in the same project as the pods you want to monitor.

You use the VPA CR to associate a workload object and specify which mode the VPA operates in:

* The `Auto` and `Recreate` modes automatically apply the VPA CPU and memory recommendations throughout the pod lifetime. The VPA deletes any pods in the project that are out of alignment with its recommendations. When redeployed by the workload object, the VPA updates the new pods with its recommendations.
* The `Initial` mode automatically applies VPA recommendations only at pod creation.
* The `Off` mode only provides recommended resource limits and requests, allowing you to manually apply the recommendations. The `off` mode does not update pods.

You can also use the CR to opt-out certain containers from VPA evaluation and updates.

For example, a pod has the following limits and requests:

[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 1
    memory: 500Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 100Mi
----

After creating a VPA that is set to `auto`, the VPA learns the resource usage and deletes the pod. When redeployed, the pod uses the new resource limits and requests:

[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 50m
    memory: 1250Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 25m
    memory: 262144k
----

You can view the VPA recommendations using the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vpa <vpa-name> --output yaml
----

After a few minutes, the output shows the recommendations for CPU and memory requests, similar to the following:

.Example output

        memory: 262144k

        cpu: 25m
        memory: 262144k
      upperBound:
        cpu: 262m
        memory: "274357142"
    - containerName: backend
      lowerBound:
        cpu: 12m
        memory: 131072k
      target:
        cpu: 12m
        memory: 131072k
      uncappedTarget:
        cpu: 12m
        memory: 131072k
      upperBound:
        cpu: 476m
        memory: "498558823"
...
----

The output shows the recommended resources, `target`, the minimum recommended resources, `lowerBound`, the highest recommended resources, `upperBound`, and the most recent  resource recommendations, `uncappedTarget`.

The VPA uses the `lowerBound` and `upperBound` values to determine if a pod needs to be updated. If a pod has resource requests below the `lowerBound` values or above the `upperBound` values, the VPA terminates and recreates the pod with the `target` values.

== Changing the VPA minimum value

By default, workload objects must specify a minimum of two replicas in order for the VPA to automatically delete and update their pods. As a result, workload objects that specify fewer than two replicas are not automatically acted upon by the VPA. The VPA does update new pods from these workload objects if the pods are restarted by some process external to the VPA.  You can change this cluster-wide minimum value by modifying the `minReplicas` parameter in the `VerticalPodAutoscalerController` custom resource (CR).

For example, if you set `minReplicas` to `3`, the VPA does not delete and update pods for workload objects that specify fewer than three replicas.

[NOTE]
====
If you set `minReplicas` to `1`, the VPA can delete the only pod for a workload object that specifies only one replica. You should use this setting with one-replica objects only if your workload can tolerate downtime whenever the VPA deletes a pod to adjust its resources. To avoid unwanted downtime with one-replica objects, configure the VPA CRs with the `podUpdatePolicy` set to `Initial`, which automatically updates the pod only when it is restarted by some process external to the VPA, or `Off`, which allows you to update the pod manually at an appropriate time for your application.

== Automatically applying VPA recommendations
To use the VPA to automatically update pods, create a VPA CR for a specific workload object with `updateMode` set to `Auto` or `Recreate`.

When the pods are created for the workload object, the VPA constantly monitors the containers to analyze their CPU and memory needs. The VPA deletes any pods that do not meet the VPA recommendations for CPU and memory. When redeployed, the pods use the new resource limits and requests based on the VPA recommendations, honoring any pod disruption budget set for your applications. The recommendations are added to the `status` field of the VPA CR for reference.

[NOTE]
====
By default, workload objects must specify a minimum of two replicas in order for the VPA to automatically delete their pods. Workload objects that specify fewer replicas than this minimum are not deleted. If you manually delete these pods, when the workload object redeploys the pods, the VPA does update the new pods with its recommendations. You can change this minimum by modifying the `VerticalPodAutoscalerController` object as shown shown in _Changing the VPA minimum value_.

* `Recreate`. The VPA assigns resource requests on pod creation and updates the existing pods by terminating them when the requested resources differ significantly from the new recommendation. This mode should be used rarely, only if you need to ensure that the pods are restarted whenever the resource request changes.

[NOTE]

There must be operating pods in the project before the VPA can determine recommended resources and apply the recommendations to new pods.

== Automatically applying VPA recommendations on pod creation
To use the VPA to apply the recommended resources only when a pod is first deployed, create a VPA CR for a specific workload object with `updateMode` set to `Initial`.

Then, manually delete any pods associated with the workload object that you want to use the VPA recommendations. In the `Initial` mode, the VPA does not delete pods and does not update the pods as it learns new resource recommendations.

== Manually applying VPA recommendations

To use the VPA to only determine the recommended CPU and memory values, create a VPA CR for a specific workload object with `updateMode` set to `off`.

When the pods are created for that workload object, the VPA analyzes the CPU and memory needs of the containers and records those recommendations in the `status` field of the VPA CR. The VPA does not update the pods as it determines new resource recommendations.

With the recommendations, you can edit the workload object to add CPU and memory requests, then delete and redeploy the pods using the recommended resources.

[id="nodes-pods-vertical-autoscaler-using-exempt_{context}"]
== Exempting containers from applying VPA recommendations

If your workload object has multiple containers and you do not want the VPA to evaluate and act on all of the containers, create a VPA CR for a specific workload object and add a `resourcePolicy` to opt-out specific containers.

When the VPA updates the pods with recommended resources, any containers with a `resourcePolicy` are not updated and the VPA does not present recommendations for those containers in the pod.

      mode: "Off"
----
<1> The type of workload object you want this VPA CR to manage.
<2> The name of the workload object you want this VPA CR to manage.
<3> Set the mode to `Auto`, `Recreate`, or `Off`. The `Recreate` mode should be used rarely, only if you need to ensure that the pods are restarted whenever the resource request changes.
<4> Specify the containers you want to opt-out and set `mode` to `Off`.

For example, a pod has two containers, the same resource requests and limits:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  containers:
  - name: frontend
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 500Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 100Mi
  - name: backend
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: 500Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 100Mi
# ...
----

After launching a VPA CR with the `backend` container set to opt-out, the VPA terminates and recreates the pod with the recommended resources applied only to the `frontend` container:

[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  containers:
    name: frontend
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 1250Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 25m
        memory: 262144k
...
    name: backend
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: 500Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 100Mi
...
