= Mapping storage classes with OADP

You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP)  with the Velero plugin v1.1.0 and later to change the storage class of a persistent volume (PV) during restores, by configuring a storage class mapping in the config map in the Velero namespace.

To deploy ConfigMap with OADP, use the `change-storage-class-config` field. You must change the storage class mapping based on your cloud provider.

.Procedure

[source,terminal]
----
$ cat change-storageclass.yaml
