[id="oc-mirror-updating-cluster-manifests-v2_{context}"]
= Configuring your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2

After you have mirrored your image set to the mirror registry, you must apply the generated `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS), `ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS), `CatalogSource`, and `UpdateService` resources to the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In oc-mirror plugin v2, the IDMS and ITMS files cover the entire image set, unlike the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) files in oc-mirror plugin v1. Therefore, the IDMS and ITMS files contain all images of the set even if you only add new images during incremental mirroring.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the OpenShift CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Apply the YAML files from the results directory to the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <path_to_oc_mirror_workspace>/working-dir/cluster-resources
----

.Verification

. Verify that the `ImageDigestMirrorSet` resources are successfully installed by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get imagedigestmirrorset
----

. Verify that the `ImageTagMirrorSet` resources are successfully installed by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get imagetagmirrorset
----

. Verify that the `CatalogSource` resources are successfully installed by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace
