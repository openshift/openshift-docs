== Known issues

* If you create a new subscription for a Kafka channel, or a new Kafka source, there might be a delay in the Kafka data plane becoming ready to dispatch messages after the newly created subscription or sink reports a ready status.
+
As a result, messages that are sent during the time when the data plane is not reporting a ready status might not be delivered to the subscriber or sink.
+
