= Troubleshooting issues with quering traces

When the issues remain even though you have verified that the TempoStack instance is successfully ingesting data, troubleshoot for issues with querying the data.

.Procedure

. Check the logs of the `query-frontend` pod, which runs with two containers: `query-frontend` and `querier`. Logs containing errors similar to the following indicate an error in the query path:
+
[source,terminal]
----
level=info ts=<...> caller=frontend.go:63 method=GET traceID=<...> url=/api/traces/<...> duration=<...> status=500
could not dial 10.X.X.X:3200 connection refused
----

. Review the logs of the `tempo-querier` and `tempo-queryfrontend` services to determine if either has crashed and as a result unable to communicate with each other.

. Check your network settings and policies to ensure proper communication between them.

. Review the `cortex_query_frontend_connected_clients` metric, which is exposed by the `query-frontend`. If `cortex_query_frontend_connected_clients` is greater than `0`, it is an indication than the `queriers` are connected to the `query-frontend`.
