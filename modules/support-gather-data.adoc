= Gathering data about your cluster for Red Hat Support

You can gather debugging information about your cluster by using the
`oc adm must-gather` CLI command.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* The {product-title} CLI (`oc`) installed.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.

. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command:
+
----
$ oc adm must-gather
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If this command fails, for example if you cannot schedule a Pod on your cluster, then use the `oc adm inspect` command to gather information for particular resources. Contact Red Hat Support for the recommended resources to gather.
====

. Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory that was just created
in your working directory. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux
operating system, run the following command:
+
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather.local.5421342344627712289/ <1>
----
<1> Make sure to replace `must-gather-local.5421342344627712289/` with the
actual directory name.

. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the
link:https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal].
