= Gathering data about your cluster for Red Hat Support

You can gather debugging information about your cluster by using the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} deployments, customers who are not using the Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model cannot use the `oc adm must-gather` command as it requires `cluster-admin` privileges.

* The {product-title} CLI (`oc`) is installed.

ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.
+

ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
[NOTE]
====
If your cluster is in a disconnected environment, you must take additional steps. If your mirror registry has a trusted CA, you must first add the trusted CA to the cluster. For all clusters in disconnected environments, you must import the default `must-gather` image as an image stream.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc import-image is/must-gather -n openshift
----
====
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]

. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command:
+
[source,terminal]

----
$ oc adm must-gather
----
+
ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are in a disconnected environment, use the `--image` flag as part of must-gather and point to the payload image.
====
+
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
[NOTE]
====
Because this command picks a random control plane node by default, the pod might be scheduled to a control plane node that is in the `NotReady` and `SchedulingDisabled` state.
====

.. If this command fails, for example, if you cannot schedule a pod on your cluster, then use the `oc adm inspect` command to gather information for particular resources.
+
[NOTE]
====
Contact Red Hat Support for the recommended resources to gather.
====

. Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory that was just created in your working directory. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux
operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather.local.5421342344627712289/ <1>
----
<1> Make sure to replace `must-gather-local.5421342344627712289/` with the actual directory name.

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/list[the *Customer Support* page] of the Red Hat Customer Portal.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. Attach the compressed file to the bugreport
