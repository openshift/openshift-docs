== New features

.Data Mover

The OADP Data Mover enables customers to back up Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store. When Data Mover is enabled, you can restore stateful applications, using CSI volume snapshots pulled from the object store if a failure, accidental deletion, or corruption of the cluster occurs.

Data Mover for CSI snapshots is a _Technology Preview_ feature only in OADP version 1.2.0

[IMPORTANT]
====
Data Mover for CSI snapshots is a _Technology Preview_ feature only in OADP version 1.2.0. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production level service agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support Red Hat Technology Preview features, see (get file link) Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
====

.Resource timeouts
The new `resourceTimeout` option specifies how many minutes to wait for several Velero resources before timeout. This applies for such resources as Velero CRD availability, `volumeSnapshot` deletion, and backup repository availablity. 10 minutes is the default setting.

.AWS S3 compatible backup storage providers
You can back up objects and snapshots on AWS S3 compatible
