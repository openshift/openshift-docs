[id="known-issues-1-2-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

The following issues have been highlighted as known issues in the release of OADP 1.2.0:

.Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack)

The HTTP/2 protocol is susceptible to a denial of service attack because request cancellation can reset multiple streams quickly. The server has to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection. This results in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. For a list of all OADP issues associated with this CVE, see the following link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2868?filter=12421248[Jira list].

It is advised to upgrade to OADP 1.2.3, which resolves this issue.
