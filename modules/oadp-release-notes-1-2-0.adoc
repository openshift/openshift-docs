This release has the following known issues:

.link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1933[Data Mover backups over `cephFS` (ODF 4.12) fails]
OADP 1.2.x no longer requires VolSync's privledged movers and can cause errors.

The following errors indicate a failed backup that timed out: `Error: container's runAsUser breaks non-root policy`, and `Error from server (BadRequest): container "restic" in pod "volsync-src-vsb-xxxyyy" is waiting to start: CreateContainerConfigError`.

By default, OADP uses POD/Workloads security context to backup data using Volsync/Data Mover. Also, by default, `dpa.spec.features.dataMover.volumeOptions.sourceVolumeOptions.moverSecurityContext` is set to `true`. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1933[(OADP-1933)]

[id="workarounds-1-2-0_{context}"]
=== Workarounds

The following workarounds are can be implemented for the above known issues:

//The following are examples

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-639[OADP-639] Data Mover: TLS-verification related config doesn't apply to VolSync
** Add an additional _config_ value to DPA for VSB/VSR.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1741[OADP-1741] Installing OADP into multiple namespaces and executing backups
.  *Scenario:* Three different team (A, B, and C) share an OpenShift cluster. Each team can manage its own OADP install and backups/restores:
*** Team A: 3 apps in namespace team-a1, team-a2, team
*** Team B: 2 apps in namespace tam-b2, team-b2
*** Team C: 1 app in namespace team-c1
. Install OADP into namespace _oadp-a_, _oadp-b_, and _oadp-c_.
. Perform the backup/restore in the respective namespace, verifying there are no errors.
. Verify that each team's bucket contains only the respective _team-ax_, _team-bx_, and _team-bx_ contents.
