= Applying the extra installation manifests

To apply the distributed unit (DU) configuration to the single node cluster, the following
extra installation manifests need to be included during installation:

* Enable workload partitioning.
* Other `MachineConfig` objects – There is a set of `MachineConfig` custom resources (CRs) included by default. You can choose to include these additional `MachineConfig` CRs that are unique to their environment. It is recommended, but not required, to apply these CRs during installation in order to minimize the number of reboots that can occur during post-install configuration.
