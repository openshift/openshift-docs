= Updating from {product-title} 4.12 to 4.14 with vSphere in-tree PVs

If you are using vSphere in-tree persistent volumes (PVs) and want to update from {product-title} 4.12 to 4.14, update vSphere vCenter and ESXI host to 7.0 Update 3L or 8.0 Update 2, otherwise the {product-title} updates are blocked. After updating vSphere, your {product-title} update can occur and automatic Container Storage Interface (CSI) migration for vSphere occurs automatically by default.

Alternatively, if you do not want to update vSphere, you can proceed with an {product-title} update by running *both* of the following commands to perform an administrator acknowledgment:

[source, terminal]
----
oc -n openshift-config patch cm admin-acks --patch '{"data":{"ack-4.12-kube-126-vsphere-migration-in-4.14":"true"}}' --type=merge
----

[source, terminal]
----
oc -n openshift-config patch cm admin-acks --patch '{"data":{"ack-4.13-kube-127-vsphere-migration-in-4.14":"true"}}' --type=merge
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you update to {product-title} 4.14 without updating vSphere, known issues can occur due to CSI migration being enabled by default in {product-title} 4.14. https://access.redhat.com/node/7011683[Before updating, carefully read this knowledge base article].
====

Updating from {product-title} 4.12 to 4.14 is an Extended Update Support (EUS)-to-EUS update. To understand the ramifications for this type of update and how to perform it, see the _EUS-to-EUS update_ link in the _Additional resources_ section below.
