= Updating from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14

Before you upgrade from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14, ensure that you completed certain administrator tasks before you update your cluster so that the cluster update operation is succesful. For more information, see "Preparing to update to OpenShift Container Platform 4.14" (Installing on vSphere).

If you are using vSphere in-tree persistent volumes (PVs) and want to update from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14, first update vSphere vCenter and ESXI host to 7.0 Update 3L or 8.0 Update 2, otherwise the {product-title} update is blocked. After updating vSphere, your {product-title} update can occur and automatic Container Storage Interface (CSI) migration is enabled by default.

Alternatively, if you do not want to update vSphere, you can proceed with an {product-title} update by performing an administrator acknowledgment:

[source, cli]
----
oc -n openshift-config patch cm admin-acks --patch '{"data":{"ack-4.13-kube-127-vsphere-migration-in-4.14":"true"}}' --type=merge
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do *not* update to vSphere 7.0 Update 3L or 8.0 Update 2 and use an administrator acknowledgment to update to {product-title} 4.14, known issues can occur due to CSI migration being enabled by default in {product-title} 4.14. link:https://access.redhat.com/node/7011683[Before proceeding with the administrator acknowledgement, carefully read this knowledge base article].
