[id='migration-configuring-proxy-for-dvm_{context}']
= Configuring a proxy for direct volume migration

If you are performing direct volume migration from a source cluster behind a proxy, you must configure an Stunnel proxy in the `MigrationController` custom resource (CR). Stunnel creates a transparent tunnel between the source and target clusters for the TCP connection without changing the certificates.

[NOTE]
====
Direct volume migration supports only one proxy. The source cluster cannot access the route of the target cluster if the target cluster is also behind a proxy.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must have `cluster-admin` privileges on all clusters.

.Procedure

. Log in to the cluster on which the `migration-controller` pod runs.
. Get the `MigrationController` CR manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get migration-controller <migration_controller> -n openshift-migration
----

. Add the `stunnel_tcp_proxy` parameter value to the manifest:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: migration.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: MigrationController
metadata:
  name: migration-controller
  namespace: openshift-migration
...
spec:
  stunnel_tcp_proxy: <stunnel_proxy> <1>
----
<1> Specify the Stunnel proxy: `\http://<user_name>:<password>@<ip_address>:<port>`.

. Save the manifest as `migration-controller.yaml`.
. Apply the updated manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc replace -f migration-controller.yaml -n openshift-migration
----
