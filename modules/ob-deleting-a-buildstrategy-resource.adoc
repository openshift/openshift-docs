= Deleting a buildstrategy resource

[role="_abstract"]
You can delete a `buildstrategy` resource created by the `Buildah`, `source-to-image` (S2I), and `Buildpacks` build processes if it is not required in your project. Deleting the resources helps you clean up build configurations that are no longer required in your project.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the `oc` CLI.

.Procedure

* Delete a `buildstrategy` resource by using the `oc` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete buildstrategy <buildstartegy_resource_name> # <1>
----
<1> Replace <buildstartegy_resource_name> with the name of the `buildstrategy` resource.
