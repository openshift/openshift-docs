$ oc delete buildstrategy <buildstrategy_resource_name>
----
+
where:

`<buildstrategy_resource_name>`:: Specifies the name of the `buildstrategy` resource.

.Verification

* Verify that the `buildstrategy` resource is deleted by using the `oc` CLI or `shp` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get buildstrategy | grep <buildstrategy_resource_name>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp buildstrategy list | grep <buildstrategy_resource_name>
