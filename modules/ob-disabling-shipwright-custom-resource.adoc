= Disabling a ShipwrightBuild resource

You can disable only the Shipwright Custom Resource (CR) without disabling the shared-resources CSI driver component. Disabling Shipwright CR removes the shipwright-build-controller and shipwright-build-webhook pods from the openshift-builds namespace.


.Procedure

. Disable the Shipwright CR from the openshift-builds namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch openshiftbuild cluster -n openshift-builds --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"shipwright":{"build":{"state":"Disabled"}}}}'
----
+

The above command disables only the Shipwright CR and does not affect the Shipwright Custom Resource Definition (CRD).
