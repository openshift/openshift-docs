= Querying metrics

The {product-title} monitoring dashboard enables you to run Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries to examine metrics visualized on a plot. This functionality provides information about the state of a cluster and any user-defined workloads that you are monitoring.

As a *cluster administrator*, you can query metrics for all core {product-title} and user-defined projects.

As a *developer*, you must specify a project name when querying metrics. You must have the required privileges to view metrics for the selected project.
