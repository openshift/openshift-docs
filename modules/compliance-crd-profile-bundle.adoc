= ProfileBundle object
When you install the Compliance Operator, it includes ready-to-run `ProfileBundle` objects. The Compliance Operator parses the `ProfileBundle` object and creates a `Profile` object for each profile in the bundle. It also parses `Rule` and `Variable` objects, which are used by the `Profile` object.


.Example `ProfileBundle` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ProfileBundle
  name: <profile bundle name>
  namespace: openshift-compliance
status:
  dataStreamStatus: VALID <1>
----
<1> Indicates whether the Compliance Operator was able to parse the content files.

[NOTE]
====
When the `contentFile` fails, an `errorMessage` attribute appears, which provides details of the error that occurred.

.Troubleshooting

When you roll back to a known content image from an invalid image, the `ProfileBundle` object stops responding and displays `PENDING` state. As a workaround, you can move to a different image than the previous one. Alternatively, you can delete and re-create the `ProfileBundle` object to return to the working state.
