= FIPS-enabled hosted clusters

The binaries for {hcp} are FIPs-compliant, with the exception of the {hcp} command-line interface, `hcp`.

If you want to deploy a FIPS-enabled hosted cluster, you must use a FIPS-enabled management cluster. To enable FIPS mode for your management cluster, you must run the installation program from a {op-system-base-full} computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on {op-system-base}, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/switching-rhel-to-fips-mode_security-hardening[Switching {op-system-base} to FIPS mode].

When running {op-system-base} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.

After you set up your management cluster in FIPS mode, the hosted cluster creation process runs on that management cluster.
