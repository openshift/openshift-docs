= Installing the Multiarch Tuning Operator by using the web console

You can install the Multiarch Tuning Operator by using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have access to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.
. Navigate to *Operators -> OperatorHub*.
. Enter *Multiarch Tuning Operator* in the search field.
. Click *Multiarch Tuning Operator*.
. Select the *Multiarch Tuning Operator* version from the *Version* list.
. Click *Install*
. Set the following options on the *Operator Installation* page:
.. Set *Update Channel* to *tech-preview*.
.. Set *Installation Mode* to *All namespaces on the cluster*.
.. Set *Installed Namespace* to *Operator recommended Namespace* or *Select a Namespace*.
+
The recommended Operator namespace is `openshift-multiarch-tuning-operator`. If the `openshift-multiarch-tuning-operator` namespace does not exist, it is created during the operator installation.
+
If you select *Select a namespace*, you must select a namespace for the Operator from the *Select Project* list.
.. *Update approval* as *Automatic* or *Manual*.
+
If you select *Automatic* updates, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically updates the running instance of the Multiarch Tuning Operator without any intervention.
+
If you select *Manual* updates, OLM creates an update request.
As a cluster administrator, you must manually approve the update request to update the Multiarch Tuning Operator to a newer version.

. Optional: Select the *Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace* checkbox.
