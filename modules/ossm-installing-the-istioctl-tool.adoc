= Installing the Istioctl tool

Install the `istioctl` command-line utility to debug and diagnose {istio} service mesh deployments.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {ocp-product-title} web console.

* The {SMProduct} 3 Operator is installed and running.

* You have created at least one `Istio` resource.

.Procedure

. Confirm which version of the `Istio` resource runs on the installation by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get istio -ojsonpath="{range .items[*]}{.spec.version}{'\n'}{end}" | sed s/^v// | sort
----
+
If there are multiple `Istio` resources with different versions, choose the latest version. The latest version is displayed last.

. In the {ocp-product-title} web console, click the *Help* icon and select *Command Line Tools*.

. Click *Download istioctl*. Choose the version and architecture that matches your system.

----
$ tar xzf istioctl-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz
----

.. If you are using an Apple Mac operating system, unpack and extract the archive.

.. If you are using a Microsoft Windows operating system, use the zip software to extract the archive.

. Move to the uncompressed directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd istioctl-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>
----

. Add the `istioctl` client to the path by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
----

. Confirm that the `istioctl` client version and the {istio} control plane version match or are within one version by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ istioctl version
----
+
