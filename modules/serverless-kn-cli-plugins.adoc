= kn plug-ins

The `kn` CLI supports the use of plug-ins, which enable you to extend the functionality of your `kn` installation by adding custom commands and other shared commands that are not part of the core distribution. `kn` CLI plug-ins are used in the same way as the main `kn` functionality.

Currently, Red Hat supports the `kn-source-kafka` plug-in.
