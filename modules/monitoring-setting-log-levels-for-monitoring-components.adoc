= Setting log levels for monitoring components

You can configure the log level for
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
Alertmanager, Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, Thanos Querier, and Thanos Ruler.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
Alertmanager, Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, and Thanos Ruler.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

The following log levels can be applied to the relevant component in the
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
`cluster-monitoring-config` and
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
`user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` objects:

* `debug`. Log debug, informational, warning, and error messages.
* `info`. Log informational, warning, and error messages.
* `warn`. Log warning and error messages only.
* `error`. Log error messages only.

The default log level is `info`.

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* *If you are setting a log level for Alertmanager, Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, or Thanos Querier in the `openshift-monitoring` project*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are setting a log level for Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, or Thanos Ruler in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* The `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object exists. This object is created by default when the cluster is created.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the `ConfigMap` object:
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
** *To set a log level for a component in the `openshift-monitoring` project*:
.. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

.. Add `logLevel: <log_level>` for a component under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: <1>
      logLevel: <log_level> <2>
----
<1> The monitoring stack component for which you are setting a log level.
For default platform monitoring, available component values are `prometheusK8s`, `alertmanagerMain`, `prometheusOperator`, and `thanosQuerier`.
<2> The log level to set for the component.
The available values are `error`, `warn`, `info`, and `debug`.
The default value is `info`.

** *To set a log level for a component in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project*:
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

.. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

.. Add `logLevel: <log_level>` for a component under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: <1>
      logLevel: <log_level> <2>
----
<1> The monitoring stack component for which you are setting a log level.
For user workload monitoring, available component values are `alertmanager`, `prometheus`, `prometheusOperator`, and `thanosRuler`.
<2> The log level to apply to the component. The available values are `error`, `warn`, `info`, and `debug`. The default value is `info`.

. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods for the component restart automatically when you apply the log-level change.
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to a monitoring config map, the pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
====

. Confirm that the log-level has been applied by reviewing the deployment or pod configuration in the related project. The following example checks the log level in the `prometheus-operator` deployment in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get deploy prometheus-operator -o yaml | grep "log-level"
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
        - --log-level=debug
----

. Check that the pods for the component are running. The following example lists the status of pods in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get pods
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If an unrecognized `logLevel` value is included in the `ConfigMap` object, the pods for the component might not restart successfully.
