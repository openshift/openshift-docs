= Setting log levels for monitoring components

You can configure the log level for Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, Alertmanager and Thanos Ruler.

The following log levels can be applied to each of those components in the `cluster-monitoring-config` and `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMaps:

* `debug`. Log debug, informational, warning, and error messages.
* `info`. Log informational, warning, and error messages.
* `warn`. Log warning and error messages only.
* `error`. Log error messages only.

The default log level is `info`.

.Prerequisites

* *If you are setting a log level for Prometheus Operator or Prometheus in the `openshift-monitoring` project*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are setting a log level for Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, or Thanos Ruler in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the ConfigMap:
** *To set a log level for a component in the `openshift-monitoring` project*:
.. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

.. Add `logLevel: <log_level>` for a component under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: <1>
      logLevel: <log_level> <2>
----
<1> The monitoring component that you are applying a log level to.
<2> The log level to apply to the component.

** *To set a log level for a component in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project*:
.. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

.. Add `logLevel: <log_level>` for a component under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: <1>
      logLevel: <log_level> <2>
----
<1> The monitoring component that you are applying a log level to.
<2> The log level to apply to the component.

. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods for the component restarts automatically when you apply the log-level change.
+
[NOTE]
====
Configurations applied to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap are not activated unless a cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to a monitoring ConfigMap, the pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
====

. Confirm that the log-level has been applied by reviewing the deployment or pod configuration in the related project. The following example checks the log level in the `prometheus-operator` deployment in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get deploy prometheus-operator -o yaml |  grep "log-level"
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
        - --log-level=debug
----

. Check that the pods for the component are running. The following example lists the status of pods in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get pods
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If an unrecognized `loglevel` value is included in the ConfigMap, the pods for the component might not restart successfully.
