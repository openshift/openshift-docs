[id="serverless-creating-broker-admin_{context}"]
= Creating a broker automatically using namespace annotation

If you have cluster administrator permissions, you can create a broker automatically by annotating a namespace.

.Prerequisites
* Knative Eventing installed.
* Cluster administrator permissions for {product-title}.

.Procedure

. Annotate your namespace by entering the following commands:
+
----
$ oc label namespace default knative-eventing-injection=enabled <1>
$ oc -n default get broker default
----
<1>  Replace `default` with the desired namespace.
+
The line shown in this example will automatically create a broker named `default` in the `default` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
Brokers created due to annotation will not be removed if you remove the annotation. You must manually delete them.
