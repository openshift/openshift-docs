= Creating a broker automatically using namespace annotation

If you have cluster administrator permissions, you can create a broker automatically by annotating a namespace.

.Prerequisites

* Knative Eventing is installed on your cluster.
* You have cluster administrator permissions.

.Procedure

. Annotate your namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label namespace default knative-eventing-injection=enabled <1>
----
<1>  Replace `default` with the desired namespace.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n default get broker default
----
+
The line shown in this example will automatically create a broker named `default` in the `default` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
Brokers created due to annotation will not be removed if you remove the annotation. You must manually delete them.
