= Configuring the advertise address network flag

[role="_abstract"]
The `apiserver.advertiseAddress` flag specifies the IP address on which to advertise the API server to members of the node. This address must be reachable by the node. You can set a custom IP address here, but you must also add the IP address to a host interface. Customizing this parameter preempts {microshift-short} from adding a default IP address to the `br-ex` network interface.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you customize the `advertiseAddress` IP address, make sure it is reachable by the node when {microshift-short} starts by adding the IP address to a host interface.
====

If unset, the default value is set to the next immediate subnet after the service network. For example, when the service network is `10.43.0.0/16`, the `advertiseAddress` is set to `10.44.0.0/32`.
