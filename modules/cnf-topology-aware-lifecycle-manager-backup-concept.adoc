= Creating a backup of cluster resources before upgrade

For {sno}, the {cgu-operator-first} can create a backup of a deployment before an upgrade. If the upgrade fails, you can recover the previous version and restore a cluster to a working state without requiring a reprovision of applications.

To use the backup feature you first create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `backup` field set to `true`. To ensure that the contents of the backup are up to date, the backup is not taken until you set the `enable` field in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR to `true`.

{cgu-operator} uses the `BackupSucceeded` condition to report the status and reasons as follows:

* `true`
+
Backup is completed for all clusters or the backup run has completed but failed for one or more clusters. If backup fails for any cluster, the update does not proceed for that cluster.
* `false`
+
Backup is still in progress for one or more clusters or has failed for all clusters. The backup process running in the spoke clusters can have the following statuses:
+
** `PreparingToStart`
+
The first reconciliation pass is in progress. The {cgu-operator} deletes any spoke backup namespace and hub view resources that have been created in a failed upgrade attempt.
** `Starting`
+
The backup prerequisites and backup job are being created.
** `Active`
+
The backup is in progress.
** `Succeeded`
+
The backup succeeded.
** `BackupTimeout`
+
Artifact backup is partially done.
** `UnrecoverableError`
+
The backup has ended with a non-zero exit code.

[NOTE]
====
If the backup of a cluster fails and enters the `BackupTimeout` or `UnrecoverableError` state, the cluster update does not proceed for that cluster. Updates to other clusters are not affected and continue.
