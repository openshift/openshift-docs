= Creating a backup of cluster resources before upgrade

For {sno}, the {cgu-operator-first} can create a backup of a deployment before an upgrade. If the upgrade fails, you can recover the previous version and restore a cluster to a working state without requiring a reprovision of applications.

The container image backup starts when the `backup` field is set to `true` in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.

The backup process can be in the following statuses:

`BackupStatePreparingToStart`:: The first reconciliation pass is in progress. The {cgu-operator} deletes any spoke backup namespace and hub view resources that have been created in a failed upgrade attempt.
`BackupStateStarting`:: The backup prerequisites and backup job are being created.
`BackupStateActive`:: The backup is in progress.
`BackupStateSucceeded`:: The backup has succeeded.
`BackupStateTimeout`:: Artifact backup has been partially done.
`BackupStateError`:: The backup has ended with a non-zero exit code.
[NOTE]
====
If the backup fails and enters the `BackupStateTimeout` or `BackupStateError` state, the cluster upgrade does not proceed.
