= Creating a PostgreSQL database instance

To create a PostgreSQL database instance, you must create a `PostgresCluster` custom resource (CR) and configure the database.

.Procedure

. Create the `PostgresCluster` CR in the `my-petclinic` namespace by running the following command in shell:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -n my-petclinic -f - << EOD

The annotations added in this `PostgresCluster` CR help in enabling the service binding connection and trigger the Operator reconciliation.

. After you have created the database instance, ensure that all the pods in `my-petclinic` namespace are running (it will take a few minutes):

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n my-petclinic
