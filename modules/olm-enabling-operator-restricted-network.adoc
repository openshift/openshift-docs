[id="olm-enabling-operator-for-restricted-network_{context}"]
= Enabling your Operator for restricted network environments

As an Operator author, your Operator must meet additional requirements to run properly in a restricted network, or disconnected, environment.

.Operator requirements for supporting disconnected mode

* In the cluster service version (CSV) of your Operator:
** List any _related images_, or other container images that your Operator might require to perform their functions.
** Reference all specified images by a digest (SHA) and not by a tag.
* All dependencies of your Operator must also support running in a disconnected mode.
* Your Operator must not require any off-cluster resources.
// TODO: Include more info w/ better steps on how to do this:
//* You must understand the {product-title} proxy configuration.

For the CSV requirements, you can make the following changes as the Operator author.

.Prerequisites

* An Operator project with a CSV.

.Procedure

. Use SHA references to related images in two places in the CSV for your Operator:

.. Update `spec.relatedImages`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  relatedImages: <1>
    - name: etcd-operator <2>
      image: quay.io/etcd-operator/operator@sha256:d134a9865524c29fcf75bbc4469013bc38d8a15cb5f41acfddb6b9e492f556e4 <3>
    - name: etcd-image
      image: quay.io/etcd-operator/etcd@sha256:13348c15263bd8838ec1d5fc4550ede9860fcbb0f843e48cbccec07810eebb68
...
----
<1> Create a `relatedImages` section and set the list of related images.
<2> Specify a unique identifier for the image.
<3> Specify each image by a digest (SHA), not by an image tag.

.. Update the `env` section in the deployment when declaring environment variables that inject the image that the Operator should use:
+
[source,yaml]
----

  install:
    spec:
      deployments:

<1> Inject the images referenced by the Operator by using environment variables.
<2> Specify each image by a digest (SHA), not by an image tag.
<3> Also reference the Operator container image by a digest (SHA), not by an image tag.
--
+
[NOTE]
====
When configuring probes, the `timeoutSeconds` value must be lower than the `periodSeconds` value. The `timeoutSeconds` default value is `1`. The `periodSeconds` default value is `10`.
====

. Add the `disconnected` annotation, which indicates that the Operator works in a disconnected environment:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    operators.openshift.io/infrastructure-features: '["disconnected"]'
----
+
Operators can be filtered in OperatorHub by this infrastructure feature.
