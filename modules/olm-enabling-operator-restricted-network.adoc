[id="olm-enabling-operator-for-restricted-network_{context}"]
= Enabling your Operator for restricted network environments

As an Operator author, your Operator must meet  additional requirements to run
properly in a restricted network, or disconnected, environment.

.Operator requirements for supporting disconnected mode

* In the ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) of your Operator:
** List any _related images_, or other container images that your Operator might
require to perform their functions.
** Reference all specified images by a digest (SHA) and not by a tag.
* All dependencies of your Operator must also support running in a disconnected
mode.
* Your Operator must not require any off-cluster resources.
// TODO: Include more info w/ better steps on how to do this:
//* You must understand the {product-title} proxy configuration.

For the CSV requirements, you can make the following changes as the Operator
author.

.Prerequisites

* An Operator project with a CSV.

.Procedure

. Use SHA references to related images in two places in the CSV for your Operator:

.. Update `spec.relatedImages`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  relatedImages: <1>
    - name: etcd-operator <2>
      image: quay.io/etcd-operator/operator@sha256:d134a9865524c29fcf75bbc4469013bc38d8a15cb5f41acfddb6b9e492f556e4 <3>
    - name: etcd-image
      image: quay.io/etcd-operator/etcd@sha256:13348c15263bd8838ec1d5fc4550ede9860fcbb0f843e48cbccec07810eebb68
...
----
<1> Create a `relatedImages` section and set the list of related images.
<2> Specify a unique identifier for the image.
<3> Specify each image by a digest (SHA), not by an image tag.

.. Update the `env` section of the Operators Deployments when declaring environment
variables that inject the image that the Operator should use:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  install:
    spec:
      deployments:
      - name: etcd-operator-v3.1.1
        spec:

          selector:
            matchLabels:

              containers:
              - args:

                  periodSeconds: 30
                name: etcd-operator
                readinessProbe:
                  httpGet:
                    path: /ready
                    port: 8080
                  initialDelaySeconds: 10

                resources: {}
              serviceAccountName: etcd-operator
    strategy: deployment
----
<1> Inject the images referenced by the Operator via environment variables.
<2> Specify each image by a digest (SHA), not by an image tag.
<3> Also reference the Operator container image by a digest (SHA), not by an image tag.

. Add the `Disconnected` annotation, which indicates that the Operator works in a
disconnected environment:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    operators.openshift.io/infrastructure-features: '["Disconnected"]'
----
+
Operators can be filtered in OperatorHub by this infrastructure feature.
