|Customer responsibilities

|Customer data
|* Maintain platform-level standards for data encryption.
* Provide OpenShift components to help manage application data, such as secrets.
* Enable integration with third-party data services (such as AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL) to store and manage data outside of the cluster and/or cloud provider.
|Maintain responsibility for all customer data stored on the platform and how customer applications consume and expose this data.

|Customer applications
|* Provision clusters with OpenShift components installed so that customers can access the OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs to deploy and manage containerized applications.
* Create clusters with image pull secrets so that customer deployments can pull images from the Red Hat Container Catalog registry.
* Provide access to OpenShift APIs that a customer can use to set up Operators to add community, third-party, and Red Hat services to the cluster.
* Provide storage classes and plug-ins to support persistent volumes for use with customer applications.
|* Maintain responsibility for customer and third-party applications, data, and their complete lifecycle.
* If a customer adds Red Hat, community, third-party, their own, or other services to the cluster by using Operators or external images, the customer is responsible for these services and for working with the appropriate provider (including Red Hat) to troubleshoot any issues.
* Use the provided tools and features to configure and deploy; keep up-to-date; set up resource requests and limits; size the cluster to have enough resources to run apps; set up permissions; integrate with other services; manage any image streams or templates that the customer deploys; externally serve; save, back up, and restore data; and otherwise manage their highly available and resilient workloads.
* Maintain responsibility for monitoring the applications run on OpenShift Dedicated; including installing and operating software to gather metrics and create alerts.

|Developer services (CodeReady)
|Make CodeReady Workspaces available as an add-on through OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM).
|Install, secure, and operate CodeReady Workspaces and the Developer CLI.
