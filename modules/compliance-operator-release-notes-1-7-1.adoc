== Bug fixes

* Previously, the Compliance Operator's `pauser` container could be terminated due to running out of memory, showing the status `OOMKilled). With this update, the memory limit for the `pauser` container is increased to prevent the error and improve overall stability. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-50924[OCPBUGS-50924])
