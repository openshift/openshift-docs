= Configuring CPU and memory limits

The {logging} components allow for adjustments to both the CPU and memory limits.

.Procedure

. Edit the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) in the `openshift-logging` project:

<1> Specify the CPU and memory limits and requests for the log store as needed. For Elasticsearch, you must adjust both the request value and the limit value.
<2> Specify the CPU and memory limits and requests for the log visualizer as needed.
<3> Specify the CPU and memory limits and requests for the log collector as needed.
