[id="adminnetworkpolicy-actions-for-rules_{context}"]
= AdminNetworkPolicy actions for rules
As an administrator, you can set `Allow`, `Deny`, or `Pass` as the `action` field for your `AdminNetworkPolicy` rules. Because OVN-Kubernetes uses a tiered ACLs to evaluate network traffic rules, ANP allow you to set very strong policy rules that can only be changed by an administrator modifying them, deleting the rule, or overriding them by setting a higher priority rule.

[id="adminnetworkpolicy-allow-example_{context}"]
== AdminNetworkPolicy Allow example
The following ANP that is defined at priority 9 ensures all ingress traffic is allowed from the `monitoring` namespace towards any tenant (all other namespaces) in the cluster.


.Example YAML file for a strong `Allow` ANP
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: AdminNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-monitoring
spec:
  priority: 9
  subject:
    namespaces: {} # Use the empty selector with caution because it also selects OpenShift namespaces as well.
  ingress:
  - name: "allow-ingress-from-monitoring"
    action: "Allow"
    from:
    - namespaces:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring
# ...
----
====
This is an example of a strong `Allow` ANP because it is non-overridable by all the parties involved. No tenants can block themselves from being monitored using `NetworkPolicy` objects and the monitoring tenant also has no say in what it can or cannot monitor.

[discrete]
[id="adminnetworkpolicy-deny-example_{context}"]
== AdminNetworkPolicy Deny example
The following ANP that is defined at priority 5 ensures all ingress traffic from the `monitoring` namespace is blocked towards restricted tenants (namespaces that have labels `security: restricted`).

.Example YAML file for a strong `Deny` ANP
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: AdminNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: block-monitoring
spec:
  priority: 5
  subject:
    namespaces:
      matchLabels:
        security: restricted
  ingress:
  - name: "deny-ingress-from-monitoring"
    action: "Deny"
    from:
    - namespaces:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring
# ...
----
====
This is a strong `Deny` ANP that is non-overridable by all the parties involved. The restricted tenant owners cannot authorize themselves to allow monitoring traffic, and the infrastructure’s monitoring service cannot scrape anything from these sensitive namespaces.

When combined with the strong `Allow` example, the `block-monitoring` ANP has a lower priority value giving it higher precedence, which ensures restricted tenants are never monitored.

[id="adminnetworkpolicy-pass-example_{context}"]
== AdminNetworkPolicy Pass example
The following ANP that is defined at priority 7 ensures all ingress traffic from the `monitoring` namespace towards internal infrastructure tenants (namespaces that have labels `security: internal`) are passed on to tier 2 of the ACLs and evaluated by the namespaces’ `NetworkPolicy` objects.

.Example YAML file for a strong `Pass` ANP
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: AdminNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: pass-monitoring
spec:
  priority: 7
  subject:
    namespaces:
      matchLabels:
        security: internal
  ingress:
  - name: "pass-ingress-from-monitoring"
    action: "Pass"
    from:
    - namespaces:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring
# ...
----
====

This example is a strong `Pass` action ANP because it delegates the decision to `NetworkPolicy` objects defined by tenant owners. This `pass-monitoring` ANP allows all tenant owners grouped at security level `internal` to choose if their metrics should be scraped by the infrastructures' monitoring service using namespace scoped `NetworkPolicy` objects.

//We will need to put this in for 4.16 when the module on best practices are created.
//For more information an example of how to use `NetworkPolicy` to create multi-tenancy policies using ANP and BANP, see "BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy multi-tenancy example".
