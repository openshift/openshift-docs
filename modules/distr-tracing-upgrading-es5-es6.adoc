[id="distr-tracing-upgrading-es5-es6_{context}"]
= Upgrading from Elasticsearch 5 to 6

When updating from Elasticsearch 5 to 6, you must delete your {JaegerShortName} instance, and then recreate the {JaegerShortName} instance because of an issue with certificates. Re-creating the {JaegerShortName} instance triggers the creation of a new set of certificates. If you are using persistent storage, the same volumes can be mounted for the new {JaegerShortName} instance as long as the {JaegerShortName} name and namespace for the new {JaegerShortName} instance are the same as the deleted {JaegerShortName} instance.

.Procedure if {JaegerShortName} is installed as part of {SMProductName}

. Determine the name of your Jaeger custom resource file by running the following command. In this example, `istio-system` is the control plane namespace.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get jaeger -n <istio-system>
----
+
You will see output similar to the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME    STATUS   VERSION    STRATEGY     STORAGE         AGE
jaeger  Running  1.24.1     production   elasticsearch   d21h
----

. Copy the generated custom resource file into a temporary directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get jaeger jaeger -oyaml -n <istio-system> > /tmp/jaeger-cr.yaml
----

. Delete the {JaegerShortName} instance by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete jaeger jaeger -n <istio-system>
----

. Recreate the {JaegerShortName} instance from your copy of the custom resource file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f /tmp/jaeger-cr.yaml -n <istio-system>
----

. Delete the copy of the generated custom resource file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rm /tmp/jaeger-cr.yaml
----


.Procedure if {JaegerShortName} not installed as part of {SMProductName}

Before you begin, create a copy of your Jaeger custom resource file.

. Run the following command to delete the Jaeger custom resource file, which deletes the {JaegerShortName} instance:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f <jaeger-cr-file>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f jaeger-prod-elasticsearch.yaml
----

. Recreate your {JaegerShortName} instance from the backup copy of your custom resource file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <jaeger-cr-file>
----

. Validate that your pods have restarted by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n <tracing-system> -w
----
