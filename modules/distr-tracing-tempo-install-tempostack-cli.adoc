[id="distr-tracing-tempo-install-tempostack-cli_{context}"]
= Installing a TempoStack instance by using the CLI

You can install a TempoStack instance from the command line.

.Prerequisites

* An active {oc-first} session by a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.
+
[TIP]
====
* Ensure that your {oc-first} version is up to date and matches your {product-title} version.

* Run the `oc login` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --username=<your_username>
----
====

* You have completed setting up the required object storage by a supported provider: link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation[{odf-full}], link:https://min.io/[MinIO], link:https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3], link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/[Azure Blob Storage], link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Google Cloud Storage]. For more information, see "Object storage setup".
+
[WARNING]
====
Object storage is required and not included with the {TempoShortName}. You must choose and set up object storage by a supported provider before installing the {TempoShortName}.
====

* You have defined one or more tenants and configured the read and write permissions. For more information, see "Configuring the read permissions for tenants" and "Configuring the write permissions for tenants".

.Procedure

. Run the following command to create a project of your choice for the TempoStack instance that you will create in a subsequent step:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
  name: <project_of_tempostack_instance>
EOF
----

. In the project that you created for the TempoStack instance, create a secret for your object storage bucket by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f - << EOF
<object_storage_secret>
EOF
----
+
For more information, see "Object storage setup".
+
--
include::snippets/distr-tracing-tempo-secret-example.adoc[]
--

. Create a TempoStack instance in the project that you created for it:
+
[NOTE]
====
You can create multiple TempoStack instances in separate projects on the same cluster.
====

.. Customize the `TempoStack` custom resource (CR):
+
--
include::snippets/distr-tracing-tempo-tempostack-custom-resource.adoc[]
--

.. Apply the customized CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f - << EOF
<tempostack_cr>
EOF
----

.Verification

. Verify that the `status` of all TempoStack `components` is `Running` and the `conditions` are `type: Ready` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get tempostacks.tempo.grafana.com simplest -o yaml
----

. Verify that all the TempoStack component pods are running by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----

. Access the Tempo console:

.. Query the route details by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get route
----

.. Open `\https://<route_from_previous_step>` in a web browser.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Tempo console initially shows no trace data following the Tempo console installation.
