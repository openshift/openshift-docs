= Overview of the {product-title} cloud deployment options

{product-title} offers {OCP} clusters as a managed service on {AWS} or {GCP}.

Through the Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model, you can deploy clusters in an existing AWS or GCP cloud account that you own. 

Alternatively, you can install {product-title} in a cloud account that is owned by Red Hat.

== Deploying clusters using the Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model

The Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model enables you to deploy Red Hat managed {product-title} clusters in an existing AWS or GCP account that you own. Red Hat requires several prerequisites be met in order to provide this service, and this service is supported by Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SRE).

In the CCS model, the customer pays the cloud infrastructure provider directly for cloud costs, and the cloud infrastructure account is part of an organization owned by the customer, with specific access granted to Red Hat. In this model, the customer pays Red Hat for the CCS subscription and pays the cloud provider for the cloud costs.

By using the CCS model, you can use the services that are provided by your cloud provider, in addition to the services provided by Red Hat.

== Deploying clusters in Red Hat cloud accounts

As an alternative to the CCS model, you can deploy {product-title} clusters in AWS or GCP cloud accounts that are owned by Red Hat. With this model, Red Hat is responsible for the cloud account and the cloud infrastructure costs are paid directly by Red Hat. The customer only pays the Red Hat subscription costs.
