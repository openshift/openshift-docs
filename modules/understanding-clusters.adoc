= Understanding your cluster cloud options

{product-title} offers {OCP} clusters as a managed service on {AWS} or {GCP}. You can purchase a standard cluster through Red Hat. Alternatively, you can use your existing cloud account through the Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model to leverage discounts.

== Standard clusters

Standard {product-title} clusters are deployed into their own AWS or GCP infrastructure accounts, each owned by Red Hat. Red Hat is responsible for the account, and the cloud infrastructure costs are paid directly by Red Hat. The customer only pays the Red Hat subscription costs.

== Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS)
The Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model enables Red Hat to deploy and manage {product-title} clusters in an existing AWS or GCP account owned by the customer. Red Hat requires several prerequisites be met in order to provide this service, and this service is supported by Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SRE).

In the CCS model, the customer pays the cloud infrastructure provider directly for cloud costs, and the cloud infrastructure account is part of a customerâ€™s organization, with specific access granted to Red Hat. In this model, the customer pays Red Hat for the CCS subscription and pays the cloud provider for the cloud costs.
