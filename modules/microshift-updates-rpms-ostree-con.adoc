= {microshift-short} updates on an {op-system-ostree} system

Updating {microshift-short} on a {op-system-ostree-first} system requires building a new {op-system-ostree} image containing the new version of {microshift-short} and any associated optional RPMs. After you create the `rpm-ostree` image with {microshift-short} embedded, you can boot into that operating system image.

The procedures are the same for minor-version and patch updates. For example, use the same steps to upgrade from 4.18 to 4.19 or from 4.19.2 to 4.19.3. The following details apply:

* Back up and system rollback are automatic with this update type.
* You can use the following workflow to update applications running in the {microshift-short} cluster. Ensure compatibilities between the application and the adjacent versions of {microshift-short} and {op-system-ostree} before starting an update.
* Downgrades other than automatic rollbacks are not supported. The following procedure is for updates only.

The steps you use depends on how your existing deployment is set up. The following procedure outlines the general steps you can take, with links to the {op-system-ostree} documentation. The {op-system-ostree} documentation is your resource for specific details on building an updated operating system image.
