= {microshift-short} updates on an {op-system-ostree} system

[role="_abstract"]
Updating {microshift-short} on a {op-system-ostree-first} system requires building a new {op-system-ostree} image containing the new version of {microshift-short} and any associated optional RPMs.

After you create the `rpm-ostree` image with {microshift-short} embedded, you can boot into that operating system image.

The procedures are the same for minor-version and patch updates. For example, use the same steps to upgrade from 4.20 to 4.21 or from 4.21.2 to 4.21.3. The following details apply:

* Back up and system rollback are automatic with this update type.
* You can use the following workflow to update applications running in the {microshift-short} node. Ensure compatibilities between the application and the adjacent versions of {microshift-short} and {op-system-ostree} before starting an update.
* Downgrades other than automatic rollbacks are not supported. The following procedure is for updates only.

====
The steps you use depends on how your existing deployment is set up. The following procedure outlines the general steps you can take, with links to the {op-system-ostree} documentation. The {op-system-ostree} documentation is your resource for specific details on building an updated operating system image.
