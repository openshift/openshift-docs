= Control plane and compute machines

By default, the {product-title} installation program stands up three control
plane and compute machines.

Each machine requires:

* An instance from the {rh-openstack} quota
* A port from the {rh-openstack} quota
* A flavor with at least 16 GB memory, 4 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space

[TIP]
====
Compute machines host the applications that you run on {product-title}; aim to
run as many as you can.

// == Compute machines

// By default, the {product-title} installation program stands up three compute machines.

// What about instances and ports?
// Each worker node requires:

// * An instance from the {rh-openstack} quota
// * A port from the {rh-openstack} quota
// * A flavor with at least 16 GB memory, 4 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space

// Each compute machine requires a flavor with at least 8 GB memory, 2 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space.
