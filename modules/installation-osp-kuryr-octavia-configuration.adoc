= Configuring Octavia

Kuryr SDN uses {rh-openstack-first}'s Octavia LBaaS to implement {product-title} services. Thus,
you must install and configure Octavia components in {rh-openstack}
to use Kuryr SDN.

To enable Octavia, you must include the Octavia service during the installation
of the {rh-openstack} Overcloud, or upgrade the Octavia service if the Overcloud
already exists. The following steps for enabling Octavia apply to both a clean
install of the Overcloud or an Overcloud update.

[NOTE]
====
The following steps only capture the key pieces required during the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/director_installation_and_usage/[deployment of {rh-openstack}]
when dealing with Octavia. It is also important to note that
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/director_installation_and_usage/configuring-a-container-image-source#registry-methods[registry methods]
vary.

This example uses the local registry method.
====

.Procedure

. If you are using the local registry, create a template to upload the images to
the registry. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
(undercloud) $ openstack overcloud container image prepare \
-e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/services-docker/octavia.yaml \
--namespace=registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13 \
--push-destination=<local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787 \
--prefix=openstack- \
--tag-from-label {version}-{product-version} \
--output-env-file=/home/stack/templates/overcloud_images.yaml \
--output-images-file /home/stack/local_registry_images.yaml
----

. Verify that the `local_registry_images.yaml` file contains the Octavia images.
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
- imagename: registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13/openstack-octavia-api:13.0-43
  push_destination: <local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787
- imagename: registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13/openstack-octavia-health-manager:13.0-45
  push_destination: <local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787
- imagename: registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13/openstack-octavia-housekeeping:13.0-45
  push_destination: <local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787
- imagename: registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13/openstack-octavia-worker:13.0-44
  push_destination: <local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The Octavia container versions vary depending upon the specific
{rh-openstack} release installed.
====

. Pull the container images from `registry.redhat.io` to the Undercloud node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
(undercloud) $ sudo openstack overcloud container image upload \
  --config-file  /home/stack/local_registry_images.yaml \
  --verbose
----
+
This may take some time depending on the speed of your network and Undercloud
disk.

. Install or update your Overcloud environment with Octavia:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack overcloud deploy --templates \
  -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/services-docker/octavia.yaml \
  -e octavia_timeouts.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This command only includes the files associated with Octavia; it varies based on
your specific installation of {rh-openstack}. See the {rh-openstack}
documentation for further information. For more information on customizing your
Octavia installation, see
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/networking_guide/#planning_your_octavia_deployment[installation
of Octavia using Director].
====
+
[NOTE]
====
When leveraging Kuryr SDN, the Overcloud installation requires the Neutron `trunk` extension. This is available by default on director deployments.
Use the `openvswitch` firewall instead of the default `ovs-hybrid` when the Neutron
backend is ML2/OVS. There is no need for modifications if the backend is
ML2/OVN.

[id="installation-osp-kuryr-octavia-driver_{context}"]
== The Octavia OVN Driver

Octavia supports multiple provider drivers through the Octavia API.

To see all available Octavia provider drivers, on a command line, enter:
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack loadbalancer provider list
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
+---------+-------------------------------------------------+
| name    | description                                     |
+---------+-------------------------------------------------+
| amphora | The Octavia Amphora driver.                     |
| octavia | Deprecated alias of the Octavia Amphora driver. |
| ovn     | Octavia OVN driver.                             |
+---------+-------------------------------------------------+
----

Beginning with {rh-openstack} version 16, the Octavia OVN provider driver (`ovn`) is supported on
{product-title} on {rh-openstack} deployments.

`ovn` is an integration driver for the load balancing
that Octavia and OVN provide. It supports basic load balancing capabilities,
and is based on OpenFlow rules. The driver is automatically enabled
in Octavia by Director on deployments that use OVN Neutron ML2.

The Amphora provider driver is the default driver. If `ovn` is enabled, however, Kuryr uses it.

If Kuryr uses `ovn` instead of Amphora, it offers the following benefits:

* Decreased resource requirements. Kuryr does not require a load balancer VM for each service.
* Reduced network latency.
* Increased service creation speed by using OpenFlow rules instead of a VM for each service.
* Distributed load balancing actions across all nodes instead of centralized on Amphora VMs.
