= Ingress Controller sharding

You can use Ingress sharding, also known as router sharding, to distribute a set of routes across multiple routers by adding labels to routes, namespaces, or both. The Ingress Controller uses a corresponding set of selectors to admit only the routes that have a specified label. Each Ingress shard comprises the routes that are filtered using a given selection expression.

As the primary mechanism for traffic to enter the cluster, the demands on the Ingress Controller can be significant. As a cluster administrator, you can shard the routes to:

* Balance Ingress Controllers, or routers, with several routes to speed up responses to changes.
* Allocate certain routes to have different reliability guarantees than other routes.
* Allow certain Ingress Controllers to have different policies defined.
* Allow only specific routes to use additional features.
* Expose different routes on different addresses so that internal and external users can see different routes, for example.
* Transfer traffic from one version of an application to another during a blue green deployment.

When Ingress Controllers are sharded, a given route is admitted to zero or more Ingress Controllers in the group. A route's status describes whether an Ingress Controller has admitted it or not. An Ingress Controller will only admit a route if it is unique to its shard.

An Ingress Controller can use three sharding methods:

* Adding only a namespace selector to the Ingress Controller, so that all routes in a namespace with labels that match the namespace selector are in the Ingress shard.

* Adding only a route selector to the Ingress Controller, so that all routes with labels that match the route selector are in the Ingress shard.

* Adding both a namespace selector and route selector to the Ingress Controller, so that routes with labels that match the route selector in a namespace with labels that match the namespace selector are in the Ingress shard.

With sharding, you can distribute subsets of routes over multiple Ingress Controllers. These subsets can be non-overlapping, also called _traditional_ sharding, or overlapping, otherwise known as _overlapped_ sharding.

== Traditional sharding example

An Ingress Controller `finops-router` is configured with the label selector `spec.namespaceSelector.matchLabels.name` set to `finance` and `ops`:

.Example YAML definition for `finops-router`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
  kind: IngressController
  metadata:
    name: finops-router
    namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
  spec:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        name:
          - finance
          - ops
----

A second Ingress Controller `dev-router` is configured with the label selector `spec.namespaceSelector.matchLabels.name` set to `dev`:

.Example YAML definition for `dev-router`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
  kind: IngressController
  metadata:
    name: dev-router
    namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
  spec:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        name: dev
----

If all application routes are in separate namespaces, each labeled with `name:finance`, `name:ops`, and `name:dev` respectively, this configuration effectively distributes your routes between the two Ingress Controllers. {product-title} routes for console, authentication, and other purposes should not be handled.

In the above scenario, sharding becomes a special case of partitioning, with no overlapping subsets. Routes are divided between router shards.

[WARNING]
====
The `default` Ingress Controller continues to serve all routes unless the `namespaceSelector` or `routeSelector` fields contain routes that are meant for exclusion. See this link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5097511[Red Hat Knowledgebase solution] and the section "Sharding the default Ingress Controller" for more information on how to exclude routes from the default Ingress Controller.

== Overlapped sharding example

In addition to `finops-router` and `dev-router` in the example above, you also have `devops-router`, which is configured with the label selector `spec.namespaceSelector.matchLabels.name` set to `dev` and `ops`:

.Example YAML definition for `devops-router`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
  kind: IngressController
  metadata:
    name: devops-router
    namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
  spec:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        name:
          - dev
          - ops
----
The routes in the namespaces labeled `name:dev` and `name:ops` are now serviced by two different Ingress Controllers. With this configuration, you have overlapping subsets of routes.

With overlapping subsets of routes you can create more complex routing rules. For example, you can divert higher priority traffic to the dedicated `finops-router` while sending lower priority traffic to `devops-router`.
