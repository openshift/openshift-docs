= Ingress Controller sharding

You can use Ingress sharding, also known as router sharding, to distribute a set of routes across multiple routers by adding labels to routes, namespaces, or both. The Ingress Controller uses a corresponding set of selectors to admit only the routes that have a specified label. Each Ingress shard comprises the routes that are filtered using a given selection expression.

As the primary mechanism for traffic to enter the cluster, the demands on the Ingress Controller can be significant. As a cluster administrator, you can shard the routes to:

* Balance Ingress Controllers, or routers, with several routes to speed up responses to changes.
* Allocate certain routes to have different reliability guarantees than other routes.
* Allow certain Ingress Controllers to have different policies defined.
* Allow only specific routes to use additional features.
* Expose different routes on different addresses so that internal and external users can see different routes, for example.
* Transfer traffic from one version of an application to another during a blue green deployment.

When Ingress Controllers are sharded, a given route is admitted to zero or more Ingress Controllers in the group. A route's status describes whether an Ingress Controller has admitted it or not. An Ingress Controller will only admit a route if it is unique to its shard.

An Ingress Controller can use three sharding methods:

* Adding only a namespace selector to the Ingress Controller, so that all routes in a namespace with labels that match the namespace selector are in the Ingress shard.

* Adding only a route selector to the Ingress Controller, so that all routes with labels that match the route selector are in the Ingress shard.

* Adding both a namespace selector and route selector to the Ingress Controller, so that routes with labels that match the route selector in a namespace with labels that match the namespace selector are in the Ingress shard.

With sharding, you can distribute subsets of routes over multiple Ingress Controllers. These subsets can be non-overlapping, also called _traditional_ sharding, or overlapping, otherwise known as _overlapped_ sharding.
