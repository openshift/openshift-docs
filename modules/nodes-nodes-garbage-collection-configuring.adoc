= Configuring garbage collection for containers and images

As an administrator, you can configure how {product-title} performs garbage collection by creating a `kubeletConfig` object for each machine config pool.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} supports only one `kubeletConfig` object for each machine config pool.
====

You can configure any combination of the following:

* Soft eviction for containers
* Hard eviction for containers
* Eviction for images

Container garbage collection removes terminated containers. Image garbage collection removes images that are not referenced by any running pods.

.Prerequisites

. Obtain the label associated with the static `MachineConfigPool` CRD for the type of node you want to configure by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineconfigpool <name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineconfigpool worker
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-11-16T15:34:25Z"
  generation: 4
  labels:
    pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: "" <1>
  name: worker
#...
----
<1> The label appears under Labels.
+
[TIP]
====
If the label is not present, add a key/value pair such as:

----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=small-pods
----
====

.Procedure

. Create a custom resource (CR) for your configuration change.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If there is one file system, or if `/var/lib/kubelet` and `/var/lib/containers/` are in the same file system, the settings with the highest values trigger evictions, as those are met first. The file system triggers the eviction.
====
+
.Sample configuration for a container garbage collection CR:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: worker-kubeconfig <1>
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: "" <2>

#...
----
<1> Name for the object.
<2> Specify the label from the machine config pool.
<3> For container garbage collection: Type of eviction: `evictionSoft` or `evictionHard`.
<4> For container garbage collection: Eviction thresholds based on a specific eviction trigger signal.
<5> For container garbage collection: Grace periods for the soft eviction. This parameter does not apply to `eviction-hard`.
<6> For container garbage collection: Eviction thresholds based on a specific eviction trigger signal.
For `evictionHard` you must specify all of these parameters.  If you do not specify all parameters, only the specified parameters are applied and the garbage collection will not function properly.
<7> For container garbage collection: The duration to wait before transitioning out of an eviction pressure condition.
<8> For image garbage collection: The minimum age for an unused image before the image is removed by garbage collection.
<9> For image garbage collection: The percent of disk usage (expressed as an integer) that triggers image garbage collection.
<10> For image garbage collection: The percent of disk usage (expressed as an integer) that image garbage collection attempts to free.

. Run the following command to create the CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f gc-container.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
kubeletconfig.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/gc-container created
----

.Verification

. Verify that garbage collection is active by entering the following command. The Machine Config Pool you specified in the custom resource appears with `UPDATING` as 'true` until the change is fully implemented:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfigpool
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     CONFIG                                   UPDATED   UPDATING
master   rendered-master-546383f80705bd5aeaba93   True      False
worker   rendered-worker-b4c51bb33ccaae6fc4a6a5   False     True
