= Configuring garbage collection for containers and images

As an administrator, you can configure how {product-title} performs garbage collection by creating a `kubeletConfig` object for each machine config pool.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} supports only one `kubeletConfig` object for each machine config pool.
====

You can configure any combination of the following:

* Soft eviction for containers 
* Hard eviction for containers
* Eviction for images

.Prerequisites

. Obtain the label associated with the static `MachineConfigPool` CRD for the type of node you want to configure.
Perform one of the following steps:

.. View the machine config pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe machineconfigpool <name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe machineconfigpool worker
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
Name:         worker
Namespace:
Labels:       custom-kubelet=small-pods <1>
----
<1> If a label has been added it appears under `Labels`.

.. If the label is not present, add a key/value pair:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=small-pods
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the label:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  labels:
    custom-kubelet: small-pods
  name: worker
----
====

.Procedure

. Create a custom resource (CR) for your configuration change.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If there is one file system, or if `/var/lib/kubelet` and `/var/lib/containers/` are in the same file system, the settings with the highest values trigger evictions, as those are met first. The file system triggers the eviction.
====

.Sample configuration for a container garbage collection CR:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: worker-kubeconfig <1>

    imageGCLowThresholdPercent: 75 <9>
----
<1> Name for the object.
<2> Selector label.
<3> Type of eviction: `EvictionSoft` and `EvictionHard`.
<4> Eviction thresholds based on a specific eviction trigger signal.
<5> Grace periods for the soft eviction. This parameter does not apply to `eviction-hard`.
<6> The duration to wait before transitioning out of an eviction pressure condition.
<7> The minimum age for an unused image before the image is removed by garbage collection.
<8> The percent of disk usage (expressed as an integer) which triggers image garbage collection.
<9> The percent of disk usage (expressed as an integer) to which image garbage collection attempts to free.

. Create the object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f gc-container.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
kubeletconfig.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/gc-container created
----

. Verify that garbage collection is active. The Machine Config Pool you specified in the custom resource appears with `UPDATING` as 'true` until the change is fully implemented:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfigpool
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     CONFIG                                   UPDATED   UPDATING
master   rendered-master-546383f80705bd5aeaba93   True      False
worker   rendered-worker-b4c51bb33ccaae6fc4a6a5   False     True
