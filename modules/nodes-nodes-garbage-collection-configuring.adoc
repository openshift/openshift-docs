= Configuring garbage collection for containers and images

As an administrator, you can configure how {product-title} performs garbage collection by creating a `kubeletConfig` object for each Machine Config Pool.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} supports only one `kubeletConfig` object for each Machine Config Pool.
====

You can configure any combination of the following:

* soft eviction for containers
* hard eviction for containers
* eviction for images 

For soft container eviction you can also configure a grace period before eviction.

.Prerequisites

. Obtain the label associated with the static Machine Config Pool CRD for the type of node you want to configure.
Perform one of the following steps:

.. View the Machine Config Pool:
+
----
$ oc describe machineconfigpool <name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ oc describe machineconfigpool worker

apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2019-02-08T14:52:39Z
  generation: 1
  labels:
    custom-kubelet: small-pods <1>
----
<1> If a label has been added it appears under `labels`.

.. If the label is not present, add a key/value pair:
+
----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=small-pods
----

.Procedure

. Create a Custom Resource (CR) for your configuration change.
+
.Sample configuration for a container garbage collection CR:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: worker-kubeconfig <1>
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      custom-kubelet: small-pods <2>
  kubeletConfig:

    imageMinimumGCAge: 5m <7>
    imageGCHighThresholdPercent: 80 <8> 
    imageGCLowThresholdPercent: 75 <9>
----
<1> Name for the object.
<2> Selector label.
<3> Type of eviction: `EvictionSoft` and `EvictionHard`.
<4> Eviction thresholds based on a specific eviction trigger signal.
<5> Grace periods for the soft eviction. This parameter does not apply to `eviction-hard`.
<6> The duration to wait before transitioning out of an eviction pressure condition
<7> The minimum age for an unused image before the image is removed by garbage collection.
<8> The percent of disk usage (expressed as an integer) which triggers image garbage collection.
<9> The percent of disk usage (expressed as an integer) to which image garbage collection attempts to free. 

. Create the object:
+
----
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
----
+
For example:
+
----
oc create -f gc-container.yaml

kubeletconfig.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/gc-container created
----

. Verify that garbage collection is active. The Machine Config Pool you specified in the custom resource appears with `UPDATING` as 'true` until the change is fully implemented:
+
----
$ oc get machineconfigpool

NAME     CONFIG                                   UPDATED   UPDATING
master   rendered-master-546383f80705bd5aeaba93   True      False
worker   rendered-worker-b4c51bb33ccaae6fc4a6a5   False     True
