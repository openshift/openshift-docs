= Rsync retry configuration

With MTC 1.4.3 and later, a new ability of retrying a failed Rsync operation is introduced.

By default, the migration controller retries Rsync until all of the data is successfully transferred from the source to the target volume or a specified number of retries is met. The default retry limit is set to `+20+`.

For larger volumes, a limit of `+20+` retries may not be sufficient.

You can increase the retry limit by using the following variable in the `MigrationController` CR:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: migration.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: MigrationController
metadata:
  name: migration-controller
  namespace: openshift-migration
spec:
  [...]
  rsync_backoff_limit: 40
----

In this example, the retry limit is increased to `40`.
