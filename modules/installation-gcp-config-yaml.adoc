[id="installation-gcp-config-yaml_{context}"]
= Sample customized `install-config.yaml` file for GCP

You can customize the `install-config.yaml` file to specify more details about your {product-title} cluster's platform or modify the values of the required parameters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your `install-config.yaml` file by using the installation program and modify it.

----
<1> Required. The installation program prompts you for this value.
<2> If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program provides the default value.
<3> The `controlPlane` section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`, and the first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Although both sections currently define a single machine pool, it is possible that future versions of {product-title} will support defining multiple compute pools during installation. Only one control plane pool is used.
<4> Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or `hyperthreading`. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance. Use larger machine types, such as `n1-standard-8`, for your machines if you disable simultaneous multithreading.
====
<5> To configure faster storage for etcd, especially for larger clusters, set the storage type as `io1` and set `iops` to `2000`.
ifdef::vpc[]
<6> If you use an existing VPC, specify its name.
<7> If you use an existing VPC, specify the name of the existing subnet to deploy the control plane machines to. The subnet must belong to the VPC that you specified.
<8> If you use an existing VPC, specify the name of the existing subnet to deploy the compute machines to. The subnet must belong to the VPC that you specified.
<9> Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the {op-system-first} machines that {product-title} runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the FIPS validated cryptography modules that are provided with {op-system} instead.
<10> You can optionally provide the `sshKey` value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery on, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.
====
ifdef::private[]
<11> How to publish the user-facing endpoints of your cluster. Set `publish` to `Internal` to deploy a private cluster, which cannot be accessed from the internet. The default value is `External`.
