= Rolling back a migration in the {mtc-short} web console

You can roll back a migration by using the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) web console.

If your application was stopped during a failed migration, you must roll back the migration in order to prevent data corruption in the persistent volume.

Rollback is not required if the application was not stopped during migration because the original application is still running on the source cluster.

.Procedure

. In the {mtc-short} web console, click *Migration plans*.
. Click the Options menu {kebab} beside a migration plan and select *Rollback*.
. Click *Rollback* and wait for rollback to complete.
+
In the migration plan details, *Rollback succeeded* is displayed.

. Verify that rollback was successful in the {product-title} web console of the source cluster:

.. Click *Home* -> *Projects*.
.. Click the migrated project to view its status.
.. In the *Routes* section, click *Location* to verify that the application is functioning, if applicable.
.. Click *Workloads* -> *Pods* to verify that the pods are running in the migrated namespace.
.. Click *Storage* -> *Persistent volumes* to verify that the migrated persistent volume is correctly provisioned.
