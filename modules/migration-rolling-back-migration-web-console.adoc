= Rolling back a migration by using the {mtc-short} web console

You can roll back a migration by using the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) web console.

[NOTE]
====
The following resources remain in the migrated namespaces for debugging after a failed direct volume migration (DVM):

* Config maps (source and destination clusters)
* `Secret` CRs (source and destination clusters)
* `Rsync` CRs (source cluster)

These resources do not affect rollback. You can delete them manually.

If you later run the same migration plan successfully, the resources from the failed migration are deleted automatically.
====

If your application was stopped during a failed migration, you must roll back the migration to prevent data corruption in the persistent volume.

Rollback is not required if the application was not stopped during migration because the original application is still running on the source cluster.

.Procedure

. In the {mtc-short} web console, click *Migration plans*.
. Click the Options menu {kebab} beside a migration plan and select *Rollback* under *Migration*.
. Click *Rollback* and wait for rollback to complete.
+
In the migration plan details, *Rollback succeeded* is displayed.

. Verify that rollback was successful in the {product-title} web console of the source cluster:

.. Click *Home* -> *Projects*.
.. Click the migrated project to view its status.
.. In the *Routes* section, click *Location* to verify that the application is functioning, if applicable.
.. Click *Workloads* -> *Pods* to verify that the pods are running in the migrated namespace.
.. Click *Storage* -> *Persistent volumes* to verify that the migrated persistent volume is correctly provisioned.
