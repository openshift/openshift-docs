= Installing {loki-op} by using the CLI

To install and configure logging on your {product-title} cluster, additional Operators must be installed. This can be done from the {product-title} CLI.

{Product-title} Operators use custom resources (CR) to manage applications and their components. High-level configuration and settings are provided by the user within a CR. The Operator translates high-level directives into low-level actions, based on best practices embedded within the Operatorâ€™s logic. A custom resource definition (CRD) defines a CR and lists all the configurations available to users of the Operator. Installing an Operator creates the CRDs, which are then used to generate CRs.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrator permissions.
* You installed the {oc-first}.
* You have access to a supported object store. For example: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Swift, Minio, or {rh-storage}.

.Procedure

. Create a `Subscription` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: loki-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators-redhat <1>
spec:
  channel: stable <2>
  name: loki-operator
  source: redhat-operators <3>
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----
<1> You must specify the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace.
<2> Specify `stable`, or `stable-5.<y>` as the channel.
<3> Specify `redhat-operators`. If your {product-title} cluster is installed on a restricted network, also known as a disconnected cluster, specify the name of the `CatalogSource` object you created when you configured the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

. Apply the `Subscription` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----
