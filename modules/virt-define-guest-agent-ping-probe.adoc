= Defining a guest agent ping probe

Define a guest agent ping probe by setting the `spec.readinessProbe.guestAgentPing` field of the virtual machine (VM) configuration.

:FeatureName: The guest agent ping probe
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

.Prerequisites

* The QEMU guest agent must be installed and enabled on the virtual machine.

.Procedure

. Include details of the guest agent ping probe in the VM configuration file. For example:
+

.Sample guest agent ping probe

<1> The guest agent ping probe to connect to the VM.
<2> Optional: The time, in seconds, after the VM starts before the guest agent probe is initiated.
<3> Optional: The delay, in seconds, between performing probes. The default delay is 10 seconds. This value must be greater than `timeoutSeconds`.
<4> Optional: The number of seconds of inactivity after which the probe times out and the VM is assumed to have failed. The default value is 1. This value must be lower than `periodSeconds`.
<5> Optional: The number of times that the probe is allowed to fail. The default is 3. After the specified number of attempts, the pod is marked `Unready`.
<6> Optional: The number of times that the probe must report success, after a failure, to be considered successful. The default is 1.

. Create the VM by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
