= Setting resource quota limits for virtual machines

[role="_abstract"]
By default, {VirtProductName} automatically manages CPU and memory limits for virtual machines (VMs) if a namespace enforces resource quotas that require limits to be set. The memory limit is automatically set to twice the requested memory and the CPU limit is set to one per vCPU.

You can customize the memory limit ratio for a specific namespace by adding the `alpha.kubevirt.io/auto-memory-limits-ratio` label to the namespace. For example, the following command sets the memory limit ratio to 1.2:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label ns/my-virtualization-project  alpha.kubevirt.io/auto-memory-limits-ratio=1.2
----

[WARNING]
====
Avoid managing resource quota limits manually. To prevent misconfigurations or scheduling issues, rely on the automatic resource limit management provided by {VirtProductName} unless you have a specific need to override the defaults.
====

Resource quotas that only use requests automatically work with VMs. If your resource quota uses limits, you must manually set resource limits on VMs.
Memory resource limits, defined by the `spec.template.spec.domain.resources.limits.memory` value, must be at least 500 MiB, or 2% larger than the `spec.template.spec.domain.memory.guest` value.

.Procedure

. Set limits for a VM by editing the `VirtualMachine` manifest. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: with-limits
spec:
  runStrategy: Halted
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        memory:
          guest: 128Mi
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 256Mi
----
+
where
+
spec.template.spec.domain.memory.guest:: Specifies the actual amount of RAM that is shown to the guest operating system (OS) in the VM.
+
spec.template.spec.domain.resources.limits.memory:: Specifies the hard limit for total memory consumption by the `virt-launcher` pod that hosts the VM. This limit must account for the guest OS RAM plus the hypervisor overhead.
+
This example configuration is supported because the `spec.template.spec.domain.resources.limits.memory` value is at least `100Mi` larger than the `spec.template.spec.domain.memory.guest` value.

. Save the `VirtualMachine` manifest.
