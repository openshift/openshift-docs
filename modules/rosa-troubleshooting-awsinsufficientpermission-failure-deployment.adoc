= Troubleshooting cluster creation with an AWSInsufficientPermissions error

[role="_abstract"]
If a cluster creation action fails, you might receive the following error message.

**Example {cluster-manager} output:**
[source,terminal]
----
Provisioning Error Code:    OCM3033
Provisioning Error Message: Current credentials insufficient for performing cluster installation.
----

This error indicates that the cluster installation is blocked due to missing or insufficient privileges on the AWS account used to provision the cluster.

.Procedure

. Ensure that the prerequisites are met by reviewing _Detailed requirements for deploying ROSA (classic architecture) using STS_ or _Deploying ROSA without AWS STS_ in _Additional resources_ depending on your choice of credential mode for installing clusters.
+
[TIP]
====
[role="_abstract"]
AWS Security Token Service (STS) is the recommended credential mode for installing and interacting with clusters on {product-title} because it provides enhanced security.
====
+
. If needed, you can re-create the permissions and policies by using the `-f` flag:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create ocm-role -f
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create user-role -f
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create account-roles -f
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create operator-roles -c ${CLUSTER} -f
----

. Validate all the prerequisites and attempt cluster reinstallation.
