= Using pod topology spread constraints for monitoring

You can use pod topology spread constraints to control how
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
the monitoring pods
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
the pods for user-defined monitoring
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
are spread across a network topology when {product-title} pods are deployed in multiple availability zones.

Pod topology spread constraints are suitable for controlling pod scheduling within hierarchical topologies in which nodes are spread across different infrastructure levels, such as regions and zones within those regions.
Additionally, by being able to schedule pods in different zones, you can improve network latency in certain scenarios.
