= Installing Logical Volume Manager Storage

You can install Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage on a bare metal or user-provisioned infrastructure cluster and configure it to dynamically provision storage for your workloads.

You can install {lvms} by using the {product-title} CLI (`oc`), {product-title} web console, or {rh-rhacm-first}.

[WARNING]
====
When using {lvms} on multi-node clusters, {lvms} only supports provisioning local storage. {lvms} does not support storage data replication mechanisms across nodes. You must ensure storage data replication through active or passive replication mechanisms to avoid a single point of failure.

== Prerequisites to install LVM Storage

The prerequisites to install {lvms} are as follows: 

* Before deploying {lvms}, ensure that every managed cluster has dedicated disks that are used to provision storage.

* Before deploying {lvms} in a private CI environment where you can reuse the storage devices that you configured in the previous {lvms} installation, ensure that you have wiped the disks that are not in use. If you do not wipe the disks before installing {lvms}, you cannot reuse the disks without manual intervention.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot wipe the disks that are in use.

* If you want to install {lvms} by using {rh-rhacm-first}, ensure that you have installed {rh-rhacm} on an {product-title} cluster. See the _Installing LVM Storage using RHACM_ section.
