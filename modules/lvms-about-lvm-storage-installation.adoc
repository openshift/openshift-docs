= Logical Volume Manager Storage installation

You can install Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage on an {product-title} cluster and configure it to dynamically provision storage for your workloads.

You can install {lvms} by using the {product-title} CLI (`oc`), {product-title} web console, or {rh-rhacm-first}.

[WARNING]
====
When using {lvms} on multi-node clusters, {lvms} only supports provisioning local storage. {lvms} does not support storage data replication mechanisms across nodes. You must ensure storage data replication through active or passive replication mechanisms to avoid a single point of failure.

== Prerequisites to install LVM Storage

The prerequisites to install {lvms} are as follows: 

* Before deploying {lvms}, ensure that every managed cluster has dedicated disks that are used to provision storage. {lvms} uses only those disks that are empty and do not contain file system signatures. To ensure that the disks are empty and do not contain file system signatures, wipe the disks before using them.

* Before deploying {lvms} in a private CI environment where you can reuse the storage devices that you configured in the previous {lvms} installation, ensure that you have wiped the disks that are not in use. If you do not wipe the disks before installing {lvms}, you cannot reuse the disks without manual intervention.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot wipe the disks that are in use.

* If you want to install {lvms} by using {rh-rhacm-first}, ensure that you have installed {rh-rhacm} on an {product-title} cluster. See the "Installing LVM Storage using RHACM" section.
