= The ClusterVersion object

One of the resources that the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) monitors is the `ClusterVersion` resource.

Administrators and OpenShift components can communicate or interact with the CVO through the `ClusterVersion` object.
The desired CVO state is declared through the `ClusterVersion` object and the current CVO state is reflected in the object's status.

[NOTE]
====
Do not directly modify the `ClusterVersion` object. Instead, use interfaces such as the `oc` CLI or the web console to declare your update target.
====

The CVO continually reconciles the cluster with the target state declared in the `spec` property of the `ClusterVersion` resource.
When the desired release differs from the actual release, that reconciliation updates the cluster.

//to-do: this might be heading overload, consider deleting this heading if the context switch from the previous paragraph to this content is smooth enough to not require one.

== Update availability data

The `ClusterVersion` resource also contains information about updates that are available to the cluster.
This includes updates that are available, but not recommended due to a known risk that applies to the cluster.
These updates are known as conditional updates.
To learn how the CVO maintains this information about available updates in the `ClusterVersion` resource, see the "Evaluation of update availability" section.

* You can inspect all available updates with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --include-not-recommended
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The additional `--include-not-recommended` parameter includes updates that are available but not recommended due to a known risk that applies to the cluster.

Cluster version is 4.10.22

Upstream is unset, so the cluster will use an appropriate default.
Channel: fast-4.11 (available channels: candidate-4.10, candidate-4.11, eus-4.10, fast-4.10, fast-4.11, stable-4.10)

The `oc adm upgrade` command queries the `ClusterVersion` resource for information about available updates and presents it in a human-readable format.

* One way to directly inspect the underlying availability data created by the CVO is by querying the `ClusterVersion` resource with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion version -o json | jq '.status.availableUpdates'
----
+
