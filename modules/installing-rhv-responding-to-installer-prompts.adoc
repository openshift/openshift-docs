= Responding to installer prompts

Respond to the following installer prompts for information. For more information about a prompt, enter “?”.

NOTE: The order of the prompts may vary from the order shown here.

.Procedure
* *SSH Public Key*: Select the public key on the installer machine, such as `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, that will be used to authenticate connections with the new {product-title} cluster. Only the owner of this public key can ssh to the new nodes. Optionally, after the installation, you can add and replace keys using the Machine Config Operator (MCO).
* *Platform*: *ovirt*
* *Enter oVirt's API endpoint URL*: Enter the URL of the {rh-virtualization} API using this format:
+
[source,bash]
----
<ovirt-admin>:<password> \ <1>
https://<engine-fqdn>/ovirt-engine/api <2>
----
<1> For `<ovirt-admin>` and `<password>`, specify the username and password of an {rh-virtualization} user with `SuperUser` or `ClusterAdmin` privileges.
<2> For `<engine-fqdn>`, specify the fully qualified domain name of the {rh-virtualization} environment.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
admin:pw123 https://rhv-env.virtlab.example.com/ovirt-engine/api
----
+
* *Is the installed oVirt certificate trusted?*: Enter *Yes* since you have already set up a CA certificate.
* *oVirt's CA bundle*: If you entered *Yes* for the preceding question, copy the certificate from `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ca.pem` and paste it here. Then, press *Enter* twice. Otherwise, if you entered *No* for the preceding question, this question does not appear.
* *Enter the oVirt engine username*: Enter the {rh-virtualization} admin user name and profile using this format:
+
[source,bash]
----
<ovirt-admin>@<ovirt-login-profile> <1>
----
<1> For `<ovirt-admin>`, specify the username of an {rh-virtualization} user with `SuperUser` or `ClusterAdmin` privileges. For `<ovirt-login-profile>` specify the associated login profile. (The login screen for the {rh-virtualization} Administration Portal displays a dropdown list of login profiles.)
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
admin@internal
----
+
* *Enter password*: Enter the {rh-virtualization} admin password.
* *Select the oVirt cluster*: Select the cluster for installing {product-title}.
* *Select the oVirt storage domain*: Select the storage domain for installing {product-title}.
* *Select the oVirt network*: Select a virtual network that has access to the {rh-virtualization} Manager REST API.
* *Enter the internal API Virtual IP*: Enter the static IP address you set aside for the cluster’s REST API.
* *Enter the internal DNS Virtual IP*: Enter the static IP address you set aside for the cluster’s internal DNS service.
* *Enter the ingress IP*: Enter the static IP address you reserved for the wildcard apps domain.
* *Base domain*: Enter the base domain of the {product-title} cluster. If this cluster is exposed to the outside world, this must be a valid domain recognized by DNS infrastructure. For example, enter: `virtlab.example.com`
* *Cluster name*: Enter the name of the cluster. For example, `ocp-cluster`. This value should match the cluster name you used in the externally registered/resolvable API and ingress DNS entries. The installer also gives this name to the cluster in the {rh-virtualization} environment.
* *Pull secret*: link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/rhv/installer-provisioned[Copy the pull secret] and paste it here. The installer uses this pull secret to get images from the Red Hat Container Registry.
