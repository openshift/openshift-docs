= PolicyGenTemplate CRs for RAN deployments

You can customize cluster custom resources (CRs) that you deploy using the GitOps ZTP pipeline. Use `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs as the basis to create a hierarchy of configuration files tailored to your specific site requirements.

The `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs that are relevant to RAN cluster configuration can be found in the `/home/ztp/argocd/example` folder in the `registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ztp-site-generate-rhel8:v4.10` reference architecture container image. The reference architecture has a `/policygentemplates` and `/siteconfig` folder. The `/policygentemplates` folder has common, group, and site-specific configuration CRs. Each `PolicyGenTemplate` CR refers to other CRs that are in the `/source-crs` folder of the reference architecture.

The `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs relevant to RAN cluster configuration are described below.
