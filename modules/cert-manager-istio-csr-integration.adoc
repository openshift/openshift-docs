:FeatureName: istio-csr integration for {cert-manager-operator}
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]


The {cert-manager-operator} provides enhanced support for securing workloads and control plane components in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh or Istio. This includes support for certificates facilitating mutual TLS (mTLS), which are signed, delivered, and renewed using {cert-manager-operator} issuers. The Istio-CSR feature, available in Tech Preview, enables Istio workloads and components to be secured using {cert-manager-operator}.

The Istio-CSR integration with {cert-manager-operator} allows Istio to obtain certificates from the {cert-manager-operator}, simplifying security and certificate management.
