[id="restore-replace-stopped-baremetal-etcd-member_{context}"]
= Replacing an unhealthy bare metal etcd member whose machine is not running or whose node is not ready

This procedure details the steps to replace a bare metal etcd member that is unhealthy either because the machine is not running or because the node is not ready.

If you are running installer-provisioned infrastructure or you used the Machine API to create your machines, follow these steps. Otherwise you must create the new control plane node using the same method that was used to originally create it.

.Prerequisites

* You have identified the unhealthy bare metal etcd member.
* You have verified that either the machine is not running or the node is not ready.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have taken an etcd backup.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must take an etcd backup before performing this procedure so that your cluster can be restored if you encounter any issues.
====

.Procedure

. Verify and remove the unhealthy member.

.. Choose a pod that is _not_ on the affected node:
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-etcd get pods -l k8s-app=etcd -o wide
----
+

----
.. Connect to the running etcd container, passing in the name of a pod that is not on the affected node:
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-openshift-control-plane-0
----

.. View the member list:

----
+
Take note of the ID and the name of the unhealthy etcd member, because these values are required later in the procedure. The `etcdctl endpoint health` command will list the removed member until the replacement procedure is completed and the new member is added.

.. Remove the unhealthy etcd member by providing the ID to the `etcdctl member remove` command:
+
[WARNING]
====
Be sure to remove the correct etcd member; removing a good etcd member might lead to quorum loss.

+
You can now exit the node shell.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you remove the member, the cluster might be unreachable for a short time while the remaining etcd instances reboot.
====

. Turn off the quorum guard by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": {"useUnsupportedUnsafeNonHANonProductionUnstableEtcd": true}}}'
----
+
This command ensures that you can successfully re-create secrets and roll out the static pods.

. Remove the old secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed by running the following commands.

.. List the secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secrets -n openshift-etcd | grep openshift-control-plane-2
----
Pass in the name of the unhealthy etcd member that you took note of earlier in this procedure.
+
There is a peer, serving, and metrics secret as shown in the following output:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret etcd-peer-openshift-control-plane-2 -n openshift-etcd

. Delete the control plane machine.
+
If you are running installer-provisioned infrastructure, or you used the Machine API to create your machines, follow these steps. Otherwise, you must create the new control plane node using the same method that was used to originally create it.

.. Obtain the machine for the unhealthy member.

If deletion of the machine is delayed for any reason or the command is obstructed and delayed, you can force deletion by removing the machine object finalizer field.

Do not interrupt machine deletion by pressing `Ctrl+c`. You must allow the command to proceed to completion. Open a new terminal window to edit and delete the finalizer fields.

If you reuse the `BareMetalHost` object definition from an existing control plane host, do not leave the `externallyProvisioned` field set to `true`.

Existing control plane `BareMetalHost` objects may have the `externallyProvisioned` flag set to `true` if they were provisioned by the {product-title} installation program.

. Turn the quorum guard back on by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": null}}'

. You can verify that the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` section is removed from the object by entering this command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get etcd/cluster -oyaml

. If you are using {sno}, restart the node. Otherwise, you might encounter the following error in the etcd cluster Operator:

.Verification

. Verify that all etcd pods are running properly.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-etcd get pods -l k8s-app=etcd
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
etcd-openshift-control-plane-0      5/5     Running     0     105m
etcd-openshift-control-plane-1      5/5     Running     0     107m
etcd-openshift-control-plane-2      5/5     Running     0     103m
----
+
If the output from the previous command only lists two pods, you can manually force an etcd redeployment. In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd cluster -p='{"spec": {"forceRedeploymentReason": "recovery-'"$( date --rfc-3339=ns )"'"}}' --type=merge <1>
----
+
<1> The `forceRedeploymentReason` value must be unique, which is why a timestamp is appended.
+
To verify there are exactly three etcd members, connect to the running etcd container, passing in the name of a pod that was not on the affected node. In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-openshift-control-plane-0
----
+
. View the member list:
