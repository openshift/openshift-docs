= Validation status

A `PreflightValidation` resource reports the status and progress of each module in the cluster that it attempts or has attempted to validate in its `.status.modules` list. Elements of that list contain the following fields:

`lastTransitionTime`:: The last time the `Module` resource status transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying status has changed. If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

`name`:: The name of the `Module` resource.

`namespace`:: The namespace of the `Module` resource.

`statusReason`:: Verbal explanation regarding the status.

`verificationStage`:: Describes the validation stage being executed: +
* `image`: Image existence verification
* `build`: Build process verification
* `sign`: Sign process verification

`verificationStatus`:: The status of the Module verification: +
* `true`: Verified
* `false`: Verification failed
* `error`: Error during the verification process
* `unknown`: Verfication has not started
