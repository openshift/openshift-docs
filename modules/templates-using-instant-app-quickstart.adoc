= Using Instant App and Quickstart templates

{product-title} provides a number of default Instant App and Quickstart
templates to make it easy to quickly get started creating a new application for
different languages. Templates are provided for Rails (Ruby), Django (Python),
Node.js, CakePHP (PHP), and Dancer (Perl). Your cluster administrator should
have created these templates in the default, global *openshift* project so you
have access to them.

By default, the templates build using a public source repository on
GitHub that contains the necessary application code.

.Procedure

. You can list the available default Instant App and Quickstart templates with:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get templates -n openshift
----

. To modify the source and build your own version of the application:
+
.. Fork the repository referenced by the template's default
`SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL` parameter.
+
.. Override the value of the `SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL` parameter when creating
from the template, specifying your fork instead of the default value.
+
By doing this, the build configuration created by the template will now point to
your fork of the application code, and you can modify the code and rebuild the
application at will.


[NOTE]
====
Some of the Instant App and Quickstart templates define a database deployment
configuration. The configuration they define uses ephemeral storage for the
database content. These templates should be used for demonstration purposes only
as all database data will be lost if the database pod restarts for any reason.
