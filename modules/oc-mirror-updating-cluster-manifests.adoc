[id="oc-mirror-updating-cluster-manifests_{context}"]
= Configuring your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror

After you have mirrored your image set to the mirror registry, you must apply the generated `ImageContentSourcePolicy`, `CatalogSource`, and release image signature resources into the cluster.

The `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource associates the mirror registry with the source registry and redirects image pull requests from the online registries to the mirror registry. The `CatalogSource` resource is used by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to retrieve information about the available Operators in the mirror registry. The release image signatures are used to verify the mirrored release images.

.Prerequisites

* You have mirrored the image set to the registry mirror in the disconnected environment.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the OpenShift CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Apply the YAML files from the results directory to the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ./oc-mirror-workspace/results-1639608409/
----

. If you mirrored release images, apply the release image signatures to the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ./oc-mirror-workspace/results-1639608409/release-signatures/
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are mirroring Operators instead of clusters, you do not need to run `$ oc apply -f ./oc-mirror-workspace/results-1639608409/release-signatures/`. Running that command will return an error, as there are no release image signatures to apply.

// TODO: Any example output to show?

.Verification

. Verify that the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resources were successfully installed by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get imagecontentsourcepolicy --all-namespaces
----

. Verify that the `CatalogSource` resources were successfully installed by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get catalogsource --all-namespaces
----
