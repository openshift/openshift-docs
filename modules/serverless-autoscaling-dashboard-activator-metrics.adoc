= Activator metrics

The *Activator* graphs *Request Concurrency*, *Request Count by Response Code (last minute)*, and *Response Time (last minute)* show the timeline of requests going through the activator until the activator is removed from the request path. These graphs can be used, for example, to evaluate whether response count and the returned HTTP codes match expectations.
