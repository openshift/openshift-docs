= Network Observability Operator release notes 1.8.0 fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the fixed issues for the Network Observability Operator 1.8.0 release.

* Previously, the Network Observability Operator came with a "kube-rbac-proxy" container to manage RBAC for its metrics server. Since this external component is deprecated, it was necessary to remove it. It is now replaced with direct TLS and RBAC management through Kubernetes controller-runtime, without the need for a side-car proxy. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1999[*NETOBSERV-1999*])

* Previously in the {product-title} console plugin, filtering on a key that was not equal to multiple values would not filter anything. With this fix, the expected results are returned, which is all flows not having any of the filtered values. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1990[*NETOBSERV-1990*])

* Previously in the {product-title} console plugin with disabled Loki, it was very likely to generate a "Can't build query" error due to selecting an incompatible set of filters and aggregations. Now this error is avoided avoid by automatically disabling incompatible filters while still making the user aware of the filter incompatibility. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1977[*NETOBSERV-1977*])

* Previously, when viewing flow details from the console plugin, the ICMP info was always displayed in the side panel, showing "undefined" values for non-ICMP flows. With this fix, ICMP info is not displayed for non-ICMP flows. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1969[*NETOBSERV-1969*])

* Previously, the "Export data" link from the *Traffic flows* view did not work as intended, generating empty CSV reports. Now, the export feature is restored, generating non-empty CSV data. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1958[*NETOBSERV-1958*])

* Previously, it was possible to configure the `FlowCollector` with `processor.logTypes` `Conversations`, `EndedConversations` or `All` with `loki.enable` set to `false`, despite the conversation logs being only useful when Loki is enabled. This resulted in resource usage waste. Now, this configuration is invalid and is rejected by the validation webhook. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1957[*NETOBSERV-1957*])

* Configuring the `FlowCollector` with `processor.logTypes` set to `All` consumes much more resources, such as CPU, memory and network bandwidth, than the other options. This was previously not documented. It is now documented, and triggers a warning from the validation webhook. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1956[*NETOBSERV-1956*])

* Previously, under high stress, some flows generated by the eBPF agent were mistakenly dismissed, resulting in traffic bandwidth under-estimation. Now, those generated flows are not dismissed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1954[*NETOBSERV-1954*])

* Previously, when enabling the network policy in the `FlowCollector` configuration, the traffic to the Operator webhooks was blocked, breaking the `FlowMetrics` API validation. Now traffic to the webhooks is allowed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1934[*NETOBSERV-1934*])

* Previously, when deploying the default network policy, namespaces `openshift-console` and `openshift-monitoring` were set by default in the `additionalNamespaces` field, resulting in duplicated rules. Now there is no additional namespace set by default, which helps avoid getting duplicated rules.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1933[*NETOBSERV-1933*])

* Previously from the {product-title} console plugin, filtering on TCP flags would match flows having only the exact desired flag. Now, any flow having at least the desired flag appears in filtered flows. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1890[*NETOBSERV-1890*])

* When the eBPF agent runs in privileged mode and pods are continuously added or deleted, a file descriptor (FD) leak occurs. The fix ensures proper closure of the FD when a network namespace is deleted. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-2063[*NETOBSERV-2063*])

* Previously, the CLI agent `DaemonSet` did not deploy on master nodes. Now, a  toleration is added on the agent `DaemonSet` to schedule on every node when taints are set. Now, CLI agent `DaemonSet` pods run on all nodes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-2030[*NETOBSERV-2030*])

* Previously, the *Source Resource* and *Source Destination* filters autocomplete were not working when using Prometheus storage only. Now this issue is fixed and suggestions displays as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1885[*NETOBSERV-1885*])

* Previously, a resource using multiple IPs was displayed separately in the *Topology* view. Now, the resource shows as a single topology node in the view. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1818[*NETOBSERV-1818*])

* Previously, the console refreshed the *Network traffic* table view contents when the mouse pointer hovered over the columns. Now, the display is fixed, so row height remains constant with a mouse hover. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-2049[*NETOBSERV-2049*])
