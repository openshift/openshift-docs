= Adding a custom certificate during a new installation with Operator

By default, Central only serves an internal TLS certificate, which means you need to handle TLS termination at the ingress or load balancer level.
If you want to terminate TLS in Central and serve a custom server certificate, specify a secret containing the certificate and private key using the `central.defaultTLSSecret` configuration option.

[NOTE]
====
You must create the TLS secret in the same namespace as Central, and the secret must follow the Kubernetes TLS secret format.
Red Hat recommends adding the `type` as `kubernetes.io/tls` to your secret YAML definition file.
