QUESTION: Would a link from here to Installing the MTV Operator by using the command-line interface (https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.9/html-single/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/index#installing-mtv-operator_cli) be appropriate? The steps as I have them here are incomplete and would need to be added to if the link to the MTV docs isn't suitable here.
====

. When the package manifest is displayed, open the {product-title} web console to install the MTV Operator.
