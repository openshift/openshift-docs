= Upgrading the {mtc-full} on {product-title} {product-version}

You can upgrade the {mtc-first} on {product-title} {product-version} by using the Operator Lifecycle Manager.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When upgrading the {mtc-short} by using the Operator Lifecycle Manager, you must use a supported migration path.
====

.Migration paths
* Migrating from {product-title} 3 to {product-title} 4 requires a legacy {mtc-short} Operator and {mtc-short} 1.7.x.
* Migrating from {mtc-short} 1.7.x to {mtc-short} 1.8.x is not supported.
* You must use {mtc-short} 1.7.x to migrate anything with a source of {product-title} 4.9 or earlier.
** {mtc-short} 1.7.x must be used on both source and destination.
* {mtc-short} 1.8.x only supports migrations from {product-title} 4.10 or later to {product-title} 4.10 or later. For migrations only involving cluster versions 4.10 and later, either 1.7.x or 1.8.x may be used. However, it must be the same {mtc-short} version on both source & destination.
** Migration from source {mtc-short} 1.7.x to destination {mtc-short} 1.8.x is unsupported.
** Migration from source {mtc-short} 1.8.x to destination {mtc-short} 1.7.x is unsupported.
** Migration from source {mtc-short} 1.7.x to destination {mtc-short} 1.7.x is supported.
** Migration from source {mtc-short} 1.8.x to destination {mtc-short} 1.8.x is supported
