= Using the must-gather tool

You can run the `must-gather` tool with the following options. To use an option, add a flag corresponding to that option in the `must-gather` command.

Default configuration:: This configuration collects pod logs, {oadp-short}, and `Velero` custom resource (CR) information for all namespaces where the {oadp-short} Operator is installed.
Timeout:: Data collection can take a long time if there are many failed `Backup` CRs. You can improve performance by setting a timeout value.
Insecure TLS connections:: If a custom CA certificate is used, use the `must-gather` tool with insecure TLS connections.

The `must-gather` tool generates a Markdown output file with the collected information. The Markdown file is located in a cluster directory.

For more information about the supported flags, use the help flag with the `must-gather` tool as shown in the following example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather-v1-5} -- /usr/bin/gather -h
----


.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the {product-title} cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.
. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command for one of the following data collection options:

* To use the default configuration of the `must-gather` tool, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather-v1-5}
----
+
* To use the timeout flag with the `must-gather` tool, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather-v1-5} -- /usr/bin/gather --request-timeout 1m # <1>
----
<1> In this example, the timeout is 1 minute.
* To use the insecure TLS connection flag with the `must-gather` tool, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather-v1-5} -- /usr/bin/gather --skip-tls
----
* To use a combination of the insecure TLS connection and the timeout flags with the `must-gather` tool, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather-v1-5} -- /usr/bin/gather --request-timeout 15s --skip-tls #<1>
----
<1> In this example, the timeout is 15 seconds. By default, the `--skip-tls` flag value is `false`. Set the value to `true` to allow insecure TLS connections.

.Verification

. Verify that the Markdown output file is generated at the following location: `must-gather.local.89...054550/registry.redhat.io/oadp/oadp-mustgather-rhel9:v1.5-sha256-0...84/clusters/a4...86/oadp-must-gather-summary.md`

. Review the `must-gather` data in the Markdown file by opening the file in a Markdown previewer. For an example output, refer to the following image. You can upload this output file to a support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal].
