[id="manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_{context}"]
= Upgrading clusters with manually maintained credentials

The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) `Upgradable` status for a cluster with manually maintained credentials is `False` by default.

* For minor releases, for example, from 4.8 to 4.9, this status prevents you from upgrading until you have addressed any updated permissions and annotated the `CloudCredential` resource to indicate that the permissions are updated as needed for the next version. This annotation changes the `Upgradable` status to `True`.

* For z-stream releases, for example, from 4.9.0 to 4.9.1, no permissions are added or changed, so the upgrade is not blocked.

Before upgrading a cluster with manually maintained credentials, you must create any new credentials for the release image that you are upgrading to. Additionally, you must review the required permissions for existing credentials and accommodate any new permissions requirements in the new release for those components.

.Procedure

. Extract and examine the `CredentialsRequest` custom resource for the new release.
+
The "Manually creating IAM" section of the installation content for your cloud provider explains how to obtain and use the credentials required for your cloud.

. Update the manually maintained credentials on your cluster:

** Create new secrets for any `CredentialsRequest` custom resources that are added by the new release image.

** If the `CredentialsRequest` custom resources for any existing credentials that are stored in secrets have changed their permissions requirements, update the permissions as required.

. When all of the secrets are correct for the new release, indicate that the cluster is ready to upgrade:

.. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.. Edit the `CloudCredential` resource to add an `upgradeable-to` annotation within the `metadata` field:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit cloudcredential cluster
----
+
.Text to add
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
  metadata:
    annotations:
      cloudcredential.openshift.io/upgradeable-to: <version_number>
...
----
+
Where `<version_number>` is the version you are upgrading to, in the format `x.y.z`. For example, `4.8.2` for {product-title} 4.8.2.
+
It may take several minutes after adding the annotation for the upgradeable status to change.

. Verify that the CCO is upgradeable:

.. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings*.

.. To view the CCO status details, click *cloud-credential* in the *Cluster Operators* list.

.. If the *Upgradeable* status in the *Conditions* section is *False*, verify that the `upgradeable-to` annotation is free of typographical errors.

When the *Upgradeable* status in the *Conditions* section is *True*, you can begin the {product-title} upgrade.
