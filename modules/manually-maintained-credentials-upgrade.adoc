[id="manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_{context}"]
= Upgrading clusters with manually maintained credentials

If credentials are added in a future release, the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) `upgradable` status for a cluster with manually maintained credentials changes to `false`. For minor release, for example, from 4.6 to 4.7, this status prevents you from upgrading until you have addressed any updated permissions. For z-stream releases, for example, from 4.6.10 to 4.6.11, the upgrade is not blocked, but the credentials must still be updated for the new release.

Use the *Administrator* perspective of the web console to determine if the CCO is upgradeable.

. Navigate to *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings*.

. To view the CCO status details, click *cloud-credential* in the *Cluster Operators* list.

. If the *Upgradeable* status in the *Conditions* section is *False*, examine the `CredentialsRequest` custom resource for the new release and update the manually maintained credentials on your cluster to match before upgrading.

In addition to creating new credentials for the release image that you are
upgrading to, you must review the required permissions for existing credentials
and accommodate any new permissions requirements for existing components in the
new release. The CCO cannot detect these mismatches and will not set
`upgradable` to `false` in this case.

The "Manually creating IAM" section of the installation content for your cloud provider explains how to obtain and use the credentials required for your cloud.
