= Installing the ACK controller

[role="_abstract"]
Install the ACK controller to create and delete buckets in the S3 service by using a Kubernetes custom resource for the bucket. Installing the controller will also create the required namespace and service account.

We will use an Operator to make it easy. The Operator installation will also create an `ack-system` namespace and a service account `ack-s3-controller` for you.

.Procedure
. Log in to the cluster console.
. On the left menu, click *Ecosystem*, then *Software Catalog*.
. In the filter box, enter "S3" and select *AWS Controller for Kubernetes - Amazon S3*.

. If a pop-up about community operators appears, click *Continue*.
. Click *Install*.
. Select *All namespaces on the cluster* under "Installation mode".
. Select *ack-system* under "Installed Namespace".
. Select *Manual* under "Update approval".
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure *Manual Mode* is selected so changes to the service account are not overwritten by an automatic operator update.
====
+
. Click *Install*.

The settings should look like the below image.

. Click *Approve*.
. The installation begins but will not complete until you have created an IAM role and policy for the ACK controller.
