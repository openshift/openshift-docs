= Viewing the compliance dashboard

[role="_abstract"]
The compliance dashboard provides a high-level view of the compliance standards across all clusters, namespaces, and nodes in your environment.

The compliance dashboard includes charts and provides options to investigate a potential problem with compliance mandates.
You can navigate to compliance scan results for a single cluster, namespace, or a node.
Moreover, you can generate reports on the state of compliance within your containerized environment.

.Procedure
* On the {product-title-short} portal, select *Compliance (1.0)* from the navigation menu.

[NOTE]
====
The first time you open the Compliance dashboard you will see a blank dashboard.
You must run a compliance scan to populate the dashboard.
