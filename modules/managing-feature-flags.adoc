[id="prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites
* You have access to the environment where the {product-title-short} component is deployed.
* You have permission to modify environment variables.
* You understand that the Technology Preview features might be incomplete and are provided with limited support.
* You know if the flag for the Technology Preview feature needs to be configured before the deployment. Check the installation manifests to see if they use the required flag.

.Procedure

. Identify the environment variable name associated with the feature flag.
Consult the release notes or the `/v1/featureflags` API endpoint to identify the flag for the feature you want to enable or disable.

. Modify the feature flag by completing one of the following actions:
* To enable a feature, configure the environment variable associated with the flag by setting its value to `true`. Configure this directly on the Kubernetes deployment or during installation by using the Helm chart or the Operator custom resource (CR). 
* To disable a feature, set the environment variable associated with the flag to `false`.

. After the application is restarted or redeployed, verify that the feature has been enabled or disabled by completing the following steps:

* Check the output of the `/v1/featureflags` API endpoint.
* Check the application functionality related to the feature.
* Review logs or monitoring tools for any errors or confirmation messages.

[id="best-practices_{context}"]
== Best practices
Follow these best practices for using the feature flag:

* Always test feature changes in a staging environment before applying them to production.
* Keep a record of all feature flags and their current status.
* Be prepared to revert the changes if the feature causes issues.

[id="troubleshooting_{context}"]
== Troubleshooting
Follow these troubleshooting guidelines:

* If the feature does not appear, ensure that the environment variable is correctly named and set. Check application logs for any errors related to feature flag parsing.
* If enabling a feature causes application errors, disable the feature and contact Red Hat Support.
