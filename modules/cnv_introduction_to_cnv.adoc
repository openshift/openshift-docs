= Introduction to {ProductName}

{ProductName} is an add-on to {product-title} that allows virtual machine 
workloads to run and be managed alongside container workloads. 
You can create virtual machines from disk images imported using the 
containerized data importer (CDI) controller, or from scratch within 
{product-title}.

{ProductName} introduces two new objects to {product-title}:

* *Virtual Machine*: The virtual machine in {product-title}
* *Virtual Machine Instance*: A running instance of the virtual machine

With the {ProductName} add-on, virtual machines run in pods and have the same 
network and storage capabilities as standard pods.

Existing virtual machine disks are imported into persistent volumes (PVs), 
which are made accessible to {ProductName} virtual machines 
using persistent volume claims (PVCs). In {product-title}, the virtual machine 
object can be modified or replaced as needed, without affecting the persistent 
data stored on the PV.


[IMPORTANT]
====
{ProductName} is currently a Technology Preview feature. For details about Red 
Hat support for {ProductName}, see the 
https://access.redhat.com/articles/3742571[Container-native Virtualization - Technology Preview Support Policy].

Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service 
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does 
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access 
to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and 
provide feedback during the development process.
