= Interactive OCM and user role creation mode options

Before you can use {cluster-manager-first} to create {product-title} (ROSA) clusters that use the AWS Security Token Service (STS), you must associate your AWS account with your Red{nbsp}Hat organization by creating and linking the OCM and user roles. You can enable interactive mode by specifying the `--interactive` option when you run the `rosa create ocm-role` command or the `rosa create user-role` command.

The following tables describe the interactive OCM role creation mode options:

.`--interactive` OCM role creation mode options
[cols=".^2,.^3a",options="header"]
|===

|Field|Description

|`Role prefix`
|Specify the prefix to include in the OCM IAM role name. The default is `ManagedOpenShift`. You can create only one OCM role per AWS account for your Red{nbsp}Hat organization.

|`Enable admin capabilities for the OCM role (optional)`
|Enable the admin OCM IAM role, which is equivalent to specifying the `--admin` argument. The admin role is required if you want to use `auto` mode to automatically provision the cluster-specific Operator roles and the OIDC provider by using {cluster-manager}.

|`Permissions boundary ARN (optional)`
|Specify a permissions boundary Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the OCM role. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html[Permissions boundaries for IAM entities] in the AWS documentation.

|`Role Path (optional)`
|Specify a custom ARN path for your OCM role. The path must contain alphanumeric characters only and start and end with `/`, for example `/test/path/dev/`. For more information, see _ARN path customization for IAM roles and policies_.

|`Role creation mode`
|Select the role creation mode. You can use `auto` mode to automatically create the OCM role and link it to your Red{nbsp}Hat organization account. In `manual` mode, the ROSA CLI (`rosa`) generates the `aws` commands needed to create and link the role. In `manual` mode, the corresponding policy JSON files are also saved to the current directory. `manual` mode enables you to review the details before running the `aws` commands manually.

|`Create the '<ocm_role_name>' role?`
|Confirm if you want to create the OCM role.

|`Link the '<ocm_role_arn>' role with organization '<red_hat_organization_id>'?`
|Confirm if you want to link the OCM role with your Red{nbsp}Hat organization.

The following tables describe the interactive user role creation mode options:

.`--interactive` user role creation mode options
[cols=".^2,.^3a",options="header"]
|===

|Field|Description

|`Role prefix`
|Specify the prefix to include in the user role name. The default is `ManagedOpenShift`.

|`Permissions boundary ARN (optional)`
|Specify a permissions boundary Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user role. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html[Permissions boundaries for IAM entities] in the AWS documentation.

|`Role Path (optional)`
|Specify a custom ARN path for your user role. The path must contain alphanumeric characters only and start and end with `/`, for example `/test/path/dev/`. For more information, see _ARN path customization for IAM roles and policies_.

|`Role creation mode`
|Selects the role creation mode. You can use `auto` mode to automatically create the user role and link it to your {cluster-manager} user account. In `manual` mode, the ROSA CLI generates the `aws` commands needed to create and link the role. In `manual` mode, the corresponding policy JSON files are also saved to the current directory. `manual` mode enables you to review the details before running the `aws` commands manually.

|`Create the '<user_role_name>' role?`
|Confirm if you want to create the user role.

|`Link the '<user_role_arn>' role with account '<red_hat_user_account_id>'?`
|Confirm if you want to link the user role with your Red{nbsp}Hat user account.
