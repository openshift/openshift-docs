= Configuring priority and preemption

You apply pod priority and preemption by creating a priority class object and associating pods to the priority by using the
`priorityClassName` in your pod specs.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot add a priority class directly to an existing scheduled pod.
====

.Procedure

To configure your cluster to use priority and preemption:

. Create one or more priority classes:

.. Create a YAML file similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: high-priority <1>
value: 1000000 <2>
preemptionPolicy: PreemptLowerPriority <3>
globalDefault: false <4>
description: "This priority class should be used for XYZ service pods only." <5>
----
<1> The name of the priority class object.
<2> The priority value of the object.
<3> Optional. Specifies whether this priority class is preempting or non-preempting. The preemption policy defaults to `PreemptLowerPriority`, which allows pods of that priority class to preempt lower-priority pods. If the preemption policy is set to `Never`, pods in that priority class are non-preempting.
<4> Optional. Specifies whether this priority class should be used for pods without a priority class name specified. This field is `false` by default. Only one priority class with `globalDefault` set to `true` can exist in the cluster. If there is no priority class with `globalDefault:true`, the priority of pods with no priority class name is zero. Adding a priority class with `globalDefault:true` affects only pods created after the priority class is added and does not change the priorities of existing pods.
<5> Optional. Describes which pods developers should use with this priority class. Enter an arbitrary text string.

.. Create the priority class:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
----

. Create a pod spec to include the name of a priority class:

.. Create a YAML file similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  priorityClassName: high-priority <1>
----
<1> Specify the priority class to use with this pod.

.. Create the pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
----
+
You can add the priority name directly to the pod configuration or to a pod template.
