= Configuring image mirroring for {hcp} in a disconnected environment

Image mirroring is the process of fetching images from external registries, such as `registry.redhat.com` or `quay.io`, and storing them in your private registry.

In the following procedures, the `oc-mirror` tool is used, which is a binary that uses the `ImageSetConfiguration` object. In the file, you can specify the following information:

* The {product-title} versions to mirror. The versions are in `quay.io`.
* The additional Operators to mirror. Select packages individually.
* The extra images that you want to add to the repository.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that the registry server is running before you start the mirroring process.

.Procedure

To configure image mirroring, complete the following steps:

. Ensure that your `${HOME}/.docker/config.json` file is updated with the registries that you are going to mirror from and with the private registry that you plan to push the images to.

. By using the following example, create an `ImageSetConfiguration` object to use for mirroring. Replace values as needed to match your environment:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
mirror:
  platform:
    channels:
    - name: candidate-{product-version}
      minVersion: <4.x.y-build>  <1>
      maxVersion: <4.x.y-build> <1>
      type: ocp
    kubeVirtContainer: true <2>
    graph: true
  operators:
  - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v{product-version}
    packages:
    - name: lvms-operator
    - name: local-storage-operator
    - name: odf-csi-addons-operator
    - name: odf-operator
    - name: mcg-operator
    - name: ocs-operator
    - name: metallb-operator
    - name: kubevirt-hyperconverged <3>
----
+
<1> Replace `<4.x.y-build>` with the supported {product-title} version you want to use.
<2> Set this optional flag to `true` if you want to also mirror the container disk image for the {op-system-first} boot image for the KubeVirt provider. This flag is available with oc-mirror v2 only.
<3> For deployments that use the KubeVirt provider, include this line.

. Start the mirroring process by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc-mirror --v2 --config imagesetconfig.yaml \
  --workspace file://mirror-file docker://<registry>
----
+
After the mirroring process is finished, you have a new folder named `mirror-file`, which contains the `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS), `ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS), and the catalog sources to apply on the hosted cluster.

. Mirror the nightly or CI versions of {product-title} by configuring the `imagesetconfig.yaml` file as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
mirror:
  platform:
    graph: true
    release: registry.ci.openshift.org/ocp/release:<4.x.y-build> <1>
    kubeVirtContainer: true <2>
# ...
----
+
<1> Replace `<4.x.y-build>` with the supported {product-title} version you want to use.
<2> Set this optional flag to `true` if you want to also mirror the container disk image for the {op-system-first} boot image for the KubeVirt provider. This flag is available with oc-mirror v2 only.

. If you have a partially disconnected environment, mirror the images from the image set configuration to a registry by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror -c imagesetconfig.yaml \
  --workspace file://<file_path> docker://<mirror_registry_url> --v2
----
+
For more information, see "Mirroring an image set in a partially disconnected environment".

. If you have a fully disconnected environment, perform the following steps:

.. Mirror the images from the specified image set configuration to the disk by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror -c imagesetconfig.yaml file://<file_path> --v2
----
+
For more information, see "Mirroring an image set in a fully disconnected environment".

.. Process the image set file on the disk and mirror the contents to a target mirror registry by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror -c imagesetconfig.yaml \
  --from file://<file_path> docker://<mirror_registry_url> --v2
----

. Mirror the latest {mce-short} images by following the steps in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.15/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#install-on-disconnected-networks[Install on disconnected networks].
