= Configuring image mirroring for {hcp} in a disconnected environment

Image mirroring is the process of fetching images from external registries, such as `registry.redhat.com` or `quay.io`, and storing them in your private registry.

In the following procedures, the `oc-mirror` tool is used, which is a binary that uses the `ImageSetConfiguration` object. In the file, you can specify the following information:

* The {product-title} versions to mirror. The versions are in `quay.io`.
* The additional Operators to mirror. Select packages individually.
* The extra images that you want to add to the repository.

.Prerequisites

Ensure that the registry server is running before you start the mirroring process.

.Procedure

To configure image mirroring, complete the following steps:

. Ensure that your `${HOME}/.docker/config.json` file is updated with the registries that you are going to mirror from and with the private registry that you plan to push the images to.

. By using the following example, create an `ImageSetConfiguration` object to use for mirroring. Replace values as needed to match your environment:
+

<1> Replace `<dns.base.domain.name>` with the DNS base domain name.
<2> Replace `4.x.y-build` with the supported {product-title} version you want to use.
<3> Set this optional flag to `true` if you want to also mirror the container disk image for the {op-system-first} boot image for the KubeVirt provider. This flag is available with oc-mirror v2 only.
<4> For deployments that use the KubeVirt provider, include this line.

. Start the mirroring process by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc-mirror --v2 --config imagesetconfig.yaml docker://${REGISTRY}
----
+
After the mirroring process is finished, you have a new folder named `oc-mirror-workspace/results-XXXXXX/`, which contains the IDMS and the catalog sources to apply on the hosted cluster.

. Mirror the nightly or CI versions of {product-title} by configuring the `imagesetconfig.yaml` file as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
mirror:
  platform:
    graph: true
    release: registry.ci.openshift.org/ocp/release:4.x.y-build <1>
    kubeVirtContainer: true <2>
# ...

<1> Replace `4.x.y-build` with the supported {product-title} version you want to use.
<2> Set this optional flag to `true` if you want to also mirror the container disk image for the {op-system-first} boot image for the KubeVirt provider. This flag is available with oc-mirror v2 only.

. Apply the changes to the file by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]

$ oc-mirror --v2 --config imagesetconfig.yaml docker://${REGISTRY}
