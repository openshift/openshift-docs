= Using tolerations for kernel module scheduling

There are circumstances where you need to evacuate workloads on a node before upgrading a kernel module, which you can do through taints. You can use a taint to schedule only pods that contain a matching toleration on the node.

However, you also need to set tolerations to allow Kernel Module Management (KMM) pods that run housekeeping operations, such as kernel module upgrades. The tolerations must match the taint that is added to the nodes.

You can create user-defined tolerations to kernel modules to schedule selected KMM pods on a cordoned node. For example, during a device driver upgrade you cordon a node, at the same time, you can run housekeeping pods that perform the driver upgrades.

The `ModuleSpec` field is used to carry the tolerations to the KMM pods that are used during pod creation.
