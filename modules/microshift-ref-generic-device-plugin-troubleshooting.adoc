= Troubleshooting configuration issues

If you encounter errors such as "invalid configuration: failed to parse device" or "cannot define both path and usbs at the same time", it means you have incorrectly mixed `paths` and `usbs` fields within the same `groups` entry for a device. Each `group` must exclusively use either `paths` or `usbs` to define its devices.
