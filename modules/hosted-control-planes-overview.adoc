= Introduction to {hcp}

You can use {hcp} for Red Hat {product-title} to reduce management costs, optimize cluster deployment time, and separate management and workload concerns so that you can focus on your applications.

{hcp-capital} is available by using the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#cluster_mce_overview[multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator version 2.0 or later] on the following platforms:

* Bare metal by using the Agent provider
* {VirtProductName}
* {aws-first}, as a Technology Preview feature
* {ibm-z-title}, as a Technology Preview feature
* {ibm-power-title}, as a Technology Preview feature

== Architecture of {hcp}

{product-title} is often deployed in a coupled, or standalone, model, where a cluster consists of a control plane and a data plane. The control plane includes an API endpoint, a storage endpoint, a workload scheduler, and an actuator that ensures state. The data plane includes compute, storage, and networking where workloads and applications run.

The standalone control plane is hosted by a dedicated group of nodes, which can be physical or virtual, with a minimum number to ensure quorum. The network stack is shared. Administrator access to a cluster offers visibility into the cluster's control plane, machine management APIs, and other components that contribute to the state of a cluster.

Although the standalone model works well, some situations require an architecture where the control plane and data plane are decoupled. In those cases, the data plane is on a separate network domain with a dedicated physical hosting environment. The control plane is hosted by using high-level primitives such as deployments and stateful sets that are native to Kubernetes. The control plane is treated as any other workload.

== Benefits of {hcp}

With {hcp} for {product-title}, you can pave the way for a true hybrid-cloud approach and enjoy several other benefits.

* The security boundaries between management and workloads are stronger because the control plane is decoupled and hosted on a dedicated hosting service cluster. As a result, you are less likely to leak credentials for clusters to other users. Because infrastructure secret account management is also decoupled, cluster infrastructure administrators cannot accidentally delete control plane infrastructure.

* With {hcp}, you can run many control planes on fewer nodes. As a result, clusters are more affordable.

* Because the control planes consist of pods that are launched on {product-title}, control planes start quickly. The same principles apply to control planes and workloads, such as monitoring, logging, and auto-scaling.

* From an infrastructure perspective, you can push registries, HAProxy, cluster monitoring, storage nodes, and other infrastructure components to the tenant's cloud provider account, isolating usage to the tenant.

* From an operational perspective, multicluster management is more centralized, which results in fewer external factors that affect the cluster status and consistency. Site reliability engineers have a central place to debug issues and navigate to the cluster data plane, which can lead to shorter Time to Resolution (TTR) and greater productivity.
