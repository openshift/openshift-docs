[role="_abstract"]
The following enhancements for direct authentication with an external OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider are included in this z-stream release:

General availability of direct authentication with an external OIDC identity provider::
Using direct authentication with an external OIDC identity provider is now generally available. This authentication method bypasses the built-in OAuth server and uses the external identity provider directly.

Support for additional identity providers::
The following OIDC identity providers are now supported for direct authentication:

* Active Directory Federation Services for Windows Server
* GitLab
* Google
* Okta
* Ping Identity
* Red Hat Single Sign-On

Deactivation of OAuth services::
The following internal OAuth resources are now disabled when you configure direct authentication:

* OpenShift OAuth server and OpenShift OAuth API server
* User and group APIs (`*.user.openshift.io`)
* OAuth APIs (`*.oauth.openshift.io`)
* OAuth server and client configurations

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that you do not rely on these removed resources before configuring direct authentication.
====

Support for additional claim mappings::
You can now use the `uid` and `extra` claim mapping fields when configuring an external OIDC provider for direct authentication.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/external-auth.adoc#external-auth[Enabling direct authentication with an external OIDC identity provider].
