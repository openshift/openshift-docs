= Configuring the LVMS 

{product-title} supports passing through a user's LVMS configuration and allows users to specify custom volume groups, thin volume provisioning parameters, and reserved unallocated volume group space. The LVMS configuration file can be edited at any time. You must restart {product-title} to deploy configuration changes. 

The following `config.yaml` file shows a basic LVMS configuration:

<1> String. The UNIX domain socket endpoint of gRPC. Defaults to  `/run/topolvm/lvmd.sock`. 
<2> `map[string]DeviceClass`. The `device-class` settings. 
<3> String. The name of the `device-class`.
<4> String. The group where the `device-class` creates the logical volumes. 
<5> unit64. Storage capacity in GiB to be spared. Defaults to `10`. 
<6> Boolean. Indicates that the `device-class` is used by default. Defaults to `false`. 
<7> unit. The number of stripes in the logical volume.
<8> String. The amount of data that is written to one device before moving to the next device. 
<9> String. Extra arguments to pas `lvcreate`, for example, `[--type=raid1"`].

[NOTE]
====
Striping can be configured by using the dedicated options (`stripe` and `stripe-size`) and `lvcreate-options`. Either option can be used, but they cannot be used together. Using `stripe` and `stripe-size` with `lvcreate-options` leads to duplicate arguments to `lvcreate`. You should never set `lvcreate-options: ["--stripes=n"]` and `stripe: n` at the same time. You can, however, use both, when `lvcreate-options` is not used for striping. For example: 

[source,yaml]
----
stripe: 2
lvcreate-options: ["--mirrors=1"]
