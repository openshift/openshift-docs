= Configuring Azure confidential virtual machines by using machine sets

:FeatureName: Using Azure confidential virtual machines
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

{product-title} {product-version} supports Azure confidential virtual machines (VMs).

[NOTE]
====
Confidential VMs are currently not supported on 64-bit ARM architectures.
====

By editing the machine set YAML file, you can configure the confidential VM options that a machine set uses for machines that it deploys. For example, you can configure these machines to use UEFI security features such as Secure Boot or a dedicated virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) instance.

ifdef::cpmso[]
[WARNING]
====
Not all instance types support confidential VMs. Do not change the instance type for a control plane machine set that is configured to use confidential VMs to a type that is incompatible. Using an incompatible instance type can cause your cluster to become unstable.

.Procedure

. In a text editor, open the YAML file for an existing machine set or create a new one.

. Edit the following section under the `providerSpec` field:

<1> Specifies security profile settings for the managed disk when using a confidential VM.
<2> Enables encryption of the Azure VM Guest State (VMGS) blob. This setting requires the use of vTPM.
<3> Specifies security profile settings for the confidential VM.
<4> Enables the use of confidential VMs. This value is required for all valid configurations.
<5> Specifies which UEFI security features to use. This section is required for all valid configurations.
<6> Disables UEFI Secure Boot.
<7> Enables the use of a vTPM.
<8> Specifies an instance type that supports confidential VMs.

.Verification

* On the Azure portal, review the details for a machine deployed by the machine set and verify that the confidential VM options match the values that you configured.
