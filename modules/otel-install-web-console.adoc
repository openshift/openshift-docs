= Installing the {OTELShortName} from the web console

You can install the {OTELShortName} from the *Administrator* view of the web console.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the web console as a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

* For {product-dedicated}, you must be logged in using an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Install the {OTELOperator}:

.. Go to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* and search for `{OTELOperator}`.

.. Select the *{OTELOperator}* that is *provided by Red Hat* -> *Install* -> *Install* -> *View Operator*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
This installs the Operator with the default presets:

* *Update channel* -> *stable*
* *Installation mode* -> *All namespaces on the cluster*
* *Installed Namespace* -> *openshift-operators*
* *Update approval* -> *Automatic*
====

.. In the *Details* tab of the installed Operator page, under *ClusterServiceVersion details*, verify that the installation *Status* is *Succeeded*.

. Create a project of your choice for the *OpenTelemetry Collector* instance that you will create in the next step by going to *Home* -> *Projects* -> *Create Project*.

. Create an *OpenTelemetry Collector* instance.

.. Go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

.. Select *OpenTelemetry Collector* -> *Create OpenTelemetry Collector* -> *YAML view*.

.. In the *YAML view*, customize the `OpenTelemetryCollector` custom resource (CR) with the OTLP, Jaeger, Zipkin receivers and the debug exporter.
