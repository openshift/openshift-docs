[id="ossm-config-individual-control-plane-infrastructure-node_{context}"]
= Configuring individual {SMProductShortName} control plane components to run on infrastructure nodes

This task should only be performed if individual {SMProductShortName} control plane components (such as Istiod, the Ingress Gateway, and the Egress Gateway) will run on infrastructure nodes. 

If the control plane will run on a worker node, skip this task.

.Procedure

. Open the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource as a YAML file.

$ oc -n istio-system edit smcp <name> <1>
----
<1>  `<name>` represents the name of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

. To run the Istiod component on an infrastructure node, add the `nodeSelector` and the `tolerations` fields to the `spec.runtime.components.pilot.pod` spec in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.
