= Enabling Insights Operator alerts

When alerts are disabled, the Insights Operator no longer sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance. You can change this behavior.

.Prerequisites

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as `cluster-admin`.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Workloads* -> *Secrets*.
. On the *Secrets* page, select *All Projects* from the *Project* list, and then set *Show default projects* to *ON*.
. Select the *openshift-config* project from the *Projects* list.
. Search for the *support* secret by using the *Search by name* field. 
. Click the *Options* menu {kebab}, and then click *Edit Secret*.
. For the `disableInsightsAlerts` key, set the *Value* field to `false`.

After you save the changes, Insights Operator again sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance.
