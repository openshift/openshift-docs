= Enabling {insights-operator} alerts

[role="_abstract"]
When alerts are disabled, the {insights-operator} no longer sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance. You can reenable them.

[NOTE]
====
Previously, a cluster administrator would create or edit the {insights-operator} configuration using a *support secret* in the `openshift-config` namespace. {red-hat-lightspeed} now supports the creation of a `ConfigMap` object to configure the {insights-operator}. The {insights-operator} gives preference to the config map configuration over the support secret if both exist.

.Prerequisites

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as `cluster-admin`.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* The *insights-config* `ConfigMap` object exists in the `openshift-insights` namespace.

.Procedure

. Go to *Workloads* -> *ConfigMaps* and select *Project: openshift-insights*.
. Click on the *insights-config* `ConfigMap` object to open it.
. Click *Actions* and select *Edit ConfigMap*.
. Click the *YAML view* radio button.
. In the file, set the `alerting` attribute to `disabled: false`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
# ...
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alerting:
      disabled: false
# ...
----

. Click *Save*. The *insights-config* config-map details page opens.
. Verify that the value of the `config.yaml` `alerting` attribute is set to `disabled: false`.
+
After you save the changes, {insights-operator} again sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance.
