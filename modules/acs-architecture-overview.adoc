= {product-title} architecture

{product-title} installs as a set of containers in your {ocp} cluster and it includes multiple components.
For better understanding, you can group the components into the following categories:

* Centralized components
* Per-cluster components
* Per-node component

[id="centralized-components_{context}"]
== Centralized components

You deploy centralized components only once and you can monitor multiple separate clusters by using the same installation.
{product-title} includes the following centralized components:

* Central
* Scanner

[discrete]
=== Central

_Central_ is the main component of {product-title} and it is installed as a Kubernetes deployment.
It handles data persistence, API interactions, and user interface(Portal) access.
You can use the same Central instance to secure multiple {ocp} or Kubernetes clusters.

[discrete]
=== Scanner

{product-title} includes an image vulnerability scanning component called _Scanner_.
It analyzes all image layers to check for known vulnerabilities from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) list.
Scanner also identifies vulnerabilities in packages installed by package managers and in dependencies for multiple programming languages.
//TODO: Add link to Examine images topic.

[NOTE]
====
_Scanner_ only scans those images that are not already scanned by other integrated vulnerability scanners.
It means that if you have integrated {product-title} with other vulnerability scanners, Scanner checks and uses the scanning results from the integrated scanner if available.

//TODO: Add link to integrate-with-vulnerability-scanners topic

[id="per-cluster-components_{context}"]
== Per-cluster components

You deploy the per-cluster components into each cluster that you want to monitor.
{product-title} includes the following per-cluster components:

* Sensor
* Admission controller

[discrete]
=== Sensor

{product-title} uses the _Sensor_ component to monitor Kubernetes and OpenShfit clusters.
It handles interactions with the {ocp} or Kubernetes API server for policy detection and enforcement, and it coordinates with _Collector_.

[discrete]
=== Admission controller

The _admission controller_ prevents users from creating workloads that violate security policies in {product-title}.
//TODO: Add link to admission-controller-enforcement.

[id="per-node-components_{context}"]
== Per-node components

You deploy the per-node components in all nodes that you want to monitor.
{product-title} includes the following per-cluster components:

* Collector

[discrete]
=== Collector

_Collector_ collects and monitors information about container runtime and network activity.
It then sends the collected information to _Sensor_.
