= {product-title} architecture overview

{product-title} ({product-title-short}) uses a distributed architecture that supports high-scale deployments and is optimized to minimize the impact on the underlying {ocp} or Kubernetes nodes.

.{product-title-short} architecture

The following graphic shows the architecture with the StackRox Scanner and Scanner V4 components. Installation of Scanner V4 is optional, but provides additional benefits.

You install {product-title-short} as a set of containers in your {ocp} or Kubernetes cluster. {product-title-short} includes the following services:

* Central services you install on one cluster
* Secured cluster services you install on each cluster you want to secure by {product-title-short}

In addition to these primary services, {product-title-short} also interacts with other external components to enhance your clusters' security.

== Installation differences

When you install {product-title-short} on {ocp} by using the Operator, {product-title-short} installs a lightweight version of Scanner on every secured cluster. The lightweight Scanner enables the scanning of images in the integrated OpenShift image registry. When you install {product-title-short} on {ocp} or Kubernetes by using the Helm install method with the _default_ values, the lightweight version of Scanner is not installed. To install the lightweight Scanner on the secured cluster by using Helm, you must set the `scanner.disable=false` parameter. You cannot install the lightweight Scanner by using the `roxctl` installation method.
