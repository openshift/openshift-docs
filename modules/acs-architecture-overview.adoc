You install {product-title-short} as a set of containers in your {ocp} or Kubernetes cluster. {product-title-short} includes the following services:

* Central services you install on one cluster
* Secured cluster services you install on each cluster you want to secure by {product-title-short}

In addition to these primary services, {product-title-short} also interacts with other external components to enhance your clusters' security.
