The following issues are fixed with {ols-official} 1.0.3:

* Before this update, the {ols-long} service could not reload BYO Knowledge images with floating tags. This condition occurred even after a restart because the `ImagePullPolicy` parameter was hardcoded to `PullIfNotPresent`. As a result, BYO Knowledge images failed to reload from the container registry, causing users to experience stale images. With this update, when the {ols-long} service restarts, it pulls the BYO Knowledge images from the container registry, ensuring consistent access to BYO Knowledge images.  link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1956[OLS-1956].
