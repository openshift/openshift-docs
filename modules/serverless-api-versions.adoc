= About API versions

The {ServerlessOperatorName} automatically upgrades older resources that use deprecated versions of APIs to use the latest version.

For example, if you have created resources on your cluster that use older versions of the `ApiServerSource` API, such as `v1beta1`, the {ServerlessOperatorName} automatically updates these resources to use the `v1` version of the API when this is available and the `v1beta1` version is deprecated.

After they have been deprecated, older versions of APIs might be removed in any upcoming release. Using deprecated versions of APIs does not cause resources to fail. However, if you try to use a version of an API that has been removed, it will cause resources to fail. Ensure that your manifests are updated to use the latest version to avoid issues.
