= About OpenShift Service Mesh Console plugin

The {SMPlugin} is an extension to {ocp-short-name} web console that provides visibility in your {SMProductShortName}.

[WARNING]
====
The {SMPluginShort} supports only one Kiali instance, regardless of its project access scope.
====

The {SMPluginShort} provides a new category, *{SMProductShortName}*, in the main {ocp-short-name} web console navigation with the following menu options:

* *Overview* for a summary of your mesh, displayed as cards that represent the namespaces in the mesh.

* *Traffic Graph* for a full topology view of your mesh, represented by nodes and edges with each node representing a component of the mesh and each edge representing traffic flowing through the mesh between components.

* *{istio} config* for a list of all {istio} configuration files in your mesh, with a column that provides a quick way to know if the configuration for each resource is valid.

* *Mesh* for detailed information about the {istio} infrastructure status. It shows an infrastructure topology view with core and add-on components, their health, and how they are connected to each other.

In the {ocp-short-name} *Workloads* details page, the {SMPluginShort} adds a *{SMProductShortName}* tab that has the following subtabs:

* *Overview* subtab shows a summary of the selected workload, including a localized topology graph showing the workload with all inbound and outbound edges and nodes.

* *Traffic* subtab shows information about all inbound and outbound traffic to the workload.

* *Logs* subtab shows the logs for the workload's containers. You can see container logs individually ordered by log time  and also how the Envoy sidecar proxy logs relate to your workload's application logs. You can enable the tracing span integration which then allows you to see which logs correspond to trace spans.

* *Metrics* subtab shows both inbound and outbound metric graphs in the corresponding subtabs. All the workload metrics are here, providing a detailed view of the performance of your workload. You can enable the tracing span integration that allows you to see which spans occurred at the same time as the metrics. With the span marker in the graph, you can see the specific spans associated with that timeframe.

* *Traces* subtab provides a chart showing the trace spans collected over the given timeframe. The trace spans show the most low-level detail within your workload application. The trace details further show heatmaps that provides a comparison of one span in relation to other requests and spans in the same timeframe.

* *Envoy* subtab shows information about the Envoy sidecar configuration.

[NOTE]
====
In the {ocp-short-name} *Networking* details page, the {SMPluginShort} adds a *{SMProductShortName}* tab similar to the *Workloads* details page.
