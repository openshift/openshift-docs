You can install {tekton-hub} on your cluster using two modes:

* _Without_ login authorization and ratings for {tekton-hub} artifacts
* _with_ login authorization and ratings for {tekton-hub} artifacts

[NOTE]
====
If you are using Github Enterprise or Gitlab Enterprise, install and deploy {tekton-hub} in the same network as the enterprise server. For example, if the enterprise server is running behind a VPN, deploy {tekton-hub} on a cluster that is also behind the VPN.
