= {rh-storage-first}

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
{rh-storage-first} provides file, block, and object storage services to the hub cluster.

Limits and requirements::
* {odf-first} in internal mode requires the Local Storage Operator to define a storage class which will provide the necessary underlying storage.
* When doing the planning for a telco management cluster, consider the {odf-short} infrastructure and networking requirements.
* Dual stack support is limited.
{odf-short} IPv4 is supported on dual-stack clusters.

Engineering considerations::
* Address capacity warnings promptly as recovery can be difficult in case of storage capacity exhaustion, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.15/html-single/planning_your_deployment/index#capacity_planning[Capacity planning].
