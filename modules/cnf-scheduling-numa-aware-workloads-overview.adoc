= Scheduling NUMA-aware workloads 

Clusters running latency-sensitive workloads typically feature performance profiles that help to minimize workload latency and optimize performance. The NUMA-aware scheduler deploys workloads based on available node NUMA resources and with respect to any performance profile settings applied to the node. The combination of NUMA-aware deployments, and the performance profile of the workload, ensures that workloads are scheduled in a way that maximizes performance.
