= Scheduling NUMA-aware workloads

Clusters running latency-sensitive workloads typically feature performance profiles that help to minimize workload latency and optimize performance. The NUMA-aware scheduler deploys workloads based on available node NUMA resources and with respect to any performance profile settings applied to the node. The combination of NUMA-aware deployments, and the performance profile of the workload, ensures that workloads are scheduled in a way that maximizes performance.

For the NUMA Resources Operator to be fully operational, you must deploy the `NUMAResourcesOperator` custom resource and the NUMA-aware secondary pod scheduler.
