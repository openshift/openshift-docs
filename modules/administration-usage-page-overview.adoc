= Administration usage page overview

When you click *Show administration usage* in the *System Health* page, you can view the product usage data for the number of secured Kubernetes nodes and CPU units for secured clusters based on metrics collected from Sensors. You can use this information to estimate {rh-rhacs-first} consumption data for reporting.

For more information on how CPU units are defined in Kubernetes, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-cpu[CPU resource units] (Kubernetes documentation).

[NOTE]
