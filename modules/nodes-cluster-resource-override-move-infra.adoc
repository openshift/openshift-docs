= Moving the Cluster Resource Override Operator pods

[role="_abstract"]
You can move the Cluster Resource Override Operator pods to infrastructure nodes to reduce the subscription requirements of your cluster. Move the pods by editing the `Subscription` custom resource (CR) for the Cluster Resource Override Operator and the `ClusterResourceOverride` custom resource.

By default, the Cluster Resource Override Operator installation process creates an Operator pod and two Cluster Resource Override pods on nodes in the `clusterresourceoverride-operator` namespace. You can move these pods to other nodes, such as infrastructure nodes, as needed.

ifdef::cro[]
You can create and use infrastructure nodes to host only infrastructure components, such as the default router, the integrated container image registry, and the components for cluster metrics and monitoring. These infrastructure nodes are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment. For more information about infrastructure nodes, see "Creating infrastructure machine sets".

.Procedure

. Move the Cluster Resource Override Operator pod by adding a node selector to its `Subscription` custom resource (CR).

.. Edit the CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit -n clusterresourceoverride-operator subscriptions.operators.coreos.com clusterresourceoverride
----

.. Add a node selector to match the node role label on the node where you want to move the Cluster Resource Override Operator pod, and add a toleration if the node uses taints:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: clusterresourceoverride
  namespace: clusterresourceoverride-operator
# ...
spec:
  config:
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
    tolerations:
    - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/infra"
      operator: "Exists"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
# ...
----
+
where:
+
`nodeSelector`:: Specifies the role label on the node where you want to move the Cluster Resource Override Operator pod
`tolerations`:: Specifies the toleration for the node where you want to move the pod. This field is only necessary if the node uses a taint.

. Move the Cluster Resource Override pods by adding a node selector to the `ClusterResourceOverride` custom resource (CR):

.. Edit the CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit ClusterResourceOverride cluster -n clusterresourceoverride-operator
----

.. Add a node selector to match the node role label on the node, and add a toleration if the node uses taints:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.autoscaling.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterResourceOverride
metadata:
  name: cluster
  resourceVersion: "37952"
spec:
  podResourceOverride:
    spec:
      cpuRequestToLimitPercent: 25
      limitCPUToMemoryPercent: 200
      memoryRequestToLimitPercent: 50
  deploymentOverrides:
    replicas: 1
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
    tolerations:
    - key: "key"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "value"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
# ...
----
+
where:
+
`replicas`:: Optional: specifies the number of Cluster Resource Override pods to deploy. The default is `2`. Only one pod is allowed per node.
`nodeSelector`:: Specifies the role label on the node where you want to move the Cluster Resource Override Operator pod
`tolerations`:: Specifies the toleration for the node where you want to move the pod. This field is only necessary if the node uses a taint.

.Verification

* You can verify that the pods have moved by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n clusterresourceoverride-operator -o wide
----
+
The Cluster Resource Override pods are now deployed to the infra nodes.
+
