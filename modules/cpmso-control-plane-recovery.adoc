= Recovery of failed control plane machines

The Control Plane Machine Set Operator automates the recovery of control plane machines. When a control plane machine is deleted, the Operator creates a replacement with the configuration that is specified in the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` custom resource (CR).

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
For clusters that use control plane machine sets, you can configure a machine health check. The machine health check deletes unhealthy control plane machines so that they are replaced.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you configure a `MachineHealthCheck` resource for the control plane, set the value of `maxUnhealthy` to `1`.

This configuration ensures that the machine health check takes no action when multiple control plane machines appear to be unhealthy. Multiple unhealthy control plane machines can indicate that the etcd cluster is degraded or that a scaling operation to replace a failed machine is in progress.

If the etcd cluster is degraded, manual intervention might be required. If a scaling operation is in progress, the machine health check should allow it to finish.
