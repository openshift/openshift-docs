= Retrieving PTP events with the PTP events REST API v2

Applications subscribe to PTP events by using an O-RAN v4 compatible REST API in the producer-side cloud event proxy sidecar.
The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar container can access the same resources as the primary application container without using any of the resources of the primary application and with no significant latency.

image:darkcircle-1.png[20,20] Event is generated on the cluster host::
The `linuxptp-daemon` process in the PTP Operator-managed pod runs as a Kubernetes `DaemonSet` and manages the various `linuxptp` processes (`ptp4l`, `phc2sys`, and optionally for grandmaster clocks, `ts2phc`).
The `linuxptp-daemon` passes the event to the UNIX domain socket.

image:darkcircle-2.png[20,20] Event is passed to the cloud-event-proxy sidecar::
The PTP plugin reads the event from the UNIX domain socket and passes it to the `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar in the PTP Operator-managed pod.
`cloud-event-proxy` delivers the event from the Kubernetes infrastructure to Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNFs) with low latency.

image:darkcircle-3.png[20,20] Event is published::
The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar in the PTP Operator-managed pod processes the event and publishes the event by using the PTP events REST API v2.

image:darkcircle-4.png[20,20] Consumer application requests a subscription and receives the subscribed event::
The consumer application sends an API request to the producer `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar to create a PTP events subscription.
Once subscribed, the consumer application listens to the address specified in the resource qualifier and receives and processes the PTP events.
