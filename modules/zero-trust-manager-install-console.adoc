= Installing the {zero-trust-full} by using the web console

Use the OperatorHub in the {product-title} web console to install the {zero-trust-full}. This process streamlines deployment and helps ensure the Operator is installed in the correct namespace with the appropriate installation mode.

[NOTE]
====
A minimum of 1Gi persistent volume is required to install the SPIRE Server.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have access to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Go to *Ecosystem* -> *Software Catalog*.

. Search for *{zero-trust-full}*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

.. Update the *Update channel*, if necessary. The channel defaults to `stable-v1`, which installs the latest `stable-v1` release of the {zero-trust-full}.

.. Choose the *Installed Namespace* for the Operator. The default Operator namespace is `zero-trust-workload-identity-manager`.
+
If the `zero-trust-workload-identity-manager` namespace does not exist, it is created for you.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Operator and operands are deployed in the same namespace.
====

.. Select an *Update Approval* strategy

* The *Automatic strategy* allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.

* The *Manual strategy* requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.

. Click *Install*.

.Verification
