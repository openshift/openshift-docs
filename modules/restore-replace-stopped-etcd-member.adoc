= Replacing an unhealthy etcd member whose machine is not running or whose node is not ready

This procedure details the steps to replace an etcd member that is unhealthy either because the machine is not running or because the node is not ready.

.Prerequisites

* You have identified the unhealthy etcd member.
* You have verified that either the machine is not running or the node is not ready.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have taken an etcd backup.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to take an etcd backup before performing this procedure so that your cluster can be restored if you encounter any issues.
====

.Procedure

. Remove the unhealthy member.

.. Choose a Pod that is _not_ on the affected node:
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-etcd | grep etcd
etcd-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal                3/3     Running     0          123m
etcd-ip-10-0-164-97.ec2.internal                 3/3     Running     0          123m
etcd-ip-10-0-154-204.ec2.internal                3/3     Running     0          124m
----

.. Connect to the running etcd container, passing in the name of a Pod that is not on the affected node:
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-ip-10-0-154-204.ec2.internal
----

.. View the member list:

.. Remove the unhealthy etcd member by providing the ID to the `etcdctl member remove` command:

+
You can now exit the node shell.

. Delete and recreate the master machine. After this machine is recreated, a new revision is forced and etcd scales up automatically.
+
If you are running an installer-provision installation, or you used the Machine API to create your machines, follow these steps. Otherwise, you must create the new master using the same method that was used to originally create it.

.. Obtain the machine for the unhealthy member.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:

$ oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api -o wide

<1> The new machine, `clustername-8qw5l-master-3` is being created and is ready once the phase changes from `Provisioning` to `Running`.

It might take a few minutes for the new machine to be created. The etcd cluster Operator will automatically sync when the machine or node returns to a healthy state.
