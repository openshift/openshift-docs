[id="restore-replace-stopped-etcd-member_{context}"]
= Replacing an unhealthy etcd member whose machine is not running or whose node is not ready

This procedure details the steps to replace an etcd member that is unhealthy either because the machine is not running or because the node is not ready.

[NOTE]
====
If your cluster uses a control plane machine set, see "Troubleshooting the control plane machine set" for a more simple etcd recovery procedure. 
====

.Prerequisites

* You have identified the unhealthy etcd member.
* You have verified that either the machine is not running or the node is not ready.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have taken an etcd backup.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to take an etcd backup before performing this procedure so that your cluster can be restored if you encounter any issues.
====

.Procedure

. Remove the unhealthy member.

.. Choose a pod that is _not_ on the affected node:
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-etcd | grep -v etcd-quorum-guard | grep etcd
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
etcd-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal                3/3     Running     0          123m
etcd-ip-10-0-164-97.ec2.internal                 3/3     Running     0          123m
etcd-ip-10-0-154-204.ec2.internal                3/3     Running     0          124m
----

.. Connect to the running etcd container, passing in the name of a pod that is not on the affected node:
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-ip-10-0-154-204.ec2.internal
----

.. View the member list:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member list -w table
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

+------------------+---------+------------------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
----
+
Take note of the ID and the name of the unhealthy etcd member, because these values are needed later in the procedure. The `$ etcdctl endpoint health` command will list the removed member until the procedure of replacement is finished and a new member is added.

.. Remove the unhealthy etcd member by providing the ID to the `etcdctl member remove` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member remove 6fc1e7c9db35841d
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Member 6fc1e7c9db35841d removed from cluster ead669ce1fbfb346
----

.. View the member list again and verify that the member was removed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member list -w table
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
+------------------+---------+------------------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+

+------------------+---------+------------------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
----
+
You can now exit the node shell.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
After you remove the member, the cluster might be unreachable for a short time while the remaining etcd instances reboot.
====

. Turn off the quorum guard by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": {"useUnsupportedUnsafeNonHANonProductionUnstableEtcd": true}}}'
----
+
This command ensures that you can successfully re-create secrets and roll out the static pods.

. Remove the old secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed.

.. List the secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secrets -n openshift-etcd | grep ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal <1>
----
<1> Pass in the name of the unhealthy etcd member that you took note of earlier in this procedure.
+
There is a peer, serving, and metrics secret as shown in the following output:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

----

.. Delete the secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed.

... Delete the peer secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-peer-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal
----

... Delete the serving secret:

$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-serving-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal

... Delete the metrics secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-serving-metrics-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal
----

. Delete and recreate the control plane machine. After this machine is recreated, a new revision is forced and etcd scales up automatically.
+
If you are running installer-provisioned infrastructure, or you used the Machine API to create your machines, follow these steps. Otherwise, you must create the new master using the same method that was used to originally create it.

.. Obtain the machine for the unhealthy member.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api -o wide

<1> The new machine, `clustername-8qw5l-master-3` is being created and is ready once the phase changes from `Provisioning` to `Running`.

It might take a few minutes for the new machine to be created. The etcd cluster Operator will automatically sync when the machine or node returns to a healthy state.

. Turn the quorum guard back on by entering the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": null}}'
