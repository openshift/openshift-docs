= Modifying a NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource

[role="_abstract"]
To update network settings or change network parameters for a secondary network in {product-title}, you can modify the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resource. Edit the Cluster Network Operator CR to apply your changes.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured a secondary network for your cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Edit the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) CR in your default text editor by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. In the `additionalNetworks` collection, update the secondary network with your changes.

. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.

. Optional: Confirm that the CNO updated the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object by running the following command. Replace `<network_name>` with the name of the secondary network to display. There might be a delay before the CNO updates the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object to reflect your changes.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions <network_name> -o yaml
----
+
For example, the following console output displays a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object that is named `net1`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions net1 -o go-template='{{printf "%s\n" .spec.config}}'
