= Creating an EgressFirewall custom resource (CR)

As a cluster administrator, you can create an egress firewall policy object for a project.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the project already has an `EgressFirewall` resource, you must edit the existing policy to make changes to egress firewall rules.
====

.Prerequisites

* A cluster that uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You must log in to the cluster as a cluster administrator.

.Procedure

. Create a policy rule:
.. Create a `<policy_name>.yaml` file where `<policy_name>` describes the egress
policy rules.
.. Define the `EgressFirewall` object in the file.

. Create the policy object by entering the following command. Replace `<policy_name>` with the name of the policy and `<project>` with the project that the rule applies to.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <policy_name>.yaml -n <project>
----
+
Successful output lists the `egressfirewall.k8s.ovn.org/v1` name and the `created` status.

. Optional: Save the `<policy_name>.yaml` file so that you can make changes later.
