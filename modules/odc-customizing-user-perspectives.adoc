= Customizing user perspectives 

The {product-title} web console provides two perspectives by default, *Administrator* and *Developer*. You might have more perspectives available depending on installed console plugins. As a cluster administrator, you can show or hide a perspective for all users or for a specific user role. Customizing  perspectives ensures that users can view only the perspectives that are applicable to their role and tasks. For example, you can hide the *Administrator* perspective from unprivileged users so that they cannot manage cluster resources, users, and projects. Similarly, you can show the *Developer* perspective to users with the developer role so that they can create, deploy, and monitor applications. 

You can also customize the perspective visibility for users based on role-based access control (RBAC). For example, if you customize a perspective for monitoring purposes, which requires specific permissions, you can define that the perspective is visible only to users with required permissions. 

Each perspective includes the following mandatory parameters, which you can edit in the YAML view:

* `id`: Defines the ID of the perspective to show or hide
* `visibility`: Defines the state of the perspective along with access review checks, if needed 
* `state`: Defines whether the perspective is enabled, disabled, or needs an access review check

[NOTE]
====
By default, all perspectives are enabled. When you customize the user perspective, your changes are applicable to the entire cluster.
