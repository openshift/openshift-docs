//TODO Fixme
* See xref:install-prerequisites_{context}[].
* You have access to the {ocp} web console.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp} web console, log in with `cluster-admin` privileges.

. In the left navigation menu, click *Operators > OperatorHub*.

. In the *Filter by keyword* text box, enter `Connectivity` to find the *{product-title}* Operator.

. Read the information about the Operator, and click *Install* to display the Operator subscription page.

. Select your subscription settings as follows:

** *Update Channel*: *stable*
** *Version*: *{operator-version}*
** *Installation mode*: *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*.
** *Installed namespace*: Select the namespace where you want to install the Operator, for example, *kuadrant-system*. If the namespace does not already exist, click this field and select *Create Project* to create the namespace.
** *Approval Strategy*: Select *Automatic* or *Manual*.

. Click *Install*, and wait a few moments until the Operator is installed and ready for use.

. Click *Operators > Installed Operators* > *{product-title}*.

. Click the *Kuadrant* tab, and click *Create Kuadrant* to create a deployment.

. In the *Configure via* field, click *YAML view* to edit the definition, for example, the deployment name.

. Click *Create* and wait for the deployment to be displayed in the list.

.Verification

After you have installed the Operator, click *Operators > Installed Operators* to verify that the *{product-title}* Operator and the following component Operators are installed in your namespace:

* *Red Hat - Authorino Operator*: Enables authentication and authorization for gateways and applications in a Gateway API network.
* *Red Hat - DNS Operator*: Configures how north-south traffic from outside the network is balanced and reaches gateways.
* *Red Hat - Limitador Operator*: Enables rate limiting for gateways and applications in a Gateway API network.

//WARNING: {prodname} uses a number of labels to search and filter resources on the cluster. All required labels are formatted as `kuadrant.io/*`. Removal of any labels with this prefix may cause unexpected behavior and degradation of {prodname}.
