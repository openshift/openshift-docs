= Revoking user access to a cluster

You can revoke cluster access from an identity provider user by removing them from your configured identity provider.

You can configure different types of identity providers for your {product-title} cluster. The following example procedure revokes cluster access for a member of a GitHub organization or team that is configured for identity provision to the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have an {product-title} cluster.
* You have a GitHub user account.
* You have configured a GitHub identity provider for your cluster and added an identity provider user.

.Procedure

. Navigate to link:https://github.com[github.com] and log in to your GitHub account.

. Remove the user from your GitHub organization or team:
* If your identity provider configuration uses a GitHub organization, follow the steps in link:https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/removing-a-member-from-your-organization[Removing a member from your organization] in the GitHub documentation.
* If your identity provider configuration uses a team within a GitHub organization, follow the steps in link:https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/removing-organization-members-from-a-team[Removing organization members from a team] in the GitHub documentation.

.Verification

* After removing the user from your identity provider, the user cannot authenticate into the cluster.
