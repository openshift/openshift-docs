= Using tolerations to control the log visualizer pod placement

You can use a specific key/value pair that is not on other pods to ensure that only the Kibana pod can run on the specified node.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {clo}, the {es-op}, and the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Add a taint to a node where you want to schedule the log visualizer pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node_name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
----
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 kibana=node:NoExecute
----
+
This example places a taint on `node1` that has key `kibana`, value `node`, and taint effect `NoExecute`. You must use the `NoExecute` taint effect. `NoExecute` schedules only pods that match the taint and remove existing pods that do not match.

. Edit the `visualization` section of the `ClusterLogging` CR to configure a toleration for the Kibana pod:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogging
metadata:
# ...
spec:
# ...
  visualization:
    type: kibana
    kibana:
      tolerations:
      - key: kibana  <1>
        operator: Exists <2>
        effect: NoExecute <3>
        tolerationSeconds: 6000 <4>
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 2Gi
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 1Gi
      replicas: 1
# ...
----
<1> Specify the key that you added to the node.
<2> Specify the `Exists` operator to require the `key`, value, and `effect` parameters to match.
<3> Specify the `NoExecute` effect.
<4> Optionally, specify the `tolerationSeconds` parameter to set how long a pod can remain bound to a node before being evicted.

This toleration matches the taint created by the `oc adm taint` command. A pod with this toleration would be able to schedule onto `node1`.
