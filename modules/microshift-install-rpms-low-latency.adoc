= Installing the {microshift-short} low latency RPM package

When you install {microshift-short}, the low latency RPM package is not installed by default. You can install the low latency RPM as an optional package.

.Prerequisites

. You installed the {microshift-short} RPM.
. You configured workload partitioning for {microshift-short}.

.Procedure

* Install the low latency RPM package by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y microshift-low-latency
----
+
[TIP]
====
Wait to restart the host until after activating your TuneD profile. Restarting the host restarts {microshift-short} and CRI-O, which applies the low latency manifests and activates the TuneD profile.
====

.Next steps
. Configure the kubelet parameter for low latency in the {microshift-short} `config.yaml`.
. Tune your operating system, for example, configure and activate a TuneD profile.
. Optional: Configure automatic activation of your TuneD profile.
. Optional: If you are using the x86_64 architecture, install {op-system-rt-kernel}.
. Prepare your workloads for low latency.
