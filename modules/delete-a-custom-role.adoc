= Deleting a custom role

[role="_abstract"]
From the *Access Control* view, you can delete the custom roles that you have created.

.Prerequisites
* You must have the *Admin* role, or read and write permissions for the `AuthProvider` and `Role` resources to create, modify, and delete custom roles.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access control*.
. Click on the *Roles and Permissions* tab.
. From the *StackRox Roles* panel, hover over the name of the role you want to delete and click the *Delete* icon.

[NOTE]
====
* You cannot modify `read` and `write` permissions for the default system roles.
* When you delete a custom role that has users assigned to it, all associated users transfer to the configured minimum access role.
