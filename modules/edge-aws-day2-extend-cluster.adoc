= Extend existing clusters to use AWS Local Zones

As a post-installation task, you can extend an existing {product-title} cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
to use AWS Local Zones.

Extending nodes to Local Zone locations comprises the following steps:

- Adjust the cluster-network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).
- Opt-in the Local Zone group.
- Create a subnet in the existing VPC for a Local Zone location.
- Create the machine set manifest and then create a node in each Local Zone location.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you extend an existing {product-title} cluster on AWS to
use Local Zones, check that the existing VPC contains available
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks to create the subnets.
