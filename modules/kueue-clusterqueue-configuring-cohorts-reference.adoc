= Configuring cohorts within a cluster queue spec

You can add a cluster queue to a cohort by specifying the name of the cohort in the `.spec.cohort` field of the `ClusterQueue` object, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterQueue
metadata:
  name: cluster-queue
spec:
# ...
  cohort: example-cohort
# ...
----

All cluster queues that have a matching `spec.cohort` are part of the same cohort.

If the `spec.cohort` field is omitted, the cluster queue does not belong to any cohort and cannot access borrowable resources.
