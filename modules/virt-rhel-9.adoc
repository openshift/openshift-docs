[id="virt-rhel-9_{context}"]
= {op-system-base} 9 compatibility

[role="_abstract"]
{VirtProductName} {VirtVersion} is based on {op-system-base-full} 9.

[id="rhel-9-machine-type_{context}"]
== {op-system-base} 9 machine type

All VM templates that are included with {VirtProductName} now use the {op-system-base} 9 machine type by default: `machineType: pc-q35-rhel9.<y>.0`, where `<y>` is a single digit corresponding to the latest minor version of {op-system-base} 9. For example, the value `pc-q35-rhel9.2.0` is used for {op-system-base} 9.2.

Updating {VirtProductName} does not change the `machineType` value of any existing VMs. These VMs continue to function as they did before the update. You can optionally change a VM's machine type so that it can benefit from {op-system-base} 9 improvements.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you change a VM's `machineType` value, you must shut down the VM.
