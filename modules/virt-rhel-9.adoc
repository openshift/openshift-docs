= {VirtProductName} on {op-system-base} 9

{VirtProductName} {VirtVersion} is based on {op-system-base-full} 9. You can update to {VirtProductName} {VirtVersion} from a version that was based on {op-system-base} 8 by following the standard {VirtProductName} update procedure. No additional steps are required.

As in previous versions, you can perform the update without disrupting running workloads. {VirtProductName} {VirtVersion} supports live migration from {op-system-base} 8 nodes to {op-system-base} 9 nodes.

[id="new-rhel-9-machine-type_{context}"]
== New {op-system-base} 9 machine type

This update also introduces a new {op-system-base} 9 machine type for VMs: `machineType: pc-q35-rhel9.2.0`. All VM templates that are included with {VirtProductName} now use this machine type by default.

Updating {VirtProductName} does not change the `machineType` value of any existing VMs. These VMs continue to function as they did before the update.

While it is not required, you might want to change a VM's machine type to `pc-q35-rhel9.2.0` so that it can benefit from {op-system-base} 9 improvements.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you change a VM's `machineType` value, you must shut down the VM.
