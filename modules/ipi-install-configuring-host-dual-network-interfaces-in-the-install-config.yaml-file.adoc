= Optional: Configuring host network interfaces for dual port NIC

:FeatureName: Support for Day 1 operations associated with enabling NIC partitioning for SR-IOV devices
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

Before installation, you can set the `networkConfig` configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml` file to configure host network interfaces using NMState to support dual port NIC.

.Prequisites

* Configure a `PTR` DNS record with a valid hostname for each node with a static IP address.
* Install the NMState CLI (`nmstate`).

[NOTE]
====
Errors in the YAML syntax might result in a failure to apply the network configuration. Additionally, maintaining the validated YAML syntax is useful when applying changes using Kubernetes NMState after deployment or when expanding the cluster.
====

.Procedure

. Add the NMState configuration to the `networkConfig` field to hosts within the `install-config.yaml` file:

----
<1> The `networkConfig` field contains information about the network configuration of the host, with subfields including `interfaces`, `dns-resolver`, and `routes`.
<2> The `interfaces` field is an array of network interfaces defined for the host.
<3> The name of the interface.
<4> The type of interface. This example creates a ethernet interface.
<5> Set this to `false to disable DHCP for the physical function (PF) if it is not strictly required.
<6> Set to the number of SR-IOV virtual functions (VFs) to instantiate.
<7> Set this to `up`.
<8> Set this to `false` to disable IPv4 addressing for the VF attached to the bond.
<9> Sets a minimum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF. This sample value sets a rate of 100 Mbps.
    * This value must be less than or equal to the maximum transmission rate.
    * Intel NICs do not support the `min-tx-rate` parameter. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1772847[*BZ#1772847*].
<10> Sets a maximum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF. This sample value sets a rate of 200 Mbps.
<11> Sets the desired bond mode.
<12> Sets the preferred port of the bonding interface. The primary device is the first of the bonding interfaces to be used and is not abandoned unless it fails. This setting is particularly useful when one NIC in the bonding interface is faster and, therefore, able to handle a bigger load. This setting is only valid when the bonding interface is in active-backup mode (mode 1) and balance-tlb (mode 5).
<13> Sets a static IP address for the bond interface. This is the node IP address.
<14> Sets `bond0` as the gateway for the default route.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After deploying the cluster, you cannot modify the `networkConfig` configuration setting of `install-config.yaml` file to make changes to the host network interface. Use the Kubernetes NMState Operator to make changes to the host network interface after deployment.
