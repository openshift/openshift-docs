= Upgrading Performance Addon Operator

You can manually upgrade to the next minor version of Performance Addon Operator and monitor the status of an update
by using the web console.

== About upgrading Performance Addon Operator

=== How Performance Addon Operator upgrades work

* You can upgrade to the next minor version of Performance Addon Operator by using the OpenShift web
console to change the channel of your Operator subscription.

* You can enable automatic z-stream updates during Performance Addon Operator installation.

* Updates are delivered via the Marketplace Operator, which is deployed during {product-title} installation.
The Marketplace Operator makes external Operators available to your cluster.

* The amount of time an update takes to complete depends on your network connection.
Most automatic updates complete within fifteen minutes.

=== How Performance Addon Operator upgrades affect your cluster

* Neither the low latency tuning nor huge pages are affected.

* Updating the Operator should not cause any unexpected reboots.
