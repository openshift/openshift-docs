= Configuring routes using the route-override plugin on an additional network

The following object describes the configuration parameters for the `route-override` CNI plugin:

.Route override CNI plugin JSON configuration object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`type`
|`string`
|The name of the CNI plugin to configure: `route-override`.

|`flushroutes`
|`boolean`
|Optional: Set to `true` to flush any existing routes.

|`flushgateway`
|`boolean`
|Optional: Set to `true` to flush the default route namely the gateway route.

|`delroutes`
|`object`
|Optional: Specify the list of routes to delete from the container namespace.

|`addroutes`
|`object`
|Optional: Specify the list of routes to add to the container namespace. Each route is a dictionary with `dst` and optional `gw` fields. If `gw` is omitted, the plugin uses the default gateway value.

|`skipcheck`
|`boolean`
|Optional: Set this to `true` to skip the check command. By default, CNI plugins verify the network setup during the container lifecycle. When modifying routes dynamically with `route-override`, skipping this check ensures the final configuration reflects the updated routes.

== Route-override plugin configuration example

The `route-override` CNI is a type of CNI that it is designed to be used when chained with a parent CNI. It does not operate independently, but relies on the parent CNI to first create the network interface and assign IP addresses before it can modify the routing rules.

The following example configures an additional network named `mymacvlan`. The parent CNI creates a network interface attached to `eth1` and assigns an IP address in the `192.168.1.0/24` range using `host-local` IPAM. The `route-override` CNI is then chained to the parent CNI and modifies the routing rules by flushing existing routes, deleting the route to `192.168.0.0/24`, and adding a new route for `192.168.0.0/24` with a custom gateway.
