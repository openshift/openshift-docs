= Installing the Cluster Application Migration Operator on an {product-title} 3 source cluster

You can install the Cluster Application Migration Operator manually on an {product-title} 3.7 (or later) source cluster, which does not support OLM.

The Cluster Application Migration Operator installs Restic and Velero.

.Prerequisites

* You must have `podman` installed.
* Your {product-title} 3 cluster must be configured to pull images from `registry.redhat.io`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `registry.redhat.io` registry does not allow unauthenticated access. You must have `registry.redhat.io` configured with credentials in order to authenticate. See this link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3772061[Red Hat Solution] for instructions to configure this registry for {product-title} 3.7, 3.9, or 3.10 clusters. Be sure to distribute the credentials to all nodes in your cluster.
====

[NOTE]
====
If your system is configured for rootless Podman containers, `sudo` is not required for this procedure.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the Red Hat Container Registry with your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials:
+
----
$ sudo podman login registry.redhat.io
----

. Download the `operator.yml` file:
+
----
$ sudo podman cp $(sudo podman create registry.redhat.io/rhcam-1-1/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator:v1.1):/operator.yml ./
----

. Download the `controller-3.yml` file:
+
----
$ sudo podman cp $(sudo podman create registry.redhat.io/rhcam-1-1/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator:v1.1 ):/controller-3.yml ./
----

. Create the Cluster Application Migration Operator CR object:
+
----
$ oc create -f operator.yml
namespace/openshift-migration created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:deployers created
serviceaccount/migration-operator created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/migrationcontrollers.migration.openshift.io created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/migration-operator created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/migration-operator created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/migration-operator created
deployment.apps/migration-operator created
Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "./operator.yml": rolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "system:image-builders" already exists <1>
Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "./operator.yml": rolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "system:image-pullers" already exists <1>
----
<1> You can ignore the `Error from server (AlreadyExists)` messages. They are caused by the Cluster Application Migration Operator creating resources for earlier versions of {product-title} 3 that are provided in later releases.

. Create the Migration controller CR object:
+
----
$ oc create -f controller-3.yml
----

. Verify that the Velero and Restic Pods are running:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-migration
----
