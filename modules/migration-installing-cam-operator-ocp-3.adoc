= Installing the Cluster Application Migration Operator on an {product-title} 3 source cluster

You can install the Cluster Application Migration Operator manually on an {product-title} 3 source cluster because {product-title} 3 does not support the Operator Lifecycle Manager.

.Prerequisites

* You must have `podman` installed.
* Your {product-title} 3 cluster must be configured to pull images from registry.redhat.io.
+
To pull images, you must link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3772061[create an `imagestreamsecret`] and copy it to each node in your cluster.

.Procedure

. Log in to registry.redhat.io with your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials:
+
----
$ sudo podman login registry.redhat.io
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If your system is configured for rootless Podman containers, `sudo` is not required for this procedure.
====

. Download the `operator.yml` file:
+
----
$ sudo podman cp $(sudo podman create registry.redhat.io/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator:v1.2):/operator.yml ./
----

. Download the `controller-3.yml` file:
+
----
$ sudo podman cp $(sudo podman create registry.redhat.io/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator:v1.2):/controller-3.yml ./
----

. Log in to your {product-title} 3 cluster.
. Verify that the cluster can authenticate with registry.redhat.io:
+
----
$ oc run test --image registry.redhat.io/ubi8 --command sleep infinity
----

. Create the Cluster Application Migration Operator CR object:
+
----
$ oc create -f operator.yml
namespace/openshift-migration created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:deployers created
serviceaccount/migration-operator created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/migrationcontrollers.migration.openshift.io created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/migration-operator created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/migration-operator created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/migration-operator created
deployment.apps/migration-operator created
Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "./operator.yml":
rolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "system:image-builders" already exists <1>
Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "./operator.yml":
rolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "system:image-pullers" already exists <1>
----
<1> You can ignore the `Error from server (AlreadyExists)` messages. They are caused by the Cluster Application Migration Operator creating resources for earlier versions of {product-title} 3 that are provided in later releases.

. Create the Migration controller CR object:
+
----
$ oc create -f controller-3.yml
----

. Verify that the Velero and Restic Pods are running:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-migration
----
