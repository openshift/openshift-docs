ifdef::migrating-3-4[]
= Installing the Cluster Application Migration Operator on an {product-title} 3 source cluster

You can install the Cluster Application Migration Operator manually on an {product-title} 3 source cluster.
endif::[]
ifdef::disconnected-3-4[]
= Installing the Cluster Application Migration Operator on an {product-title} 3 source cluster in a restricted environment

You can create a manifest file based on the Cluster Application Migration Operator image and edit the manifest to point to your local image registry. Then, you can use the local image to create the Cluster Application Migration Operator on an {product-title} 3 source cluster.
endif::[]

.Prerequisites

* Access to `registry.redhat.io`
ifdef::migrating-3-4[]
* {product-title} 3 cluster configured to pull images from `registry.redhat.io`
+
To pull images, you must link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3772061[create an `imagestreamsecret`] and copy it to each node in your cluster.
endif::[]
ifdef::disconnected-3-4[]
* Linux workstation with unrestricted network access
* Mirror registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]
* Custom Operator catalog pushed to a mirror registry
endif::[]

.Procedure

ifdef::migrating-3-4[]
. Log in to `registry.redhat.io` with your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials:
endif::[]
ifdef::disconnected-3-4[]
. On the workstation with unrestricted network access, log in to `registry.redhat.io` with your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials:
endif::[]
+
----
$ sudo podman login registry.redhat.io
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If your system is configured for rootless Podman containers, `sudo` is not required for this procedure.
====

. Download the `operator.yml` file:
+
----
$ sudo podman cp $(sudo podman create registry.redhat.io/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator:v1.2):/operator.yml ./
----

. Download the `controller-3.yml` file:
+
----
$ sudo podman cp $(sudo podman create registry.redhat.io/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator:v1.2):/controller-3.yml ./
----

ifdef::disconnected-3-4[]
. Obtain the Operator image value from the `mapping.txt` file that was created when you ran the `oc adm catalog mirror` on the {product-title} 4 cluster:
+
----
$ grep openshift-migration-rhel7-operator ./mapping.txt | grep rhcam-1-2
----
+
The output shows the mapping between the `registry.redhat.io` image and your mirror registry image:
+
----
registry.redhat.io/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator@sha256:468a6126f73b1ee12085ca53a312d1f96ef5a2ca03442bcb63724af5e2614e8a=<registry.apps.example.com>/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator
----

. Update the `image` and `REGISTRY` values in the `operator.yml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
containers:
  - name: ansible
    image: <registry.apps.example.com>/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator@sha256:<468a6126f73b1ee12085ca53a312d1f96ef5a2ca03442bcb63724af5e2614e8a> <1>
...
  - name: operator
    image: <registry.apps.example.com>/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator@sha256:<468a6126f73b1ee12085ca53a312d1f96ef5a2ca03442bcb63724af5e2614e8a> <1>
...
    env:
    - name: REGISTRY
      value: <registry.apps.example.com> <2>
----
<1> Specify your mirror registry and the `sha256` value of the Operator image in the `mapping.txt` file.
<2> Specify your mirror registry.
endif::[]

. Log in to your {product-title} 3 cluster.

ifdef::migrating-3-4[]
. Verify that the cluster can authenticate with `registry.redhat.io`:
+
----
$ oc run test --image registry.redhat.io/ubi8 --command sleep infinity
----
endif::[]

. Create the Cluster Application Migration Operator CR object:
+
----
$ oc create -f operator.yml
----
+
The output resembles the following:
+
----
namespace/openshift-migration created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:deployers created
serviceaccount/migration-operator created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/migrationcontrollers.migration.openshift.io created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/migration-operator created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/migration-operator created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/migration-operator created
deployment.apps/migration-operator created
Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "./operator.yml":
rolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "system:image-builders" already exists <1>
Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "./operator.yml":
rolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "system:image-pullers" already exists
----
<1> You can ignore `Error from server (AlreadyExists)` messages. They are caused by the Cluster Application Migration Operator creating resources for earlier versions of {product-title} 3 that are provided in later releases.

. Create the Migration controller CR object:
+
----
$ oc create -f controller-3.yml
----

. Verify that the Velero and Restic Pods are running:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-migration
----
