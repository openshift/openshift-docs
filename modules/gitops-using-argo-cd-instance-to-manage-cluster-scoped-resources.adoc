= Using an Argo CD instance to manage cluster-scoped resources

[role="_abstract"]
[WARNING]
====
Do not elevate the permissions of Argo CD instances to be cluster-scoped unless you have a distinct use case that requires it. Only users with `cluster-admin` privileges should manage the instances you elevate. Anyone with access to the namespace of a cluster-scoped instance can elevate their privileges on the cluster to become a cluster administrator themselves.
====

To manage cluster-scoped resources, update the existing `Subscription` object for the {gitops-title} Operator and add the namespace of the Argo CD instance to the `ARGOCD_CLUSTER_CONFIG_NAMESPACES` environment variable in the `spec` section.

.Procedure
. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators* → *Installed Operators* → *{gitops-title}* → *Subscription*. 
. Click the *Actions* list and then click *Edit Subscription*.
. On the *openshift-gitops-operator* Subscription details page, under the *YAML* tab, edit the `Subscription` YAML file by adding the namespace of the Argo CD instance to the `ARGOCD_CLUSTER_CONFIG_NAMESPACES` environment variable in the `spec` section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: openshift-gitops-operator
  namespace: openshift-gitops-operator
# ...
spec:
  config:
    env:
    - name: ARGOCD_CLUSTER_CONFIG_NAMESPACES
      value: openshift-gitops, <list of namespaces of cluster-scoped Argo CD instances>
# ...
----

. Click *Save* and *Reload*.

. To verify that the Argo CD instance is configured with a cluster role to manage cluster-scoped resources, perform the following steps:
+
.. Navigate to *User Management* → *Roles* and from the *Filter*  list select *Cluster-wide Roles*.
.. Search for the `argocd-application-controller` by using the *Search by name* field.
+
The *Roles* page displays the created cluster role.
+
[TIP]
====
Alternatively, in the OpenShift CLI, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
oc auth can-i create oauth -n openshift-gitops --as system:serviceaccount:openshift-gitops:openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller
----

The output `yes` verifies that the Argo instance is configured with a cluster role to manage cluster-scoped resources. Else, check your configurations and take necessary steps as required.
