= Persistent volumes with RWO access mode permissions

Persistent volume claims (PVCs) can be created with different access modes. A PVC with the `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO) access mode set allows multiple pods on the same node to read or write into the same PV at once.

There are instances when the pods of the same node are not able to read or write into the same PV. This happens when the pods in the node do not have the same SELinux context. Persistent volumes can be mounted, then later claimed by PVCs, with the RWO access mode.
