= Configuring node restart behaviors upon machine config changes

You can create a node disruption policy to define the machine configuration changes that cause a disruption to your cluster, and which changes do not.

You can control how your nodes respond to changes in the files in the `/var` or `/etc` directory, the systemd units, the SSH keys, and the `registries.conf` file.

.Prerequisites

* You have enabled the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set by using the feature gates. For more information, see "Enabling features using feature gates".
+
[WARNING]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on your cluster prevents minor version updates. The `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set cannot be disabled. Do not enable this feature set on production clusters.
====

.Procedure

. Edit the `machineconfigurations.operator.openshift.io` object to define the node disruption policy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit MachineConfiguration cluster -n openshift-machine-config-operator
----

. Add a node disruption policy similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfiguration
metadata:
  name: cluster
# ...
spec:
  nodeDisruptionPolicy: <1>
    files: # <2>
    - actions: # <3>
      - reload: # <4>
          serviceName: chronyd.service # <5>
        type: Reload
      path: /etc/chrony.conf # <6>
    sshkey: # <7>
      actions:
      - type: Drain
      - reload:
          serviceName: crio.service
        type: Reload
      - type: DaemonReload
      - restart:
          serviceName: crio.service
        type: Restart
    units: # <8>
    - actions:
      - type: Drain
      - reload:
          serviceName: crio.service
        type: Reload
      - type: DaemonReload
      - restart:
          serviceName: crio.service
        type: Restart
      name: test.service
----
<1> Specifies the node disruption policy. 
<2> Specifies a list of machine config file definitions and actions to take to changes on those paths. This list supports a maximum of 50 entries.
<3> Specifies the series of actions to be executed upon changes to the specified files. Actions are applied in the order that they are set in this list. This list supports a maximum of 10 entries.
<4> Specifies that the listed service is to be reloaded upon changes to the specified files. 
<5> Specifies the full name of the service to be acted upon. 
<6> Specifies the location of a file that is managed by a machine config. The actions in the policy apply when changes are made to the file in `path`.
<7> Specifies a list of service names and actions to take upon changes to the SSH keys in the cluster.
<8> Specifies a list of systemd unit names and actions to take upon changes to those units.

.Verification

* View the `MachineConfiguration` object file that you created:
+
----
$ oc get MachineConfiguration/cluster -o yaml
