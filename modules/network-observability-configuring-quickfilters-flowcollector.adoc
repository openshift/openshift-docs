= Configuring quick filters

You can modify the filters in the `FlowCollector` resource. Exact matches are possible using double-quotes around values. Otherwise, partial matches are used for textual values. The bang (!) character, placed at the end of a key, means negation. See the sample `FlowCollector` resource for more context about modifying the YAML.

[NOTE]
====
The filter matching types "all of" or "any of" is a UI setting that the users can modify from the query options. It is not part of this resource configuration.

Here is a list of all available filter keys:

|Universal*
|Source

|Description

|namespace
|`src_namespace`
|`dst_namespace`
|Filter traffic related to a specific namespace.

|name
|`src_name`
|`dst_name`
|Filter traffic related to a given leaf resource name, such as a specific pod, service, or node (for host-network traffic).

|kind
|`src_kind`
|`dst_kind`
|Filter traffic related to a given resource kind. The resource kinds include the leaf resource (Pod, Service or Node), or the owner resource (Deployment and StatefulSet).

|owner_name
|`src_owner_name`
|`dst_owner_name`
|Filter traffic related to a given resource owner; that is, a workload or a set of pods. For example, it can be a Deployment name, a StatefulSet name, etc.

|resource
|`src_resource`
|`dst_resource`
|Filter traffic related to a specific resource that is denoted by its canonical name, that identifies it uniquely. The canonical notation is `kind.namespace.name` for namespaced kinds, or `node.name` for nodes. For example, `Deployment.my-namespace.my-web-server`.

|address
|`src_address`
|`dst_address`
|Filter traffic related to an IP address. IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. CIDR ranges are also supported.

|mac
|`src_mac`
|`dst_mac`
|Filter traffic related to a MAC address.

|port
|`src_port`
|`dst_port`
|Filter traffic related to a specific port.

|host_address
|`src_host_address`
|`dst_host_address`
|Filter traffic related to the host IP address where the pods are running.

|protocol
|N/A
|N/A
|Filter traffic related to a protocol, such as TCP or UDP.

|===
* Universal keys filter for any of source or destination. For example, filtering `name: 'my-pod'` means all traffic from `my-pod` and all traffic to `my-pod`, regardless of the matching type used, whether *Match all* or *Match any*.
