= Routes

Routes are specific to {product-title} resources that expose a service at a host name so that external clients can reach the service by name. 

Routes map a host name to a service. Route name mapping allows external clients to access the service using the host name. 
Routes provide load balancing for the traffic directed to the service. The host name used in a route is resolved to the IP address of the router. Routes then forward the traffic to the appropriate service. Routes can also be secured using SSL/TLS to encrypt traffic between the client and the service.
