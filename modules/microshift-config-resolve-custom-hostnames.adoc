= Configuring custom hostnames

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the `hosts` file to resolve custom hostnames for pod workloads. This enables applications to resolve fixed hostnames, such as the local machine or external services, by applying `/etc/hosts` functionality to DNS queries within the node. The functionality is applied by adding specific configuration to the {microshift-short} configuration YAML file, and completing a service restart.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have root access to the node.

.Procedure
. Edit the {microshift-short} configuration in the `/etc/microshift/config.yaml` file.
. Add the following `hosts` configuration at the end of the file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
dns:
 hosts:
   status: <Enabled|Disabled>
   file: <filepath>
----

. Save your configuration YAML file.
. Restart the {microshift-short} service to activate the configuration changes:
+ 
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart microshift
----
+
After this initial restart, if `dns.hosts.status` is set to `Enabled`, {microshift-short} automatically monitors the `dns.hosts.file` file for updates. You do not have to restart the {microshift-short} service until the {microshift-short} configuration YAML file is changed again.
+
[NOTE]
====
After you save the `/etc/hosts` file, it takes up to 90 seconds for the change to be active in the pods. During this period, the pods might not properly resolve hostnames.
