= SNO node reboot scenario

On a {sno-caps} cluster and in {product-title} clusters generally a situation might arise in case a node reboot occurs without node drain where an application pod requesting devices fails with the `UnexpectedAdmissionError` error. deployment, replicaset, or daemonset  error is reported due to the fact that application pods requiring devices can start before the pod serving those devices, as there is no way to control the order of pod restarts.

While this behavior is expected, it can lead to a pod remaining on the cluster even when it has failed to deploy successfully and will continue to report `UnexpectedAdmissionError`. The presence of this issue is mitigated since application pods are typically included in a deployment, replicaset, or daemonset. Having a pod in this state is of little concern as another instance should be running. Being part of a deployment, replicaset, or daemonset guarantees the successful creation and execution of subsequent pods and ensures the successful deployment of the application.

There is ongoing work upstream to ensure that such pods are gracefully terminated. Until that is resolved run the following command in a {sno-caps} deployment to remove the failed pods:

[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl delete pods --field-selector status.phase=Failed -n <POD_NAMESPACE>
----

[NOTE]
====
The option to drain the node is unavailable in a {sno-caps} deployment.
