= Configuring the Flow Collector resource with Kafka
You can configure the `FlowCollector` resource to use Kafka for high-throughput and low-latency data feeds. A Kafka instance needs to be running, and a Kafka topic dedicated to {product-title} Network Observability must be created in that instance. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.7/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift/using-the-topic-operator-str[Kafka documentation with AMQ Streams].

.Prerequisites
* Kafka is installed. Red Hat supports Kafka with AMQ Streams Operator.

.Procedure
. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators*.

. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for the Network Observability Operator, select *Flow Collector*.

. Select the cluster and then click the *YAML* tab.

. Modify the `FlowCollector` resource for {product-title} Network Observability Operator to use Kafka, as shown in the following sample YAML:

----
<1> Set `spec.deploymentModel` to `KAFKA` instead of `DIRECT` to enable the Kafka deployment model.
<2> `spec.kafka.address` refers to the Kafka bootstrap server address. You can specify a port if needed, for instance `kafka-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.netobserv:9093` for using TLS on port 9093.
<3> `spec.kafka.topic` should match the name of a topic created in Kafka.
<4> `spec.kafka.tls` can be used to encrypt all communications to and from Kafka with TLS or mTLS. When enabled, the Kafka CA certificate must be available as a ConfigMap or a Secret, both in the namespace where the `flowlogs-pipeline` processor component is deployed (default: `netobserv`) and where the eBPF agents are deployed (default: `netobserv-privileged`). It must be referenced with `spec.kafka.tls.caCert`. When using mTLS, client secrets must be available in these namespaces as well (they can be generated for instance using the AMQ Streams User Operator) and referenced with `spec.kafka.tls.userCert`.
