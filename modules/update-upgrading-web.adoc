= Updating a cluster by using the web console

If updates are available, you can update your cluster from the web console.

You can find information about available {product-title} advisories and updates
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[in the errata section] of the Customer Portal.

.Prerequisites

* Have access to the web console as a user with `admin` privileges.
* Pause all `MachineHealthCheck` resources. 

.Procedure

. From the web console, click *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* and review the contents of the *Details* tab.

. For production clusters, ensure that the *Channel* is set to the correct channel for
ifdef::within[]
the version that you want to update to,
endif::within[]
ifdef::between[]
your current minor version,
endif::between[]
ifndef::openshift-origin[]
such as `stable-{product-version}`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For production clusters, you must subscribe to a stable-* or fast-* channel.
====
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
such as `stable-4`.
endif::openshift-origin[]
** If the *Update status* is not *Updates available*, you cannot upgrade your cluster.
** *Select channel* indicates the cluster version that your cluster is running or is updating to.

. Select
ifdef::within[]
a version to update to,
endif::within[]
ifdef::between[]
the highest available version
endif::between[]
and click *Save*.
+
The Input channel
*Update status* changes to *Update to <product-version> in progress*, and you can review the progress of the cluster update by watching the progress bars for the Operators and nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are upgrading your cluster to the next minor version, like version 4.y to 4.(y+1), it is recommended to confirm your nodes are upgraded before deploying workloads that rely on a new feature. Any pools with worker nodes that are not yet updated are displayed on the *Cluster Settings* page.

ifdef::between[]
. After the update completes and the Cluster Version Operator refreshes the available updates, check if more updates are available in your current channel.
+
--
** If updates are available, continue to perform updates in the current channel until you can no longer update.
ifndef::openshift-origin[]
** If no updates are available, change the *Channel* to the stable-* or fast-* channel for the next minor version, and update to the version that you want in that channel.
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
** If no updates are available, change the *Channel* to the stable-* channel for the next minor version, and update to the version that you want in that channel.
endif::openshift-origin[]
--
+
You might need to perform several intermediate updates until you reach the version that you want.
ifdef::rhel[]
+
[NOTE]
====
When you update a cluster that contains Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) worker machines, those workers temporarily become unavailable during the update process. You must run the upgrade playbook against each RHEL machine as it enters the `NotReady` state for the cluster to finish updating.
