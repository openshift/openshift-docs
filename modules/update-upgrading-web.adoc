= Updating a cluster by using the web console

If updates are available, you can update your cluster from the web console.

You can find information about available {product-title} advisories and updates
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/ver=4.2/rhel---7/4.2.0/x86_64/product-errata[in the errata section]
of the Customer Portal.

.Prerequisites

* Have access to the web console as a user with `admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. From the web console, click *Administration* > *Cluster Settings* and review
the contents of the *Overview* tab.
. For production clusters, ensure that the *CHANNEL* is set to the correct channel for
ifdef::within[]
the version that you want to update to,
endif::within[]
ifdef::between[]
your current minor version,
endif::between[]
such as `stable-{product-version}`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For production clusters, you must subscribe to a stable-* or fast-* channel.
====
** If the *UPDATE STATUS* is not *Updates Available*, you cannot upgrade your
cluster.
** The *DESIRED VERSION* indicates the cluster version that your cluster is running
or is updating to.

. Click *Updates Available*, select
ifdef::within[]
a version to update to,
endif::within[]
ifdef::between[]
the highest available version
endif::between[]
and click *Update*.
The *UPDATE STATUS* changes to `Updating`, and you can review the progress of
the Operator upgrades on the *Cluster Operators* tab.

ifdef::between[]
. After the update completes and the Cluster Version Operator refreshes the available updates, check if more updates are available in your current channel.
+
--
** If updates are available, continue to perform updates in the current channel until you can no longer update.
** If no updates are available, change the *CHANNEL* to the stable-* or fast-* channel for the next minor version, and update to the version that you want in that channel.
--
+
You might need to perform several intermediate updates until you reach the version that you want.
