= Backup considerations for external databases and cloud users

You must manage your backups differently if you use an external database or if you are a cloud user.

.Back up with an external database

If you use an external database, you cannot use the automatic backup option or start a backup process from within {rh-rhacs-first}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* When you upgrade your external database, you must scale down Central before you start the backup. Central attempts to connect to the database until it is successful, which can cause issues during the upgrade process.

* For a database that you manage, you must use the backup procedures that your database vendor recommends.

.Back up for cloud users

If you are a cloud user, you cannot use the automatic backup option or start the backup process from an integration. Red{nbsp}Hat is responsible for backing up your data.
