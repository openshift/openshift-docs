[id="changes-to-cluster-logging-and-forwarding-in-logging-6_{context}"]
= Changes to cluster logging and forwarding in Logging 6

Log collection and forwarding configurations are now specified under the new link:https://github.com/openshift/cluster-logging-operator/blob/master/docs/reference/operator/api_observability_v1.adoc[API], part of the `observability.openshift.io` API group. The following sections highlight the differences from the old API resources.

[NOTE]
====
Vector is the only supported collector implementation.

[id="management-resource-allocation-workload-scheduling_{context}"]
== Management, resource allocation, and workload scheduling

Configuration for management state, resource requests and limits, tolerations, and node selection is now part of the new `ClusterLogForwarder` API.

[id="input-specification_{context}"]
== Input specifications

The input specification is an optional part of the `ClusterLogForwarder` specification. Administrators can continue to use the predefined values `application`, `infrastructure`, and `audit` to collect these sources.

Namespace and container inclusions and exclusions have been consolidated into a single field.

.5.x application input with namespace and container includes and excludes
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: ClusterLogForwarder

  inputs:
   - name: application-logs

       namespaces:
       - foo
       - bar
       includes:
       - namespace: my-important
         container: main
       excludes:
       - container: too-verbose
----

.6.x application input with namespace and container includes and excludes
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "observability.openshift.io/v1"
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
spec:
  inputs:
   - name: application-logs

       - namespace: my-important
         container: main
       excludes:
       - container: too-verbose
----

[NOTE]
====
"application", "infrastructure", and "audit" are reserved words and cannot be used as names when defining an input.
====

Changes to input receivers include:

* Explicit configuration of the type at the receiver level.
* Port settings moved to the receiver level.

[id="output-specification_{context}"]
== Output specifications

High-level changes to output specifications include:

* URL settings moved to each output type specification.
* Tuning parameters moved to each output type specification.
* Separation of TLS configuration from authentication.
* Explicit configuration of keys and secret/config map for TLS and authentication.

[id="secrets-and-tls-configuration_{context}"]
== Secrets and TLS configuration

Secrets and TLS configurations are now separated into authentication and TLS configuration for each output. They must be explicitly defined in the specification rather than relying on administrators to define secrets with recognized keys. Upgrading TLS and authorization configurations requires administrators to understand previously recognized keys to continue using existing secrets. The examples in this section illustrate how to configure `ClusterLogForwarder` secrets to forward to existing Red{nbsp}Hat managed log storage solutions.

[id="filters-and-pipeline-configuration_{context}"]
== Filters and pipeline configuration

All attributes of pipelines in previous releases have been converted to filters in this release. Individual filters are defined in the `filters` spec and referenced by a pipeline.

[source,yaml]
----
...

  pipelines:
  - name: app-logs

    openshiftLabels:
      <key>: <label>
  pipelines:
  - name: app-logs
    filterRefs:
    - my-multiline
    - my-parse
    - my-labels
...
----

[NOTE]
====
`Drop`, `Prune`, and `KubeAPIAudit` filters remain unchanged.
====

== Validation and status

Most validations are now enforced when a resource is created or updated which provides immediate feedback. This is a departure from previous releases where all validation occurred post creation requiring inspection of the resource status location. Some validation still occurs post resource creation for cases where is not possible to do so at creation or update time.

Instances of the `ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io` resource must satisfy the following conditions before the operator deploys the log collector:

* Resource status conditions: Authorized, Valid, Ready

* Spec validations: Filters, Inputs, Outputs, Pipelines

All must evaluate to the status value of `True`.
