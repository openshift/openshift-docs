== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `hybridOverlay` service was not using the trusted CA bundle when connecting to Kubernetes because the `hybridOverlay` service command was missing the `--k8s-cacert` option. As a consequence, users could have encountered trust issues or failures when the `hybridOverlay` service attempted to communicate securely with Kubernetes clusters using custom or internal CAs. With this fix, the `hybridOverlay` service command now includes the `--k8s-cacert` flag pointing to the trusted CA bundle. As a result, the `hybridOverlay` service uses the trusted CA bundle for secure communication, preventing trust issues and ensuring compatibility with the cluster.

* Previously, the WMCO neglected to close SSH connections when finishing node reconciliation. As a consequence, after adding a new Windows node to a cluster, the node SSH server would eventually refuse new connections due to being overwhelmed, causing node management issues. With this fix, the WMCO now properly closes SSH connections. As a result, the node SSH servers no longer refuse new connections due to this problem. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-60775[OCPBUGS-60775])

* Previously, if an internally used config map needed to be deleted and re-created, a nil error was dereferenced when logging the event. As a consequence, the WMCO pod panicked and restarted. With this fix, the error handling logic has been reworked. As a result, the Operator pod no longer panics. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-60792[OCPBUGS-60792])

* Previously, during secret reconciliations, secret change data was being added to the logs on each reconciliation loop. As a result, this secret change data was persisting, causing the logs to grow in size with unrelated data. With this fix, only the current secret change data is being logged, reducing the size and complexity of the logs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61832[OCPBUGS-61832])
