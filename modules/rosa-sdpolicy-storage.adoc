= Storage


This section provides information about the service definition for {product-title} storage.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-encrytpted-at-rest-storage_{context}"]
== Encrypted-at-rest OS and node storage
Control plane nodes use encrypted-at-rest AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) storage.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-encrytpted-at-rest-pv_{context}"]
== Encrypted-at-rest PV
EBS volumes that are used for PVs are encrypted-at-rest by default.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-block-storage_{context}"]
== Block storage (RWO)
Persistent volumes (PVs) are backed by AWS EBS, which is Read-Write-Once.

PVs can be attached only to a single node at a time and are specific to the availability zone in which they were provisioned. However, PVs can be attached to any node in the availability zone.

Each cloud provider has its own limits for how many PVs can be attached to a single node. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/volume_limits.html#instance-type-volume-limits[AWS instance type limits] for details.

== Shared Storage (RWX)

The AWS CSI Driver can be used to provide RWX support for {product-title}. A community Operator is provided to simplify setup.
