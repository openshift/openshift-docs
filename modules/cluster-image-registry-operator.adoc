== Purpose

ifdef::cluster-caps[]
The Cluster Image Registry Operator provides features for the `ImageRegistry` capability.
endif::[]

The Cluster Image Registry Operator manages a singleton instance of the {product-registry}. It manages all configuration of the registry, including creating storage.

On initial start up, the Operator creates a default `image-registry` resource instance based on the configuration detected in the cluster. This indicates what cloud storage type to use based on the cloud provider.

If insufficient information is available to define a complete `image-registry` resource, then an incomplete resource is defined and the Operator updates the resource status with information about what is missing.

The Cluster Image Registry Operator runs in the `openshift-image-registry` namespace and it also manages the registry instance in that location. All configuration and workload resources for the registry reside in that namespace.

ifdef::cluster-caps[]
If you disable the `ImageRegistry` capability, you can reduce the overall resource footprint of {product-title} in Telco environments. Depending on your deployment, you can disable this component if you do not need it.
