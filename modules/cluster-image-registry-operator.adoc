= Cluster Image Registry Operator

[discrete]
== Purpose

The Cluster Image Registry Operator manages a singleton instance of the
{product-title} registry. It manages all configuration of the registry,
including creating storage.

On initial start up, the Operator creates a default `image-registry` resource
instance based on the configuration detected in the cluster. This indicates
what cloud storage type to use based on the cloud provider.

If insufficient information is available to define a complete `image-registry`
resource, then an incomplete resource is defined and the Operator updates the
resource status with information about what is missing.

The Cluster Image Registry Operator runs in the `openshift-image-registry`
namespace and it also manages the registry instance in that location. All
configuration and workload resources for the registry reside in that namespace.
