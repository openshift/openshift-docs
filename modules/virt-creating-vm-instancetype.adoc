You can use common instance types to install and edit customized instance types and preferences to create a virtual machine (VM).

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to the *InstanceTypes* tab in one of the following ways:

+
* Click *Virtualization* -> *Catalog* -> *InstanceTypes*.
* Click *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines* and select *From volume* in the *Create* dropdown menu.

. Select a volume to boot from.

. Select an 'InstanceType'.

. Select the 'InstanceType' size based on the VM's available CPUs and memory.

. Optional: Edit the 'VirtualMachine' details. You can edit the SSH key during this step under *Advanced settings*.

. Optional: Uncheck *Start this VirtualMachine after creation* to prevent the VM from starting automatically. By default, this box is checked and the VM will start after creation.

. Click *Create VirtualMachine*.

After the VM is created, you can monitor the status on the *VirtualMachine details* page.
