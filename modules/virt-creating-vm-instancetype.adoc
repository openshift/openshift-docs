ifdef::virt-create-vms[]
You can create a virtual machine (VM) from an instance type by using the {product-title} web console. You can choose either a Red Hat provided instance type or an instance type that you define.
endif::[]
ifdef::static-key[]
You can add a statically managed SSH key when you create a virtual machine (VM) from an instance type by using the {product-title} web console. The key is added to the VM as a cloud-init data source at first boot. This method does not affect cloud-init user data.
endif::[]
ifdef::dynamic-key[]
You can enable dynamic SSH key injection when you create a virtual machine (VM) from an instance type by using the {product-title} web console. Then, you can add or revoke the key at runtime.

[NOTE]
====
Only {op-system-base-full} 9 supports dynamic key injection.
====

The key is added to the VM by the QEMU guest agent, which is installed with {op-system-base} 9.

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to *Virtualization* -> *Catalog* and click the *InstanceTypes* tab.
. Select a bootable volume.
+
[NOTE]
====

. Select either of the following instance type tab options:
* *Red Hat provided*: Hover over each of the tile selections and click the instance type that is most suitable for your workload.
* *User provided*: Search for the instance type by name or click an existing name from the available list.

ifdef::dynamic-key[]
. Click the *Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 VM* tile.
endif::[]
. If you have not already added a public SSH key to your project, click the edit icon beside *Authorized SSH key* in the *VirtualMachine details* section.
. Select one of the following options:

* *Use existing*: Select a secret from the secrets list.
* *Add new*:
.. Browse to the public SSH key file or paste the file in the key field.
.. Enter the secret name.
.. Optional: Select *Automatically apply this key to any new VirtualMachine you create in this project*.
.. Click *Save*.
ifdef::dynamic-key[]
. Set *Dynamic SSH key injection* in the *VirtualMachine details* section to on.
endif::[]
. Optional: Click *View YAML & CLI* to view the YAML file. Click *CLI* to view the CLI commands. You can also download or copy either the YAML file contents or the CLI commands.
. Click *Create VirtualMachine*.


After the VM is created, you can monitor the status on the *VirtualMachine details* page.
