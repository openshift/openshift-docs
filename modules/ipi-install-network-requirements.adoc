= Network requirements

Installer-provisioned installation of {product-title} involves several network requirements. First, installer-provisioned installation involves an optional non-routable `provisioning` network for provisioning the operating system on each bare metal node. Second, installer-provisioned installation involves a routable `baremetal` network.

[discrete]
== Configuring NICs

{product-title} deploys with two networks:

- `provisioning`: The `provisioning` network is an optional non-routable network used for provisioning the underlying operating system on each node that is a part of the {product-title} cluster. The network interface for the `provisioning` network on each cluster node must have the BIOS or UEFI configured to PXE boot.
+
The `provisioningNetworkInterface` configuration setting specifies the `provisioning` network NIC name on the control plane nodes, which must be identical on the control plane nodes. The `bootMACAddress` configuration setting provides a means to specify a particular NIC on each node for the `provisioning` network.
+
The `provisioning` network is optional, but it is required for PXE booting. If you deploy without a `provisioning` network, you must use a virtual media BMC addressing option such as `redfish-virtualmedia` or `idrac-virtualmedia`.

- `baremetal`: The `baremetal` network is a routable network. You can use any NIC to interface with the `baremetal` network provided the NIC is not configured to use the `provisioning` network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using a VLAN, each NIC must be on a separate VLAN corresponding to the appropriate network.
====

[discrete]
== Configuring the DNS server

Clients access the {product-title} cluster nodes over the `baremetal` network. A network administrator must configure a subdomain or subzone where the canonical name extension is the cluster name.

----
<cluster_name>.<domain>
----

For example:

----
test-cluster.example.com
----

{product-title} includes functionality that uses cluster membership information to generate A/AAAA records. This resolves the node names to their IP addresses. After the nodes are registered with the API, the cluster can disperse node information without using CoreDNS-mDNS. This eliminates the network traffic associated with multicast DNS.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create a DNS entry for the `api.<cluster_name>.<domain>` domain name on the external DNS because removing CoreDNS causes the local entry to disappear. Failure to create a DNS record for the `api.<cluster_name>.<domain>` domain name in the external DNS server precludes worker nodes from joining the cluster.
====

[discrete]
== Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) requirements

By default, installer-provisioned installation deploys `ironic-dnsmasq` with DHCP enabled for the `provisioning` network. No other DHCP servers should be running on the `provisioning` network when the `provisioningNetwork` configuration setting is set to `managed`, which is the default value. If you have a DHCP server running on the `provisioning` network, you must set the `provisioningNetwork` configuration setting to `unmanaged` in the `install-config.yaml` file.

Network administrators must reserve IP addresses for each node in the {product-title} cluster for the `baremetal` network on an external DHCP server.

[discrete]
== Reserving IP addresses for nodes with the DHCP server

For the `baremetal` network, a network administrator must reserve a number of IP addresses, including:

. Two virtual IP addresses.
+
- One IP address for the API endpoint
- One IP address for the wildcard ingress endpoint
+
. One IP address for the provisioner node.
. One IP address for each control plane (master) node.
. One IP address for each worker node, if applicable.

[IMPORTANT]
.Reserving IP addresses so they become static IP addresses
====
Some administrators prefer to use static IP addresses so that each node's IP address remains constant in the absence of a DHCP server. To use static IP addresses in the {product-title} cluster, reserve the IP addresses with an infinite lease. During deployment, the installer will reconfigure the NICs from DHCP assigned addresses to static IP addresses. NICs with DHCP leases that are not infinite will remain configured to use DHCP.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Networking between external load balancers and control plane nodes
====
External load balancing services and the control plane nodes must run on the same L2 network, and on the same VLAN when using VLANs to route traffic between the load balancing services and the control plane nodes.
====

The following table provides an exemplary embodiment of fully qualified domain names. The API and Nameserver addresses begin with canonical name extensions. The hostnames of the control plane and worker nodes are exemplary, so you can use any host naming convention you prefer.

|=====
| Usage | Host Name | IP
| API | `api.<cluster_name>.<domain>` | `<ip>`
| Ingress LB (apps) |  `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<domain>`  | `<ip>`

| Worker-n | `openshift-worker-n.<cluster_name>.<domain>` | `<ip>`

== Network Time Protocol (NTP)

Each {product-title} node in the cluster must have access to an NTP server. {product-title} nodes use NTP to synchronize their clocks. For example, cluster nodes use SSL certificates that require validation, which might fail if the date and time between the nodes are not in sync.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Define a consistent clock date and time format in each cluster node's BIOS settings, or installation might fail.
====

You may reconfigure the control plane nodes to act as NTP servers on disconnected clusters, and reconfigure worker nodes to retrieve time from the control plane nodes.

[discrete]
== State-driven network configuration requirements (Technology Preview)

{product-title} supports additional post-installation state-driven network configuration on the secondary network interfaces of cluster nodes using `kubernetes-nmstate`. For example, system administrators might configure a secondary network interface on cluster nodes after installation for a storage network.

[NOTE]
====
Configuration must occur before scheduling pods.
====

State-driven network configuration requires installing `kubernetes-nmstate`, and also requires Network Manager running on the cluster nodes. See *OpenShift Virtualization > Kubernetes NMState (Tech Preview)* for additional details.
