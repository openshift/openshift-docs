= Network requirements

Installer-provisioned installation of {product-title} involves several network requirements by default. First, installer-provisioned installation involves a non-routable `provisioning` network for provisioning the OS on each bare metal node and a routable `baremetal` network. Since installer-provisioned installation deploys `ironic-dnsmasq`, the networks should have no other DHCP servers running on the same broadcast domain. Network administrators *must* reserve IP addresses for each node in the {product-title} cluster.

.Network Time Protocol (NTP)

Each {product-title} node in the cluster must have access to an NTP server.

.Configuring NICs

{product-title} deploys with two networks:

- `provisioning`: The `provisioning` network is an *optional* non-routable network used for provisioning the underlying operating system on each node that is a part of the {product-title} cluster. When deploying using the `provisioning` network, the first NIC on each node, such as `eth0` or `eno1`,
*must* interface with the `provisioning` network.

- `baremetal`: The `baremetal` network is a routable network. When deploying using the `provisioning` network, the second NIC on each node, such as `eth1` or `eno2`, *must* interface with the `baremetal` network. When deploying without a `provisioning` network, you can use any NIC on each node to interface with the `baremetal` network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Each NIC should be on a separate VLAN corresponding to the appropriate network.
====

.Configuring the DNS server

Clients access the {product-title} cluster nodes over the `baremetal` network.
A network administrator must configure a subdomain or subzone where the canonical name extension is the cluster name.

----
<cluster-name>.<domain-name>
----

For example:

----
test-cluster.example.com
----

.Reserving IP Addresses for Nodes with the DHCP Server

For the `baremetal` network, a network administrator must reserve a number of IP addresses, including:

. Two virtual IP addresses.
+
- 1 IP address for the API endpoint
- 1 IP address for the wildcard ingress endpoint

. One IP Address for the provisioner node.
. One IP address for each Control Plane (Master) node.
. One IP address for each worker node.


The following table provides an exemplary embodiment of hostnames for each node in the {product-title} cluster.

| Usage | Hostname | IP

| Worker-1 | openshift-worker-1.<cluster-name>.<domain> | <ip>
| Worker-n | openshift-worker-n.<cluster-name>.<domain> | <ip>

.Additional requirements with no provisioning network

All installer-provisioned installations require a `baremetal` network. The `baremetal` network is a routable network used for external network access to the outside world. In addition to the IP address supplied to the {product-title} cluster node, installations without a `provisioning` network require the following:

- Setting an available IP address from the `baremetal` network to the `bootstrapProvisioningIP` configuration setting within the `install-config.yaml` configuration file.

- Setting an available IP address from the `baremetal` network to the `provisioningHostIP` configuration setting within the `install-config.yaml` configuration file.

- Deploying the {product-title} cluster using RedFish Virtual Media/iDRAC Virtual Media.

[NOTE]
====
Configuring additional IP addresses for `bootstrapProvisioningIP` and `provisioningHostIP` is not required when using a `provisioning` network.
