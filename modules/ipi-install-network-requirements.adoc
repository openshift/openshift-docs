= Network requirements

Installer-provisioned installation of {product-title} involves several network requirements. First, installer-provisioned installation involves an optional non-routable `provisioning` network for provisioning the operating system on each bare metal node. Second, installer-provisioned installation involves a routable `baremetal` network.

== Configuring NICs

{product-title} deploys with two networks:

- `provisioning`: The `provisioning` network is an optional non-routable network used for provisioning the underlying operating system on each node that is a part of the {product-title} cluster. The network interface for the `provisioning` network on each cluster node must have the BIOS or UEFI configured to PXE boot.
+
The `provisioningNetworkInterface` configuration setting specifies the `provisioning` network NIC name on the control plane nodes, which must be identical on the control plane nodes. The `bootMACAddress` configuration setting provides a means to specify a particular NIC on each node for the `provisioning` network.
+
The `provisioning` network is optional, but it is required for PXE booting. If you deploy without a `provisioning` network, you must use a virtual media BMC addressing option such as `redfish-virtualmedia` or `idrac-virtualmedia`.

- `baremetal`: The `baremetal` network is a routable network. You can use any NIC to interface with the `baremetal` network provided the NIC is not configured to use the `provisioning` network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using a VLAN, each NIC must be on a separate VLAN corresponding to the appropriate network.
====

[discrete]
== DNS requirements

Clients access the {product-title} cluster nodes over the `baremetal` network. A network administrator must configure a subdomain or subzone where the canonical name extension is the cluster name.

<cluster_name>.<base_domain>

For example:

ifeval::[{product-version}>4.7]
{product-title} includes functionality that uses cluster membership information to generate A/AAAA records. This resolves the node names to their IP addresses. After the nodes are registered with the API, the cluster can disperse node information without using CoreDNS-mDNS. This eliminates the network traffic associated with multicast DNS.

In {product-title} deployments, DNS name resolution is required for the following components:

* The Kubernetes API
* The {product-title} application wildcard ingress API

A/AAAA records are used for name resolution and PTR records are used for reverse name resolution. {op-system-first} uses the reverse records or DHCP to set the hostnames for all the nodes.

Installer-provisioned installation includes functionality that uses cluster membership information to generate A/AAAA records. This resolves the node names to their IP addresses. In each record, `<cluster_name>` is the cluster name and `<base_domain>` is the base domain that you specify in the `install-config.yaml` file. A complete DNS record takes the form: `<component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`.

.Required DNS records
[cols="1a,3a,5a",options="header"]
|===

|Component
|Record
|Description

.2+a|Kubernetes API
|`api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|An A/AAAA record, and a PTR record, identify the API load balancer. These records must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

|Routes
|`*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|The wildcard A/AAAA record refers to the application ingress load balancer. The application ingress load balancer targets the nodes that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the worker nodes by default. These records must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

For example, `console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` is used as a wildcard route to the {product-title} console.

|===

[TIP]
====
You can use the `dig` command to verify DNS resolution.

== Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) requirements

By default, installer-provisioned installation deploys `ironic-dnsmasq` with DHCP enabled for the `provisioning` network. No other DHCP servers should be running on the `provisioning` network when the `provisioningNetwork` configuration setting is set to `managed`, which is the default value. If you have a DHCP server running on the `provisioning` network, you must set the `provisioningNetwork` configuration setting to `unmanaged` in the `install-config.yaml` file.

Network administrators must reserve IP addresses for each node in the {product-title} cluster for the `baremetal` network on an external DHCP server.

[discrete]
== Reserving IP addresses for nodes with the DHCP server

For the `baremetal` network, a network administrator must reserve a number of IP addresses, including:

ifeval::[{product-version} > 4.5]
. Two unique virtual IP addresses.
endif::[]
ifeval::[{product-version} <= 4.5]
. Three unique virtual IP addresses
endif::[]
+
- One virtual IP address for the API endpoint
- One virtual IP address for the wildcard ingress endpoint
ifeval::[{product-version} <= 4.5]
- One virual IP address for the name server
endif::[]

. One IP address for the provisioner node.
. One IP address for each control plane (master) node.
. One IP address for each worker node, if applicable.

ifeval::[{product-version} > 4.6]
[IMPORTANT]
.Reserving IP addresses so they become static IP addresses
====
Some administrators prefer to use static IP addresses so that each node's IP address remains constant in the absence of a DHCP server. To use static IP addresses in the {product-title} cluster, reserve the IP addresses with an infinite lease. During deployment, the installer will reconfigure the NICs from DHCP assigned addresses to static IP addresses. NICs with DHCP leases that are not infinite will remain configured to use DHCP.
====
endif::[]

ifeval::[{product-version} > 4.7]
[IMPORTANT]
.Networking between external load balancers and control plane nodes
====
External load balancing services and the control plane nodes must run on the same L2 network, and on the same VLAN when using VLANs to route traffic between the load balancing services and the control plane nodes.
====
endif::[]

The following table provides an exemplary embodiment of fully qualified domain names. The API and Nameserver addresses begin with canonical name extensions. The hostnames of the control plane and worker nodes are exemplary, so you can use any host naming convention you prefer.

[width="100%", cols="3,5,2", options="header"]
|=====
| Usage | Host Name | IP
| API | `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` | `<ip>`
| Ingress LB (apps) |  `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`  | `<ip>`
ifeval::[{product-version} <= 4.5]

ifdef::upstream[]
For assistance in configuring the DHCP server, check xref:ipi-install-upstream-appendix[Appendix] section for:

- xref:creating-dhcp-reservations-option1_{context}[Creating DHCP reservations with dhcpd (Option 1)]
- xref:creating-dhcp-reservations-using-dnsmasq-option2_{context}[Creating DHCP reservations with dnsmasq (Option 2)]
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
If you do not create DHCP reservations, the installer requires reverse DNS resolution to set the hostnames for the Kubernetes API node, the provisioner node, the control plane nodes, and the worker nodes.
====

[discrete]
== Network Time Protocol (NTP)

Each {product-title} node in the cluster must have access to an NTP server. {product-title} nodes use NTP to synchronize their clocks. For example, cluster nodes use SSL certificates that require validation, which might fail if the date and time between the nodes are not in sync.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Define a consistent clock date and time format in each cluster node's BIOS settings, or installation might fail.
====

You can reconfigure the control plane nodes to act as NTP servers on disconnected clusters, and reconfigure worker nodes to retrieve time from the control plane nodes.

ifeval::[{product-version} == 4.6]
[discrete]
== Additional requirements with no provisioning network

All installer-provisioned installations require a `baremetal` network. The `baremetal` network is a routable network used for external network access to the outside world. In addition to the IP address supplied to the {product-title} cluster node, installations without a `provisioning` network require the following:

- Setting an available IP address from the `baremetal` network to the `bootstrapProvisioningIP` configuration setting within the `install-config.yaml` configuration file.

- Setting an available IP address from the `baremetal` network to the `provisioningHostIP` configuration setting within the `install-config.yaml` configuration file.

- Deploying the {product-title} cluster using RedFish Virtual Media/iDRAC Virtual Media.

[NOTE]
====
Configuring additional IP addresses for `bootstrapProvisioningIP` and `provisioningHostIP` is not required when using a `provisioning` network.
====
endif::[]

ifeval::[{product-version} > 4.6]
[discrete]
== State-driven network configuration requirements (Technology Preview)

{product-title} supports additional post-installation state-driven network configuration on the secondary network interfaces of cluster nodes using `kubernetes-nmstate`. For example, system administrators might configure a secondary network interface on cluster nodes after installation for a storage network.

[NOTE]
====
Configuration must occur before scheduling pods.
====

State-driven network configuration requires installing `kubernetes-nmstate`, and also requires Network Manager running on the cluster nodes. See *OpenShift Virtualization > Kubernetes NMState (Tech Preview)* for additional details.
endif::[]

[discrete]
== Port access for the out-of-band management IP address

The out-of-band management IP address is on a separate network from the node. To ensure that the out-of-band management can communicate with the `baremetal` node during installation, the out-of-band management IP address address must be granted access to the TCP 6180 port.
