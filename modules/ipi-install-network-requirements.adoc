= Network requirements

IPI installation involves several network requirements. First, IPI installation involves a non-routable `provisioning` network for provisioning the OS on each bare metal node and a routable `baremetal` network for access to the public network. Since IPI installation deploys `ironic-dnsmasq`, the networks should have no other DHCP servers running on the same broadcast domain. Network administrators *must* reserve IP addresses for each node in the {product-title} cluster.

.Network Time Protocol (NTP)

Each {product-title} node in the cluster must have access to an NTP server.

.Configuring NICs

{product-title} deploys with two networks:

- `provisioning`: The `provisioning` network is a non-routable network used for
provisioning the underlying operating system on each node that is a part of the
{product-title} cluster. The first NIC on each node, such as `eth0` or `eno1`,
*must* interface with the `provisioning` network.

- `baremetal`: The `baremetal` network is a routable network used for external
network access to the outside world. The second NIC on each node, such as `eth1`
or `eno2`, *must* interface with the `baremetal` network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Each NIC should be on a separate VLAN corresponding to the appropriate network.
====

.Configuring the DNS server

Clients access the {product-title} cluster nodes over the `baremetal` network.
A network administrator *must* configure a subdomain or subzone where the canonical name extension is the cluster name.

----
<cluster-name>.<domain-name>
----

For example:

----
test-cluster.example.com
----

.Reserving IP Addresses for Nodes with the DHCP Server

For the `baremetal` network, a network administrator must reserve a number of IP addresses, including:

. Three virtual IP addresses.
+
- 1 IP address for the API endpoint
- 1 IP address for the wildcard ingress endpoint
- 1 IP address for the name server

. One IP Address for the Provisioner node.
. One IP address for each Control Plane (Master) node.
. One IP address for each worker node.


The following table provides an exemplary embodiment of hostnames for each node in the {product-title} cluster.
