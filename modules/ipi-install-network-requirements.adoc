= Network requirements

IPI installation involves several network requirements. First, IPI installation involves a non-routable `provisioning` network for provisioning the OS on each bare metal node and a routable `baremetal` network. Since IPI installation deploys `ironic-dnsmasq`, the networks should have no other DHCP servers running on the same broadcast domain. Network administrators *must* reserve IP addresses for each node in the {product-title} cluster.

.Network Time Protocol (NTP)

Each {product-title} node in the cluster must have access to an NTP server.

.Configuring NICs

{product-title} deploys with two networks:

- `provisioning`: The `provisioning` network is a non-routable network used for
provisioning the underlying operating system on each node that is a part of the
{product-title} cluster. The first NIC on each node, such as `eth0` or `eno1`,
*must* interface with the `provisioning` network.

- `baremetal`: The `baremetal` network is a routable network. The second NIC on each node, such as `eth1` or `eno2`, *must* interface with the `baremetal` network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Each NIC should be on a separate VLAN corresponding to the appropriate network.
====

.Configuring the DNS server

Clients access the {product-title} cluster nodes over the `baremetal` network.
A network administrator *must* configure a subdomain or subzone where the canonical name extension is the cluster name.

----
<cluster-name>.<domain-name>
----

For example:

----
test-cluster.example.com
----

.Reserving IP addresses for nodes with the DHCP server

For the `baremetal` network, a network administrator must reserve a number of IP addresses, including:

. Three virtual IP addresses.
+
- One IP address for the API endpoint
- One IP address for the wildcard Ingress endpoint
- One IP address for the name server

. One IP Address for the provisioner node.
. One IP address for each Control Plane (Master) node.
. One IP address for each worker node.

The following table provides an exemplary embodiment of fully-qualified domain names. The API and Nameserver addresses begin with canonical name extensions. The hostnames of the control plane and worker nodes are exemplary, so you can use any host naming convention you prefer.
