{VirtProductName} supports the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.17/html-single/configuring_openshift_data_foundation_disaster_recovery_for_openshift_workloads/index#rdr-solution[Regional-DR solution for {rh-storage}], which provides asynchronous data replication at regular intervals between managed {VirtProductName} clusters installed on primary and secondary sites.

.Regional-DR differences
* Regional-DR supports higher network latency between the primary and secondary sites.
* Regional-DR uses RBD snapshots to replicate data asynchronously. Currently, your applications must be resilient to small variances between VM disks. You can prevent these variances by using single disk VMs.
* Using the import method when selecting a population source for your VM disk is recommended. However, you can protect VMs that use cloned PVCs if you select a `VolumeReplicationClass` that enables image flattening. For more information, see the {rh-storage} documentation.
