= Creating a virtual machine template with the interactive wizard in the web console

The web console features an interactive wizard that guides you through the *General*,
*Networking*, *Storage*, *Advanced*, and *Review* steps to simplify the process of creating virtual machine templates.
All required fields are marked with a `*`. The wizard prevents you from moving to the next step
until you provide values in the required fields.

.Procedure

. In the {CNVProductName} console, click *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machine Templates*.
. Click *Create Template* and select *New with Wizard*.
. Fill in all required fields in the *General* step.
. Click *Next* to progress to the *Networking* screen. A NIC that is named `nic0` is attached by default.
.. Optional: Click *Add Network Interface* to create additional NICs.
.. Optional: You can remove any or all NICs by clicking the Options menu {kebab} and selecting *Delete*. Virtual machines created from a template do not need a NIC attached. NICs can be created after a virtual machine has been created.
. Click *Next* to progress to the *Storage* screen.
.. Optional: Click *Add Disk* to create additional disks.
.. Optional: Click a disk to modify available fields. Click the &#10003; button to save the changes.
.. Optional: Click *Disk* to choose an available disk from the *Select Storage* list.

[NOTE]
====
If either *URL* or *Container* are selected as the *Source* in the *General* step, a `rootdisk` disk is created and attached to virtual machines as the *Bootable Disk*. You can modify the `rootdisk` but you cannot remove it.

A *Bootable Disk* is not required for virtual machines provisioned from a *PXE* source if there are no disks attached to the virtual machine. If one or more disks are attached to the virtual machine, you must select one as the *Bootable Disk*.
====

. Click *Create Virtual Machine Template >*. The *Results* screen displays the JSON configuration file for the virtual machine template.
+
The template is listed in *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machine Templates*.
