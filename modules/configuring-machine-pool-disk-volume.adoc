= Configuring machine pool disk volume

Machine pool disk volume size can be configured for additional flexibility. The default disk size is 300 GiB.

For {rosa-classic-first} clusters version 4.13 or earlier, the disk size can be configured from a minimum of 128 GiB to a maximum of 1 TiB. For version 4.14 and later, the disk size can be configured to a minimum of 128 GiB to a maximum of 16 TiB.

For {hcp-title-first} clusters, the disk size can be configured from a minimum of 75 GiB to a maximum of 16,384 GiB.

You can configure the machine pool disk size for your cluster by using {cluster-manager} or the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).

[NOTE]
====
Existing cluster and machine pool node volumes cannot be resized.
