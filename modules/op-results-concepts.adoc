{tekton-results} archives pipeline runs and task runs in the form of results and records.

For every `PipelineRun` and `TaskRun` custom resource (CR) that completes running, {tekton-results} creates a _record_.

A _result_ can contain one or several records. A record is always a part of exactly one result.

A result corresponds to a pipeline run, and includes the records for the `PipelineRun` CR itself and for all the `TaskRun` CRs that were started as a part of the pipeline run.

If a task run was started directly, without the use of a pipeline run, a result is created for this task run. This result contains the record for the same task run.

Each result has a name that includes the namespace in which the `PipelineRun` or `TaskRun` CR was created and the UUID of the CR.  The format for the result name is `<namespace_name>/results/<parent_run_uuid>`. In this format, `<parent_run_uuid>` is the UUUD of a pipeline run or else of a task run that was started directly.

----

Each record has a name that includes name of the result that contains the record, as well as the UUID of the `PipelineRun` or `TaskRun` CR to which the record corresponds.  The format for the result name is `<namespace_name>/results/<parent_run_uuid>/results/<run_uuid>`.

----

The record includes the full YAML manifest of the `TaskRun` or `PipelineRun` CR as it existed after the completion of the run. This manifest contains the specification of the run, any annotation specified for the run, as well as certain information about the results of the run, such as the time when it was completed and whether the run was successful.

While the `TaskRun` or `PipelineRun` CR exists, you can view the YAML manifest by using the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pipelinerun <cr_name> -o yaml
----

{tekton-results} preserves this manifest after the `TaskRun` or `PipelineRun` CR is deleted and makes it available for viewing and searching.

{tekton-results} also creates a log record that contains the logging information of all the tools that ran as a part of a pipeline run or task run.

You can access every result and record by its name. You can also use Common Expression Language (CEL) queries to search for results and records by the information they contain, including the YAML manifest.
