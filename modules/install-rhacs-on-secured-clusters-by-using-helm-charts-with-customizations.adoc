= Install {product-title-short} on secured clusters by using Helm charts with customizations

[role="_abstract"]
To deploy {rh-rhacs-first} with a specific resource and security settings, you must configure and install the secured cluster services Helm chart. You must create separate configuration files to manage sensitive and non-sensitive parameters for components such as Sensor, Collector, and Scanner, and run the Helm installation command to apply these customizations and secure your cluster services.

Create the following files for configuring the Helm chart for installing {product-title-short}:

Public configuration file::
`values-public.yaml`::: Use this file to save all non-sensitive configuration options.

Private configuration file::
`values-private.yaml`::: Use this file to save all sensitive configuration options. Ensure that you store this file securely.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While using the `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart, do not modify the `values.yaml` file that is part of the chart.
