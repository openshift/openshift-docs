=  Control plane node sizing

The control plane node resource requirements depend on the number of nodes in the cluster. The following control plane node size recommendations are based on the results of control plane density focused testing.

[options="header",cols="3*"]
|===
| Number of worker nodes |CPU cores |Memory (GB)

| 25
| 4
| 16

| 100
| 8
| 32

| 250
| 16
| 96

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because you cannot modify the control plane node size in a running {product-title} {product-version} cluster, you must estimate your total node count and use the suggested control plane node size during installation.
====

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} {product-version}, half of a CPU core (500 millicore) is now reserved by the system by default compared to {product-title} 3.11 and previous versions. The sizes are determined taking that into consideration.
