[id="known-issues-1-2-1_{context}"]
== Known issues

The following issues have been highlighted as known issues in the release of OADP 1.2.1:

.Backup configuration "csiSnapshotTimeout" not functioning as expected

The backup configuration setting `csiSnapshotTimeout` is not functioning as expected. When attempting to modify this parameter to a custom value, the backup process still utilizes the default timeout value instead of the specified one. This behavior persists regardless of the value assigned to `csiSnapshotTimeout`. This issue has been resolved in OADP 1.2.2.

.DataMover Restic retain and prune policies do not work as expected

The retention and prune features provided by VolSync and Restic are not working as expected. Because there is no working option to set the prune interval on VolSync replication, you have to manage and prune remotely stored backups on S3 storage outside of OADP. For more details, see:
