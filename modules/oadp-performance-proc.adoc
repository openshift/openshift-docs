= Optimizing {oadp-short} performance

This procedure guides you through the process of tuning OADP for improved performance.

*Prerequisites*

* You must have a solid understanding of your application's data and storage configuration.

* You must be logged in to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster with oc as a user with administrator privileges.

*Procedure*

. Configure Parallel Processing: By default, Velero backs up volumes sequentially. To improve performance, you can configure the {oadp-short} DataProtectionApplication (DPA) resource to use a higher number of parallel backup and restore operations. This is especially useful for applications with multiple persistent volumes.
+
* Action: Edit the DPA custom resource and set the velero.spec.backup.resource.volume.parallelism field to a value greater than 1.
+
* Adjust Resource Limits: {oadp-short} components, such as the Velero server and restic pods, consume CPU and memory. You can set resource limits to prevent OADP from overwhelming your cluster. It is a balancing act between providing enough resources for fast operations and not consuming too many resources during normal cluster operation.

. Action: Edit the DPA resource to adjust the `velero.spec.resource_requirements.requests` and `velero.spec.resource_requirements.limits` fields.
+
* Optimize Storage: The speed of your backup and restore operations is highly dependent on your backup storage location. High-latency storage or a slow network connection can create a significant bottleneck.
+
* Action: Evaluate your BackupStorageLocation to ensure it is configured with an efficient storage backend. For instance, using a storage class that supports snapshots can dramatically improve performance compared to File System Backups (FSB).
