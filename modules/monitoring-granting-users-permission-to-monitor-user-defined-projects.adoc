= Granting users permission to monitor user-defined projects

Cluster administrators can monitor all core {product-title} and user-defined projects.

Cluster administrators can grant developers and other users permission to monitor their own projects. Privileges are granted by assigning one of the following monitoring roles:

* The *monitoring-rules-view* role provides read access to PrometheusRule custom resources for a project.

* The *monitoring-rules-edit* role grants a user permission to create, modify, and deleting PrometheusRule custom resources for a project.

* The *monitoring-edit* role grants the same privileges as the `monitoring-rules-edit` role. Additionally, it enables a user to create new scrape targets for services or pods. With this role, you can also create, modify, and delete ServiceMonitors and PodMonitors.

You can also grant users permission to configure the components that are responsible for monitoring user-defined projects:

* The *user-workload-monitoring-config-edit* role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project enables you edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap. With this role, you can edit the ConfigMap to configure Prometheus, Prometheus Operator and Thanos Ruler for user-defined workload monitoring.

This section provides details on how to assign these roles by using the {product-title} web console or the CLI.
