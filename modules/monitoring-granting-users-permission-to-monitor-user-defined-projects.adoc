= Granting users permission to monitor user-defined projects

As a cluster administrator, you can monitor all core {product-title} and user-defined projects.

You can also grant developers and other users different permissions:

* To monitor user-defined projects.
* To configure the components that monitor user-defined projects.
* To configure alert routing for user-defined projects.

You can grant the permissions by assigning one of the following monitoring roles:

|===
|Role name |Description

|`monitoring-rules-view` | Users with this cluster role have read access to `PrometheusRule` custom resources for a user-defined project. They can also view the alerts in the *Developer* perspective of the {product-title} web console.

|`monitoring-rules-edit` | Users with this cluster role can create, modify, and delete `PrometheusRule` custom resources for a user-defined project. They can also create and silence alerts in the *Developer* perspective of the {product-title} web console.

|`monitoring-edit` | Users with this cluster role have the same privileges as users with the `monitoring-rules-edit` cluster role. Additionally, users can create, modify, and delete `ServiceMonitor` and `PodMonitor` resources to scrape metrics from services and pods.

|`user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` | This role is given in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project. Users with this role can edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object to configure Prometheus, Prometheus Operator, Alertmanager, and Thanos Ruler for user-defined workload monitoring.

|`alert-routing-edit` | Users with this cluster role can create, update, and delete `AlertmanagerConfig` custom resources for a user-defined project.

The following sections provide details on how to assign these roles by using the {product-title} web console or the CLI.
