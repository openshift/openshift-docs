= Granting users permission to monitor user-defined projects

Cluster administrators can monitor all core {product-title} and user-defined projects.

Cluster administrators can grant developers and other users permission to monitor their own projects. Privileges are granted by assigning one of the following monitoring roles:

* The *monitoring-rules-view* cluster role provides read access to `PrometheusRule` custom resources for a project.

* The *monitoring-rules-edit* cluster role grants a user permission to create, modify, and deleting `PrometheusRule` custom resources for a project.

* The *monitoring-edit* cluster role grants the same privileges as the `monitoring-rules-edit` cluster role. Additionally, it enables a user to create new scrape targets for services or pods. With this role, you can also create, modify, and delete `ServiceMonitor` and `PodMonitor` resources.

You can also grant users permission to configure the components that are responsible for monitoring user-defined projects:

* The *user-workload-monitoring-config-edit* role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project enables you to edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object. With this role, you can edit the `ConfigMap` object to configure Prometheus, Prometheus Operator, and Thanos Ruler for user-defined workload monitoring.

You can also grant users permission to configure alert routing for user-defined projects:

* The **alert-routing-edit** cluster role grants a user permission to create, update, and delete `AlertmanagerConfig` custom resources for a project.

This section provides details on how to assign these roles by using the {product-title} web console or the CLI.
