= Granting users permission to monitor user-defined projects

As a cluster administrator, you can monitor all core {product-title} and user-defined projects.

You can also grant developers and other users different permissions:

* Monitoring user-defined projects
* Configuring the components that monitor user-defined projects
* Configuring alert routing for user-defined projects
* Managing alerts and silences for user-defined projects

You can grant the permissions by assigning one of the following monitoring roles or cluster roles:

.Monitoring roles

|Role name |Description |Project

|`user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` 
|Users with this role can edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object to configure Prometheus, Prometheus Operator, Alertmanager, and Thanos Ruler for user-defined workload monitoring. 
|`openshift-user-workload-monitoring`

|`monitoring-alertmanager-api-reader`

|`monitoring-edit` 
|Users with this cluster role have the same privileges as users with the `monitoring-rules-edit` cluster role. Additionally, users can create, read, modify, and delete `ServiceMonitor` and `PodMonitor` resources to scrape metrics from services and pods.
|Can be bound with `RoleBinding` to any user project.
