= Build validations

To avoid triggering `BuildRun` resources that will fail because of incorrect or missing dependencies or configuration settings, the build controller validates them in advance. If all validations are successful, you view a `status.reason` field named `Succeeded`. However, if any validations fail, you must check the `status.reason` and `status.message` fields to understand the root cause.

| status.reason field | Description

| `BuildStrategyNotFound` | The referenced strategy at namespace level does not exist.

| `ClusterBuildStrategyNotFound` | The referenced strategy at cluster level does not exist.

| `SetOwnerReferenceFailed` | Setting owner references between a `Build` and a `BuildRun` resources failed. This status is triggered when you set the `spec.retention.atBuildDeletion` field to `true` in a build.

| `SpecSourceSecretRefNotFound` | The secret used to authenticate to Git does not exist.

| `SpecOutputSecretRefNotFound` | The secret used to authenticate to the container registry does not exist.

| `SpecBuilderSecretRefNotFound` | The secret used to authenticate to the container registry does not exist.

| `MultipleSecretRefNotFound` | Multiple secrets used for authentication are missing. 

| `RestrictedParametersInUse` | One or many defined `params` are colliding with any reserved parameters. 

| `UndefinedParameter` | The parameters are not defined in the referenced strategy. You must define those parameters in the `spec.parameters` specification in your strategy.

| `RemoteRepositoryUnreachable` | The defined `spec.source.git.url` specification was not found. This validation only takes place for HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

| `BuildNameInvalid` | The build name in the `metadata.name` field is invalid. You must use a valid label value for the build name.

| `SpecEnvNameCanNotBeBlank` | Indicates that the name for a user-provided environment variable is blank.

| `SpecEnvValueCanNotBeBlank` | Indicates that the value for a user-provided environment variable is blank.
