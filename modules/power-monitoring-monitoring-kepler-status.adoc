= Monitoring the {PM-kepler} status

You can monitor the state of the {PM-kepler} exporter with the `status` field of the `{PM-kepler}` resource. 

The `status.exporter` field includes information, such as the following:

* The number of nodes currently running the {PM-kepler} pods
* The number of nodes that should be running the {PM-kepler} pods
* Conditions representing the health of the {PM-kepler} resource

This provides you with valuable insights into the changes made through the `spec` field.
