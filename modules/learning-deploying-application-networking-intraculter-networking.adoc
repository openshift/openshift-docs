= Configuring intra-cluster networking

[role="_abstract"]
You can view your networking configurations in your OSToy application.

.Procedure
. In the OSToy application web console, click *Networking* in the left menu. 
. Review the networking configuration. The tile "Hostname Lookup" illustrates how the service name created for a pod translates into an internal ClusterIP address.

. Enter the name of the microservice created in the "Hostname Lookup" tile following the format: `<service_name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`. You can find the microservice name in the service definition of `ostoy-microservice.yaml` by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get service <name_of_service> -o yaml
----
+
*For example*:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ostoy-microservice-svc
  labels:
    app: ostoy-microservice
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: ostoy-microservice
----
+
In this example, the full hostname is `ostoy-microservice-svc.ostoy.svc.cluster.local`.

. An IP address is returned. In this example it is `172.30.165.246`. This is the intra-cluster IP address, which is only accessible from within the cluster.
