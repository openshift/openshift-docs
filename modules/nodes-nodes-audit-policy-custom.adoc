= Configuring the audit log policy with custom rules

You can configure an audit log policy that defines custom rules. You can specify multiple groups and define which profile to use for that group.

These custom rules take precedence over the top-level profile field. The custom rules are evaluated from top to bottom, and the first that matches is applied.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Custom rules are ignored if the top-level profile field is set to `None`.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Edit the `APIServer` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit apiserver cluster
----

. Add the `spec.audit.customRules` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: APIServer
metadata:
...
spec:
  audit:
    customRules:                        <1>
    - group: system:authenticated:oauth
      profile: WriteRequestBodies
    - group: system:authenticated
      profile: AllRequestBodies
    profile: Default                    <2>
----
<1> Add one or more groups and specify the profile to use for that group. These custom rules take precedence over the top-level profile field. The custom rules are evaluated from top to bottom, and the first that matches is applied.
<2> Set to `Default`, `WriteRequestBodies`, or `AllRequestBodies`. If you do not set this top-level profile field, it defaults to the `Default` profile.
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not set the top-level profile field to `None` if you want to use custom rules. Custom rules are ignored if the top-level profile field is set to `None`.
====

. Save the file to apply the changes.

.Verification

* Verify that a new revision of the Kubernetes API server pods is rolled out. It can take several minutes for all nodes to update to the new revision.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="NodeInstallerProgressing")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
----
+
Review the `NodeInstallerProgressing` status condition for the Kubernetes API server to verify that all nodes are at the latest revision. The output shows `AllNodesAtLatestRevision` upon successful update:
+
[source,terminal]
----
AllNodesAtLatestRevision
3 nodes are at revision 12 <1>
----
<1> In this example, the latest revision number is `12`.
+
If the output shows a message similar to one of the following messages, the update is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

** `3 nodes are at revision 11; 0 nodes have achieved new revision 12`
** `2 nodes are at revision 11; 1 nodes are at revision 12`
