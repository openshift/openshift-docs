== Bug fixes
* Before this update, alerting rules for the Fluentd collector did not adhere to the {product-title} monitoring style guidelines. This update modifies those alerts to include the namespace label, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1823[LOG-1823])

* Before this update, the index management rollover script failed to generate a new index name whenever there was more than one hyphen character in the name of the index. With this update, index names generate correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2644[LOG-2644])

* Before this update, the Kibana route was setting a `caCertificate` value without a certificate present. With this update, no `caCertificate` value is set. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2661[LOG-2661])

* Before this update, a change in the collector dependencies caused it to issue a warning message for unused parameters. With this update, removing unused configuration parameters resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2859[LOG-2859])

* Before this update, pods created for deployments that Loki Operator created were mistakenly scheduled on nodes with non-Linux operating systems, if such nodes were available in the cluster the Operator was running in. With this update, the Operator attaches an additional node-selector to the pod definitions which only allows scheduling the pods on Linux-based nodes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2895[LOG-2895])

* Before this update,  the OpenShift Console Logs view did not filter logs by severity due to a LogQL parser issue in the LokiStack gateway. With this update, a parser fix resolves the issue and the OpenShift Console Logs view can filter by severity. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2908[LOG-2908])

* Before this update, a refactoring of the Fluentd collector plugins removed the timestamp field for events. This update restores the timestamp field, sourced from the event's received time. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2923[LOG-2923])

* Before this update, absence of a `level` field in audit logs caused an error in vector logs. With this update, the addition of a `level` field in the audit log record resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2961[LOG-2961])

* Before this update, if you deleted the Kibana Custom Resource, the {product-title} web console continued displaying a link to Kibana. With this update, removing the Kibana Custom Resource also removes that link. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3053[LOG-3053])

* Before this update, each rollover job created empty indices when the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource had JSON parsing defined. With this update, new indices are not empty. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3063[LOG-3063])

* Before this update, when the user deleted the LokiStack after an update to Loki Operator 5.5 resources originally created by Loki Operator 5.4 remained. With this update, the resources' owner-references point to the 5.5 LokiStack. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2945[LOG-2945])

* Before this update, a user was not able to view the application logs of namespaces they have access to. With this update, the Loki Operator automatically creates a cluster role and cluster role binding allowing users to read application logs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2918[LOG-2918])

* Before this update, users with cluster-admin privileges were not able to properly view infrastructure and audit logs using the logging console. With this update, the authorization check has been extended to also recognize users in cluster-admin and dedicated-admin groups as admins. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2970[LOG-2970])
