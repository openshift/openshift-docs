= Tasks provided in the {pipelines-shortname} namespace

An {pipelines-shortname} installation includes a set of standard tasks that you can use in your pipelines. These tasks are located in the {pipelines-shortname} installation namespace, which is normally the `openshift-pipelines` namespace. You can use the cluster resolver to access the tasks.

Until version 1.16, {pipelines-shortname} included `ClusterTask` functionality. Versions 1.17 and later no longer include this functionality. If your pipelines use `ClusterTask` references, you can re-create them with the tasks that are available from the {pipelines-shortname} installation namespace by using the cluster resolver. However, certain changes are made in these tasks compared to the previously existing `ClusterTask` definitions.

You cannot specify a custom execution image in any of the tasks available in the {pipelines-shortname} installation namespace. These tasks do not support parameters such as `BUILDER_IMAGE`, `gitInitImage`, or `KN_IMAGE`. If you want to use a custom execution image, create a copy of the task and replace the image by editing the copy.

The `skopeo-copy` task executes the `skopeo copy` command.

Skopeo is a command-line tool for working with remote container image registries, which does not require a daemon or other infrastructure to load and run the images.
