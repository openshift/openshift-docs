= Troubleshooting catalog selection errors

If bundle resolution fails because of ambiguity or because no catalog is selected, an error message is printed in the `status.conditions` field of the cluster extension.

Perform the following actions to troubleshoot catalog selection errors:

* Refine your selection criteria using labels or expressions.
* Adjust your catalog priorities.
* Ensure that only one bundle matches your package name and version requirements.
