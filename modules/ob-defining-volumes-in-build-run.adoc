= Volumes definition for a build run

[role="_abstract"] 

You can define volumes in your `BuildRun` CR. The defined volumes override the volumes specified in the `BuildStrategy` resource. If a volume is not overridden, then the build run fails. 

In case the `Build` and `BuildRun` resources override the same volume, the volume defined in the `BuildRun` resource is used for overriding.

The following example shows a `BuildRun` CR that uses the `volumes` field:
