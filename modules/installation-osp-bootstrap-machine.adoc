[id="installation-osp-bootstrap-machine_{context}"]
= Bootstrap machine

During installation, a bootstrap machine is temporarily provisioned to stand up the
control plane. After the production control plane is ready, the bootstrap
machine is deprovisioned.

The bootstrap machine requires:

* An instance from the {rh-openstack} quota
* A port from the {rh-openstack} quota
* A flavor with at least 16 GB memory, 4 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space

[NOTE]
====
The installation program cannot pass certificate authority bundles to Ignition
on control plane machines. Therefore, the bootstrap machine cannot retrieve
Ignition configurations from Swift if your endpoint uses self-signed
certificates.
