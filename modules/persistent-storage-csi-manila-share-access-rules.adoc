= Customizing Manila share access rules

By default, {product-title} creates Manila storage classes that provide access to all IPv4 clients. To limit client access, define custom storage classes that use specific client IP addresses or subnets by using the `nfs-ShareClient` parameter.

.Prerequisites

* {rh-openstack-first} is deployed with appropriate Manila share infrastructure.
* You have cluster administrator privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for your custom storage class based on the following example:
+
.Example custom storage class file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: csi-manila-gold-restricted <1>
provisioner: manila.csi.openstack.org
parameters:
  type: gold <2>
  nfs-ShareClient: "10.0.0.0/24,192.168.1.100" <3>
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-name: manila-csi-secret
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: openshift-manila-csi-driver
  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-name: manila-csi-secret
  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-namespace: openshift-manila-csi-driver
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-name: manila-csi-secret
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-namespace: openshift-manila-csi-driver
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-publish-secret-name: manila-csi-secret
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-publish-secret-namespace: openshift-manila-csi-driver
allowVolumeExpansion: true
----
+
<1> A descriptive name for your custom storage class.
<2> The Manila share type. This type must match an existing share type in your {rh-openstack} environment.
<3> Comma-separated list of IP addresses or CIDR subnets that are allowed to access the NFS shares. In this example, access is restricted to the `10.0.0.0/24` subnet and the specific IP address is `192.168.1.100`.

. Apply the storage class from the file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f custom-manila-storageclass.yaml
----

. Verify that the storage class was created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get storageclass csi-manila-gold-restricted
----

. Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) that uses the custom storage class based on the following example:
+
.Example PVC file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-manila-restricted
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: csi-manila-gold-restricted <1>
----
+
<1> The name of your custom storage class that has restricted access.

. Apply the PVC from the file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f pvc-manila-restricted.yaml
----

[NOTE]
====
The `nfs-ShareClient` parameter accepts various formats:

* Single IP address: `192.168.1.100`
* CIDR subnet: `10.0.0.0/24`
* Multiple entries: `10.0.0.0/24,192.168.1.100,172.16.0.0/16`

Ensure that the specified IP addresses or subnets include the {product-title} cluster nodes to allow proper mounting of the persistent volumes.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using custom storage classes with restricted access rules, ensure that:

* The specified IP addresses or subnets include all {product-title} nodes that need to access the storage.
* The Manila service in {rh-openstack} supports the share type specified in the storage class.
* Network connectivity exists between the allowed clients and the Manila share servers.
