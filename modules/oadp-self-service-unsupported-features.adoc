= {oadp-short} Self-Service limitations

The following features are not supported by {oadp-short} Self-Service:

* Cross cluster backup and restore, or migrations are not supported. These {oadp-short} operations are supported for the cluster administrator.

* A namespace `admin` user cannot create a `VolumeSnapshotLocation` (VSL) CR. The cluster administrator creates and configures the VSL in the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) CR for a namespace `admin` user.

* The `ResourceModifiers` CR and volume policies are not supported for a namespace `admin` user.

* A namespace `admin` user can request backup or restore logs by using the `NonAdminDownloadRequest` CR, only if the backup or restore is created by a user by using the `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` CR. 
+
If the backup or restore CRs are created by using the cluster-wide default backup storage location, a namespace `admin` user cannot request the backup or restore logs.

* To ensure secure backup and restore, {oadp-short} Self-Service automatically excludes the following CRs from being backed up or restored:

** `NonAdminBackup`
** `NonAdminRestore`
** `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation`
** `SecurityContextConstraints`
** `ClusterRole`
** `ClusterRoleBinding`
** `CustomResourceDefinition`
** `PriorityClasses`
** `VirtualMachineClusterInstanceTypes`
** `VirtualMachineClusterPreferences`
