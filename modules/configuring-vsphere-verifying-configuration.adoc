= Verifying the configuration

The connection configuration process updates operator statuses and control plane nodes. It takes approximately an hour to complete. During the configuration process, the nodes will reboot. Previously bound `PersistentVolumeClaims` objects might become disconnected.

.Prerequisites
* You have saved the configuration settings in the *vSphere connection configuration* wizard.

.Procedure

. Check that the configuration process completed successfully:
+
--
.. In the OpenShift Container Platform Administrator perspective, navigate to *Home -> Overview*.
.. Under *Status* click *Operators*. Wait for all operator statuses to change from  *Progressing* to *All succeeded*.  A *Failed* status indicates that the configuration failed.
.. Under *Status*, click *Control Plane*. Wait for the response rate of all Control Pane components to return to 100%. A *Failed* control plane component indicates that the configuration failed.
--
A failure indicates that at least one of the connection settings is incorrect. Change the settings in the *vSphere connection configuration* wizard and save the configuration again.

. Check that you are able to bind `PersistentVolumeClaims` objects by performing the following steps:

.. Create a `StorageClass` object using the following YAML:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
 name: vsphere-sc
provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
parameters:
 datastore: YOURVCENTERDATASTORE
 diskformat: thin
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
----
.. Create a `PersistentVolumeClaims` object using the following YAML:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
 name: test-pvc
 namespace: openshift-config
 annotations:
   volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
 finalizers:
   - kubernetes.io/pvc-protection
spec:
 accessModes:
   - ReadWriteOnce
 resources:
   requests:
    storage: 10Gi
 storageClassName: vsphere-sc
 volumeMode: Filesystem
----
+
If you are unable to create a `PersistentVolumeClaims` object, you can troubleshoot by navigating to *Storage* -> *PersistentVolumeClaims* in the *Administrator* perspective of the {product-title} web console.
