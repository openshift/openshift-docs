= Exposing the back-end service

Similar to how you exposed the front-end service for external clients, you must now expose the back-end service by creating a route.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed the `nationalparks` back-end application.
* You have `cluster-admin` or project-level `admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a route to expose the `nationalparks` back-end application by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create route edge nationalparks --service=nationalparks
----

. Label the `nationalparks` route by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label route nationalparks type=parksmap-backend
----
+
The application code expects the `nationalparks` route to be labeled with `type=parksmap-backend`.
