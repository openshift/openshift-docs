= Applying minor-version updates with RPMs

Updating a {microshift-short} minor version on non `rpm-ostree` systems such as {op-system-base-full} requires downloading then updating the RPMs. For example, use the following procedure to update from 4.14 to 4.15.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only update {microshift-short} from one version to the next in sequence. Jumping minor versions is not supported. For example, must update 4.14 to 4.15.
====

* The system requirements for installing {microshift-short} have been met.
* You have root user access to the host.
* The version of {microshift-short} you have is compatible to upgrade to the version you are preparing to use.
* You have verified that your host operating system is compatible with the version of {microshift-short} you are preparing to install.
* You have completed a system backup.

+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
    --enable rhocp-{ocp-version}-for-{rhel-major}-$(uname -m)-rpms \
