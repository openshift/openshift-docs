= Applying minor-version updates with RPMs

[role="_abstract"]
Updating a {microshift-short} minor version on non `rpm-ostree` systems such as {op-system-base-full} requires downloading then updating the RPMs. For example, use the following procedure to update from 4.18 to 4.20.

include::snippets/microshift-unsupported-config-warn.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

.Prerequisites
* The system requirements for installing {microshift-short} have been met.
* You have root user access to the host.
* The version of {microshift-short} you have is compatible to upgrade to the version you are preparing to use.
* You have verified that your host operating system is compatible with the version of {microshift-short} you are preparing to install.
* You have completed a system backup.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot downgrade {microshift-short} with this process. Downgrades are not supported.

.Procedure

. For all lifecycles, enable the repository for the release you want to update to by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
    --enable rhocp-{ocp-version}-for-rhel-{op-system-version-major}-$(uname -m)-rpms \
    --enable fast-datapath-for-rhel-{op-system-version-major}-$(uname -m)-rpms
----

. For extended support (EUS) releases, also enable the EUS repositories by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
    --enable rhel-{op-system-version-major}-for-$(uname -m)-appstream-eus-rpms \
    --enable rhel-{op-system-version-major}-for-$(uname -m)-baseos-eus-rpms
----

. Avoid unintended future updates into an unsupported configuration by locking your operating system version with the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ sudo subscription-manager release --set={op-system-version}
----

. Update the {microshift-short} RPMs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf update microshift
----

. Reboot the host to apply updates by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl reboot
----

[NOTE]
====
The system health check runs on this update type, but does not perform any actions. If the update fails, an error message appears with the instruction to check the logs.
====

.Verification

. Check if the health checks exited with a successful boot by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl status greenboot-healthcheck
----

. Check the health check logs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl -u greenboot-healthcheck
----
