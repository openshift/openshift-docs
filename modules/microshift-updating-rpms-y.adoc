= Applying minor-version updates with RPMs

Updating a {product-title} minor version on non `rpm-ostree` systems such as {op-system-base-full} requires downloading then updating the RPMs. For example, use the following procedure to update from 4.14 to 4.15.

You can only update {product-title} from one version to the next in sequence. Jumping minor versions is not supported. For example, must update 4.14 to 4.15.

* You have root user access to the host.
* The version of {product-title} you have is compatible to upgrade to the version you are preparing to use.
* You have verified that your host operating system is compatible with the version of {product-title} you are preparing to install.
* You have completed a system backup.
