= Applying minor-version updates with RPMs

Updating a {microshift-short} minor version on non `rpm-ostree` systems such as {op-system-base-full} requires downloading then updating the RPMs. For example, use the following procedure to update from 4.16 to 4.18.

include::snippets/microshift-unsupported-config-warn.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

.Prerequisites
* The system requirements for installing {microshift-short} have been met.
* You have root user access to the host.
* The version of {microshift-short} you have is compatible to upgrade to the version you are preparing to use.
* You have verified that your host operating system is compatible with the version of {microshift-short} you are preparing to install.
* You have completed a system backup.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot downgrade {microshift-short} with this process. Downgrades are not supported.

.Procedure

. For all lifecycles, enable the repository for your release by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
    --enable rhocp-<x.y>-for-<9>-$(uname -m)-rpms \ # <1>
    --enable fast-datapath-for-<9>-$(uname -m)-rpms # <2>
----
<1> Replace _<x.y>_ and _<9>_ with the compatible versions of your {microshift-short} and {op-system-base-full}.
<2> Replace  _<9>_ with the compatible version of {op-system-base}.

. For extended support (EUS) releases, also enable the EUS repositories by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
`$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
    --enable rhel-<9>-for-x86_64-appstream-eus-rpms \ # <1>
    --enable rhel-<9>-for-x86_64-baseos-eus-rpms` # <2>
----
<1> Replace _<9>_ with the compatible major version number of {op-system-base}.
<2> Replace _<9>_ with the compatible major version number of {op-system-base}.

. Avoid unintended future updates into an unsupported configuration by locking your operating system version with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo subscription-manager release --set=<9.4> command. # <1>
----
<1> Replace _<9.4>_ with the major and minor version of your compatible {op-system-base} system.

. Update the {microshift-short} RPMs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf update microshift
----

. Reboot the host to apply updates by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl reboot
----

[NOTE]
====
The system health check runs on this update type, but does not perform any actions. If the update fails, an error message appears with the instruction to check the logs.
====

.Verification

. Check if the health checks exited with a successful boot by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl status greenboot-healthcheck
----

. Check the health check logs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl -u greenboot-healthcheck
----
