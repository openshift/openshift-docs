The following issues are fixed with {ols-official} 1.0.2:

* Before this update, the cluster-wide proxy incorrectly routed large language model (LLM) provider connections, ignoring the `no_proxy` environment variable. This led to end users experiencing {ols-long} attempting to connect to the LLM provider through a proxy when the `no_proxy` variable was explicitly defined. In this release, {ols-short} now respects the `no_proxy` environment variable for LLM provider connections. As a result, {ols-short} ignores proxy settings when `no_proxy` is set, enhancing direct LLM provider connections. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1861[OLS-1861].
