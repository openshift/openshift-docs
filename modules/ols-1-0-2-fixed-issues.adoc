= Fixed issues

The following issues are fixed with {ols-official} 1.0.2:

* Previously, when an {ocp-product-title} cluster had a cluster-wide proxy and the `no_proxy` environment variable was set, the {ols-long} service tried to connect to the large language model (LLM) provider through the proxy. Now, when a cluster has a cluster-wide proxy and you set the `no_proxy` environment variable, the {ols-short} service does not try to connect to the LLM provider through the proxy. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1861[OLS-1861].
