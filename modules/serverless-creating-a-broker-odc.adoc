= Creating a broker by using the web console

After Knative Eventing is installed on your cluster, you can create a broker by using the web console. Using the {ocp-product-title} web console provides a streamlined and intuitive user interface to create a broker.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console.
* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Serving and Knative Eventing are installed on the cluster.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *+Add* -> *Broker*. The *Broker* page is displayed.

. Optional. Update the *Name* of the broker. If you do not update the name, the generated broker is named `default`.

. Click *Create*.

.Verification

You can verify that the broker was created by viewing broker components in the *Topology* page.

. Navigate to *Topology*.

. View the `mt-broker-ingress`, `mt-broker-filter`, and `mt-broker-controller` components.
