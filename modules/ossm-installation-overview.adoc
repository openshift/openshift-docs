= {ProductName} installation overview

To install {ProductShortName} you use the link:https://operatorhub.io/[OperatorHub] to install the {ProductName} Operator.  By default the Operator is installed in the `openshift-operators` project. Installing the {ProductName} Operator provides the following:

* Provides the Istio Service Mesh Member Roll API
* Provides the Istio Service Mesh Control Plane API
* Installs the Kiali Operator
* Installs the Jaeger Operator
* Installs the Elasticsearch Operator (based on the Jaeger template setting)

After you have installed the Operator, you configure and deploy the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` custom resource. You specify configuration parameters such as CPU and memory and enable and disable components in the control plane CR. Creating an instance of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` creates the following required objects for {ProductShortName} and its dependencies (Jaeger, Kiali, etc.):

* ConfigMaps
* Deployments
* Pods
* ReplicaSets
* Secrets
* Services

[NOTE]
====
The default Jaeger deployment settings are only recommended for development, demo, or testing purposes and should NOT be used for production environments.  If you are deploying Service Mesh in a production environment you must modify the default Jaeger parameters in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` custom resource before running in a production environment.
====

After you have deployed the control plane, you create a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` custom resource to define the projects that are managed by each `ServiceMeshControlPlane` instance.  A project does not belong to a service mesh until you add it to the member roll for a particular control plane deployment.

In a single tenancy model, you only need to create a single `ServiceMeshControlPlane` and `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`.  In a multitenant implementation, you create a control plane and associated member roll for each tenant.
