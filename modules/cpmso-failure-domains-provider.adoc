= Failure domain platform support and configuration

The control plane machine set concept of a failure domain is analogous to existing concepts on cloud providers. Not all platforms support the use of failure domains.

1. Nutanix has a failure domain concept, but {product-title} {product-version} does not include support for this feature.
