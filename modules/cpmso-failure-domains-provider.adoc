= Failure domain platform support and configuration

The control plane machine set concept of a failure domain is analogous to existing concepts on cloud providers. Not all platforms support the use of failure domains.

1. Nutanix has a failure domain concept, but {product-title} {product-version} does not include support for this feature.

The failure domain configuration in the control plane machine set custom resource (CR) is platform-specific. For more information about failure domain parameters in the CR, see the sample failure domain configuration for your provider.
