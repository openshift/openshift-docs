= Creating a Jenkins service from a template

Templates provide parameter fields to define all the environment variables with predefined default values. {product-title} provides templates to make creating a new Jenkins service easy. The Jenkins templates should be registered in the default `openshift` project by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.

The two available templates both define deployment configuration and a service. The templates differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether the Jenkins content persists across a pod restart.

[NOTE]
====
A pod might be restarted when it is moved to another node or when an update of the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage. On pod restart, all data is lost. This template is only useful for development or testing.

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a Persistent Volume (PV) store. Data survives a pod restart.

To use a PV store, the cluster administrator must define a PV pool in the {product-title} deployment.

After you select which template you want, you must instantiate the template to be able to use Jenkins.

.Procedure

. Create a new Jenkins application using one of the following methods:
** A PV:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app jenkins-persistent
----

** Or an `emptyDir` type volume where configuration does not persist across pod restarts:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral
----

With both templates, you can run `oc describe` on them to see all the parameters available for overriding.

For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe jenkins-ephemeral
----
