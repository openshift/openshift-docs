= Creating a Jenkins service from a template

Templates provide parameter fields to define all the environment variables
with predefined default values. {product-title} provides templates to make
creating a new Jenkins service easy. The Jenkins templates should be
registered in the default `openshift` project by your cluster administrator
during the initial cluster setup.

The two available templates both define deployment configuration and a service.
The templates differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether or not the
Jenkins content persists across a Pod restart.

[NOTE]
====
A Pod might be restarted when it is moved to another node or when an update of
the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage. On Pod restart, all data is lost.
This template is only useful for development or testing.

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a Persistent Volume store. Data survives a Pod
restart.

To use a Persistent Volume store, the cluster administrator must define a
Persistent Volume pool in the {product-title} deployment.

After you select which template you want, you must instantiate the
template to be able to use Jenkins.

.Procedure

. Create a new Jenkins application using one of the following methods:
** A Persistent Volume:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app jenkins-persistent
----

** Or an `emptyDir` type volume where configuration does not persist across Pod restarts:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral
----
