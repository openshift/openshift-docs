= Kubernetes

{product-title} (ROSA) uses Red Hat OpenShift, which is an enterprise Kubernetes platform. Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services across multiple hosts, and offers management tools for deploying, automating, monitoring, and scaling containerized apps with minimal to no manual intervention. For complete information about Kubernetes, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer&level=foundational[Kubernetes documentation].

Cluster, compute pool, and compute node:: A Kubernetes cluster consists of a control plane and one or more compute nodes. Compute nodes are organized into compute pools of the type or profile of CPU, memory, operating system, attached disks, and other properties. The compute nodes correspond to the Kubernetes `Node` resource, and are managed by a Kubernetes control plane that centrally controls and monitors all Kubernetes resources in the cluster.
+
When you deploy the resources for a containerized app, the Kubernetes control plane decides which compute node to deploy those resources on, accounting for the deployment requirements and available capacity in the cluster. Kubernetes resources include services, deployments, and pods.

Namespace:: Kubernetes namespaces are a way to divide your cluster resources into separate areas that you can deploy apps and restrict access to, such as if you want to share the cluster with multiple teams. For example, system resources that are configured for you are kept in separate namespaces like `kube-system`. If you do not designate a namespace when you create a Kubernetes resource, the resource is automatically created in the `default` namespace.

Pod:: Every containerized app that is deployed into a cluster is deployed, run, and managed by a Kubernetes resource that is called a pod. Pods represent small deployable units in a Kubernetes cluster and are used to group the containers that must be treated as a single unit. In most cases, each container is deployed in its own pod. However, an app can require a container and other helper containers to be deployed into one pod so that those containers can be addressed by using the same private IP address.

App:: An app can refer to a complete app or a component of an app. You can deploy components of an app in separate pods or separate compute nodes.

Service:: A service is a Kubernetes resource that groups a set of pods and provides network connectivity to these pods without exposing the actual private IP address of each pod. You can use a service to make your app available within your cluster or to the public Internet.

Deployment:: A deployment is a Kubernetes resource where you can specify information about other resources or capabilities that are required to run your app, such as services, persistent storage, or annotations. You configure a deployment in a configuration YAML file, and then apply it to the cluster. The Kubernetes main resource configures the resources and deploys containers into pods on the compute nodes with available capacity.
+
Define update strategies for your app, including the number of pods that you want to add during a rolling update and the number of pods that can be unavailable at a time. When you perform a rolling update, the deployment checks whether the update is working and stops the rollout when failures are detected.
+
A deployment is just one type of workload controller that you can use to manage pods.
