The following bugs are fixed for this release:

* Before this update, when a `MachineDeployment` was in the process of upgrading its machines and the Cluster Autoscaler was also scaling the `MachineDeployment`, it was possible for the Cluster Autoscaler to remove new machines by scaling down the `MachineDeployment` for under-utilized nodes. With this release, scale down does not occur when a `MachineDeployment` is in the process of upgrading its machines. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-63495[OCPBUGS-63495])

* Before this update, the filtering mechanism was not handling the scenario where a range was actually a specific version, which resulted in the system mirroring more Operator versions than requested by the customer. With this release, we have fixed the logic to ignore a range when only one version is required, ensuring that only the specific requested version is mirrored. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-64647[OCPBUGS-64647])

* Before this update, the console relied on the full name for user identification, which created potential ambiguity when users shared similar names. With this release, the display logic has been updated to prioritize unique identifiers. As a result, the console now shows the user name instead of the full name as the display name. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65793[OCPBUGS-65793])

* Before this update, when opening a terminal to a running pod, the session disconnected whenever the annotations of the pod changed. With this release, the terminal session no longer disconnects when the annotations are changed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65900[OCPBUGS-65900])

* Before this update, there were missing unit conversion formulas, which resulted in units displaying as "undefined" when one of the missing formulas was selected. With this release, the missing unit conversion formulas have been added, ensuring that results now show the correct units rather than appearing as "undefined".
