= Upgrading clusters that run on {rh-openstack}

[role="_abstract"]
Review post-upgrade requirements for clusters running on {rh-openstack-first} to ensure control plane machine sets function correctly.

For clusters that run on {rh-openstack} that were created with {product-title} 4.13 or earlier, you might have to perform post-upgrade tasks before you can use control plane machine sets.
