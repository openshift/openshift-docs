= Limited support status

While operating outside of the supported versions list, you may be asked to upgrade the cluster to
a supported version when requesting support. Additionally, Red Hat does not make any runtime or SLA
guarantees for clusters outside of the supported versions list at the end of their 9 month end of
life cycle date.

Red Hat provides commercially reasonable support to ensure an upgrade path from an unsupported
release to a supported release is available. However, if a supported upgrade path is no longer
available, you may be required to create a new cluster and migrate your workloads.
