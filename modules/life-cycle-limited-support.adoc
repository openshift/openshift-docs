= Limited Support Status

While operating outside of the supported versions
list you may be asked to upgrade the cluster to a
supported version when requesting support, unless
you are within the 30-day grace period after version
deprecation. Additionally, Red Hat does not make any
runtime or SLA guarantees for clusters outside of the
supported versions list at the end of the 30-day grace
period.

Red Hat will provide best effort to ensure an upgrade
path from an unsupported release to a supported release
is available. However, if a supported upgrade path is no
longer available you may be required to create a new cluster
and migrate your workloads.
