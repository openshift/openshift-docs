* Alertmanager to 0.28.1
* Prometheus to 3.2.1
* Prometheus Operator to 0.81.0
* Thanos to 0.37.2
* kube-state-metrics to 2.15.0
* node-exporter to 1.9.1

== Changes to alerting rules

[NOTE]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat does not guarantee backward compatibility for recording rules or alerting rules.
====

* Added the `PrometheusPossibleNarrowSelectors` alert to warn users when PromQL queries or metric relabel configurations use selectors that could be too restrictive and might not take into account that values on the `le` label of classic histograms or the `quantile` label of summaries are floats in Prometheus v3. For more information, see the "Prometheus v3 upgrade" section.

[id="monitoring-4-19-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

The in-cluster monitoring stack for this release includes the following new features and enhancements:

Prometheus v3 upgrade::
This release introduces a major update to the Prometheus component, transitioning from v2 to v3. The monitoring stack and other core components include all of the necessary adjustments to ensure a smooth upgrade. However, some user-managed configurations might require modifications. The key changes include the following items:
+
--
* The values of the `le` label for classic histograms and the `quantile` label for summaries are normalized during ingestion. For example, the `example_bucket{le="10"}` metric selector is ingested as `example_bucket{le="10.0"}`. As a result, alerts, recording rules, dashboards, and relabeling configurations that reference label values as whole numbers, for example, `le="10"`, might no longer work as intended.
+
To mitigate the issue, update your selectors:

** If your queries need to cover data from both before and after the Prometheus upgrade, ensure both values are considered, for example, use a regular expression, `example_bucket{le=~"10(.0)?"}`.

** For queries that only cover data after the upgrade, use float values, for example, `le="10.0"`.
+
* Configurations that send alerts to additional Alertmanager instances through `additionalAlertmanagerConfigs` by using the Alertmanager v1 API are no longer supported.
+
To mitigate the issue, upgrade any affected Alertmanager instances to support the v2 API, which is supported since Alertmanager `v0.16.0`, and update your monitoring configuration to use the v2 scheme.

Metrics collection profiles is generally available::
{product-title} 4.13 introduced the ability to set a metrics collection profile for default platform monitoring to collect either the default amount of metrics data or a minimal amount of metrics data. In {product-title} {product-version}, metrics collection profiles are now generally available.
+
For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/monitoring_stack_for_red_hat_openshift/4.19/html-single/monitoring_key_concepts/index#configuring-metrics-collection-profiles_key-concepts[About metrics collection profiles] and link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/monitoring_stack_for_red_hat_openshift/4.19/html-single/configuring_core_platform_monitoring/index#choosing-a-metrics-collection-profile_configuring-performance-and-scalability[Choosing a metrics collection profile].

Added cluster proxy support for external Alertmanager instances::
With this release, external Alertmanager instances now use the cluster-wide HTTP proxy settings for communication. The {cmo-first} reads the cluster-wide proxy settings and configures the appropriate proxy URL for the Alertmanager endpoints.

Strict validation for the {cmo-full} is improved::
With this release, the strict validation introduced in {product-title} 4.18 is improved. Error messages now clearly identify the affected field, and validation is case-sensitive to ensure more accurate and consistent configuration.
+

[id="monitoring-4-19-fixed-issues_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

The in-cluster monitoring stack for this release includes the following fixed issues:

* Previously, if a scrape failed, Prometheus erroneously considered the samples from the very next scrape as duplicates and dropped them. This issue affected only the scrape immediately following a failure, while subsequent scrapes were processed correctly. With this release, the scrape following a failure is now correctly handled, ensuring that no valid samples are mistakenly dropped. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-53025[OCPBUGS-53025])
