= Understanding configuration notifications behavior across namespaces

[role="_abstract"]
When the Configuring notifications in any namespace feature is enabled, the {gitops-title} Operator performs additional actions to support delegated notification configuration. For each delegated namespace, the {gitops-title} Operator automatically creates a `NotificationsConfiguration` custom resource (CR) named `default-notifications-configuration`. Application teams can update this CR to define or modify their notification settings.

The Notifications controller determines which configuration to apply by using the following resolution behavior:

* The controller first checks for the delegated `NotificationsConfiguration` CR or the corresponding config map (`argocd-notifications-cm`) and Secret (`argocd-notification-secret`) in the namespace of the application.
* If no delegated configuration is found, the controller falls back to the central configuration resources (ConfigMap and Secret) defined in the control plane namespace.

To enable this model, the {gitops-title} Operator creates a `Role` and a `RoleBinding` in each delegated namespace, granting the Notifications controller permission to read `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets`. The {gitops-title} Operator also applies the `argocd.argoproj.io/notifications-managed-by-cluster-argocd` label to each delegated namespace.
