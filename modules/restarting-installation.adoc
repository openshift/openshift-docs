= Reinstalling the {product-title} cluster

If you are unable to debug and resolve issues in the failed {product-title} installation, consider installing a new {product-title} cluster. Before starting the installation process again, you must complete thorough cleanup.
For a user-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) installation, you must manually destroy the cluster and delete all associated resources. The following procedure is for an installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) installation.

.Procedure

. Destroy the cluster and remove all the resources associated with the cluster, including the hidden installer state files in the installation directory:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install destroy cluster --dir=<installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> `installation_directory` is the directory you specified when you ran `./openshift-install create cluster`. This directory contains the {product-title}
definition files that the installation program creates.

. Before reinstalling the cluster, delete the installation directory:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ rm -rf <installation_directory>
----

. Follow the procedure for installing a new {product-title} cluster.
