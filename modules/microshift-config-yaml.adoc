[id="microshift-config-yaml_{context}"]
= Using a YAML configuration file

At start up, {microshift-short} checks the system-wide `/etc/microshift/` directory for a configuration file named `config.yaml`. If the configuration file does not exist in the directory, the built-in default values are used to start the service.

[id="microshift-yaml-custom_{context}"]
== Custom settings
To create custom configurations, you must create a `config.yaml` file in the `/etc/microshift/` directory, and then change any settings that are expected to override the defaults before starting or restarting {microshift-short}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Restart {microshift-short} after changing any configuration settings to have them take effect. The `config.yaml` file is read only when {microshift-short} starts.
====

[TIP]
====
If you add all of the configurations you need at the same time, you can minimize system restarts.
