[id="microshift-config-yaml_{context}"]
= Using a YAML configuration file

At start up, {microshift-short} checks the system-wide `/etc/microshift/` directory for a configuration file named `config.yaml`. If the configuration file does not exist in the directory, built-in default values are used to start the service.

[id="microshift-yaml-custom_{context}"]
== Custom settings
To create custom configurations, make a copy of the provided `config.yaml.default` file that is provided in the `/etc/microshift/` directory, renaming it `config.yaml`. Keep this file in the `/etc/microshift/` directory, and then you can change supported settings that are expected to override the defaults before starting or restarting {microshift-short}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Restart {microshift-short} after changing any configuration settings to have them take effect. The `config.yaml` file is read only when {microshift-short} starts.

[id="microshift-yaml-custom-settings_{context}"]
== Separate restarts
Applications and other optional services used with your {microshift-short} cluster might also need to be restarted separately to apply configuration changes throughout the cluster. For example, when making changes to certain networking settings, you must stop and restart service and application pods to apply those changes. See each procedure for the task you are completing for more information.

[TIP]
====
If you add all of the configurations you need at the same time, you can minimize system restarts.
