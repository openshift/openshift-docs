= Using a YAML configuration file

On start up, {microshift-short} searches the system-wide `/etc/microshift/` directory for a configuration file named `config.yaml`. To use custom configurations, you must create the configuration file and specify any settings that are expected to override the defaults before starting {microshift-short}.

[id="microshift-yaml-custom_{context}"]
== Custom settings
To create custom configurations, you must create a `config.yaml` file in the `/etc/microshift/` directory, and then change any settings that are expected to override the defaults before starting or restarting {microshift-short}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Restart {microshift-short} after changing any configuration settings to have them take effect. The `config.yaml` file is read only when {microshift-short} starts.
