= The {microshift-short} YAML configuration file

At start up, {microshift-short} checks the system-wide `/etc/microshift/` directory for a configuration file named `config.yaml`. If the configuration file does not exist in the directory, built-in default values are used to start the service.

The {microshift-short} configuration file must be used in combination with host and, sometimes, application and service settings. Ensure that each item is configured in tandem when you customize your {microshift-short} cluster.
