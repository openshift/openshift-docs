= The {microshift-short} configuration file

At startup, {microshift-short} checks the system-wide `/etc/microshift/` directory for a configuration file named `config.yaml`. If the configuration file does not exist in the directory, built-in default values are used to start the service.

You must use the {microshift-short} configuration file in combination with host and, sometimes, application and service settings. Ensure that you configure each function in tandem when you adjust settings for your {microshift-short} cluster.

For your convenience, a `config.yaml.default` file ready for your inputs is automatically installed.
