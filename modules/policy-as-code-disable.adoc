= Disabling the policy as code feature

[role="_abstract"]
The policy as code feature is automatically enabled when you install {product-title-short}, but you can disable it.

.Procedure

To disable the policy as code feature, complete one of the following tasks, depending on the method you used to install {product-title-short}:

* If you installed {product-title-short} by using the Operator, set the `spec.configAsCode.configAsCodeComponent` field to `Disabled`.
* If you installed {product-title-short} by using Helm charts, set the `configAsCode.enabled` field in the `values.yaml` file to `false`.
* If you installed {product-title-short} by using the manifest installation method, also known as the `roxctl` method, delete the `config-controller` deployment by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl -n stackrox delete deployment config-controller <1>
----
<1> For {ocp}, use `oc` instead of `kubectl`.
