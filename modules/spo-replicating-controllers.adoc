= Replicating controllers and SecurityContextConstraints

When you deploy SELinux policies for replicating controllers, such as deployments or daemon sets, note that the `Pod` objects spawned by the controllers are not running with the identity of the user who creates the workload. Unless a `ServiceAccount` is selected, the pods might revert to using a restricted `SecurityContextConstraints` (SCC) which does not allow use of custom security policies.

.Procedure

. Create a project by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project nginx-secure
----

. Create the following `RoleBinding` object to allow SELinux policies to be used in the `nginx-secure` namespace:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: spo-nginx
  namespace: nginx-secure
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: spo-deploy-test
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: spo-nginx
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
----

. Create the `Role` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: spo-nginx
  namespace: nginx-secure
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - security.openshift.io
  resources:
  - securitycontextconstraints
  resourceNames:
  - privileged
  verbs:
  - use
----

. Create the `ServiceAccount` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: spo-deploy-test
  namespace: nginx-secure
----

. Create the `Deployment` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: selinux-test
  namespace: nginx-secure
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: selinux-test
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: selinux-test
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: selinux-test
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: spo-deploy-test
      securityContext:
        seLinuxOptions:
          type: nginx-secure_.process <1>
      containers:
      - name: nginx-unpriv
        image: quay.io/security-profiles-operator/test-nginx-unprivileged:1.21
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
----
<1> The `.seLinuxOptions.type` must exist before the Deployment is created.
+
[NOTE]
====
The SELinux type is not specified in the workload and is handled by the SCC. When the pods are created by the deployment and the `ReplicaSet`, the pods will run with the appropriate profile.
====

Ensure that your SCC is usable by only the correct service account. Refer to _Additional resources_ for more information.
