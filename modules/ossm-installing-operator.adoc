= Installing the {SMProductShortName} Operator

[WARNING]
====
For clusters without {SMProduct} instances, install the {SMProductShortName} Operator. {SMProduct} operates cluster-wide and needs a scope configuration to prevent conflicts between {istio} control planes. For clusters with {SMProduct} 3 or later, see "Deploying multiple service meshes on a single cluster".
====

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed a cluster on {ocp-product-title} 4.14 or later.

* You are logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp-product-title} web console, navigate to the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* page.

. Search for the {SMProductName} 3 Operator.

. Locate the {SMProductShortName} Operator, and click to select it.

. When the prompt that discusses the community operator opens, click *Continue*.

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page, perform the following steps:

.. Select *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* as the *Installation Mode*. This mode installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace, which enables the Operator to watch and be available to all namespaces in the cluster.

.. Select *Automatic* as the *Approval Strategy*. This ensures that the {olm-first} handles the future upgrades to the Operator automatically. If you select the *Manual* approval strategy, {olm} creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve the {olm} update request to update the Operator to the new version.

.. Select an *Update Channel*.
+
* Choose the *stable* channel to install the latest stable version of the {SMProductName} 3 Operator. It is the default channel for installing the Operator.
+
* To install a specific version of the {SMProductName} 3 Operator, choose the corresponding `stable-<version>` channel. For example, to install the {SMProductName} Operator version 3.0.x, use the *stable-3.0* channel.

. Click *Install* to install the Operator.

.Verification

. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* to verify that the {SMProductShortName} Operator is installed. `Succeeded` should show in the *Status* column.
