= Creating control plane profiles

You can create reusable configurations with `ServiceMeshControlPlane` profiles. Individual users can extend the profiles they create with their own configurations. Profiles can also inherit configuration information from other profiles. For example, you can create an accounting control plane for the accounting team and a marketing control plane for the marketing team. If you create a development template and a production template, members of the marketing team and the accounting team can extend the development and production profiles with team specific customization.

When you configure control plane profiles, which follow the same syntax as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, users inherit settings in a hierarchical fashion. The Operator is delivered with a `default` profile with default settings for {ProductName}. 

[id="ossm-create-configmap_{context}"]
== Creating the ConfigMap

To add custom profiles you must create a ConfigMap named `smcp-templates` in the `openshift-operators` project and mount the ConfigMap in the Operator container at `/usr/local/share/istio-operator/templates`.

.Prerequisites

* An installed, verified {ProductShortName} Operator.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Location of the Operator deployment.
* Access to the {product-title} Command-line Interface (CLI) also known as `oc`.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a cluster administrator.

. From the CLI, run this command to create the ConfigMap named `smcp-templates` in the `openshift-operators` project and replace `<profiles-directory>` with the location of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` files on your local disk:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap --from-file=<profiles-directory> smcp-templates -n openshift-operators
----

. Locate the Operator ClusterServiceVersion name.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterserviceversion -n openshift-operators | grep 'Service Mesh'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
maistra.v2.0.0            Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh   2.0.0                Succeeded
----

. Edit the Operator cluster service version to instruct the Operator to use the `smcp-templates` ConfigMap.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit clusterserviceversion -n openshift-operators servicemeshoperator.v2.0.0.1
----

. Add a volume mount and volume to the Operator deployment.
+

. Save your changes and exit the editor.

. You can use the `profiles` parameter in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` to specify one or more templates.
