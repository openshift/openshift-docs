= About the Developer perspective in the web console

The *Developer* perspective offers several built-in ways to deploy applications, services, and databases. In the *Developer* perspective, you can:

* View real-time visualization of rolling and recreating rollouts on the component.
* View the application status, resource utilization, project event streaming, and quota consumption.
* Share your project with others.
* Troubleshoot problems with your applications by running Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries on your project and examining the metrics visualized on a plot. The metrics provide information about the state of a cluster and any user-defined workloads that you are monitoring.

Cluster administrators can also open an embedded command line terminal instance in the web console in {product-title} 4.7 and later.

[NOTE]
====
The default web console perspective that is shown depends on the role of the user. The *Developer* perspective is displayed by default if the user is recognised as a developer.
====

The *Developer* perspective provides workflows specific to developer use cases, such as the ability to:

* Create and deploy applications on {product-title} by importing existing codebases, images, and container files.
* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with them within a project and monitor their deployment and build status.
* Group components within an application and connect the components within and across applications.
* Integrate serverless capabilities (Technology Preview).
* Create workspaces to edit your application code using Eclipse Che.
