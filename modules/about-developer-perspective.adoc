= About the Developer perspective in the web console

The {product-title} web console provides two perspectives; the *Administrator* perspective and the *Developer* perspective. The *Developer* perspective offers several built-in ways to deploy applications, services, and databases. You can view real-time virtualization of rolling and recreating rollouts on the component. You can also view the application status, resource utilization, project event streaming, and quota consumption. You can also share your project with others. You can also troubleshoot problems with your applications by running Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries on your project and examining the metrics visualized on a plot. The metrics provide information about the state of a cluster and any user-defined workloads that you are monitoring.

[NOTE]
====
The default web console perspective that is shown depends on the role of the user. The *Developer* perspective is displayed by default if the user is recognised as a developer.
====

The *Developer* perspective provides workflows specific to developer use cases, such as the ability to:

* Create and deploy applications on {product-title} by importing existing codebases, images, and dockerfiles.
* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with them within a project and monitor their deployment and build status.
* Group components within an application and connect the components within and across applications.
* Integrate serverless capabilities (Technology Preview).
* Create workspaces to edit your application code using Eclipse Che.

== Prerequisites

To access the *Developer* perspective, ensure that you have logged in to the web console.
