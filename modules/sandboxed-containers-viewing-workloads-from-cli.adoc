= Viewing {sandboxed-containers-first} workloads from the CLI

You can view the `runtimeClass` that the pods for your workloads use from the CLI.

.Prerequisites

* You have {product-title} {product-version} installed on your cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

* Inspect the `runtimeClassName` field on the pod to see a pod running on {sandboxed-containers-first} versus a normal container.
+
** On the node, each pod has a corresponding `qemu` process.

.Verification

* You can check the logs of the `openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator` controller pod to see detailed messages about the steps it is running.
** You can retrieve the name of the controller pod by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator | grep openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator-controller-manager
----
+
This enables you to monitor the logs of the container manager of that pod.
