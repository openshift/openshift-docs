= Distributed tracing

Distributed Tracing is the process of tracking the performance of individual services in an application by tracing the path of the service calls in the application. Each time a user takes action in an application, a request is executed that might require many services to interact to produce a response. The path of this request is called a distributed transaction.

{ProductName} uses Jaeger to allows developers to visualize call flows in a microservice application. Understanding the sequence of calls how many calls occur in a serial fashion versus how many occur in parallel) and sources of latency is useful when maintaining a distributed system
