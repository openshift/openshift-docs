= Disabling ShipwrightBuilds build controller and webhook pod

[role="_abstract"] 

You can disable the `ShipwrightBuilds` Custom Resource (CR) without disabling the shared-resources Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver component and the `ShipwrightBuilds` Custom Resource Definition (CRD). Disabling the `ShipwrightBuilds` CR removes the `ShipwrightBuilds` build controller and `ShipwrightBuilds` build webhook pod from the `openshift-builds` namespace.

.Procedure

* Disable the `ShipwrightBuilds` controller and webhook by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch openshiftbuild cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"shipwright":{"build":{"state":"Disabled"}}}}'
----
+
This command disables the build controller and webhook but does not affect the `ShipwrightBuilds` CRD.
