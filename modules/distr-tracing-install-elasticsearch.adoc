= Installing the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator

The default {JaegerName} deployment uses in-memory storage because it is designed to be installed quickly for those evaluating {DTProductName}, giving demonstrations, or using {JaegerName} in a test environment. If you plan to use {JaegerName} in production, you must install and configure a persistent storage option, in this case, Elasticsearch.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

[WARNING]
====
Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you have already installed the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator as part of OpenShift Logging, you do not need to install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator again. The {JaegerName} Operator creates the Elasticsearch instance using the installed OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type *Elasticsearch* into the filter box to locate the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.

. Click the *OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator* provided by Red Hat to display information about the Operator.

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page, select the *stable* Update Channel. This automatically updates your Operator as new versions are released.

. Accept the default *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators-redhat` project and makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Elasticsearch installation requires the *openshift-operators-redhat* namespace for the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. The other {DTProductName} Operators are installed in the `openshift-operators` namespace.
====
+

* Accept the default *Automatic* approval strategy. By accepting the default, when a new version of this Operator is available, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention. If you select *Manual* updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Manual* approval strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator install and subscription process.
====

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Installed Operators* page, select the `openshift-operators-redhat` project. Wait until you see that the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator shows a status of "InstallSucceeded" before continuing.
