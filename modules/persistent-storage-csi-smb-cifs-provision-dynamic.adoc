= Dynamic provisioning

You can create a storage class for dynamic provisioning of Common Internet File System (CIFS) dialect/Server Message Block (SMB) protocol volumes. Provisioning volumes creates a subdirectory with the persistent volume (PV) name under `source` defined in the storage class.

.Prerequisites
* {FeatureName} CSI Driver Operator and driver installed.
* You are logged in to the running {product-title} cluster.
* You have installed the SMB server and know the following information about the server:
** Hostname
** Share name
** Username and password

.Procedure

To set up dynamic provisioning:

. Create a Secret for access to the Samba server using the following command with the following example YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
--
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
--
+
[source,yaml]
.Secret example YAML file
--
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: smbcreds <1>
  namespace: samba-server <2>
stringData:
  username: <username> <3>
  password: <password> <4>
--
<1> Name of the Secret for the Samba server.
<2> Namespace for the Secret for the Samba server.
<3> Username for the Secret for the Samba server.
<4> Password for the Secret for the Samba server.

. Create a storage class by running the following command with the following example YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
--
$ oc create -f <sc_file_name>.yaml <1>
--
<1> Name of the storage class YAML file.
+
[source,yaml]
.Storage class example YAML file
--
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: <sc_name> <1>
provisioner: smb.csi.k8s.io
parameters:
  source: //<hostname>/<shares> <2>
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-name: smbcreds <3>
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: samba-server <4>
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-name: smbcreds <3>
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-namespace: samba-server <4>
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
mountOptions:
  - dir_mode=0777
  - file_mode=0777
  - uid=1001
  - gid=1001
--
<1> The name of the storage class.
<2> The Samba server must be installed somewhere and reachable from the cluster with <`hostname>` being the hostname for the Samba server and `<shares>` the path the server is configured to have among the exported shares. 
<3> Name of the Secret for the Samba server that was set in the previous step. If the `csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret` is provided, a subdirectory is created with the PV name under `source`.
<4> Namespace for the Secret for the Samba server that was set in the previous step.

. Create a PVC:

.. Create a PVC by running the following command with the following example YAML file:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <pv_file_name>.yaml <1>
----
<1> The name of the PVC YAML file.
+
.Example PVC YAML file
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: <pvc_name> <1>
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: <storage_amount> <2>
  storageClassName: <sc_name> <3>
----
<1> The name of the PVC.
<2> Storage request amount.
<3> The name of the CIFS/SMB storage class that you created in the previous step.

.. Ensure that the PVC was created and is in the "Bound" status by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc describe pvc <pvc_name> <1>
----
<1> The name of the PVC that you created in the preceding step.
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
Name:          pvc-test
Namespace:     default
StorageClass:  samba
Status:        Bound <1>
...
----
<1> PVC is in Bound status.
