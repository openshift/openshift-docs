= Configuring AWS PrivateLink DNS forwarding

With AWS PrivateLink clusters, a public hosted zone and a private hosted zone are created in Route 53. With the private hosted zone, records within the zone are resolvable only from within the VPC to which it is assigned.

The _Let's Encrypt DNS-01_ validation requires a public zone so that valid, publicly trusted certificates can be issued for the domain. The validation records are deleted after _Let's Encrypt_ validation is complete; however, the zone is still required for issuing and renewing these certificates, which are typically required every 60 days. While these zones usually appear empty, it is serving a critical role in the validation process.

For more information about private hosted zones, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html[AWS private hosted zones documentation]. For more information about private hosted zones, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html[AWS public hosted zones documentation].

.Prerequisites

* Your corporate network or other VPC has connectivity
* UDP port 53 and TCP port 53 ARE enabled across your networks to allow for DNS queries
* You have created an AWS PrivateLink cluster using {product-title}

.Procedure

. To allow for records such as `api.<cluster_domain>`` and ``*.apps.<cluster_domain>`` to resolve outside of the VPC, link:https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/route53-resolve-with-inbound-endpoint/[configure a Route 53 Resolver Inbound Endpoint].

. When you configure the inbound endpoint, select the VPC and private subnets that were used when you created the cluster.

. After the endpoints are operational and associated, configure your corporate network to forward DNS queries to those IP addresses for the top-level cluster domain, such as `drow-pl-01.htno.p1.openshiftapps.com`.

. If you are forwarding DNS queries from one VPC to another VPC, link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-rules-managing.html[configure forwarding rules].

. If you are configuring your remote network DNS server, see your specific DNS server documentation to configure selective DNS forwarding for the installed cluster domain.
