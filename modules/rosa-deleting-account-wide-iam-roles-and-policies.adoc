= Deleting the account-wide IAM roles and policies

This section provides steps to delete the account-wide IAM roles and policies that you created for ROSA with STS deployments, along with the account-wide Operator policies. You can delete the account-wide AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies only after deleting all of the {product-title} (ROSA) with AWS Security Token Services (STS) clusters that depend on them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The account-wide IAM roles and policies might be used by other ROSA clusters in the same AWS account. You must only remove the roles if they are not required by other clusters.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed a ROSA cluster.
* You have installed and configured the latest ROSA CLI (`rosa`) on your installation host.

.Procedure

. Delete the account-wide roles:
.. List the account-wide roles in your AWS account by using the ROSA CLI (`rosa`):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list account-roles
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

.. Delete the account-wide roles:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa delete account-roles --prefix <prefix> --mode auto <1>
----
<1> You must include the `--<prefix>` argument. Replace `<prefix>` with the prefix of the account-wide roles to delete. If you did not specify a custom prefix when you created the account-wide roles, specify the default prefix, `ManagedOpenShift`.

====

. Delete the account-wide in-line and Operator policies:
.. Under the *Policies* page in the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/policies[AWS IAM Console], filter the list of policies by the prefix that you specified when you created the account-wide roles and policies.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you did not specify a custom prefix when you created the account-wide roles, search for the default prefix, `ManagedOpenShift`.

.. Delete the account-wide in-line policies and Operator policies by using the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/policies[AWS IAM Console]. For more information about deleting IAM policies by using the AWS IAM Console, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-delete.html[Deleting IAM policies] in the AWS documentation.
