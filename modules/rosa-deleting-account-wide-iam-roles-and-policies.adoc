= Deleting the account-wide IAM roles and policies

This section provides steps to delete the account-wide IAM roles and policies that you created for 
ifdef::sts[]
ROSA with STS 
endif::sts[]
ifdef::hcp[]
{hcp-title} 
endif::hcp[] 
deployments, along with the account-wide Operator policies. You can delete the account-wide AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies only after deleting all of the 
ifdef::sts[]
{product-title} (ROSA) with AWS Security Token Services (STS) 
endif::sts[]
ifdef::hcp[]
{hcp-title} 
endif::hcp[]
clusters that depend on them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The account-wide IAM roles and policies might be used by other 
ifdef::sts[]
ROSA clusters 
endif::sts[]
ifdef::hcp[]
{product-title} 
endif::hcp[]
in the same AWS account. Only remove the roles if they are not required by other clusters.
====

* You have account-wide IAM roles that you want to delete.
* You have installed and configured the latest ROSA CLI (`rosa`) on your installation host.

.. Delete the account-wide roles:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa delete account-roles --prefix <prefix> --mode auto <1>
----
<1> You must include the `--<prefix>` argument. Replace `<prefix>` with the prefix of the account-wide roles to delete. If you did not specify a custom prefix when you created the account-wide roles, specify the default prefix, `ManagedOpenShift`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The account-wide IAM roles might be used by other ROSA clusters in the same AWS account. Only remove the roles if they are not required by other clusters.

. Delete the account-wide in-line and Operator policies:
.. Under the *Policies* page in the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/policies[AWS IAM Console], filter the list of policies by the prefix that you specified when you created the account-wide roles and policies.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you did not specify a custom prefix when you created the account-wide roles, search for the default prefix, `ManagedOpenShift`.

.. Delete the account-wide in-line policies and Operator policies by using the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/policies[AWS IAM Console]. For more information about deleting IAM policies by using the AWS IAM Console, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-delete.html[Deleting IAM policies] in the AWS documentation.
