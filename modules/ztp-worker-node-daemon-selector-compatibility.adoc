= (Optional) Ensuring PTP and SR-IOV daemon selector compatibility

If the DU profile was deployed using the {ztp-first} plugin version 4.11 or earlier, the PTP and SR-IOV Operators might be configured to place the daemons only on nodes labelled as `master`. This configuration prevents the PTP and SR-IOV daemons from operating on the worker node. If the PTP and SR-IOV daemon node selectors are incorrectly configured on your system, you must change the daemons before proceeding with the worker DU profile configuration.

.Procedure

. Check the daemon node selector settings of the PTP Operator on one of the spoke clusters:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ptpoperatorconfig/default -n openshift-ptp -ojsonpath='{.spec}' | jq
----
+
.Example output for PTP Operator
+
[source,json]
----
{"daemonNodeSelector":{"node-role.kubernetes.io/master":""}} <1>
----
<1> If the node selector is set to `master`, the spoke was deployed with the version of the {ztp} plugin that requires changes.

. Check the daemon node selector settings of the SR-IOV Operator on one of the spoke clusters:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc get sriovoperatorconfig/default -n \
openshift-sriov-network-operator -ojsonpath='{.spec}' | jq
----
+
.Example output for SR-IOV Operator
+
[source,json]
----
{"configDaemonNodeSelector":{"node-role.kubernetes.io/worker":""},"disableDrain":false,"enableInjector":true,"enableOperatorWebhook":true} <1>
----
<1> If the node selector is set to `master`, the spoke was deployed with the version of the {ztp} plugin that requires changes.

. In the group policy, add the following `complianceType` and `spec` entries:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
    - fileName: PtpOperatorConfig.yaml
      policyName: "config-policy"
      complianceType: mustonlyhave
      spec:
        daemonNodeSelector:
          node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
    - fileName: SriovOperatorConfig.yaml
      policyName: "config-policy"
      complianceType: mustonlyhave
      spec:
        configDaemonNodeSelector:
          node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the `daemonNodeSelector` field causes temporary PTP synchronization loss and SR-IOV connectivity loss.
====

. Commit the changes in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the {ztp} ArgoCD application.
