= Setting a live migration feature gate for each cluster in {VirtProductName}

To enable cross-cluster live migration, you must set a feature gate for each of the two clusters in {VirtProductName}.

.Prerequisites

* The `virt-synchronization-controller` pods must be running.

.Procedure

* Set the feature gate by running the following command for each cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv --type json -p '[{"op":
"replace", "path": "/spec/featureGates/decentralizedLiveMigration", "value": true}]'
----

.Verification

* To verify that the feature gate enablement is successful for each cluster, run the following command in the {VirtProductName} namespace to locate the synchronization pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n openshift-cnv pod | grep virt-synchronization
----
