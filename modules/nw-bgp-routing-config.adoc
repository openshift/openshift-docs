As a cluster administrator, you can enable or disable BGP routing support for your cluster on bare-metal infrastructure.

[id="enabling-bgp-routing-support_{context}"]
== Enabling BGP routing support

As a cluster administrator, you can enable Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing support for your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in to the cluster with a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Cluster is installed on bare-metal infrastructure.

.Procedure

. To enable dynamic routing, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch network.operator cluster -p '{
  "spec": {
    "defaultNetwork": {
      "ovnKubernetesConfig": {
        "routeAdvertisements": "Enabled"
      }
    }
  }
}'
----

. To enable a dynamic routing provider, enter the following command:
+
