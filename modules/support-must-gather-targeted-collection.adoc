= Reducing the size of must-gather output

The `oc adm must-gather` command collects comprehensive cluster information. However, a full data collection can result in a large file that is difficult to upload and analyze and could result in timeouts. 

To manage the output size and target your data collection for more effective troubleshooting, you can pass specific flags to the underlying `gather` script or scope the collection to particular resources.

[id="excluding-all-pod-logs_{context}"]
== Excluding all pod logs

If you suspect the issue is not related to pod logs, you can exclude them entirely to significantly reduce the size of the `must-gather` archive. To pass flags to the data collection script running within the `must-gather` image, add a double dash (`--`) after `oc adm must-gather`, followed by the script arguments.

.Procedure

To run `must-gather` without collecting any pod logs, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather -- /usr/bin/gather --no-logs
----

[id="gathering-data-for-specific-resources"]
== Gathering data for specific resources

Instead of collecting data for the entire cluster, you can direct `must-gather` to inspect a specific resource. This is highly effective for isolating issues within a single project, operator, or application.

The `must-gather` tool uses `oc adm inspect` internally. You can specify what to inspect by passing the `inspect` command and its arguments after the `--` separator.

.Procedure

. To gather data for a specific namespace, such as `my-project`, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --dest-dir=my-project-must-gather -- oc adm inspect ns/my-project
----
+
This command collects all standard resources within the `my-project` namespace, including logs from pods in that namespace, but excludes cluster-scoped resources.

. To gather data related to a specific Cluster Operator, such as `openshift-apiserver`, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --dest-dir=apiserver-must-gather -- oc adm inspect clusteroperator/openshift-apiserver
----
