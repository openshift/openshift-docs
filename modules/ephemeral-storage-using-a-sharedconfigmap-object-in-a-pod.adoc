= Using a SharedConfigMap custom resource in a pod

[role="_abstract"]
To access a `SharedConfigMap` custom resource (CR) from a pod, you must grant the associated service account the necessary role-based access control (RBAC) permissions to use that `SharedConfigMap` CR.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a `SharedConfigMap` CR instance for the config map that you want to share across namespaces in the cluster.
* You must have permissions to perform the following actions:
** Run the `oc get sharedconfigmaps` command to get the list of the `SharedConfigMap` CR instances.
** Run the `oc adm policy who-can use <sharedsecret_identifier>` command to check if a service account is allowed to use the `SharedSecret` CR and the service account is listed in your namespace.
** Run the `oc describe clusterrole <roleName>` command to confirm that the service account of your pod is allowed to use `csi` volumes. If you created the pod as a user, confirm that you are allowed to use `csi` volumes.

[NOTE]
====
If you are unable to complete the last two prerequisites, the cluster administrator can grant you the RBAC permission to enable the service accounts to use the `SharedConfigMap` CR.
====

.Procedure

. Create the `RoleBinding` object associated with the role and grant the permission to your service account to use the shared resource.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: use-shared-config
  namespace: <app_namespace> <1>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: use-shared-config
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: <service_account_name> <2> 
----
<1> Replace `<app_namespace>` with the namespace name of your application.
<2> Replace `<service_account_name>` with the service account name of your application.

. Mount the Shared Resource Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver into a pod or any other resource that accepts `csi` volumes.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-shared-config
  namespace: <app_namespace> # <1>
spec:
  ...
  serviceAccountName: default
  volumes:
    - name: shared-config
      csi:
        readOnly: true 
        driver: csi.sharedresource.openshift.io
        volumeAttributes:
          sharedConfigMap: share-test-config # <2>
----
<1> Replace <app_namespace> with the namespace name of your application.
<2> Specifies the name of the `sharedConfigMap` object. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the value of `sharedConfigMap` attribute does not match the name of `sharedConfigMap` instance, the pod fails to start.
