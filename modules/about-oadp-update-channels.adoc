= About {oadp-short} update channels

When you install an {oadp-short} Operator, you choose an _update channel_. This channel determines which upgrades to the {oadp-short} Operator and to Velero you receive. You can switch channels at any time.

The following update channels are available:

* The *stable* channel is now deprecated. The *stable* channel contains the patches (z-stream updates) of OADP `ClusterServiceVersion` for `{oadp-short}.v1.1.z` and older versions from `{oadp-short}.v1.0.z`.

* The *stable-1.0* channel is deprecated and is not supported.

* The *stable-1.1* channel is deprecated and is not supported.

* The *stable-1.2* channel  is deprecated and is not supported.

* The *stable-1.3* channel contains `{oadp-short}.v1.3.z`, the most recent {oadp-short} 1.3 `ClusterServiceVersion`.

* The *stable-1.4* channel contains `{oadp-short}.v1.4.z`, the most recent {oadp-short} 1.4 `ClusterServiceVersion`.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

*Which update channel is right for you?*

* The *stable* channel is now deprecated. If you are already using the stable channel, you will continue to get updates from `{oadp-short}.v1.1.z`.

* Choose the *stable-1.y* update channel to install {oadp-short} 1.y and to continue receiving patches for it. If you choose this channel, you will receive all z-stream patches for version 1.y.z.

*When must you switch update channels?*

* If you have {oadp-short} 1.y installed, and you want to receive patches only for that y-stream, you must switch from the *stable* update channel to the *stable-1.y* update channel. You will then receive all z-stream patches for version 1.y.z.

* If you have {oadp-short} 1.0 installed, want to upgrade to {oadp-short} 1.1, and then receive patches only for {oadp-short} 1.1, you must switch from the *stable-1.0* update channel to the *stable-1.1* update channel. You will then receive all z-stream patches for version 1.1.z.

* If you have {oadp-short} 1.y installed, with _y_ greater than 0, and want to switch to {oadp-short} 1.0, you must uninstall your {oadp-short} Operator and then reinstall it using the *stable-1.0* update channel. You will then receive all z-stream patches for version 1.0.z.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot switch from {oadp-short} 1.y to OADP 1.0 by switching update channels. You must uninstall the Operator and then reinstall it.
