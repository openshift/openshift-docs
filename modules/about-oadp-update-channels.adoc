= About OADP update channels

When you install an OADP Operator, you choose an _update channel_. This channel determines which upgrades to the OADP Operator and to Velero you receive. You can switch channels at any time.

The following update channels are available:

* The *stable* channel is now deprecated. The *stable* channel contains the patches (z-stream updates) of OADP `ClusterServiceVersion` for `oadp.v1.1.z` and older versions from `oadp.v1.0.z`.

* The *stable-1.0* channel contains `oadp.v1.0._z_`, the most recent OADP 1.0 `ClusterServiceVersion`.

* The *stable-1.1* channel contains `oadp.v1.1._z_`, the most recent OADP 1.1 `ClusterServiceVersion`.

* The *stable-1.2* channel contains `oadp.v1.2._z_`, the most recent OADP 1.2 `ClusterServiceVersion`.

* The *stable-1.3* channel contains `oadp.v1.3._z_`, the most recent OADP 1.3 `ClusterServiceVersion`.

*Which update channel is right for you?*

* The *stable* channel is now deprecated.  If you are already using the stable channel, you will continue to get updates from `oadp.v1.1._z_`.

* Choose the *stable-1._y_* update channel to install OADP 1._y_ and to continue receiving patches for it. If you choose this channel, you will receive all z-stream patches for version 1._y_._z_.

*When must you switch update channels?*

* If you have OADP 1._y_ installed, and you want to receive patches only for that y-stream, you must switch from the *stable* update channel to the *stable-1._y_* update channel. You will then receive all z-stream patches for version 1._y_._z_.

* If you have OADP 1.0 installed, want to upgrade to OADP 1.1, and then receive patches only for OADP 1.1, you must switch from the *stable-1.0* update channel to the *stable-1.1* update channel. You will then receive all z-stream patches for version 1.1._z_.

* If you have OADP 1._y_ installed, with _y_ greater than 0, and want to switch to OADP 1.0, you must _uninstall_ your OADP Operator and then reinstall it using the *stable-1.0* update channel. You will then receive all z-stream patches for version 1.0._z_.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot switch from OADP 1._y_ to OADP 1.0 by switching update channels. You must uninstall the Operator and then reinstall it.
