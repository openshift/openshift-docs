= Updating or filtering a file-based catalog image

You can use the `opm` CLI to update or filter a catalog image that uses the file-based catalog format. By extracting the contents of an existing catalog image, you can modify the catalog as needed, for example:

* Adding packages
* Removing packages
* Updating existing package entries
* Detailing deprecation messages per package, channel, and bundle

You can then rebuild the image as an updated version of the catalog.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, if you already have a catalog image on a mirror registry, you can use the oc-mirror CLI plugin to automatically prune any removed images from an updated source version of that catalog image while mirroring it to the target registry.

For more information about the oc-mirror plugin and this use case, see the "Keeping your mirror registry content updated" section, and specifically the "Pruning images" subsection, of "Mirroring images for a disconnected installation using the oc-mirror plugin".

.Prerequisites
* You have the following on your workstation:
** The `opm` CLI.
** `podman` version 1.9.3+.
** A file-based catalog image.
** A catalog directory structure recently initialized on your workstation related to this catalog.
+
If you do not have an initialized catalog directory, create the directory and generate the Dockerfile. For more information, see the "Initialize the catalog" step from the "Creating a file-based catalog image" procedure.

.Procedure

. Extract the contents of the catalog image in YAML format to an `index.yaml` file in your catalog directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ opm render <registry>/<namespace>/<catalog_image_name>:<tag> \
    -o yaml > <catalog_dir>/index.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can use the `-o json` flag to output in JSON format.
====

. Modify the contents of the resulting `index.yaml` file to your specifications:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
After a bundle has been published in a catalog, assume that one of your users has installed it. Ensure that all previously published bundles in a catalog have an update path to the current or newer channel head to avoid stranding users that have that version installed.

* To add an Operator, follow the steps for creating package, bundle, and channel entries in the "Creating a file-based catalog image" procedure.

* To remove an Operator, delete the set of `olm.package`, `olm.channel`, and `olm.bundle` blobs that relate to the package. The following example shows a set that must be deleted to remove the `example-operator` package from the catalog:

* To add or update deprecation messages for an Operator, ensure there is a `deprecations.yaml` file in the same directory as the package's `index.yaml` file. For information on the `deprecations.yaml` file format, see "olm.deprecations schema".

. Save your changes.

. Validate the catalog:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ opm validate <catalog_dir>
----

. Rebuild the catalog:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman build . \
    -f <catalog_dir>.Dockerfile \
    -t <registry>/<namespace>/<catalog_image_name>:<tag>
----

. Push the updated catalog image to a registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman push <registry>/<namespace>/<catalog_image_name>:<tag>
----

.Verification

. In the web console, navigate to the OperatorHub configuration resource in the *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* -> *Configuration* page.

. Add the catalog source or update the existing catalog source to use the pull spec for your updated catalog image.
+
For more information, see "Adding a catalog source to a cluster" in the "Additional resources" of this section.

. After the catalog source is in a *READY* state, navigate to the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* page and check that the changes you made are reflected in the list of Operators.
