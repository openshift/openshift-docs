= Deleting a volume snapshot

Deletion is triggered based on how you define the VolumeSnapshot object.

.Procedure

To enable deletion of a volume snapshot in a cluster:

. Specify the required deletion policy in VolumeSnapshotClass, as shown in the following example:

+
.volumesnapshot.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass <1>
metadata:
  name: csi-hostpath-snap
driver: hostpath.csi.k8s.io
deletionPolicy: Delete <1>
----
<1> If `Delete`, the underlying snapshot will be deleted, along with the VolumeSnapshotContent object. If `Retain`, both the underlying snapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent remain.
+
[NOTE]
====
If `Retain` is specified, and the VolumeSnapshot is deleted without deleting the corresponding VolumeSnapshotContent, then the content will remain.
