= Deleting a volume snapshot

You can configure how {product-title} deletes volume snapshots.

.Procedure

To enable deletion of a volume snapshot in a cluster:

. Specify the deletion policy that you require in the `VolumeSnapshotClass` object, as shown in the following example:

+
.volumesnapshotclass.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: csi-hostpath-snap
driver: hostpath.csi.k8s.io
deletionPolicy: Delete <1>
----
<1> If the `Delete` value is set, the underlying snapshot will be deleted, along with the `VolumeSnapshotContent` object. If the `Retain` value is set, both the underlying snapshot and `VolumeSnapshotContent` object remain.
  +
If the `Retain` value is set, and the `VolumeSnapshot` object is deleted without deleting the corresponding `VolumeSnapshotContent` object, then the content will remain. The snapshot itself is also retained in the storage back end.
