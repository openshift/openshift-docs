= Deleting a volume snapshot

You can configure how {product-title} deletes volume snapshots.

.Procedure

. Specify the deletion policy that you require in the `VolumeSnapshotClass` object, as shown in the following example:
+
.volumesnapshotclass.yaml
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: csi-hostpath-snap
driver: hostpath.csi.k8s.io
deletionPolicy: Delete <1>
----
[.small]
<1> When deleting the volume snapshot, if the `Delete` value is set, the underlying snapshot is deleted along with the `VolumeSnapshotContent` object. If the `Retain` value is set, both the underlying snapshot and `VolumeSnapshotContent` object remain.
  +
If the `Retain` value is set and the `VolumeSnapshot` object is deleted without deleting the corresponding `VolumeSnapshotContent` object, the content remains. The snapshot itself is also retained in the storage back end.

. Delete the volume snapshot by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete volumesnapshot <volumesnapshot_name>
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
volumesnapshot.snapshot.storage.k8s.io "mysnapshot" deleted
----

. If the deletion policy is set to `Retain`, delete the volume snapshot content by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete volumesnapshotcontent <volumesnapshotcontent_name>
----
+
. Optional: If the `VolumeSnapshot` object is not successfully deleted, enter the following command to remove any finalizers for the leftover resource so that the delete operation can continue:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Only remove the finalizers if you are confident that there are no existing references from either persistent volume claims or volume snapshot contents to the `VolumeSnapshot` object.
Even with the `--force` option, the delete operation does not delete snapshot objects until all finalizers are removed.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch -n $PROJECT volumesnapshot/$NAME --type=merge -p '{"metadata": {"finalizers":null}}'
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
volumesnapshotclass.snapshot.storage.k8s.io "csi-ocs-rbd-snapclass" deleted
----
+
The finalizers are removed and the volume snapshot is deleted.
