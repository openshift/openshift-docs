== Purpose
The OpenShift {redfish-operator} manages the life-cycle of the Baremetal Hardware Event proxy. The Baremetal Hardware Event Proxy enables the user to configure the types of event that are monitored using Redfish Hardware Events on the cluster.

== Configuration Objects
You can use this command to edit the configuration after installation: for example, the webhook port.
You can edit configuration objects with:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n [namespace] edit cm hw-event-proxy-operator-manager-config
----
[source,terminal]

== CRD
The proxy enables applications running on bare-metal clusters to respond quickly to Redfish hardware changes and failures such as breaches of temperature thresholds, fan failure, disk loss, power outages, and memory failure, reported using the HardwareEvent CR.
