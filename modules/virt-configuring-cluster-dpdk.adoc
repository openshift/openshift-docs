= Configuring a cluster for DPDK workloads

You can use the following procedure to configure an {product-title} cluster to run Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) workloads.

:FeatureName: Configuring a cluster for DPDK workloads
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have installed the SR-IOV Network Operator.
* You have installed the Node Tuning Operator.

.Procedure 
. Map your compute nodes topology to determine which Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) CPUs are isolated for DPDK applications and which ones are reserved for the operating system (OS).
. Label a subset of the compute nodes with a custom role; for example, `worker-dpdk`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-dpdk=""
---- 

. Create a new `MachineConfigPool` manifest that contains the `worker-dpdk` label in the `spec.machineConfigSelector` object:
+
.Example `MachineConfigPool` manifest
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  name: worker-dpdk
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker-dpdk
spec:
  machineConfigSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role
        operator: In
        values:
          - worker
          - worker-dpdk
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-dpdk: ""
----

. Create a `PerformanceProfile` manifest that applies to the labeled nodes and the machine config pool that you created in the previous steps. The performance profile specifies the CPUs that are isolated for DPDK applications and the CPUs that are reserved for house keeping.
+
.Example `PerformanceProfile` manifest
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
  name: profile-1
spec:
  cpu:
    isolated: 4-39,44-79
    reserved: 0-3,40-43
  hugepages:
    defaultHugepagesSize: 1G
    pages:
    - count: 32
      node: 0
      size: 1G
  net:
    userLevelNetworking: true
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-dpdk: ""
  numa:
    topologyPolicy: single-numa-node
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The compute nodes automatically restart after you apply the `MachineConfigPool` and `PerformanceProfile` manifests.
====

. Retrieve the name of the generated `RuntimeClass` resource from the `status.runtimeClass` field of the `PerformanceProfile` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get performanceprofiles.performance.openshift.io profile-1 -o=jsonpath='{.status.runtimeClass}{"\n"}'
----

. Set the previously obtained `RuntimeClass` name as the default container runtime class for the `virt-launcher` pods by adding the following annotation to the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate --overwrite -n openshift-cnv hco kubevirt-hyperconverged \
    kubevirt.kubevirt.io/jsonpatch='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/configuration/defaultRuntimeClass", "value": <runtimeclass_name>}]'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Adding the annotation to the `HyperConverged` CR changes a global setting that affects all VMs that are created after the annotation is applied.
Setting this annotation breaches support of the {VirtProductName} instance and must be used only on test clusters. For best performance, apply for a support exception.
====

. Create an `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` object with the `spec.deviceType` field set to `vfio-pci`:
+
.Example `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` manifest
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-1
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  resourceName: intel_nics_dpdk
  deviceType: vfio-pci
  mtu: 9000
  numVfs: 4
  priority: 99
  nicSelector:
    vendor: "8086"
    deviceID: "1572"
    pfNames:
      - eno3
    rootDevices:
      - "0000:19:00.2"
  nodeSelector:
    feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: "true"
