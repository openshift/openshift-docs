= Vertical scaling etcd cluster members

The Controller machine API manages vertical scaling in the etcd cluster. The Controller protects the cluster quorum by ensuring learners are in the ‘Ready but not running’ state for scaling up and scaling down by removing members that are pending deletion.

Scale up an etcd cluster by adding a member, which becomes a non-voting member called a _learner_. The _learner_ is promoted to a voting member only when it receives a complete snapshot from the leader.

Scale down an etcd cluster by removing an active member, which is scheduled for removal. The member is only removed when a replacement member is available. This action protects the etcd quorum and the cluster operation is maintained.
