= Vertical scaling etcd cluster members

Vertical scaling adds and removes etcd members in a cluster. This process maintains the quorum stability and prevents data loss and cluster unavailability.

Scale up an etcd cluster by adding a member, which becomes a non-voting member called a _learner_. The _learner_ is promoted to a voting member only when it receives a complete snapshot from the leader.

Scale down an etcd cluster by removing an active member, which is then scheduled for removal. The member is only removed when a replacement member is available. This action protects the etcd quorum and the cluster operation is maintained.

NOTE: New members cannot be added or removed from an etcd cluster if they are unhealthy. See _Replacing an unhealthy etcd member_ for more information.
