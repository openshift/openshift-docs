[id="olmv1-semver-support_{context}"]
= Support for semantic versioning

Support for link:https://semver.org/[semantic versioning (semver)] is enabled in {olmv1} by default. Operator and extension authors can use the semver standard to define compatible updates.

{olmv1-first} can use an Operator or extension's version number to determine if an update can be resolved successfully.

Cluster administrators can define a range of acceptable versions to install and automtically update. For Operators and extensions that follow the semver standard, you can use comparison strings to define to specify a desired version range.

[NOTE]
====
{olmv1} does not support automatic updates to the next major version. If you want to perform a major version update, you must verify and apply the update manually. For more information, see "Forcing an update or rollback".

== Major version zero releases

The semver standard specifies that major version zero releases (`O.y.z`) are reserved for initial development. During the initial development stage, the API is not stable and breaking changes might be introduced in any published version. As a result, major version zero releases apply a special set of update conditions.

.Update conditions for major version zero releases

* You cannot apply automatic updates when the major and minor versions are both zero, such as `0.0.*`. For example, automatic updates with the version range of `>=0.0.1 <0.1.0` are not allowed.
* You cannot apply automatic updates from one minor version to another within a major version zero release. For example, {olmv1} does not automatically apply an update from `0.1.0` to `0.2.0`.
* You can apply automatic updates from patch versions, such as `>=0.1.0 <0.2.0` or `>=0.2.0 <0.3.0`.

When an automatic update is blocked by {olmv1}, you must manually verify and force the update by editing the Operator or extension's custom resource (CR).
