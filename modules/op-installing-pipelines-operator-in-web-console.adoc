= Installing the {pipelines-title} Operator in web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can install the {pipelines-title} Operator by using the {OCP} web console to automatically configure the necessary custom resources (CRs) for your pipelines. This method provides a graphical interface to manage the installation and seamless upgrades of the Operator and its components.

The default Operator custom resource definition (CRD) `config.operator.tekton.dev` is now replaced by `tektonconfigs.operator.tekton.dev`.  In addition, the Operator provides the following additional CRDs to individually manage {pipelines-shortname} components:
 `tektonpipelines.operator.tekton.dev`, `tektontriggers.operator.tekton.dev` and `tektonaddons.operator.tekton.dev`.

If you have {pipelines-shortname} already installed on your cluster, the existing installation is seamlessly upgraded. The Operator will replace the instance of `config.operator.tekton.dev` on your cluster with an instance of `tektonconfigs.operator.tekton.dev` and additional objects of the other CRDs as necessary.

[WARNING]
====
If you manually changed your existing installation, such as, changing the target namespace in the `config.operator.tekton.dev` CRD instance by making changes to the `resource name - cluster` field, then the upgrade path is not smooth. In such cases, the recommended workflow is to uninstall your installation and reinstall the {pipelines-title} Operator.
====

The {pipelines-title} Operator now provides the option to select the components that you want to install by specifying profiles as part of the `TektonConfig` custom resource (CR). The Operator automatically installs the `TektonConfig` CR when you install the Operator.
The supported profiles are:

* Lite: This profile installs only Tekton Pipelines.
* Basic: This profile installs Tekton Pipelines, Tekton Triggers, {tekton-chains}, and {tekton-results}.
* All: This is the default profile used when you install the `TektonConfig` CR. This profile installs all of the Tekton components, including Tekton Pipelines, Tekton Triggers, {tekton-chains}, {tekton-results}, {pac}, and Tekton add-ons. Tekton add-ons includes the `ClusterTriggerBindings`, `ConsoleCLIDownload`, `ConsoleQuickStart`, and `ConsoleYAMLSample` resources, and the tasks and step action definitions available by using the cluster resolver from the `openshift-pipelines` namespace.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Use the *Filter by keyword* box to search for `{pipelines-title}` Operator in the catalog. Click the *{pipelines-title}* Operator tile.

. Read the brief description about the Operator on the *{pipelines-title}* Operator page. Click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:
+
.. Select *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* for the *Installation Mode*. This mode installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace, which enables the Operator to watch and be available to all namespaces in the cluster.

.. Select *Automatic* for the *Approval Strategy*. This ensures that the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically handles future upgrades to the Operator. If you select the *Manual* approval strategy, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve the OLM update request to update the Operator to the new version.

.. Select an *Update Channel*.

*** The `latest` channel enables installation of the most recent stable version of the {pipelines-title} Operator. Currently, it is the default channel for installing the {pipelines-title} Operator.
*** To install a specific version of the {pipelines-title} Operator, cluster administrators can use the corresponding `pipelines-<version>` channel. For example, to install the {pipelines-title} Operator version `1.8.x`, you can use the `pipelines-1.8` channel.
+
[NOTE]
====
Starting with {OCP} 4.11, the `preview` and `stable` channels for installing and upgrading the {pipelines-title} Operator are not available. However, in {OCP} 4.10 and earlier versions, you can use the `preview` and `stable` channels for installing and upgrading the Operator.
====

. Click *Install*. You will see the Operator listed on the *Installed Operators* page.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Operator installs automatically into the `openshift-operators` namespace.
====
+
. Verify that the *Status* displays *Succeeded Up to date*  to confirm successful installation of {pipelines-title} Operator.
+
[WARNING]
====
The success status might show as *Succeeded Up to date* even if installation of other components is in-progress. Therefore, it is important to verify the installation manually in the terminal.
====
+
. Verify that the {pipelines-title} Operator installed all components successfully. Login to the cluster on the terminal, and run the following command:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get tektonconfig config
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="attributes"]
----
NAME     VERSION                          READY   REASON
config   {pipelines-version-number}.0     True
----
+
If the *READY* condition is *True*, the Operator and its components installed successfully.
+
Additionally, check the components' versions by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get tektonpipeline,tektontrigger,tektonchain,tektonaddon,pac
