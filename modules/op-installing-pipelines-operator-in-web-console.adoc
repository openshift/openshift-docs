. On the *Install Operator* page:

  .. Select *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* for the *Installation Mode*. This mode installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace, which enables the Operator to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster.

  .. Select *Automatic* for the *Approval Strategy*. This ensures that the future upgrades to the Operator are handled automatically by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). If you select the *Manual* approval strategy, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve the OLM update request to update the Operator to the new version.
  .. Select an *Update Channel*.
    *** The *ocp-<4.x>* channel enables installation of the latest stable release of the {pipelines-title} Operator.
    *** The *preview* channel enables installation of the latest preview version of the {pipelines-title} Operator, which may contain features that are not yet available from the 4.x update channel.
+
    . Click *Install*. You will see the Operator listed on the *Installed Operators* page.

[NOTE]
====
The Operator is installed automatically into the `openshift-operators` namespace.
