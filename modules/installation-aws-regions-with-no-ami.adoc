ifndef::aws-china,aws-secret[]
You can deploy an {product-title} cluster to Amazon Web Services (AWS) regions
without native support for a {op-system-first} Amazon Machine Image (AMI) or the
AWS software development kit (SDK). If a
published AMI is not available for an AWS region, you can upload a custom AMI
prior to installing the cluster.

If you are deploying to a region not supported by the AWS SDK
and you do not specify a custom AMI, the installation program
copies the `us-east-1` AMI to the user account automatically. Then the
installation program creates the control plane machines with encrypted EBS
volumes using the default or user-specified Key Management Service (KMS) key.
This allows the AMI to follow the same process workflow as published {op-system}
AMIs.

A region without native support for an {op-system} AMI is not available to
select from the terminal during cluster creation because it is not published.
However, you can install to this region by configuring the custom AMI in the
`install-config.yaml` file.

ifdef::aws-china[Red Hat does not publish a {op-system-first} Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for the AWS China regions.]
ifdef::aws-secret[Red Hat does not publish a {op-system-first} Amzaon Machine Image for the AWS Secret and Top Secret Regions.]

Before you can install the cluster, you must:

* Upload a custom {op-system} AMI.
* Manually create the installation configuration file (`install-config.yaml`).
* Specify the AWS region, and the accompanying custom AMI, in the installation configuration file.

You cannot use the {product-title} installation program to create the installation configuration file. The installer does not list an AWS region without native support for an {op-system} AMI.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must also define a custom CA certificate in the `additionalTrustBundle` field of the `install-config.yaml` file because the AWS API requires a custom CA trust bundle. To allow the installation program to access the AWS API, the CA certificates must also be defined on the machine that runs the installation program. You must add the CA bundle to the trust store on the machine, use the `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable, or define the CA bundle in the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/setting-global-ca_bundle.html[`ca_bundle`] field of the AWS config file.
