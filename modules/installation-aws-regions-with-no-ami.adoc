[id="installation-aws-regions-with-no-ami_{context}"]
= AWS regions without a published {op-system} AMI

You can deploy an {product-title} cluster to Amazon Web Services (AWS) regions
without native support for a {op-system-first} Amazon Machine Image (AMI) or the
AWS software development kit (SDK). If a
published AMI is not available for an AWS region, you can upload a custom AMI
prior to installing the cluster. This is required if you are deploying your
cluster to an AWS government region.

If you are deploying to a non-government region that does not have a published
{op-system} AMI, and you do not specify a custom AMI, the installation program
copies the `us-east-1` AMI to the user account automatically. Then the
installation program creates the control plane machines with encrypted EBS
volumes using the default or user-specified Key Management Service (KMS) key.
This allows the AMI to follow the same process workflow as published {op-system}
AMIs.

A region without native support for an {op-system} AMI is not available to
select from the terminal during cluster creation because it is not published.
However, you can install to this region by configuring the custom AMI in the
`install-config.yaml` file.
