= Configuring vulnerability management report job retention settings

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure settings that determine when vulnerability report job requests expire and other retention settings for report jobs.

[NOTE]
====
These settings do not affect the following vulnerability report jobs:

* Jobs in the `WAITING` or `PREPARING` state (unfinished jobs)
* The last successful scheduled report job
* The last successful on-demand emailed report job
* The last successful downloadable report job
* Downloadable report jobs for which the report file has not been deleted by either manual deletion or by configuring the downloadable report pruning settings
====

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} web portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *System Configuration*. You can configure the following settings for vulnerability report jobs:
* *Vulnerability report run history retention*: The number of days that a record is kept of vulnerability report jobs that have been run. This setting controls how many days that report jobs are listed in the *All report jobs* tab under *Vulnerability Management* -> *Vulnerability Reporting* when a report configuration is selected. The entire report history after the exclusion date is deleted, with the exception of the following jobs:
** Unfinished jobs.
** Jobs for which prepared downloadable reports still exist in the system.
** The last successful report job for each job type (scheduled email, on-demand email, or download). This ensures users have information about the last run job for each type.
* *Prepared downloadable vulnerability reports retention days*: The number of days that prepared, on-demand downloadable vulnerability report jobs are available for download on the *All report jobs* tab under *Vulnerability Management* -> *Vulnerability Reporting* when a report configuration is selected.
* *Prepared downloadable vulnerability reports limit*: The limit, in MB, of space allocated to prepared downloadable vulnerability report jobs. After the limit is reached, the oldest report job in the download queue is removed.
. To change these values, click *Edit*, make your changes, and then click *Save*.
