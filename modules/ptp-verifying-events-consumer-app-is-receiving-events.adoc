[id="ptp-verifying-events-consumer-app-is-receiving-events_{context}"]
= Verifying that the PTP events consumer application is receiving events

Verify that the `cloud-event-proxy` container in the application pod is receiving PTP events.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have installed and configured the PTP Operator.

.Procedure

. Get the list of active `linuxptp-daemon` pods.
Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-ptp
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
linuxptp-daemon-2t78p   3/3     Running   0          8h
linuxptp-daemon-k8n88   3/3     Running   0          8h
----

. Access the metrics for the required consumer-side `cloud-event-proxy` container by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it <linuxptp-daemon> -n openshift-ptp -c cloud-event-proxy -- curl 127.0.0.1:9091/metrics
----
+
where:
+
<linuxptp-daemon>:: Specifies the pod you want to query, for example, `linuxptp-daemon-2t78p`.
