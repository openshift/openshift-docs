= Troubleshooting Loki rate limit errors

If the Log Forwarder API forwards a large block of messages that exceeds the rate limit to Loki, Loki generates rate limit (`429`) errors.

These errors can occur during normal operation. For example, when adding the {logging} to a cluster that already has some logs, rate limit errors might occur while the {logging} tries to ingest all of the existing log entries. In this case, if the rate of addition of new logs is less than the total rate limit, the historical data is eventually ingested, and the rate limit errors are resolved without requiring user intervention.

In cases where the rate limit errors continue to occur, you can fix the issue by modifying the `LokiStack` custom resource (CR).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `LokiStack` CR is not available on Grafana-hosted Loki. This topic does not apply to Grafana-hosted Loki servers.

.Conditions

* The Log Forwarder API is configured to forward logs to Loki.

* Your system sends a block of messages that is larger than 2 MB to Loki. For example:
+

----

* After you enter `oc logs -n openshift-logging -l component=collector`, the collector logs in your cluster show a line containing one of the following error messages:

.Procedure

* Update the `ingestionBurstSize` and `ingestionRate` fields in the `LokiStack` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
  name: logging-loki
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  limits:
    global:
      ingestion:
        ingestionBurstSize: 16 # <1>
        ingestionRate: 8 # <2>
# ...
----
<1> The `ingestionBurstSize` field defines the maximum local rate-limited sample size per distributor replica in MB. This value is a hard limit. Set this value to at least the maximum logs size expected in a single push request. Single requests that are larger than the `ingestionBurstSize` value are not permitted.
<2> The `ingestionRate` field is a soft limit on the maximum amount of ingested samples per second in MB. Rate limit errors occur if the rate of logs exceeds the limit, but the collector retries sending the logs. As long as the total average is lower than the limit, the system recovers and errors are resolved without user intervention.
