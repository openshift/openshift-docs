= Preparing your VPC to use with {product-title}

Using your own virtual private cloud (VPC) requires an AWS account, a configured VPC, and an attached internet gateway.

.Procedure

. Log in to your account on the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html[AWS Management Console].
. Create a VPC with the IP address of `10.0.0.0/16` and enable `dnsHostnames`. For more information, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-support[supported DNS values for the VPC in AWS].
. Create an internet gateway, and attach it to the VPC you created in the previous step.

Next, you must create subnets for the VPC and finish the configuration in OpenShift Console Management (OCM).
