= Compliance assessment and reporting by using RHACS

On the dashboard page, you can assess and report on the compliance of your containerized infrastructure and workloads with the applicable technical controls from a range of security and regulatory frameworks.

You can run out-of-the-box compliance scans based on the following industry standards:

* *Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks* for *Kubernetes*
* *Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act* (HIPAA)
* *National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-190*
* *NIST Special Publication 800-53*
* *Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard* (PCI DSS)
* *OpenShift Compliance Operator Profiles*
+
The Compliance Operator evaluates the compliance of both the {ocp} Kubernetes API resources and the nodes running the cluster. There are several profiles available as part of the Compliance Operator installation.
+
For more information about the available profiles, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html-single/security_and_compliance/index#compliance-operator-supported-profiles[Supported compliance profiles].

By scanning your environment based on these standards, you can:

* Evaluate your infrastructure for regulatory compliance.
* Harden your Kubernetes orchestrator.
* Understand and manage the overall security posture of your environment.
* Get a detailed overview of the compliance status of clusters, namespaces, and nodes.
