= Technology Preview restrictions for platform Operators

During the Technology Preview release of the platform Operators feature in {product-title} 4.12, the following restrictions determine whether an Operator can be installed through the platform Operators mechanism:

* Kubernetes manifests must be packaged using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) `registry+v1` bundle format.
* The Operator cannot declare package or group/version/kind (GVK) dependencies.
* The Operator cannot specify cluster service version (CSV) install modes other than `AllNamespaces`
* The Operator cannot specify any `Webhook` or `APIService` definitions.
* All package bundles must be in the `redhat-operators` catalog source.

After considering these restrictions, the following Operators can be successfully installed:
