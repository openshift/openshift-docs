= Isolating Project Networks

.Prerequisites

* The `Multitenant` SDN plug-in must be enabled in your cluster.


.Procedure

* To isolate the projects in the cluster, run the
following command:
+
----
$ oc adm pod-network isolate-projects <project1> <project2>
----
+
Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

In the above example, all of the pods and services in `<project1>` and
`<project2>` can _not_ access any pods and services from other non-global
projects in the cluster. The other non-global
projects in the cluster can _not_ access any pods and services from
`<project1>` and `<project2>`.
