= Installing the Compliance Operator on ROSA hosted control planes (HCP)

As of the Compliance Operator 1.5.0 release, the Operator is tested against {product-rosa} using {hcp-capital}.

{product-rosa} {hcp-capital} clusters have restricted access to the control plane, which is managed by Red{nbsp}Hat. By default, the Compliance Operator will schedule to nodes within the `master` node pool, which is not available in {product-rosa} {hcp-capital} installations. This requires you to configure the `Subscription` object in a way that allows the Operator to schedule on available node pools. This step is necessary for a successful installation on {product-rosa} {hcp-capital} clusters.

.Prerequisites

* You must have `admin` privileges.
* You must have a `StorageClass` resource configured.

.Procedure

. Define a `Namespace` object:
+
.Example `namespace-object.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged <1>
  name: openshift-compliance
----
<1> In {product-title} {product-version}, the pod security label must be set to `privileged` at the namespace level.

. Create the `Namespace` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f namespace-object.yaml
----

. Define an `OperatorGroup` object:
+
.Example `operator-group-object.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-compliance
----

. Create the `OperatorGroup` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f operator-group-object.yaml
----

. Define a `Subscription` object:
+
.Example `subscription-object.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator-sub
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  channel: "stable"
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: compliance-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  config:
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: "" <1>
----
<1> Update the Operator deployment to deploy on `worker` nodes.

. Create the `Subscription` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f subscription-object.yaml
----

.Verification

. Verify that the installation succeeded by running the following command to inspect the cluster service version (CSV) file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csv -n openshift-compliance
----

. Verify that the Compliance Operator is up and running by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deploy -n openshift-compliance
----
