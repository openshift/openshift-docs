= Reissuing internal certificates for Central

You can maintain a secure communication between Central and other {rh-rhacs-first} components by reissuing the internal certificates.

.Prerequisites

* You have `write` permission for the `Administration` resource.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, click the link in the banner that announces the certificate expiration to download a YAML configuration file, which contains a new secret. The secret includes the certificate and key values.
. To apply the new YAML configuration file to the cluster where you have installed Central, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <secret_file.yaml>
----

. To apply the changes, restart Central.
