= Disabling guest memory overhead accounting

WARNING: This procedure is only useful in certain use-cases and should
only be attempted by advanced users.

A small amount of memory is requested by each virtual machine instance in 
addition to the amount that you request. This additional memory is used for 
the infrastructure wrapping each *VirtualMachineInstance* process.

Though it is not usually advisable, it is possible to increase the VMI
density on the node by disabling guest memory overhead accounting.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster running {product-title} 3.11 or newer

.Procedure

To disable guest memory overhead accounting, edit the YAML configuration
file and set the `overcommitGuestOverhead` value to `true`. This parameter is 
disabled by default.

----
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  template:
    domain:
    resources:
        overcommitGuestOverhead: true
        requests:
          memory: 1024M
----

[NOTE]
====
If `overcommitGuestOverhead` is enabled, it adds the guest overhead
to memory limits (if present).
