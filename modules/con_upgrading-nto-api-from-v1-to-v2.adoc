= Upgrading Node Tuning Operator API from v1alpha1 or v1 to v2

[role="_abstract"]
When you upgrade to v2 API, existing v1 and v1alpha1 performance profiles are automatically converted using a webhook that adds the globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing field set to true.

When upgrading from an older Node Tuning Operator API version, the existing v1 and v1alpha1 performance profiles are converted using a conversion webhook that injects the `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` field with a value of `true`.
