[id="selecting-billing-account-cli_{context}"]
= Selecting the AWS billing account for {product-title} during cluster deployment using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
When deploying your cluster using {rosa-cli}, you must select the correct AWS billing account.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that you have the most recent ROSA command-line interface (CLI) and AWS CLI installed and have completed the {product-title} prerequisites covered in the previous section. See link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/104179[Help with ROSA CLI setup] and link:https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[Instructions to install the AWS CLI] for more information.

.Procedure
. Initiate the cluster deployment using the `rosa create cluster` command. You can click the *copy* button on the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/rosa/getstarted[Set up Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) console page] and paste the command in your terminal. This launches the cluster creation process in interactive mode:

. To use a custom AWS profile, one of the non-default profiles specified in your `~/.aws/credentials`, you can add the `–profile <profile_name>` selector to the rosa create cluster command so that the command looks like rosa create cluster `–profile stage`. If no AWS CLI profile is specified using this option, the default AWS CLI profile will determine the AWS infrastructure profile into which the cluster is deployed. The billing AWS profile is selected in one of the following steps.

. When deploying a {product-title} cluster, the billing AWS account needs to be specified:

* Only AWS accounts that are linked to the user's logged in Red{nbsp}Hat account are shown.
* The specified AWS account is charged for using the {product-title} service.
* An indicator shows if the {product-title} contract is enabled or not enabled for a given AWS billing account.
** If you select an AWS billing account that shows the _Contract enabled_ label, on-demand consumption rates are charged only after the capacity of your pre-paid contract is consumed.
** AWS accounts without the _Contract enabled_ label are charged the applicable on-demand consumption rates.
