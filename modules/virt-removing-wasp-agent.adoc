= Removing the wasp-agent component

[role="_abstract"]
If you no longer need memory overcommitment, you can remove the `wasp-agent` component and associated resources from your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the cluster with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Revert the memory overcommitment configuration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-cnv patch HyperConverged/kubevirt-hyperconverged \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/higherWorkloadDensity"}]'
----

. Delete the `MachineConfig` that provisions swap memory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete machineconfig 90-worker-swap
----

.Verification

* Confirm that swap is no longer enabled on a node, by running the following command and observing the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<selected_node> -- free -m
----
+
Ensure that the `Swap:` row shows `0` or that no swap space shows as provisioned.
