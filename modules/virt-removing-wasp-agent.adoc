= Removing the wasp-agent component

If you no longer need memory overcommitment, you can remove the `wasp-agent` component and associated resources from your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Remove the `wasp-agent` DaemonSet:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete daemonset wasp-agent -n wasp
----

. If deployed, remove the alerting rules:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete prometheusrule wasp-rules -n wasp
----

. Optionally, delete the `wasp` namespace if no other resources depend on it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete namespace wasp
----

. Revert the memory overcommitment configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-cnv patch HyperConverged/kubevirt-hyperconverged \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/higherWorkloadDensity"}]'
----

. Delete the `MachineConfig` that provisions swap memory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete machineconfig 90-worker-swap
----

. Delete the associated `KubeletConfig`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete kubeletconfig custom-config
----

. Wait for the worker nodes to reconcile:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait mcp worker --for condition=Updated=True --timeout=-1s
----

.Verification

* Confirm that the `wasp-agent` DaemonSet is removed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get daemonset -n wasp
----
+
No `wasp-agent` should be listed.

* Confirm that swap is no longer enabled on a node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<selected_node> -- free -m
----
+
Ensure that the `Swap:` row shows `0` or that no swap space shows as provisioned.
