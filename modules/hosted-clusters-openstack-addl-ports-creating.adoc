= Creating additional ports for node pools

You can configure additional ports for node pools for hosted clusters that run on {rh-openstack-first}.

.Prerequisites

* You created a hosted cluster.
* You have access to the management cluster.
* The `hcp` CLI is installed.
* Additional networks are created in {rh-openstack}.
* The project that is used by the hosted cluster must have access to the additional networks.
* You reviewed the options that are listed in "Options for additional ports for node pools".

.Procedure

* Create a hosted cluster with additional ports attached to it by running the `hcp create nodepool openstack` command with the `--openstack-node-additional-port` options. For example:
+

$ hcp create nodepool openstack \
