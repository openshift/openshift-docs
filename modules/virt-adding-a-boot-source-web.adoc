= Adding a boot source for a virtual machine template

A boot source can be configured for any virtual machine template that you want to use for creating virtual machines or custom templates. When  virtual machine templates are configured with a boot source, they are labeled *Available* in the *Templates* tab.

.Procedure

. In the {VirtProductName} console, click *Workloads* -> *Virtualization* from the side menu.

. Click the *Templates* tab.

. Identify the virtual machine template for which you want to configure a boot source and click *Add source*.

. In the *Add boot source to template* window, click *Select boot source*, select a method for creating a persistent volume claim (PVC): *Upload local file*, *Import via URL*, *Clone existing PVC*, or *Import via Registry*.

.. Optional: Click *Mount this as a CD-ROM boot source* to add an additional disk and mount the disk as a CD-ROM.

. Enter a value for *Persistent Volume Claim size* to specify the PVC size that is adequate for the uncompressed image and any additional space that is required.

.. Optional: Enter a name for *Source provider* to associate the name with this template.

.. Advanced: Click *Storage class* and select the storage class that is used to create the disk.

.. Advanced: Click *Access mode* and select an access mode for the persistent volume. Supported access modes are: *Single User (RWO)*, *Shared Access (RWX)*, and *Read Only (ROX)*.

.. Advanced: Click *Volume mode* if you want to select *Block* instead of the default value *Filesystem*.

. Select the appropriate method to save your boot source:

.. Click *Save and upload* if you uploaded a local file.

.. Click *Save and import* if you imported content from a URL or the registry.

.. Click *Save and clone* if you cloned an existing PVC.

Your custom virtual machine template with a boot source is listed in the *Templates* tab, and you can create virtual machines by using this template.
