= Adding a boot source for a virtual machine template

A boot source can be configured for any virtual machine template that you want to use for creating virtual machines or custom templates. When virtual machine templates are configured with a boot source, they are labeled *Available* in the *Templates* tab. After you add a boot source to a template, you can create a new virtual machine from the template.

There are four methods for selecting and adding a boot source in the web console:

* *Upload local file (creates PVC)*
* *Import via URL (creates PVC)*
* *Clone existing PVC (creates PVC)*
* *Import via Registry (creates PVC)*

.Prerequisites
* To add a boot source, you must be logged in as a user with the `os-images.kubevirt.io:edit` RBAC role or as an administrator. You do not need special privileges to create a virtual machine from a template with a boot source added.

* To upload a local file, the operating system image file must exist on your local machine.

* To import via URL, access to the web server with the operating system image is required. For example: the Red Hat Enterprise Linux web page with images.

* To clone an existing PVC, access to the project with a PVC is required.

* To import via registry, access to the container registry is required.

.Procedure

. In the {VirtProductName} console, click *Workloads* -> *Virtualization* from the side menu.

. Click the *Templates* tab.

. Identify the virtual machine template for which you want to configure a boot source and click *Add source*.

. In the *Add boot source to template* window, click *Select boot source*, select a method for creating a persistent volume claim (PVC): *Upload local file*, *Import via URL*, *Clone existing PVC*, or *Import via Registry*.

. Optional: Click *This is a CD-ROM boot source* to mount a CD-ROM and use it to install the operating system on to an empty disk. The additional empty disk is automatically created and mounted by {VirtProductName}. If the additional disk is not needed, you can remove it when you create the virtual machine.

. Enter a value for *Persistent Volume Claim size* to specify the PVC size that is adequate for the uncompressed image and any additional space that is required.

.. Optional: Enter a name for *Source provider* to associate the name with this template.

.. Optional: *Advanced Storage settings*: Click *Storage class* and select the storage class that is used to create the disk. Typically, this storage class is the default storage class that is created for use by all PVCs.

.. Optional: *Advanced Storage settings*: Click *Access mode* and select an access mode for the persistent volume:

* *Single User (RWO)* mounts the volume as read-write by a single node.
* *Shared Access (RWX)* mounts the volume as read-write by many nodes.
* *Read Only (ROX)* mounts the volume as read-only by many nodes.

.. Optional: *Advanced Storage settings*: Click *Volume mode* if you want to select *Block* instead of the default value *Filesystem*. {VirtProductName} can statically provision raw block volumes. These volumes do not have a file system, and can provide performance benefits for applications that either write to the disk directly or implement their own storage service.

. Select the appropriate method to save your boot source:

.. Click *Save and upload* if you uploaded a local file.

.. Click *Save and import* if you imported content from a URL or the registry.

.. Click *Save and clone* if you cloned an existing PVC.

Your custom virtual machine template with a boot source is listed in the *Templates* tab, and you can create virtual machines by using this template.
