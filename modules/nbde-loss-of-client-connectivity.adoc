= Planning for a loss of client network connectivity

The loss of network connectivity to an individual node will cause it to become unable to boot in an unattended fashion.

If you are planning work that might cause a loss of network connectivity,
you can reveal the passphrase for an onsite technician to use manually,
and then rotate the keys afterwards to invalidate it:

.Procedure

. Before the network becomes unavailable, show the password used in the first slot `-s 1` of device `/dev/vda2` with this command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo clevis luks pass -d /dev/vda2 -s 1
----

. Invalidate that value and regenerate a new random boot-time passphrase with this command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo clevis luks regen -d /dev/vda2 -s 1
----
