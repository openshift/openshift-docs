= Uninstalling the HyperShift Operator

To uninstall the HyperShift Operator and disable the `hypershift-addon` from the `local-cluster`, complete the following steps:

.Procedure

. Run the following command to ensure that there is no hosted cluster running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get hostedcluster -A
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If a hosted cluster is running, the HyperShift Operator does not uninstall, even if the `hypershift-addon` is disabled.
====

. Disable the `hypershift-addon` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch mce multiclusterengine --type=merge -p \// <1>
  '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift-local-hosting","enabled": false}]}}}'
----
+
<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`, but you can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your cluster by running the following command: `$ oc get mce`.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also disable the `hypershift-addon` for the `local-cluster` from the {mce-short} console after disabling the `hypershift-addon`.
