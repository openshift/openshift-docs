= Overview of OperatorHub

_OperatorHub_ is available via the {product-title} web console and is the
interface that cluster administrators use to discover and install Operators.
With one click, an Operator can be pulled from their off-cluster source,
installed and subscribed on the cluster, and made ready for engineering teams to
self-service manage the product across deployment environments using the
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

Cluster administrators can choose from OperatorSources grouped into
the following categories:

[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Category |Description

|Red Hat Operators
|Red Hat products packaged and shipped by Red Hat. Supported by Red Hat.

|Certified Operators
|Products from leading independent software vendors (ISVs). Red Hat partners with
ISVs to package and ship. Supported by the ISV.

|Community Operators
|Optionally-visible software maintained by relevant representatives in the
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators[operator-framework/community-operators]
GitHub repository. No official support.

|Custom Operators
|Operators you add to the cluster yourself.
If you have not added any Custom Operators, the Custom category does not appear in
the web console on your OperatorHub.

OperatorHub content automatically refreshes every 60 minutes.

Operators on OperatorHub are packaged to run on OLM. This includes a YAML
file called a ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) containing all of the CRDs, RBAC
rules, Deployments, and container images required to install and securely run the
Operator. It also contains user-visible information like a description of its
features and supported Kubernetes versions.

The Operator SDK can be used to assist developers packaging their Operators for
use on OLM and OperatorHub. If you have a commercial application that you
want to make accessible to your customers, get it included using the
certification workflow provided by Red Hat's ISV partner portal at
link:https://connect.redhat.com[connect.redhat.com].
