= About OperatorHub

_OperatorHub_ is the web console interface in {product-title} that cluster administrators use to discover and install Operators. With one click, an Operator can be pulled from its off-cluster source, installed and subscribed on the cluster, and made ready for engineering teams to self-service manage the product across deployment environments using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

Cluster administrators can choose from catalogs grouped into the following categories:

Operators on OperatorHub are packaged to run on OLM. This includes a YAML file called a ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) containing all of the CRDs, RBAC rules, Deployments, and container images required to install and securely run the Operator. It also contains user-visible information like a description of its features and supported Kubernetes versions.

The Operator SDK can be used to assist developers packaging their Operators for use on OLM and OperatorHub. If you have a commercial application that you want to make accessible to your customers, get it included using the certification workflow provided by Red Hat's ISV partner portal at link:https://connect.redhat.com[connect.redhat.com].
