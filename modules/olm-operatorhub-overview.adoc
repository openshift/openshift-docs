= Overview of the OperatorHub

The _OperatorHub_ is available via the {product-title} web console and is the
interface that cluster administrators use to discover and install Operators.
With one click, an Operator can be pulled from their off-cluster source,
installed and subscribed on the cluster, and made ready for engineering teams to
self-service manage the product across deployment environments using the
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

Cluster administrators can choose from OperatorSources grouped into
the following categories:

[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Category |Description

|Red Hat Operators
|Red Hat products packaged and shipped by Red Hat. Supported by Red Hat.

|Certified Operators
|Products from leading independent software vendors (ISVs). Red Hat partners with
ISVs to package and ship. Supported by the ISV.

|Community Operators
|Optionally-visible software maintained by relevant representatives in the
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators[operator-framework/community-operators]
GitHub repository. No official support.

|Custom Operators
|Operators you add to the cluster yourself.
If you have not added any Custom Operators, the Custom category does not appear in
the web console on your OperatorHub.
|===

Operators on the OperatorHub are packaged to run on OLM. This includes a YAML
file called a ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) containing all of the CRDs, RBAC
rules, Deployments, and container images required to install and securely run the
Operator. It also contains user-visible information like a description of its
features and supported Kubernetes versions.

The Operator SDK can be used to assist developers packaging their Operators for
use on OLM and the OperatorHub. If you have a commercial application that you
want to make accessible to your customers, get it included using the
certification workflow provided by Red Hat's ISV partner portal at
link:https://connect.redhat.com[connect.redhat.com].
