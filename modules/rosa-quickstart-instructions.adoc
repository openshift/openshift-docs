If you have already installed the required prerequisites, here are the commands you need to create a cluster.

[source, terminal]
----
## Configures your AWS account and ensures everything is setup correctly
$ rosa init

## Starts the cluster creation process (~30-40minutes) and watches the logs
$ rosa create cluster --cluster-name <cluster_name> --watch

## Connect your IDP to your cluster
$ rosa create idp --cluster <cluster_name> --interactive

## Promotes a user from your IDP to dedicated-admin level
$ rosa grant user dedicated-admin --user <idp_user_name> --cluster <cluster_name>

## Checks if your install is ready (look for State: Ready),
## and provides your Console URL to login to the web console.
$ rosa describe cluster <cluster_name>
