= Configuring manually assigned egress IP addresses for a namespace

In {product-title} you can associate one or more egress IP addresses with a namespace.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Update the `NetNamespace` object by specifying the following JSON
object with the desired IP addresses:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 $ oc patch netnamespace <project_name> --type=merge -p \
  '{
    "egressIPs": [
      "<ip_address>"
    ]
  }'
----
+
--
where:

`<project_name>`:: Specifies the name of the project.
`<ip_address>`:: Specifies one or more egress IP addresses for the `egressIPs` array.
--
+
For example, to assign the `project1` project to the IP addresses `192.168.1.100` and `192.168.1.101`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch netnamespace project1 --type=merge \
  -p '{"egressIPs": ["192.168.1.100","192.168.1.101"]}'
----
+
To provide high availability, set the `egressIPs` value to two or more IP addresses on different nodes. If multiple egress IP addresses are set, then pods use all egress IP addresses roughly equally.
+
[NOTE]
====
Because OpenShift SDN manages the `NetNamespace` object, you can make changes only by modifying the existing `NetNamespace` object. Do not create a new `NetNamespace` object.
====

. Manually assign the egress IP address to the node hosts.
+
If your cluster is installed on public cloud infrastructure, you must confirm that the node has available IP address capacity.
+
Set the `egressIPs` parameter on the `HostSubnet` object on the node host. Using the following JSON, include as many IP addresses as you want to assign to that node host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch hostsubnet <node_name> --type=merge -p \
  '{
    "egressIPs": [
      "<ip_address>",
      "<ip_address>"
      ]
  }'
----
+
--
where:

`<node_name>`:: Specifies a node name.
`<ip_address>`:: Specifies an IP address. You can specify more than one IP address for the `egressIPs` array.
--
+
For example, to specify that `node1` should have the egress IPs `192.168.1.100`,
`192.168.1.101`, and `192.168.1.102`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch hostsubnet node1 --type=merge -p \
  '{"egressIPs": ["192.168.1.100", "192.168.1.101", "192.168.1.102"]}'
----
+
In the previous example, all egress traffic for `project1` will be routed to the node hosting the specified egress IP, and then connected through Network Address Translation (NAT) to that IP address.
