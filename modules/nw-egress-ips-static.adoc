= Configuring manually assigned egress IP addresses for a namespace

In {product-title} you can associate one or more egress IP addresses with a namespace.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Update the `NetNamespace` resource by specifying the following JSON
object with the desired IP addresses:
+
----
$ oc patch netnamespace <project> --type=merge -p \ <1>
  '{
    "egressIPs": [ <2>
      "<ip_address>"
      ]
  }'
----
<1> Specify the name of the project.
<2> Specify one or more egress IP addresses. The `egressIPs` parameter is an
array.
+
For example, to assign the `project1` project to an IP address of
`192.168.1.100`:
+
----
$ oc patch netnamespace project1 --type=merge \
  -p '{"egressIPs": ["192.168.1.100"]}'
----
+
You can set `egressIPs` to two or more IP addresses on different nodes to
provide high availability. If multiple egress IP addresses are set, pods use the
first IP in the list for egress, but if the node hosting that IP address fails,
pods switch to using the next IP in the list after a short delay.

. Manually assign the egress IP to the node hosts. Set the `egressIPs` parameter
on the `HostSubnet` object on the node host. Using the following JSON, include
as many IPs as you want to assign to that node host:
+
----
$ oc patch hostsubnet <node_name> --type=merge -p \ <1>
  '{
    "egressIPs": [ <2>
      "<ip_address_1>",
      "<ip_address_N>"
      ]
  }'
----
<1> Specify the name of the project.
<2> Specify one or more egress IP addresses. The `egressIPs` field is an array.
+
For example, to specify that `node1` should have the egress IPs `192.168.1.100`,
`192.168.1.101`, and `192.168.1.102`:
+
----
$ oc patch hostsubnet node1 --type=merge -p \
  '{"egressIPs": ["192.168.1.100", "192.168.1.101", "192.168.1.102"]}'
----
+
In the previous example, all egress traffic for `project1` will be routed to the
node hosting the specified egress IP, and then connected (using NAT) to that IP
address.
