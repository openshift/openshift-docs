----
<1> A selector that describes the pods to which the policy applies. The policy object can only select pods in the project that defines the `NetworkPolicy` object. In this documentation, it would be the project in which the Network Observability Operator is installed, which is the `netobserv` project.
<2> A selector that matches the pods from which the policy object allows ingress traffic. The default is that the selector matches pods in the same namespace as the `NetworkPolicy`.
<3> When the `namespaceSelector` is specified, the selector matches pods in the specified namespace.
