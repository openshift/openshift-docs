= Managing proxy certificates

Proxy certificates allow users to specify one or more custom certificate authority (CA) certificates that are used by platform components when making egress connections.

[NOTE]
====
Certain CAs set expiration dates and you might need to renew these certificates every two years.
====

If you did not originally set the requested certificates, you can determine the certificate expiration in several ways.
Most Cloud-native Network Functions (CNFs) use certificates that are not specifically designed for browser-based connectivity.
Therefore, you need to pull the certificate from the `ConfigMap` object of your deployment.

.Procedure

* To get the expiration date, run the following command against the certificate file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in <cert_file_name>.pem
----

For more information about determining how and when to renew your proxy certificates, see "Proxy certificates" in _Security and compliance_.
