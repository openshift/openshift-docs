= When to use MetalLB

Using MetalLB is valuable when you have a bare-metal cluster, or an infrastructure that is like bare metal, and you want fault-tolerant access to an application through an external IP address.

You must configure your networking infrastructure to ensure that network traffic for the external IP address is routed from clients to the host network for the cluster.

After deploying MetalLB with the MetalLB Operator, when you add a service of type `LoadBalancer`, MetalLB provides a platform-native load balancer. 

When external traffic enters your {product-title} cluster through a MetalLB `LoadBalancer` service, the return traffic to the client has the external IP address of the load balancer as the source IP.

MetalLB operating in layer2 mode provides support for failover by utilizing a mechanism similar to IP failover. However, instead of relying on the virtual router redundancy protocol (VRRP) and keepalived, MetalLB leverages a gossip-based protocol to identify instances of node failure. When a failover is detected, another node assumes the role of the leader node, and a gratuitous ARP message is dispatched to broadcast this change.

MetalLB operating in layer3 or border gateway protocol (BGP) mode delegates failure detection to the network. The BGP router or routers that the {product-title} nodes have established a connection with will identify any node failure and terminate the routes to that node.

Using MetalLB instead of IP failover is preferable for ensuring high availability of pods and services.
