If you are using a firewall to control egress traffic from {product-title}, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the certain domain and port combinations below. {product-title} requires this access to provide a fully managed OpenShift service.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured an Amazon S3 gateway endpoint in your AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This endpoint is required to complete requests from the cluster to the Amazon S3 service. 

.Procedure

. Allowlist the following URLs that are used to download and install packages and tools:
+
[cols="6,1,6",options="header"]
|===
|Domain | Port | Function
|`quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`cdn01.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`cdn02.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`cdn03.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`quayio-production-s3.s3.amazonaws.com`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`registry.redhat.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`registry.access.redhat.com`
|443
|Required. Hosts all the container images that are stored on the Red{nbsp}Hat Ecosytem Catalog. Additionally, the registry provides access to the `odo` CLI tool that helps developers build on OpenShift and Kubernetes.

|`access.redhat.com`
|443
|Required. Hosts a signature store that a container client requires for verifying images when pulling them from `registry.access.redhat.com`. 

|`mirror.openshift.com`
|443
|Required. Used to access mirrored installation content and images. This site is also a source of release image signatures, although the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) needs only a single functioning source.
|===
+
. Allowlist the following telemetry URLs:
+
[cols="6,1,6",options="header"]
|===
|Domain | Port | Function
|`infogw.api.openshift.com`
|443
|Required for telemetry.

|`console.redhat.com`
|443
|Required. Allows interactions between the cluster and OpenShift Console Manager to enable functionality, such as scheduling upgrades.

|`sso.redhat.com`
|443
|Required. The `https://console.redhat.com/openshift` site uses authentication from `sso.redhat.com` to download the pull secret and use Red{nbsp}Hat SaaS solutions to facilitate monitoring of your subscriptions, cluster inventory, chargeback reporting, etc.
|===
+
Managed clusters require enabling telemetry to allow Red{nbsp}Hat to react more quickly to problems, better support the customers, and better understand how product upgrades impact clusters.
For more information about how remote health monitoring data is used by Red{nbsp}Hat, see _About remote health monitoring_ in the _Additional resources_ section.

. Allowlist the following Amazon Web Services (AWS) API URls:
+
[cols="6,1,6",options="header"]
|===
|Domain | Port | Function

|`sts.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com` ^[1]^
|443
|Required. Used to access the AWS Secure Token Service (STS) regional endpoint. Ensure that you replace `<aws-region>` with the region that your cluster is deployed in.

|`sts.amazonaws.com` ^[2]^
|443
|See footnote. Used to access the AWS Secure Token Service (STS) global endpoint.
|===

1. This can also be accomplished by configuring a private interface endpoint in your AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to the regional AWS STS endpoint.
2. The AWS STS global endpoint is only required to be allowed if you are running a version of OpenShift before 4.14.18 or 4.15.4. ROSA HCP version 4.14.18+, 4.15.4+, and 4.16.0+ use the AWS STS regional endpoint.
--
+

. Allowlist the following URLs for optional third-party content:
+
[cols="6,1,6",options="header"]
|===
|Domain | Port | Function
|`registry.connect.redhat.com`
| 443
| Optional. Required for all third-party-images and certified operators.

|`rhc4tp-prod-z8cxf-image-registry-us-east-1-evenkyleffocxqvofrk.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
| 443
| Optional. Provides access to container images hosted on `registry.connect.redhat.com`.

|`oso-rhc4tp-docker-registry.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
| 443
| Optional. Required for Sonatype Nexus, F5 Big IP operators.
|===

. Allowlist any site that provides resources for a language or framework that your builds require.
. Allowlist any outbound URLs that depend on the languages and frameworks used in OpenShift. See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2998411[OpenShift Outbound URLs to Allow] for a list of recommended URLs to be allowed on the firewall or proxy.
