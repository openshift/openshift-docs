[id="rosa-hcp-firewall-prerequisites_{context}"]
= Firewall prerequisites

* If you are using a firewall to control egress traffic from {product-title}, your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) must be able to complete requests from the cluster to the Amazon S3 service, for example, via an Amazon S3 gateway.

* You must also configure your firewall to grant access to the following domain and port combinations.
//TODO OSDOCS-11789: From your deploy machine? From your cluster?

== Domains for installation packages and tools
[cols="6,1,6",options="header"]
|===
|Domain | Port | Function
|`quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`cdn01.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`cdn02.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`cdn03.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`cdn04.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`cdn05.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`cdn06.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`quayio-production-s3.s3.amazonaws.com`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`registry.redhat.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`registry.access.redhat.com`
|443
|Required. Hosts all the container images that are stored on the Red{nbsp}Hat Ecosytem Catalog. Additionally, the registry provides access to the `odo` CLI tool that helps developers build on OpenShift and Kubernetes.

|`access.redhat.com`
|443
|Required. Hosts a signature store that a container client requires for verifying images when pulling them from `registry.access.redhat.com`. 

|`api.openshift.com`
|443
|Required. Used to check for available updates to the cluster.

|`mirror.openshift.com`
|443
|Required. Used to access mirrored installation content and images. This site is also a source of release image signatures, although the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) needs only a single functioning source.

== Domains for telemetry
[cols="6,1,6",options="header"]
|===
|Domain | Port | Function
|`infogw.api.openshift.com`
|443
|Required for telemetry.

|`console.redhat.com`
|443
|Required. Allows interactions between the cluster and OpenShift Console Manager to enable functionality, such as scheduling upgrades.

|`sso.redhat.com`
|443
|Required. The `https://console.redhat.com/openshift` site uses authentication from `sso.redhat.com` to download the pull secret and use Red{nbsp}Hat SaaS solutions to facilitate monitoring of your subscriptions, cluster inventory, chargeback reporting, etc.
|===

Managed clusters require enabling telemetry to allow Red{nbsp}Hat to react more quickly to problems, better support the customers, and better understand how product upgrades impact clusters.
For more information about how remote health monitoring data is used by Red{nbsp}Hat, see _About remote health monitoring_.

== Domains for Amazon Web Services (AWS) APIs
[cols="6,1,6",options="header"]
|===
|Domain | Port | Function

|`sts.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com` ^[1]^
|443
|Required. Used to access the AWS Secure Token Service (STS) regional endpoint. Ensure that you replace `<aws-region>` with the region that your cluster is deployed in.
|===

== Domains for your workload

Your workload may require access to other sites that provide resources for programming languages or frameworks.

* Allow access to sites that provide resources required by your builds.
* Allow access to outbound URLs required for your workload, for example, link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2998411[OpenShift Outbound URLs to Allow].

== Optional domains to enable third-party content
[cols="6,1,6",options="header"]
