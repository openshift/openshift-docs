= Enabling IPv6 connectivity to pods on {rh-openstack}

To enable IPv6 connectivity between pods that have additional networks that are on different nodes, disable port security for the IPv6 port of the server. Disabling port security obviates the need to create allowed address pairs for each IPv6 address that is assigned to pods and enables traffic on the security group.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only the following IPv6 additional network configurations are supported:

* SLAAC and host-device
* SLAAC and MACVLAN
* DHCP stateless and host-device
* DHCP stateless and MACVLAN
====

.Procedure

* On a command line, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack port set --no-security-group --disable-port-security <compute_ipv6_port>
----
+
IMPORTANT: This command removes security groups from the port and disables port security. Traffic restrictions are removed entirely from the port.

where:

<compute_ipv6_port>:: Specifies the IPv6 port of the compute server.
