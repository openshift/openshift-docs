= Diagnosing a duplicate MAC address when provisioning a new host in the cluster

If the MAC address of an existing bare-metal node in the cluster matches the MAC address of a bare-metal host you are attempting to add to the cluster, the Bare Metal Operator associates the host with the existing node. If the host enrollment, inspection, cleaning, or other Ironic steps fail, the Bare Metal Operator retries the installation continuously. A registration error is displayed for the failed bare-metal host.

You can diagnose a duplicate MAC address by examining the bare-metal hosts that are running in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace.

.Prerequisites

* Install an {product-title} cluster on bare metal.
* Install the {product-title} CLI `oc`.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

To determine whether a bare-metal host that fails provisioning has the same MAC address as an existing node, do the following:

. Get the bare-metal hosts running in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get bmh -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                 STATUS   PROVISIONING STATUS      CONSUMER
openshift-master-0   OK       externally provisioned   openshift-zpwpq-master-0
openshift-master-1   OK       externally provisioned   openshift-zpwpq-master-1
openshift-master-2   OK       externally provisioned   openshift-zpwpq-master-2

. To see more detailed information about the status of the failing host, run the following command replacing `<bare_metal_host_name>` with the name of the host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n openshift-machine-api bmh <bare_metal_host_name> -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
