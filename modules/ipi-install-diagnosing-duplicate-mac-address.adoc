= Diagnosing a duplicate MAC address when provisioning a new host in the cluster

[role="_abstract"]
If the MAC address of an existing bare metal node in the cluster matches the MAC address of a bare metal host you are attempting to add to the cluster, the Ironic installation Operator associates the bare metal host with the existing node. If the host enrollment, inspection, cleaning, or other Ironic steps fail, the `metal3-baremetal-operator` continuously retries the install. The Operator displays a registration error for the failed bare metal host. You can diagnose a duplicate MAC address by examining the `metal3-baremetal-operator` log.

.Prerequisites

* Install a {product-title} cluster on bare metal.
* Install the {product-title} CLI `oc`.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

To determine whether a bare metal host that fails provisioning has a duplicate MAC address, do the following:

. Get the pods running in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cluster-autoscaler-operator-77c59896d5-vrc5l   2/2     Running   1          20d
machine-api-controllers-69d94b9d85-qtrnf       7/7     Running   1          20d
machine-api-operator-6899f4c5d6-n9zh2          2/2     Running   1          20d
metal3-7cbcc4b66b-2rkrl                        8/8     Running   0          20d
----

. Copy the full name of the metal3 pod, for example `metal3-7cbcc4b66b-2rkrl`.
. Get the `metal3-baremetal-operator` log from the metal3 pod and check if a "MAC address already exists" error exists for the host you are trying to provision:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-machine-api logs metal3-7cbcc4b66b-2rkrl metal3-baremetal-operator
----
+
.Example log entry
[source,terminal]
----
... A port with MAC address b4:96:91:1d:7c:20 already exists ...
----
