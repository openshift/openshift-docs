= Secrets for signing data in {tekton-chains}

[role="_abstract"]
Cluster administrators can generate a key pair and use {tekton-chains} to sign artifacts by using a Kubernetes secret. For {tekton-chains} to work, a private key and a password for encrypted keys must exist as part of the `signing-secrets` secret in the `openshift-pipelines` namespace.

Currently, {tekton-chains} supports the `x509` and `cosign` signature schemes.

[NOTE]
====
Use only one of the supported signature schemes.
====

* To use the `x509` signing scheme with {tekton-chains}, you must fulfill the following requirements:

** Store the private key in the `signing-secrets` with the `x509.pem` structure.
** Store the private key as an unencrypted `PKCS #8` Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) file.
** The key is of `ed25519` or `ecdsa` type.

* To use the `cosign` signing scheme with {tekton-chains}, you must fulfill the following requirements:

** Store the private key in the `signing-secrets` with the `cosign.key` structure.
** Store the password in the `signing-secrets` with the `cosign.password` structure.
** Store the private key as an encrypted PEM file of type `ENCRYPTED COSIGN PRIVATE KEY`.
