= Testing S2I images

As an Source-to-Image (S2I) builder image author, you can test your S2I image
locally and use the {product-title} build system for automated testing and
continuous integration.

S2I requires the
`assemble` and `run` scripts to be present in order to successfully run
the S2I build. Providing the `save-artifacts` script reuses the build
artifacts, and providing the `usage` script ensures that usage information is
printed to console when someone runs the container image outside of the S2I.

The goal of testing an S2I image is to make sure that all of these described
commands work properly, even if the base container image has changed or the tooling
used by the commands was updated.

[id="testing-requirements_{context}"]
== Understanding testing requirements
The standard location for the `test` script is `test/run`. This script is
invoked by the {product-title} S2I image builder and it could be a simple Bash
script or a static Go binary.

The `test/run` script performs the S2I build, so you must have the S2I binary
available in your `$PATH`. If required, follow the installation instructions
in the
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/README.md#installation[S2I
README].

S2I combines the application source code and builder image, so in order to test
it you need a sample application source to verify that the source successfully
transforms into a runnable container image. The sample application should be simple,
but it should exercise the crucial steps of `assemble` and `run` scripts.

[id="generating-scripts-and-tools_{context}"]
== Generating scripts and tools
The S2I tooling comes with powerful generation tools to speed up the process of
creating a new S2I image. The `s2i create` command produces all the necessary S2I
scripts and testing tools along with the `Makefile`:

[source,termnal]
----
$ s2i create _<image name>_ _<destination directory>_
----

The generated `test/run` script must be adjusted to be
useful, but it provides a good starting point to begin developing.

[NOTE]
====
The `test/run` script produced by the `s2i create` command requires that the sample application sources are inside the `test/test-app` directory.

[id="testing-locally_{context}"]

== Testing locally
The easiest way to run the S2I image tests locally is to use the generated
`Makefile`.

If you did not use the `s2i create` command, you can copy the
following `Makefile` template and replace the `IMAGE_NAME` parameter with
your image name.

.Sample `Makefile`
----
IMAGE_NAME = openshift/ruby-20-centos7
CONTAINER_ENGINE := $(shell command -v podman 2> /dev/null | echo docker)

build:
	${CONTAINER_ENGINE} build -t $(IMAGE_NAME) .

.PHONY: test
test:
	${CONTAINER_ENGINE} build -t $(IMAGE_NAME)-candidate .
	IMAGE_NAME=$(IMAGE_NAME)-candidate test/run
----

[id="basic-testing-workflow_{context}"]

== Basic testing workflow
The `test` script assumes you have already built the image you want to
test. If required, first build the S2I image. Run one of the following commands:

* If you use Podman, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman build -t <builder_image_name>
----

* If you use Docker, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker build -t <builder_image_name>
----

The following steps describe the default workflow to test S2I image builders:

. Verify the `usage` script is working:
+
* If you use Podman, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run <builder_image_name> .
----

* If you use Docker, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker run <builder_image_name> .
----

. Build the image:
+
[source,terminal]
[options="nowrap"]
----
$ s2i build file:///path-to-sample-app _<BUILDER_IMAGE_NAME>_ _<OUTPUT_APPLICATION_IMAGE_NAME>_
----

. Optional: if you support `save-artifacts`, run step 2 once again to
verify that saving and restoring artifacts works properly.

. Run the container:
+
* If you use Podman, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run <output_application_image_name>
----

* If you use Docker, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker run <output_application_image_name>
----

. Verify the container is running and the application is responding.

Running these steps is generally enough to tell if the builder image is
working as expected.


[id="using-openshift-for-building-the-image_{context}"]

== Using {product-title} for building the image
Once you have a `Dockerfile` and the other artifacts that make up your new
S2I builder image, you can put them in a git repository and use {product-title}
to build and push the image.  Simply define a Docker build that points
to your repository.

If your {product-title} instance is hosted on a public IP address, the build can
be triggered each time you push into your S2I builder image GitHub repository.

You can also use the `ImageChangeTrigger` to trigger a rebuild of your applications that are
based on the S2I builder image you updated.
