[role="_abstract"]
To control traffic flow and enhance cluster security, enable network policies and custom rules for the {cert-manager-operator}.

To enable network policy and custom rules, see the following example:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: CertManager
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNetworkPolicy: "true"
----

To allow egress access to all external issuer providers, see the following example:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: CertManager
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNetworkPolicy: "true"
  networkPolicies:
  - name: allow-egress-to-all
    componentName: CoreController
    egress:
     - {}
----

To allow the cert-manager Operator controller to perform the ACME challenge self-check, see the following example. This process requires connections to the ACME provider, DNS API endpoints, and recursive DNS servers.

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: CertManager
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNetworkPolicy: "true"
  networkPolicies:
  - name: allow-egress-to-acme-server
    componentName: CoreController
    egress:
    - ports:
      - port: 80
        protocol: TCP
      - port: 443
        protocol: TCP
  - name: allow-egress-to-dns-service
    componentName: CoreController
    egress:
    - ports:
      - port: 53
        protocol: UDP
      - port: 53
        protocol: TCP
