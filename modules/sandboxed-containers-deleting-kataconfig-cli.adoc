= Deleting the KataConfig custom resource using the CLI

Remove and uninstall the `kata` runtime and all its related resources, such as CRI-O config and `RuntimeClass`, from your cluster. The deletion typically takes between ten to forty minutes, depending on the size of the deployment.

.Prerequisites

* You have {product-title} {product-version} installed on your cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Delete the `KataConfig` custom resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete kataconfig <KataConfig_CR_Name>
----

. Delete the `KataConfig` custom resource definition by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete crd kataconfigs.kataconfiguration.openshift.io
----

The {sandboxed-containers-operator} removes all resources that were initially created to enable the runtime on your cluster.

.Verification

* To verify that the `KataConfig` custom resource is deleted, run the following command:
