= Deleting the KataConfig custom resource using the CLI

Remove and uninstall the `kata` runtime and all its related resources, such as CRI-O config and `RuntimeClass`, from your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have {product-title} {product-version} installed on your cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deleting the `KataConfig` CR automatically reboots the worker nodes. The reboot can take from 10 to more than 60 minutes. Factors that impede reboot time are as follows:

* A larger {product-title} deployment with a greater number of worker nodes.
* Activation of the BIOS and Diagnostics utility.
* Deployment on a hard drive rather than an SSD.
* Deployment on physical nodes such as bare metal, rather than on virtual nodes.
* A slow CPU and network.
====

.Procedure

. Delete the `KataConfig` custom resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete kataconfig <KataConfig_CR_Name>
----

The {sandboxed-containers-operator} removes all resources that were initially created to enable the runtime on your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
During deletion, the CLI stops responding until all worker nodes reboot. Wait for the process to complete before performing the verification or continuing to the next procedure.
====

.Verification

* To verify that the `KataConfig` custom resource is deleted, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kataconfig <KataConfig_CR_Name>
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
No KataConfig instances exist
----
