= Creating the migration plan using YAML manifests

You can create a migration plan using YAML. However, it is recommended to create a migration plan in the {mtc-first} web console.

.Procedure

. To migrate the `mig-vm` namespace, ensure that the `namespaces` field of the migration plan includes `mig-vm`.
. Modify the contents of the migration plan by adding `mig-vm` to the namespaces.

kind: MigPlan
metadata:
  name: live-migrate-plan
  namespace: openshift-migration
spec:
  namespaces:

...
----
<1> Add `mig-vm` to the namespaces.

* To attempt a live storage migration, the `liveMigrate` field in the migration plan specification must be set to true, and `KubeVirt` must be configured, and be enabled to perform live storage migration.

Staging the migration plan skips any running virtual machines and does not sync the data. Any stopped virtual machine disks are synced.
