= About IAM resources for clusters that use STS

To deploy a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS), you must create the following AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) resources:

* Specific account-wide IAM roles and policies that provide the STS permissions required for ROSA support, installation, control plane and compute functionality. This includes account-wide Operator policies.
* Cluster-specific Operator IAM roles that permit the ROSA cluster Operators to carry out core OpenShift functionality.
* An OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that the cluster Operators use to authenticate.

This document provides reference information about the IAM resources that you must deploy when you create a ROSA cluster that uses STS. It also includes the `aws` CLI commands that are generated when you use `manual` mode with the `rosa create` command.
