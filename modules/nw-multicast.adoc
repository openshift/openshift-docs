= Joining Project Networks

.Prerequisites

* The `Multitenant` SDN plug-in must be enabled in your cluster.


.Procedure

* Use the following command to join projects to an existing project network:
+
----
$ oc adm pod-network join-projects --to=<project1> <project2> <project3>
----

In the above example, all the pods and services in `<project2>` and `<project3>`
can now access any pods and services in `<project1>` and vice versa. Services
can be accessed either by IP or fully qualified DNS name
(`<service>.<pod_namespace>.svc.cluster.local`).

For example, to access a
service named `db` in a project `myproject`, use `db.myproject.svc.cluster.local`.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

Use the following command to view the pod-networks that you have joined
together:

----
$ oc get netnamespaces
----

Then look at the *NETID* column. Projects in the same pod-network will have the
same NetID.
