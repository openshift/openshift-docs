= Overview of CSI volume snapshots

A snapshot represents the state of the storage volume in a cluster at a particular point in time. VolumeSnapshots can be used to provision a new volume or to restore an existing volume to a previous state.

{product-title} supports CSI volume snapshots by default. However, a specific CSI driver is required.

With CSI volume snapshots, a cluster administrator can:

* Deploy a third-party CSI driver that supports snapshots.
* Create a new persistent volume claim (PVC) from an existing volume snapshot.
* Take a snapshot of an existing PVC.
* Restore a snapshot as a different PVC.
* Delete an existing volume snapshot.

With CSI volume snapshots, an app developer can:

* Use the CSI snapshot sidecar in {product-title} to run their third-party CSI driver of choice.
* Use volume snapshots as building blocks for developing application- or cluster-level storage backup solutions.
* Rapidly rollback to a previous development version.
* Use storage more efficiently by not having to make a full copy each time.

Be aware of the following when using VolumeSnapshot:

* Support is only available for CSI drivers. In-tree and FlexVolumes are not supported.
* {product-title} does not ship with any CSI drivers. It is recommended to use the CSI drivers provided by
link:https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html[community or storage vendors]. Follow the installation instructions provided by the CSI driver.
* CSI drivers may or may not have implemented the volume snapshot functionality. CSI drivers that have provided support for VolumeSnapshots will likely use csi-external-snapshotter. See documentation provided by the CSI driver for details.
* {product-title} {product-version} supports version 1.1.0 of the
link:https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec[CSI specification].
