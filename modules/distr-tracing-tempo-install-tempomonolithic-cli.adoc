= Installing a TempoMonolithic instance by using the CLI

:FeatureName: The TempoMonolithic instance
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

You can install a TempoMonolithic instance from the command line.

.Prerequisites

* An active {oc-first} session by a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.
+
[TIP]
====
* Ensure that your {oc-first} version is up to date and matches your {product-title} version.

* Run `oc login`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --username=<your_username>
----
====

.Procedure

. Run the following command to create a project of your choice for the TempoMonolithic instance that you will create in a subsequent step:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
  name: <project_of_tempomonolithic_instance>
EOF
----

. Decide which type of supported storage you will use for storing traces: in-memory storage, a Persistent Volume, or object storage.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Object storage is not included with the {TempoShortName} and requires setting up an object store by a supported provider: link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation[Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation], link:https://min.io/[MinIO], link:https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3], link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/[Azure Blob Storage], or link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Google Cloud Storage].

Additionally, opting for object storage requires creating a secret for your object storage bucket in the project that you created for the TempoMonolithic instance. You can do this by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f - << EOF
<object_storage_secret>
EOF
----

For more information, see "Object storage setup".

--
====

. Create a TempoMonolithic instance in the project that you created for it.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can create multiple TempoMonolithic instances in separate projects on the same cluster.
====
+
.. Customize the `TempoMonolithic` custom resource (CR).
+
include::snippets/distr-tracing-tempo-tempomonolithic-custom-resource.adoc[]

.. Apply the customized CR by running the following command.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f - << EOF
<TempoMonolithic_custom_resource>
EOF
----

.Verification

. Verify that the `status` of all TempoMonolithic `components` is `Running` and the `conditions` are `type: Ready` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get tempomonolithic.tempo.grafana.com <metadata_name_of_TempoMonolithic_CR> -o yaml
----

. Run the following command to verify that the pod of the TempoMonolithic instance is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----

. Access the Jaeger UI:

.. Query the route details for the `tempo-<metadata_name_of_TempoMonolithic_CR>-jaegerui` route by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get route
----

.. Open `\https://<route_from_previous_step>` in a web browser.

. When the pod of the TempoMonolithic instance is ready, you can send traces to the `tempo-<metadata_name_of_TempoMonolithic_CR>:4317` (OTLP/gRPC) and `tempo-<metadata_name_of_TempoMonolithic_CR>:4318` (OTLP/HTTP) endpoints inside the cluster.
+
The Tempo API is available at the `tempo-<metadata_name_of_TempoMonolithic_CR>:3200` endpoint inside the cluster.
