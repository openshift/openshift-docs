= Support considerations for ROSA clusters with STS

The supported way of creating a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS) is by using the steps described in this product documentation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can use `manual` mode with the ROSA CLI (`rosa`) to generate the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy files and `aws` commands that are required to install the STS resources.

The files and `aws` commands are generated for review purposes only and must not be modified in any way. Red{nbsp}Hat cannot provide support for ROSA clusters that have been deployed by using modified versions of the policy files or `aws` commands.
