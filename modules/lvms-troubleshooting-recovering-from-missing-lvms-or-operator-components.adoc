= Recovering from a missing storage class

If you encounter the `storage class not found` error, check the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) and ensure that all the {lvms-first} pods are in the `Running` state. 

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You have logged in to the {oc-first} as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure

. Verify that the `LVMCluster` CR is present by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get lvmcluster -n openshift-storage
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME            AGE
my-lvmcluster   65m
----

. If the `LVMCluster` CR is not present, create an `LVMCluster` CR. For more information, see "Ways to create an LVMCluster custom resource".

. In the `openshift-storage` namespace, check that all the {lvms} pods are in the `Running` state by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-storage
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
lvms-operator-7b9fb858cb-6nsml        3/3     Running   0             70m
topolvm-controller-5dd9cf78b5-7wwr2   5/5     Running   0             66m
topolvm-node-dr26h                    4/4     Running   0             66m
vg-manager-r6zdv                      1/1     Running   0             66m
----
+
The output of this command must contain a running instance of the following pods:

* `lvms-operator`
* `vg-manager`
* `topolvm-controller`
* `topolvm-node`
+
If the `topolvm-node` pod is stuck in the `Init` state, it is due to a failure to locate an available disk for {lvms} to use. To retrieve the necessary information to troubleshoot this issue, review the logs of the `vg-manager` pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -l app.kubernetes.io/component=vg-manager -n openshift-storage
----
