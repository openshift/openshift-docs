= Recovering from missing LVMS or Operator components

If you encounter a storage class "not found" error, check the `LVMCluster` resource and ensure that all the logical volume manager storage (LVMS) pods are running. You can create an `LVMCluster` resource if it does not exist.

.Procedure

. Verify the presence of the LVMCluster resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get lvmcluster -n openshift-storage
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME            AGE
my-lvmcluster   65m
----

. If the cluster does not have an `LVMCluster` resource, create one by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n openshift-storage -f <custom_resource> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<custom_resource>` with a custom resource URL or file tailored to your requirements.
+
.Example custom resource
[source,yaml,options="nowrap",role="white-space-pre"]
----
apiVersion: lvm.topolvm.io/v1alpha1
kind: LVMCluster
metadata:
  name: my-lvmcluster
spec:
  storage:
    deviceClasses:
    - name: vg1
      default: true
      thinPoolConfig:
        name: thin-pool-1
        sizePercent: 90
        overprovisionRatio: 10
----

. Check that all the pods from LVMS are in the `Running` state in the `openshift-storage` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-storage
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
lvms-operator-7b9fb858cb-6nsml        3/3     Running   0             70m
topolvm-controller-5dd9cf78b5-7wwr2   5/5     Running   0             66m
topolvm-node-dr26h                    4/4     Running   0             66m
vg-manager-r6zdv                      1/1     Running   0             66m
----
+
The expected output is one running instance of `lvms-operator` and `vg-manager`. One instance of `topolvm-controller` and `topolvm-node` is expected for each node.
+
If `topolvm-node` is stuck in the `Init` state, there is a failure to locate an available disk for LVMS to use. To retrieve the information necessary to troubleshoot, review the logs of the `vg-manager` pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -l app.kubernetes.io/component=vg-manager -n openshift-storage
