[discrete]
== Disk storage for the IBM Power guest virtual machines

* Local storage, or storage provisioned by the Virtual I/O Server using vSCSI, NPIV (N-Port ID Virtualization) or SSP (shared storage pools)

[discrete]
== Network for the PowerVM guest virtual machines

* Dedicated physical adapter, or SR-IOV virtual function
* Available by the Virtual I/O Server using Shared Ethernet Adapter
* Virtualized by the Virtual I/O Server using IBM vNIC

[discrete]
== Storage / main memory

* 100 GB / 16 GB for {product-title} control plane machines
* 100 GB / 8 GB for {product-title} compute machines
* 100 GB / 16 GB for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine
