= Minimum IBM Power requirements

You can install {product-title} version {product-version} on the following IBM hardware:

* IBM Power9 or Power10 processor-based systems

[NOTE]
====
Support for {op-system} functionality for all IBM POWER8 models, IBM POWER9 AC922, IBM POWER9 IC922, and IBM POWER9 LC922 is deprecated. These hardware models remain fully supported in {product-title} 4.12. However, Red Hat recommends that you use later hardware models.
