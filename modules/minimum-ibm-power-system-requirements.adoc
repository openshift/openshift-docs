= Minimum IBM Power requirements

You can install {product-title} version {product-version} on the following IBM hardware:

* IBM Power9 or Power10 processor-based systems

[NOTE]
====
Support for {op-system} functionality for all IBM Power8 models, IBM Power AC922, IBM Power IC922, and IBM Power LC922 is deprecated in {product-title} {product-version}. Red Hat recommends that you use later hardware models.
