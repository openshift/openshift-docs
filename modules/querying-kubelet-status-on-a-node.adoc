= Querying the kubelet's status on a node

You can review cluster node health status, resource consumption statistics, and node logs. Additionally, you can query `kubelet` status on individual nodes.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Your API service is still functional.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. The kubelet is managed using a systemd service on each node. Review the kubelet's status by querying the `kubelet` systemd service within a debug pod.
.. Start a debug pod for a node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/my-node
----
+
.. Set `/host` as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host's root file system in `/host` within the pod. By changing the root directory to `/host`, you can run binaries contained in the host's executable paths:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# chroot /host
----
+
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} cluster nodes running {op-system-first} are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Accessing cluster nodes using SSH is not recommended and nodes will be tainted as _accessed_. However, if the {product-title} API is not available, or `kubelet` is not properly functioning on the target node, `oc` operations will be impacted. In such situations, it is possible to access nodes using `ssh core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` instead.
====
+
.. Check whether the `kubelet` systemd service is active on the node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl is-active kubelet
----
+
.. Output a more detailed `kubelet.service` status summary:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# systemctl status kubelet
----
