= Using the Node Feature Discovery Operator

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator orchestrates all resources needed to run the Node-Feature-Discovery daemon set by watching for a `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR. Based on the `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR, the Operator will create the operand (NFD) components in the desired namespace. You can edit the CR to choose another `namespace`, `image`, `imagePullPolicy`, and `nfd-worker-conf`, among other options.

As a cluster administrator, you can create a `NodeFeatureDiscovery` instance using the {product-title} CLI or the web console.

[id="create-cd-cli_{context}"]
== Create a NodeFeatureDiscovery instance using the CLI

As a cluster administrator, you can create a `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR instance using the CLI.

.Prerequisites

* An {product-title} cluster
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Install the NFD Operator.

.Procedure

. Create the following `NodeFeatureDiscovery` Custom Resource (CR), and then save the YAML in the `NodeFeatureDiscovery.yaml` file:
