= Configuring the scale-to-zero grace period

This setting specifies an upper bound time limit that Knative waits for scale-from-zero machinery to be in place before the last replica of an application is removed.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving on your cluster.
* You have cluster administrator permissions.
* You are using the default Knative Pod Autoscaler. The scale to zero feature is not available if you are using the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

.Procedure

* Modify the `scale-to-zero-grace-period` spec in the `KnativeServing` CR:
+
