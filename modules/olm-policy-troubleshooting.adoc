= Troubleshooting permission failures

If an Operator installation fails due to lack of permissions, identify the
errors using the following procedure.

.Procedure

. Review the Subscription object. Its status has an object reference
`installPlanRef` that points to the InstallPlan object that attempted to create
the necessary [Cluster]Role[Binding](s) for the Operator:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: etcd
  namespace: scoped
status:
  installPlanRef:
    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
    kind: InstallPlan
    name: install-4plp8
    namespace: scoped
    resourceVersion: "117359"
    uid: 2c1df80e-afea-11e9-bce3-5254009c9c23
----

. Check the status of the InstallPlan object for any errors:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: InstallPlan
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2019-07-26T21:13:10Z"
    lastUpdateTime: "2019-07-26T21:13:10Z"
    message: 'error creating clusterrole etcdoperator.v0.9.4-clusterwide-dsfx4: clusterroles.rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:scoped:scoped" cannot create resource
      "clusterroles" in API group "rbac.authorization.k8s.io" at the cluster scope'
    reason: InstallComponentFailed
    status: "False"
    type: Installed
  phase: Failed
----
+
The error message tells you:
+
* The type of resource it failed to create, including the API group of the
resource. In this case, it was `clusterroles` in the `rbac.authorization.k8s.io`
group.
* The name of the resource.
* The type of error: `is forbidden` tells you that the user does not have enough
permission to do the operation.
* The name of the user who attempted to create or update the resource. In this
case, it refers to the service account specified in the OperatorGroup.
* The scope of the operation: `cluster scope` or not.
+
The user can add the missing permission to the service account and then iterate.

OLM does not currently provide the complete list of errors on the first try,
but may be added in a future release.
