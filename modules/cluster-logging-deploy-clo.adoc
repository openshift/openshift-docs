= Install the Cluster Logging Operator using the web console

You can use the {product-title} web console to install the Cluster Logging Operator.  

.Procedure

To install the Cluster Logging Operator using the {product-title} web console:

. Create a Namespace for the Cluster Logging Operator:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Home* -> *Projects*.

.. Click *Create Project*.

.. Enter `openshift-logging` in the *Name* and *Display Name* fields.

.. Optional: Enter a description.

.. Click *Create*.

.. On the *Project Details* page, click *YAML*.

.. Replace the YAML shown on the page with the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-logging
  annotations:
    openshift.io/node-selector: ""
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-logging: "true"
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
----

.. Click *Save*.

. Install the Cluster Logging Operator:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose  *Cluster Logging* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.

.. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page, under *A specific Namespace on the cluster* select *openshift-logging*.
Then, click *Subscribe*.

. Verify that the Cluster Logging Operator installed:

.. Switch to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *Cluster Logging* is listed in the *openshift-logging* project with a *Status* of *InstallSucceeded*.
+
[NOTE]
====
During installation an Operator might display a *Failed* status. If the Operator then installs with an *InstallSucceeded* message,
you can safely ignore the *Failed* message.
====
+
If the Operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:
+
* Switch to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page and inspect
the *Status* column for any errors or failures.
* Switch to the *Workloads* → *Pods* page and check the logs in any Pods in the
`openshift-logging` and `openshift-operators-redhat` projects that are reporting issues.

. Create a cluster logging instance:

.. Switch to the *Administration* -> *Custom Resource Definitions* page.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click *ClusterLogging*.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definition Overview* page, select *View Instances* from the *Actions* menu.

.. On the *Cluster Loggings* page, click *Create Cluster Logging*.
+
You might have to refresh the page to load the data.

.. In the YAML field, replace the code with the following:
+
[NOTE]
====
This default cluster logging configuration should support a wide array of environments. Review the topics on tuning and
configuring the cluster logging components for information on modifications you can make to your cluster logging cluster.

<2> The cluster logging management state. In most cases, if you change the default cluster logging defaults, you must set this to `Unmanaged`.
However, an unmanaged deployment does not receive updates until the cluster logging is placed back into a managed state. For more information, see *Changing cluster logging management state*.

====
The maximum number of Elasticsearch master nodes is three. If you specify a `nodeCount` greater than `3`, {product-title} creates three Elasticsearch nodes that are Master-eligible nodes, with the master, client, and data roles. The additional Elasticsearch nodes are created as Data-only nodes, using client and data roles. Master nodes perform cluster-wide actions such as creating or deleting an index, shard allocation, and tracking nodes. Data nodes hold the shards and perform data-related operations such as CRUD, search, and aggregations. Data-related operations are I/O-, memory-, and CPU-intensive. It is important to monitor these resources and to add more Data nodes if the current nodes are overloaded.

For example, if `nodeCount=4`, the following nodes are created:

----
$ oc get deployment

cluster-logging-operator       1/1     1            1           18h
elasticsearch-cd-x6kdekli-1    0/1     1            0           6m54s
elasticsearch-cdm-x6kdekli-1   1/1     1            1           18h
elasticsearch-cdm-x6kdekli-2   0/1     1            0           6m49s
elasticsearch-cdm-x6kdekli-3   0/1     1            0           6m44s
----

The number of primary shards for the index templates is equal to the number of Elasticsearch data nodes.
====

.. Click *Create*. This creates the Cluster Logging Custom Resource and Elasticsearch Custom Resource, which you
can edit to make changes to your cluster logging cluster.

. Verify the install:

.. Switch to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page.

.. Select the *openshift-logging* project.
