= Defining webhooks in a CSV

The ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) resource includes a `webhookdefinitions` section
to define validating and mutating admission webhooks that ship with an Operator.
For example:

.CSV containing a validating admission webhook
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterServiceVersion
metadata:
  annotations:
    description: |-
      An example CSV that contains a webhook
  name: example-webhook.v1.0.0
  namespace: placeholder
spec:
  webhookdefinitions:
  - generateName: example.webhook.com
    type: ValidatingAdmissionWebhook
    deploymentName: "example-webhook-deployment"
    containerPort: 443
    sideEffects: "None"
    failurePolicy: "Ignore"
    admissionReviewVersions:
    - "v1"
    - "v1beta1"
    rules:
    - operations:
      - "CREATE"
      apiGroups:
      - ""
      apiVersions:
      - "v1"
      resources:
      - "configmaps"
    objectSelector:
      foo: bar
    webhookPath: "/validate"
...
----

OLM requires that you define the following:

* The `type` field must be set to either `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` or
`MutatingAdmissionWebhook`, or the CSV will be placed in a failed phase. * The
CSV must contain a Deployment whose name is equivalent to the value supplied in
the `deploymentName` field of the `webhookdefinition`.

When the webhook is created, OLM ensures that the webhook only acts upon
namespaces that match the OperatorGroup that the Operator is deployed in.
