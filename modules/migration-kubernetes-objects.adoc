= Performing a state migration of Kubernetes objects by using the {mtc-short} API

After you migrate all the PV data, you can use the Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) API to perform a one-time state migration of Kubernetes objects that constitute an application.

You do this by configuring `MigPlan` custom resource (CR) fields to provide a list of Kubernetes resources with an additional label selector to further filter those resources, and then performing a migration by creating a `MigMigration` CR. The `MigPlan` resource is closed after the migration.

[NOTE]
====
Selecting Kubernetes resources is an API-only feature. You must update the `MigPlan` CR and create a `MigMigration` CR for it by using the CLI. The {mtc-short} web console does not support migrating Kubernetes objects.
====

[NOTE]
====
After migration, the `closed` parameter of the `MigPlan` CR is set to `true`. You cannot create another `MigMigration` CR for this `MigPlan` CR.
====

You add Kubernetes objects to the `MigPlan` CR by using one of the following options:

* Adding the Kubernetes objects to the `includedResources` section. When the `includedResources` field is specified in the `MigPlan` CR, the plan takes a list of `group-kind` as input. Only resources present in the list are included in the migration.
* Adding the optional `labelSelector` parameter to filter the `includedResources` in the `MigPlan`. When this field is specified, only resources matching the label selector are included in the migration. For example, you can filter a list of `Secret` and `ConfigMap` resources by using the label `app: frontend` as a filter.

.Procedure

. Update the `MigPlan` CR to include Kubernetes resources and, optionally, to filter the included resources by adding the `labelSelector` parameter:

.. To update the `MigPlan` CR to include Kubernetes resources:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: migration.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: MigPlan
metadata:
  name: <migplan>
  namespace: openshift-migration
spec:
  includedResources:
  - kind: <kind> <1>
    group: ""
  - kind: <kind>
    group: ""
----
<1> Specify the Kubernetes object, for example, `Secret` or `ConfigMap`.

.. Optional: To filter the included resources by adding the `labelSelector` parameter:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: migration.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: MigPlan
metadata:
  name: <migplan>
  namespace: openshift-migration
spec:
  includedResources:

    group: ""
  - kind: <kind>
    group: ""
...
  labelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      <label> <2>
----
<1> Specify the Kubernetes object, for example, `Secret` or `ConfigMap`.
<2> Specify the label of the resources to migrate, for example, `app: frontend`.

. Create a `MigMigration` CR to migrate the selected Kubernetes resources. Verify that the correct `MigPlan` is referenced in `migPlanRef`:
+
[source,yaml]
