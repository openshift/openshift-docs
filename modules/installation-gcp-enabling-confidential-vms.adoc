= Enabling Confidential VMs

You can use Confidential VMs when installing your cluster. Confidential VMs encrypt data while it is being processed. For more information, see Google's documentation on link:https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing[Confidential Computing]. You can enable Confidential VMs and Shielded VMs at the same time, although they are not dependent on each other.

[NOTE]
====
Confidential VMs are currently not supported on 64-bit ARM architectures.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have created an `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

* Use a text editor to edit the `install-config.yaml` file prior to deploying your cluster and add one of the following stanzas:
.. To use confidential VMs for only control plane machines:
+
[source,yaml]
----
controlPlane:
  platform:
    gcp:
       confidentialCompute: Enabled <1>
       type: n2d-standard-8 <2>
       onHostMaintenance: Terminate <3>
----
<1> Enable confidential VMs.
<2> Specify a machine type that supports Confidential VMs. Confidential VMs require the N2D or C2D series of machine types. For more information on supported machine types, see link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/confidential-vm/docs/os-and-machine-type#machine-type[Supported operating systems and machine types].
<3> Specify the behavior of the VM during a host maintenance event, such as a hardware or software update. For a machine that uses Confidential VM, this value must be set to `Terminate`, which stops the VM. Confidential VMs do not support live VM migration.
+
.. To use confidential VMs for only compute machines:
+
[source,yaml]
----
compute:
- platform:
    gcp:
       confidentialCompute: Enabled
       type: n2d-standard-8
       onHostMaintenance: Terminate
----
+
.. To use confidential VMs for all machines:
+
[source,yaml]
----
platform:
  gcp:
    defaultMachinePlatform:
       confidentialCompute: Enabled
       type: n2d-standard-8
       onHostMaintenance: Terminate
