= Configuring high availability replicas for Knative Eventing

High availability (HA) is available by default for the Knative Eventing `eventing-controller`, `eventing-webhook`, `imc-controller`, `imc-dispatcher`, and `mt-broker-controller` components, which are configured to have two replicas each by default. You can change the number of replicas for these components by modifying the `spec.high-availability.replicas` value in the `KnativeEventing` custom resource (CR).

[NOTE]
====
For Knative Eventing, the `mt-broker-filter` and `mt-broker-ingress` deployments are not scaled by HA. If multiple deployments are needed, scale these components manually.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing are installed on your cluster.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp-product-title} web console *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *OperatorHub* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Select the `knative-eventing` namespace.

. Click *Knative Eventing* in the list of *Provided APIs* for the {ServerlessOperatorName} to go to the *Knative Eventing* tab.

. Click *knative-eventing*, then go to the *YAML* tab in the *knative-eventing* page.

. Modify the number of replicas in the `KnativeEventing` CR:

.Example YAML
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: KnativeEventing
metadata:
  name: knative-eventing
  namespace: knative-eventing
spec:
  high-availability:
    replicas: 3

. You can also specify the number of replicas for a specific workload.

[NOTE]
====
Workload-specific configuration overrides the global setting for Knative Eventing.
