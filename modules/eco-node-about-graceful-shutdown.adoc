Concept topic on graceful shutdown of nodes.

Explain graceful shutdown and the shutdown grace period.

For advanced users, graceful shutdown of nodes gives admins the ability to specify a termination grace period so that workloads that should not be interrupted have time to complete.
This is a tool these users can employ to help keep their work loads running even if there is an unexpected shutdown request.
How long to set the termination period is based on the users knowledge of their system and workloads. For example, there may be relationships between workloads that the user should be aware of. If, for example, one pod is running a workload and another is monitoring the workload, the user will want both to continue until the workload completes.
Users can tag workloads to specify the order of shut down - check if this is already documented.
