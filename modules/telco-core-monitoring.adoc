New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
The {cmo-first} is included by default in {product-title} and provides monitoring (metrics, dashboards, and alerting) for the platform components and optionally user projects as well.

[NOTE]
====
The default handling of pod CPU and memory metrics is based on upstream Kubernetes `cAdvisor` and makes a tradeoff that prefers handling of stale data over metric accuracy. This leads to spiky data that will create false triggers of alerts over user-specified thresholds. OpenShift supports an opt-in dedicated service monitor feature creating an additional set of pod CPU and memory metrics that do not suffer from the spiky behavior.

====

Limits and requirements::
* Monitoring configuration must enable the dedicated service monitor feature for accurate representation of pod metrics

Engineering considerations::
* You configure the Prometheus retention period. The value used is a tradeoff between operational requirements for maintaining historical data on the cluster against CPU and storage resources. Longer retention periods increase the need for storage and require additional CPU to manage the indexing of data.
