= Synchronization mechanism between the control plane and workload clusters

Each Argo CD Agent on a cluster manages the local Argo CD instance and ensures that applications, AppProjects, and secrets remain synchronized with their source of truth.

The Agent performs the following key functions:

**Resource synchronization**

* Synchronizes Argo CD resources such as `Application`, `AppProject`, and related `Secret` objects between the control plane and workload clusters.
* When you create or modify an application on the control plane, the change propagates to the workload cluster with the agent configured in the Managed mode.
* When an application status changes on a workload cluster, the change reports back to the control plane.

**Unified observability**

* Enables the control plane Argo CD web console to display the real-time state of applications across all clusters.  
* Enables independent synchronization by the Agent container, ensuring consistent two-way updates outside the Argo CD internal reconciliation loop.
