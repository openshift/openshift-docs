= Enabling log based alerts with Loki
Loki alerting rules use link:https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/[LogQL] and follow link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/#recording-rules[Prometheus formatting]. You can set log based alerts by creating an `AlertingRule` custom resource (CR). `AlertingRule` CRs may be created for `application`, `audit`, or `infrastructure` tenants.

[options="header"]
|================================================
| Tenant type    | Valid namespaces
| application    |
| audit          | `openshift-logging`
| infrastructure | `openshift-/\*`, `kube-/\*`, `default`
|================================================

Application, Audit, and Infrastructure alerts are sent to the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) Alertmanager in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace by default unless you have disabled the local `Alertmanager` instance.

Application alerts are not sent to the CMO Alertmanager in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace by default unless you have enabled a separate `Alertmanager` instance.

The `AlertingRule` CR contains a set of specifications and webhook validation definitions to declare groups of alerting rules for a single LokiStack instance. In addition, the webhook validation definition provides support for rule validation conditions:

* If an `AlertingRule` CR includes an invalid `interval` period, it is an invalid alerting rule
* If an `AlertingRule` CR includes an invalid `for` period, it is an invalid alerting rule.
* If an `AlertingRule` CR includes an invalid LogQL `expr`, it is an invalid alerting rule.
* If an `AlertingRule` CR includes two groups with the same name, it is an invalid alerting rule.
* If none of above applies, an `AlertingRule` is considered a valid alerting rule.
