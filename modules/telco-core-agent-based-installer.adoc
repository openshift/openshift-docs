Description::
+
--
Telco core clusters can be installed by using the Agent-based Installer.
This method allows you to install OpenShift on bare-metal servers without requiring additional servers or VMs for managing the installation.
The Agent-based Installer can be run on any system (for example, from a laptop) to generate an ISO installation image.
The ISO is used as the installation media for the cluster supervisor nodes.
Installation progress can be monitored using the ABI tool from any system with network connectivity to the supervisor node's API interfaces.

ABI supports the following:

* Installation from declarative CRs
* Installation in disconnected environments
* Installation with no additional supporting install or bastion servers required to complete the installation
--

Limits and requirements::
* Disconnected installation requires a registry that is reachable from the installed host, with all required content mirrored in that registry.

Engineering considerations::
* Networking configuration should be applied as NMState configuration during installation.
Day 2 networking configuration using the NMState Operator is not supported.
