= Bundle

A RukPak `Bundle` object represents content to make available to other consumers in the cluster. Much like the contents of a container image must be pulled and unpacked in order for pod to start using them, `Bundle` objects are used to reference content that might need to be pulled and unpacked. In this sense, a bundle is a generalization of the image concept and can be used to represent any type of content.

Bundles cannot do anything on their own; they require a provisioner to unpack and make their content available in the cluster. They can be unpacked to any arbitrary storage medium, such as a `tar.gz` file in a directory mounted into the provisioner pods. Each `Bundle` object has an associated `spec.provisionerClassName` field that indicates the `Provisioner` object that watches and unpacks that particular bundle type.
