= NIC partitioning for SR-IOV devices

In some cases, you might want to split virtual functions (VFs) from the same physical function (PF) into multiple resource pools. For example, you might want some of the VFs with the default driver loaded, while the remaining VFs load with the `vfio-pci` driver. In such a deployment, the `pfNames` selector in your SriovNetworkNodePolicy Custom Resource can be used to specify a range of VFs for a pool using the following format: `<PFName>#<FirstVF>-<LastVF>`

For example, the following YAML shows the selector for an interface named `netpf0` with VF 2 through 7:

[source,yaml]
----
pfNames: ["netpf0#2-7"]
----

* `netpf0` is the PF interface name.
* `2` is the first VF index (0-based) that is included in the range.
* `7` is the last VF index (0-based) that is included in the range.

You can select VFs from the same PF by using different policy CRs if the following requirements are met:

* The `numVfs` must be identical for policies that select the same PF.
* The VF index must be in range of `0` to `<numVfs>-1`. For example, if you have a policy with `numVfs` set to `8`, then the `<FirstVF>` must not be smaller than 0, and the `<LastVF>` must not larger than 7.
* The VFs ranges in different policies must not overlap.
* The `<FirstVF>` must not larger be than the `<LastVF>`.

The following example illustrates NIC partitioning for an SR-IOV device.

The policy `policy-net-1` defined a resource pool `net-1` that contains the VF `0` of PF `netpf0`, with the default VF driver. The policy `policy-net-1-dpdk` defined another resource pool `net-1-dpdk` that contains the VF `8` to `15` of PF `netpf0`, with the `vfio` VF driver.
