= Generating and sharing certificates with the remote basic authentication server

Complete the following steps on the first control plane host (also known as the master host) listed in the Ansible host inventory file,
by default `/etc/ansible/hosts`.

.Procedure

. To ensure that communication between the remote basic authentication server and
{product-title} is trustworthy, create a set of Transport Layer Security (TLS)
certificates to use during the other phases of this set up. Run the following command:
+
----
# openshift start \
    --public-master=https://openshift.example.com:8443 \
    --write-config=/etc/origin/
----
+
The output inclues the `/etc/origin/master/ca.crt` and
`/etc/origin/master/ca.key` signing certificates.
.  Use the signing certificate to generate keys to use on the remote basic
authentication server:
+
----
# mkdir -p /etc/origin/remote-basic/
# oc adm ca create-server-cert \
    --cert='/etc/origin/remote-basic/remote-basic.example.com.crt' \
    --key='/etc/origin/remote-basic/remote-basic.example.com.key' \
    --hostnames=remote-basic.example.com \ <1>
    --signer-cert='/etc/origin/master/ca.crt' \
    --signer-key='/etc/origin/master/ca.key' \
    --signer-serial='/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt'
----
+
<1> A comma-separated list of all the hostnames and interface IP addresses that must access the
remote basic authentication server.
+
[NOTE]
====
The certificate files that you generate are valid for two years. You can alter
this period by changing the `--expire-days` and `--signer-expire-days` values,
but for security reasons, do not make them greater than 730.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not list all hostnames and interface IP addresses that must access the
remote basic authentication server, the HTTPS connection will fail.
====
. Copy the necessary certificates and key to the remote basic authentication server:
+
----
# scp /etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
      root@remote-basic.example.com:/etc/pki/CA/certs/

# scp /etc/origin/remote-basic/remote-basic.example.com.crt \
      root@remote-basic.example.com:/etc/pki/tls/certs/

# scp /etc/origin/remote-basic/remote-basic.example.com.key \
      root@remote-basic.example.com:/etc/pki/tls/private/
