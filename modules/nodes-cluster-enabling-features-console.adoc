= Enabling feature sets using the web console

You can use the {product-title} web console to enable feature sets for all of the nodes in a cluster by editing the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

To enable feature sets:

. In the {product-title} web console, switch to the *Administration* -> *Custom Resource Definitions* page.

. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click *FeatureGate*.

. On the *Custom Resource Definition Details* page, click the *Instances* tab.

. Click the *cluster* feature gate, then click the *YAML* tab.

Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on your cluster cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. You should not enable this feature set on production clusters.
