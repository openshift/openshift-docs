= Creating an LVMCluster CR by using {rh-rhacm}

After you have installed {lvms} by using {rh-rhacm}, you must create an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {lvms} by using {rh-rhacm}.
* You have access to the {rh-rhacm} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You read the "About the LVMCluster custom resource" section.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {rh-rhacm} CLI using your {product-title} credentials.

. Create a `ConfigurationPolicy` CR YAML file with the configuration to create an `LVMCluster` CR:
