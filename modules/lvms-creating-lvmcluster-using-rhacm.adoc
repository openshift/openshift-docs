= Creating an LVMCluster CR by using {rh-rhacm}

After you have installed {lvms} by using {rh-rhacm}, you must create an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {lvms} by using {rh-rhacm}.
* You have access to the {rh-rhacm} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You read the "About the LVMCluster custom resource" section.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {rh-rhacm} CLI using your {product-title} credentials.

. Create a `ConfigurationPolicy` CR YAML file with the configuration to create an `LVMCluster` CR:

<2> Contains the configuration to specify the paths to the devices that you want to add to the LVM volume group, and force wipe the devices that are added to the LVM volume group. 
<3> Contains the configuration to create a thin pool in the LVM volume group. If you exclude this field, logical volumes are thick provisioned.
<4> Contains the configuration to choose the nodes on which you want to create the LVM volume groups. If this field is empty, then all nodes without no-schedule taints are considered.
