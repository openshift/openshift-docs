= Protecting control plane with admission plug-ins

While RBAC controls access rules between users and groups and available projects,
_admission plug-ins_ define access to the {product-title} master API.
Admission plug-ins form a chain of rules that consist of:

* Default admissions plug-ins: These implement a default set of
policies and resources limits that are applied to components of the {product-title}
control plane.

* Mutating admission plug-ins: These plug-ins dynamically extend the admission chain.
They call out to a webhook server and can both authenticate a request and modify the selected resource.

* Validating admission plug-ins: These validate requests for a selected resource
and can both validate the request and ensure that the resource does not change again.

API requests go through admissions plug-ins in a chain, with any failure along
the way causing the request to be rejected. Each admission plug-in is associated with particular resources and only
responds to requests for those resources.

== Security context constraints (SCCs)

You can use _security context constraints_ (SCCs) to define a set of conditions
that a pod must run with in order to be accepted
into the system.

Some aspects that can be managed by SCCs include:

- Running of privileged containers
- Capabilities a container can request to be added
- Use of host directories as volumes
- SELinux context of the container
- Container user ID

If you have the required permissions, you can adjust the default SCC policies to
be more permissive, if required.

[id="security-service-account_{context}"]
== Granting roles to service accounts

You can assign roles to service accounts, in the same way that
users are assigned role-based access.
There are three default service accounts created for each project.
A service account:

* is limited in scope to a particular project
* derives its name from its project
* is automatically assigned an API token and credentials to access the
OpenShift Container Registry

Service accounts associated with platform components automatically
have their keys rotated.
