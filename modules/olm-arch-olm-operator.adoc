= OLM Operator

The OLM Operator is responsible for deploying applications defined by CSV
resources after the required resources specified in the CSV are present in the
cluster.

The OLM Operator is not concerned with the creation of the required resources;
you can choose to manually create these resources using the CLI or using the
Catalog Operator. This separation of concern allows users incremental buy-in in
terms of how much of the OLM framework they choose to leverage for their
application.

The OLM Operator uses the following workflow:

. Watch for ClusterServiceVersion (CSVs) in a namespace and check that
requirements are met.
. If requirements are met, run the install strategy for the CSV.

[NOTE]
====
A CSV must be an active member of an OperatorGroup for the install strategy to
run.
