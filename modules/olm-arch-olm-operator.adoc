= OLM Operator

[role="_abstract"]
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operator deploys applications that are defined by cluster service version (CSV) resources. Understanding the OLM Operator workflow helps you troubleshoot deployments and identify which resources you must create manually.

The OLM Operator does not create the resources that a CSV requires. You can create these resources manually by using the CLI, or the Catalog Operator can create them. With this separation, you can adopt OLM features incrementally.

The OLM Operator uses the following workflow:

. Watches for Cluster Service Versions (CSVs) in a namespace.
. Verifies that the required resources exist.
. Runs the install strategy for the CSV, if the requirements are met.

[NOTE]
====
For the install strategy to run, a CSV must be an active member of an Operator group.
