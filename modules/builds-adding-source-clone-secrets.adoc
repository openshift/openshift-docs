= Source Clone Secrets

Builder pods require access to any Git repositories defined as source for a build. Source clone secrets are used to provide the builder pod with access it would not normally have access to, such as private repositories or repositories with self-signed or untrusted SSL certificates.

The following source clone secret configurations are supported:

* A `.gitconfig` file
* Basic authentication
* SSH key authentication
* Trusted certificate authorities

[NOTE]
====
You can also use combinations of these configurations to meet your specific needs.
