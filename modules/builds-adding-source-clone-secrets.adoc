= Adding Source Clone Secrets

Builder pods require access to any Git repositories defined as source for a
build. Source clone secrets are used to provide the builder pod with access it
would not normally have access to, such as private repositories or repositories
with self-signed or untrusted SSL certificates.

.Prerequisites

* The following source clone secret configurations are supported.
** .gitconfig File
** Basic Authentication
** SSH Key Authentication
** Trusted Certificate Authorities

[NOTE]
====
You can also use combinations of these configurations
to meet your specific needs.
====

.Procedure

Builds are run with the *builder* service account, which must have access to any
source clone secrets used.

* Run the following command to grant access:

----
$ oc secrets link builder mysecret
----

[NOTE]
====
Limiting secrets to only the service accounts that reference them is disabled by
default. This means that if `serviceAccountConfig.limitSecretReferences` is set
to `false` (the default setting) in the master configuration file, linking
secrets to a service is not required.
