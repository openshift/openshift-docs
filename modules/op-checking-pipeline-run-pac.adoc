= Checking a pipeline run

You can check that the {pac} resolver correctly processes the pipeline run definition that you created.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the `tkn` command line utility
* You are logged into your {OCP} cluster using the `tkn` command line utility
* You cloned your Git repository locally

.Procedure

* From the root of yout cloned Git repository, run the following command, specifying your pipeline run definition file name:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ tkn pac resolve .tekton/pipeline-run-definition.yaml
----
+
This command processes the pipeline run definition using the {pac} resolver. If the resolver fails to find any referenced resource, an error message displays. If the resolver completes successfully, the definition of a `PipelineRun` custom resource (CR) that includes all referenced resources, such as remote task definitions, displays.
