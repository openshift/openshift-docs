= Certificate rotation

[role="_abstract"]
Certificates that are expired or close to their expiration dates must be rotated to ensure continued {microshift-short} operation. This rotation can be an automatic process.

When {microshift-short} restarts for any reason, certificates that are close to expiring are rotated. A certificate that expires soon, or has already expired, can also cause an automatic {microshift-short} restart to perform a rotation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the rotated certificate is a {microshift-short} certificate authority (CA), then all of the signed certificates rotate. If you created any custom CAs, ensure that the CAs manually rotate.
