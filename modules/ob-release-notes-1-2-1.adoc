= Release notes for {builds-shortname} General Availability 1.2.1

{builds-shortname} General Availability (GA) 1.2.1 is now available on {ocp-product-title} <version>.

[id="fixed-issues-1-2-1_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Before this update, when you installed Builds for OpenShift without installing OpenShift Pipelines, the Builds for OpenShift attempts to deploy OpenShift Pipelines and enables the Tekton Pipeline controllers. Previously, builds for OpenShift incorrectly configured OpenShift Pipelines and failed to deploy the Tekton Pipeline controllers. With this change, Builds for OpenShift creates a valid TektonConfig and deploys the Tekton Pipeline controllers.

* Before this update, when you tried to execute builds using {builds-title} installed on ARM, IBM Power, or IBM Z worker node CPU architectures, then the builds would fail due to AMD only build strategies images. Now, the AMD only image is replaced with a multi-arch image in `buildah` and `source-to-image` build strategies and you can execute builds on all the architectures.

* Before this update, when you enabled cluster monitoring in the openshift builds namespace, the TargetDown alert was received on the Shared Resources Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Metrics Service Monitor. Now, the ServerName is updated to the correct address in Shared Resources CSI Driver Metrics Service Monitor.
