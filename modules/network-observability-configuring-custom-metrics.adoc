= Configuring custom metrics by using FlowMetrics API
You can configure the `FlowMetrics` API to create custom metrics by using flowlogs data fields as Prometheus labels. You can add multiple `FlowMetrics` resources to a project to see multiple dashboard views.

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. In the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *FlowMetrics*.
. In the *Project:*  dropdown list, select the project of the Network Observability Operator instance. 
. Click *Create FlowMetric*.
. Configure the `FlowMetrics` resource, similar to the following sample configurations:
+
.Generate a metric that tracks ingress bytes received from cluster external sources

----
<1> The `FlowMetric` resources need to be created in the namespace defined in the `FlowCollector` `spec.namespace`, which is `netobserv` by default.
<2> The name of the Prometheus metric, which in the web console appears with the prefix `netobserv-<metricName>`. 
<3> The `type` specifies the type of metric. The `Counter` `type` is useful for counting bytes or packets.
<4> The direction of traffic to capture. If not specified, both ingress and egress are captured, which can lead to duplicated counts. 
<5> Labels define what the metrics look like and the relationship between the different entities and also define the metrics cardinality. For example, `SrcK8S_Name` is a high cardinality metric.
<6> Refines results based on the listed criteria. In this example,  selecting only the cluster external traffic is done by matching only flows where `SrcSubnetLabel` is absent. This assumes the subnet labels feature is enabled (via `spec.processor.subnetLabels`), which is done by default.

.Verification
. Once the pods refresh, navigate to *Observe* -> *Metrics*.
. In the *Expression* field, type the metric name to view the corresponding result. You can also enter an expression, such as `topk(5, sum(rate(netobserv_cluster_external_ingress_bytes_total{DstK8S_Namespace="my-namespace"}[2m])) by (DstK8S_HostName, DstK8S_OwnerName, DstK8S_OwnerType))`

<2> The `type` specifies the type of metric. The `Histogram` `type` is useful for a latency value (`TimeFlowRttNs`).
<3> Since the Round-trip time (RTT) is provided as nanos in flows, use a divider of 1 billion to convert into seconds, which is standard in Prometheus guidelines.
<4> The custom buckets specify precision on RTT, with optimal precision ranging between 5ms and 250ms.
