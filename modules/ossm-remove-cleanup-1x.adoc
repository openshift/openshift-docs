= Clean up Operator resources

Follow this procedure to manually remove resources left behind after removing the {ProductName} Operator using the OpenShift console.

.Prerequisites

* An account with cluster administration access.
* Access to the {product-title} Command-line Interface (CLI) also known as `oc`.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a cluster administrator.

. Run the following commands to clean up resources after uninstalling the Operators. If you intend to keep using Jaeger as a stand alone service without service mesh, do not delete the Jaeger resources.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Operators are installed in the `openshift-operators` namespace by default.  If you installed the Operators in another namespace, replace `openshift-operators` with the name of the project where the {ProductName} Operator was installed.
