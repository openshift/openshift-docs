= Known limitations of installing with Kuryr

Using {product-title} with Kuryr SDN has several known limitations.

[id="openstack-general-limitations_{context}"]
== {rh-openstack} general limitations

{product-title} with Kuryr SDN does not support NodePort services.

[discrete]
[id="openstack-resource-limitations_{context}"]
== {rh-openstack} resource limitations

* An Amphora load balancer VM is deployed per OpenShift Service that uses the
default Octavia load balancer driver (Amphora driver). Creating too many Services
can cause you to run out of resources.

[discrete]
[id="openstack-version-limitations_{context}"]
== {rh-openstack} version limitations

Using {product-title} with Kuryr SDN has several limitations that depend on the {rh-openstack} version.

* Octavia {rh-openstack} versions before 16 do not support UDP listeners. Therefore,
OpenShift UDP services are not supported.

* Octavia {rh-openstack} versions before 16 cannot listen to multiple protocols on the
same port. Services that expose the same port to different protocols, like TCP
and UDP, are not supported.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The OVN Octavia driver does not support listeners that use different protocols on
any {rh-openstack} version.

[discrete]
[id="openstack-go-limitations_{context}"]
== {rh-openstack} environment limitations

There are limitations when using Kuryr SDN that depend on your deployment environment.

Because of Octavia's lack of support for the UDP protocol and multiple listeners, Kuryr forces Pods to use TCP
for DNS resolution if:

* The {rh-openstack} version is earlier than 16
* The OVN Octavia driver is used

In Go versions 1.12 and earlier, applications that are compiled with CGO support disabled use UDP only. In this case,
the native Go resolver does not recognize the `use-vc` option in `resolv.conf`, which controls whether TCP is forced for DNS resolution.
As a result, UDP is still used for DNS resolution, which fails.

To ensure that TCP forcing is allowed, compile applications either with the environment variable `CGO_ENABLED` set to `1`, i.e. `CGO_ENABLED=1`, or ensure that the variable is absent.

In Go versions 1.13 and later, TCP is used automatically if DNS resolution using UDP fails.

[NOTE]
====
musl-based containers, including Alpine-based containers, do not support the `use-vc` option.
