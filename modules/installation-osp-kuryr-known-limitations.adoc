= Known limitations of installing with Kuryr

There are known limitations when using Kuryr SDN:

* An Amphora load balancer VM is deployed per OpenShift Service with
the default Octavia load balancer driver (Amphora driver). If the environment is
resource constrained, creating a large amount of Services could be a problem.
* Depending on the Octavia version, UDP listeners are not supported. This means
that OpenShift UDP Services are not supported.
* There is a known limitation of Octavia not supporting listeners on different
protocols, like UDP and TCP, on the same port. Thus, Services exposing the same
port for different protocols are not supported.
* Due to the above UDP limitations of Octavia, Kuryr forces Pods to use TCP
for DNS resolution. This is set with the `use-vc` option in `resolv.conf`. This
might be a problem for Pods running Go applications compiled with the `CGO_DEBUG`
flag disabled, as that uses the `go` resolver that only leverages UDP and is not
considering the `use-vc` option added by Kuryr to the `resolv.conf`. This is a
problem also for musl-based containers as its resolver does not support the
`use-vc` option. This includes images built from `alpine`.
