= Known limitations of installing with Kuryr

Using {product-title} with Kuryr SDN has several known limitations.

[discrete]
[id="openstack-general-limitations_{context}"]
== {rh-openstack} general limitations

{product-title} with Kuryr SDN does not support NodePort services. 

If the machines subnet is not connected to a router, or if the
subnet is connected, but the router has no external gateway set,
Kuryr cannot create floating IPs for LoadBalancer services.

[discrete]
[id="openstack-version-limitations_{context}"]
== {rh-openstack} version limitations

Using {product-title} with Kuryr SDN has several limitations that depend on the {rh-openstack} version.

* {rh-openstack} versions before 16 use
the default Octavia load balancer driver (Amphora). This driver requires that one
Amphora load balancer VM is deployed per OpenShift Service. Creating too many
Services can cause you to run out of resources.
+
Deployments of later versions of {rh-openstack} that have the OVN Octavia driver disabled also
use the Amphora driver. They are subject to the same resource concerns as earlier versions of {rh-openstack}.

* Octavia {rh-openstack} versions before 16 do not support UDP listeners. Therefore,
OpenShift UDP services are not supported.

* Octavia {rh-openstack} versions before 16 cannot listen to multiple protocols on the
same port. Services that expose the same port to different protocols, like TCP
and UDP, are not supported.

[discrete]
[id="openstack-go-limitations_{context}"]
== {rh-openstack} environment limitations

There are limitations when using Kuryr SDN that depend on your deployment environment.

Because of Octavia's lack of support for the UDP protocol and multiple listeners, if the {rh-openstack} version is earlier than 16, Kuryr forces pods to use TCP for DNS resolution.

In Go versions 1.12 and earlier, applications that are compiled with CGO support disabled use UDP only. In this case,
the native Go resolver does not recognize the `use-vc` option in `resolv.conf`, which controls whether TCP is forced for DNS resolution.
As a result, UDP is still used for DNS resolution, which fails.

To ensure that TCP forcing is allowed, compile applications either with the environment variable `CGO_ENABLED` set to `1`, i.e. `CGO_ENABLED=1`, or ensure that the variable is absent.

In Go versions 1.13 and later, TCP is used automatically if DNS resolution using UDP fails.

[NOTE]
====
musl-based containers, including Alpine-based containers, do not support the `use-vc` option.

[id="openstack-upgrade-limitations_{context}"]
== {rh-openstack} upgrade limitations

As a result of the {rh-openstack} upgrade process, the Octavia API might be changed, and upgrades to the Amphora images that are used for load balancers might be required.

You can address API changes on an individual basis.

If the Amphora image is upgraded, the {rh-openstack} operator can handle existing load balancer VMs in two ways:

* Upgrade each VM by triggering a triggering a link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.0/html/networking_guide/sec-octavia#update-running-amphora-instances[Load Balancer failover].

* Leave responsibility for upgrading the VMs to users.

If the operator takes the first option, there might be short downtimes during failovers.

If the operator takes the second option, the existing load balancers will not support upgraded Octavia
API features, like UDP listeners. In this case, users must recreate their Services to use these features.


[IMPORTANT]
====
If {product-title} detects a new Octavia version that supports UDP load balancing, it recreates the DNS Service automatically. The Service recreation ensures that the Service default supports UDP load balancing.

The recreation causes the DNS Service approximately one minute of downtime.
