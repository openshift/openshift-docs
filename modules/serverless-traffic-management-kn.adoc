[id="serverless-traffic-management-kn_{context}"]
= Traffic management using the Knative CLI

You can use the `kn service update` command to split traffic between revisions of a service.

.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service update <service_name> --traffic <revision>=<percent>
----

Where:

* `<service_name>` is the name of the Knative service that you are configuring traffic routing for.
* `<revision>` is the revision that you want to configure to receive a percentage of traffic. You can either specify the name of the revision, or a tag that you assigned to the revision by using the `--tag` flag.
* `<percent>` is the percentage of traffic that you want to send to the specified revision.

[id="serverless-traffic-management-kn-precedence_{context}"]
== Multiple flags and order precedence

All traffic-related flags can be specified using a single `kn service update` command. `kn` defines the precedence of these flags. The order of the flags specified when using the command is not taken into account.

The precedence of the flags as they are evaluated by `kn` are:

. `--untag`: All the referenced revisions with this flag are removed from the traffic block.
. `--tag`: Revisions are tagged as specified in the traffic block.
. `--traffic`: The referenced revisions are assigned a portion of the traffic split.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `--traffic` flag can be specified multiple times in one command, and is valid only if the sum of the `Percent` values in all flags totals 100.
====

You can add tags to revisions and then split traffic according to the tags you have set.

[id="serverless-traffic-management-kn-example_{context}"]
== Example traffic management commands

In the following command, the `@latest` tag means that `blue` resolves to the latest revision of the service:

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service update example-service --tag green=revision-0001 --tag blue=@latest
----

After the `green` and `blue` tags have been applied, you can run the following command to split traffic for the service named `example-service`, by sending 80% of traffic to the revision `green` and 20% of traffic to the revision `blue`:

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service update example-service --traffic green=80 --traffic blue=20
----

Alternatively, you could use the following command to send 80% of traffic to the latest revision and 20% to a revision named `v1`, without using tags:

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service update example-service --traffic @latest=80 --traffic v1=20
----

[NOTE]
====
You can only use the identifier `@latest` once per command with the `--traffic` flag.
