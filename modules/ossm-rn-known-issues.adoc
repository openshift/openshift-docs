*Consequence* - What user action or situation would make this problem appear (Selecting the Foo option with the Bar version 1.3 plugin enabled results in an error message)?  What did the customer experience as a result of the issue? What was the symptom?
*Cause* (if it has been identified) - Why did this happen?
*Workaround* (If there is one)- What can you do to avoid or negate the effects of this issue in the meantime?  Sometimes if there is no workaround it is worthwhile telling readers to contact support for advice. Never promise future fixes.
*Result* - If the workaround does not completely address the problem.
////

These limitations exist in {ProductName}:

* {ProductName} does not yet support link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-1314[IPv6], as it is not yet fully supported by the upstream Istio project.

* Graph layout - The layout for the Kiali graph can render differently, depending on your application architecture and the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions). Because it is difficult if not impossible to create a single layout that renders nicely for every situation, Kiali offers a choice of several different layouts. To choose a different layout, you can choose a different *Layout Schema* from the *Graph Settings* menu.

* The first time you access related services such as Jaeger and Grafana, from the Kiali console, you must accept the certificate and re-authenticate using your {product-title} login credentials. This happens due to an issue with how the framework displays embedded pages in the console.

* The Bookinfo sample application cannot be installed on IBM Z and IBM Power Systems.

* WebAssembly is unsupported on IBM Z.

== {ProductShortName} known issues

These are the known issues in {ProductName}:

* link:https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/14743[Istio-14743] Due to limitations in the version of Istio that this release of {ProductName} is based on, there are several applications that are currently incompatible with {ProductShortName}. See the linked community issue for details.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-285[OSSM-285] When trying to access the Kiali console, receive the following error message "Error trying to get OAuth Metadata". The workaround is to restart the Kiali pod.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2692[MAISTRA-2692] With Mixer removed, custom metrics that have been defined in {ProductShortName} 2.0.x cannot be used in 2.1. Custom metrics can be configured using `EnvoyFilter`. Red Hat is unable to support `EnvoyFilter` configuration except where explicitly documented. This is due to tight coupling with the underlying Envoy APIs, meaning that backward compatibility cannot be maintained.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-2687[MAISTRA-2687] {ProductName} 2.1 federation gateway does not send the full certificate chain when using external certificates. The {ProductShortName} federation egress gateway only sends the client certificate. Because the federation ingress gateway only knows about the root certificate, it cannot verify the client certificate unless you add the root certificate to the federation import `ConfigMap`.
+
. To provide both the root certificate and CA certificate when setting the federation import `ConfigMap`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: mesh1-ca-root-cert
    namespace: mesh2-system
  data:
    root-cert.pem: |-
      {{MESH1_CERT}}
----
+
. Assign the certificate values to the mesh variable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ MESH1_CERT=$(cat cacerts/root-cert.pem cacerts/ca-cert.pem | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/\\\n    /g')
----
+
. Insert the certificate information into `ConfigMap` and apply the change:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sed "s:{{MESH1_CERT}}:$MESH1_CERT:g" import/configmap.yaml | oc apply -f -
----

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2648[MAISTRA-2648] `ServiceMeshExtensions` are currently not compatible with meshes deployed on IBM Z Systems.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-2411[MAISTRA-2411] When the Operator creates a new ingress gateway using `spec.gateways.additionaIngress` in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, Operator is not creating a `NetworkPolicy` for the additional ingress gateway like it does for the default istio-ingressgateway. This is causing a 503 response from the route of the new gateway. The workaround for this issue is to manually create the `NetworkPolicy` in the <istio-system> namespace.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-1959[MAISTRA-1959] _Migration to 2.0_ Prometheus scraping (`spec.addons.prometheus.scrape` set to `true`) does not work when mTLS is enabled. Additionally, Kiali displays extraneous graph data when mTLS is disabled.
+
This problem can be addressed by excluding port 15020 from proxy configuration, for example,
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  proxy:
    networking:
      trafficControl:
        inbound:
          excludedPorts:
          - 15020
----
+
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-1947[MAISTRA-1947] _Technology Preview_ Updates to ServiceMeshExtensions are not applied. The workaround is to remove and recreate the ServiceMeshExtensions.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-1314[MAISTRA-1314] {ProductName} does not yet support IPv6.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-806[MAISTRA-806] Evicted Istio Operator Pod causes mesh and CNI not to deploy.
+
If the `istio-operator` pod is evicted while deploying the control pane, delete the evicted `istio-operator` pod.
+
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-681[MAISTRA-681] When the control plane has many namespaces, it can lead to performance issues.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-465[MAISTRA-465] The Maistra Operator fails to create a service for operator metrics.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-453[MAISTRA-453] If you create a new project and deploy pods immediately, sidecar injection does not occur. The operator fails to add the `maistra.io/member-of` before the pods are created, therefore the pods must be deleted and recreated for sidecar injection to occur.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-158[MAISTRA-158] Applying multiple gateways referencing the same hostname will cause all gateways to stop functioning.

== Kiali known issues

[NOTE]
====
New issues for Kiali should be created in the link:https://issues.redhat.com/projects/OSSM/[OpenShift Service Mesh] project with the `Component` set to `Kiali`.
====

These are the known issues in Kiali:

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2206[KIALI-2206] When you are accessing the Kiali console for the first time, and there is no cached browser data for Kiali, the “View in Grafana” link on the Metrics tab of the Kiali Service Details page redirects to the wrong location. The only way you would encounter this issue is if you are accessing Kiali for the first time.

* link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/507[KIALI-507] Kiali does not support Internet Explorer 11. This is because the underlying frameworks do not support Internet Explorer. To access the Kiali console, use one of the two most recent versions of the Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari browser.
