*Consequence* - What user action or situation would make this problem appear (Selecting the Foo option with the Bar version 1.3 plugin enabled results in an error message)?  What did the customer experience as a result of the issue? What was the symptom?
*Cause* (if it has been identified) - Why did this happen?
*Workaround* (If there is one)- What can you do to avoid or negate the effects of this issue in the meantime?  Sometimes if there is no workaround it is worthwhile telling readers to contact support for advice. Never promise future fixes.
*Result* - If the workaround does not completely address the problem.

These limitations exist in {SMProductName}:

* {SMProductName} does not yet support link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-1314[IPv6], as it is not yet fully supported by the upstream Istio project.  As a result, {SMProductName} does not support dual-stack clusters.

* Graph layout - The layout for the Kiali graph can render differently, depending on your application architecture and the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions). Because it is difficult if not impossible to create a single layout that renders nicely for every situation, Kiali offers a choice of several different layouts. To choose a different layout, you can choose a different *Layout Schema* from the *Graph Settings* menu.

* The first time you access related services such as {JaegerShortName} and Grafana, from the Kiali console, you must accept the certificate and re-authenticate using your {product-title} login credentials. This happens due to an issue with how the framework displays embedded pages in the console.

* The Bookinfo sample application cannot be installed on IBM Z and IBM Power.

* WebAssembly extensions are not supported on IBM Z and IBM Power.

* LuaJIT is not supported on IBM Power.

== {SMProductShortName} known issues

These are the known issues in {SMProductName}:

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-2221[OSSM-2221] Gateway injection does not work in control plane namespace. If you use the Gateway injection feature to create a gateway in the same location as the control plane, the injection fails and OpenShift generates this message:
+
`Warning  Failed          10s   kubelet, ocp-wide-vh8fd-worker-vhqm9  Failed to pull image "auto": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = reading manifest latest in docker.io/library/auto: errors`
+
To create a gateway in the control plane namespace, use the `gateways` parameter in the SMCP spec to configure ingress and egress gateways for the mesh.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-2042[OSSM-2042] Deployment of SMCP named `default` fails. If you are creating an SMCP object, and set its version field to v2.3, the name of the object cannot be `default`. If the name is `default`, then the control plane fails to deploy, and OpenShift generates a `Warning` event with the following message:
+
`Error processing component mesh-config: error: [mesh-config/templates/telemetryv2_1.6.yaml: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "rev.validation.istio.io": Post "https://istiod-default.istio-system.svc:443/validate?timeout=10s": x509: certificate is valid for istiod.istio-system.svc, istiod-remote.istio-system.svc, istio-pilot.istio-system.svc, not istiod-default.istio-system.svc, mesh-config/templates/enable-mesh-permissive.yaml`

//Keep OSSM-1655 in RN, closed as "explained" error is expected.
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-1655[OSSM-1655] Kiali dashboard shows error after enabling mTLS in `SMCP`.
+
After enabling the `spec.security.controlPlane.mtls` setting in the SMCP, the Kiali console displays the following error message `No subsets defined`.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-1505[OSSM-1505] This issue only occurs when using the `ServiceMeshExtension` resource on OpenShift Container Platform 4.11. When you use `ServiceMeshExtension` on OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 the resource never becomes ready. If you inspect the issue using `oc describe ServiceMeshExtension` you will see the following error:  `stderr: Error creating mount namespace before pivot: function not implemented`.
+
Workaround: `ServiceMeshExtension` was deprecated in {SMProductShortName} 2.2. Migrate from `ServiceMeshExtension` to the `WasmPlugin` resource.
For more information, see Migrating from `ServiceMeshExtension` to `WasmPlugin` resources.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-1396[OSSM-1396] If a gateway resource contains the `spec.externalIPs` setting, instead of being recreated when the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` is updated, the gateway is removed and never recreated.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-1168[OSSM-1168] When service mesh resources are created as a single YAML file, the Envoy proxy sidecar is not reliably injected into pods. When the SMCP, SMMR, and Deployment resources are created individually, the deployment works as expected.
//Keep OSSM-1052 in RN - Closed as documented.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-1115[OSSM-1115] The `concurrency` field of the `spec.proxy` API did not propagate to the istio-proxy. The `concurrency` field works when set with `ProxyConfig`. The `concurrency` field specifies the number of worker threads to run. If the field is set to `0`, then the number of worker threads available is equal to the number of CPU cores. If the field is not set, then the number of worker threads available defaults to `2`.
+
In the following example, the `concurrency` field is set to `0`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ProxyConfig
metadata:
  name: mesh-wide-concurrency
  namespace: <istiod-namespace>
spec:
  concurrency: 0
----

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-1052[OSSM-1052] When configuring a Service `ExternalIP` for the ingressgateway in the {SMProductShortName} control plane, the service is not created. The schema for the SMCP is missing the parameter for the service.
+
Workaround: Disable the gateway creation in the SMCP spec and manage the gateway deployment entirely manually (including Service, Role and RoleBinding).

//Keep OSSM-882 in RN to document the workaround
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-882[OSSM-882] This applies for {SMProductShortName} 2.1 and earlier. Namespace is in the accessible_namespace list but does not appear in Kiali UI. By default, Kiali will not show any namespaces that start with "kube" because these namespaces are typically internal-use only and not part of a mesh.
+
For example, if you create a namespace called 'akube-a' and add it to the Service Mesh member roll, then the Kiali UI does not display the namespace. For defined exclusion patterns, the software excludes namespaces that start with or contain the pattern.
+
Workaround: Change the Kiali Custom Resource setting so it prefixes the setting with a carat (^). For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
api:
  namespaces:
    exclude:
    - "^istio-operator"
    - "^kube-.*"
    - "^openshift.*"
    - "^ibm.*"
    - "^kiali-operator"
----
+
* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2692[MAISTRA-2692] With Mixer removed, custom metrics that have been defined in {SMProductShortName} 2.0.x cannot be used in 2.1. Custom metrics can be configured using `EnvoyFilter`. Red Hat is unable to support `EnvoyFilter` configuration except where explicitly documented. This is due to tight coupling with the underlying Envoy APIs, meaning that backward compatibility cannot be maintained.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-2648[MAISTRA-2648] `ServiceMeshExtensions` are currently not compatible with meshes deployed on IBM Z Systems.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-1959[MAISTRA-1959] _Migration to 2.0_ Prometheus scraping (`spec.addons.prometheus.scrape` set to `true`) does not work when mTLS is enabled. Additionally, Kiali displays extraneous graph data when mTLS is disabled.
+
This problem can be addressed by excluding port 15020 from proxy configuration, for example,
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  proxy:
    networking:
      trafficControl:
        inbound:
          excludedPorts:
          - 15020

//Keep MAISTRA-1314 in RN until IPv6 is actually supported
* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-1314[MAISTRA-1314] {SMProductName} does not yet support IPv6.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-453[MAISTRA-453] If you create a new project and deploy pods immediately, sidecar injection does not occur. The operator fails to add the `maistra.io/member-of` before the pods are created, therefore the pods must be deleted and recreated for sidecar injection to occur.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-158[MAISTRA-158] Applying multiple gateways referencing the same hostname will cause all gateways to stop functioning.

[NOTE]
====
New issues for Kiali should be created in the link:https://issues.redhat.com/projects/OSSM/[OpenShift Service Mesh] project with the `Component` set to `Kiali`.

These are the known issues in Kiali:

//Keep KIALI-2206 in RN as this is for information purposes.
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2206[KIALI-2206] When you are accessing the Kiali console for the first time, and there is no cached browser data for Kiali, the “View in Grafana” link on the Metrics tab of the Kiali Service Details page redirects to the wrong location. The only way you would encounter this issue is if you are accessing Kiali for the first time.
//Keep KIALI-507 in RN as this is for information purposes.
* link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/507[KIALI-507] Kiali does not support Internet Explorer 11. This is because the underlying frameworks do not support Internet Explorer. To access the Kiali console, use one of the two most recent versions of the Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari browser.
