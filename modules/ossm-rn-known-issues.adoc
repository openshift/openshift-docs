Consequence - What user action or situation would make this problem appear (Selecting the Foo option with the Bar version 1.3 plugin enabled results in an error message)?  What did the customer experience as a result of the issue? What was the symptom?
Cause (if it has been identified) - Why did this happen?
Workaround (If there is one)- What can you do to avoid or negate the effects of this issue in the meantime?  Sometimes if there is no workaround it is worthwhile telling readers to contact support for advice. Never promise future fixes.
Result - If the workaround does not completely address the problem.

These limitations exist in {ProductName} at this time:

* link:https://github.com/istio/old_issues_repo/issues/115[{ProductName} does not support IPv6], as it it not supported by the upstream Istio project, nor fully supported by OpenShift.

* Graph layout - The layout for the Kiali graph can render differently, depending on your application architecture and the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions). Because it is difficult if not impossible to create a single layout that renders nicely for every situation, Kiali offers a choice of several different layouts. To choose a different layout, you can choose a different *Layout Schema* from the *Graph Settings* menu.

[NOTE]
====
While Kafka publisher is included in the release as part of Jaeger, it is not supported.

== {ProductName} known issues

These are the known issues in {ProductName} at this time:

* link:https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/14743[Istio-14743] Due to limitations in the version of Istio that this release of {ProductName} is based on, there are several applications that are currently incompatible with {ProductShortName}. See the linked community issue for details.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-858[MAISTRA-858] The following Envoy log messages describing link:https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/deprecated[deprecated options and configurations associated with Istio 1.1.x] are expected:
+
** [2019-06-03 07:03:28.943][19][warning][misc] [external/envoy/source/common/protobuf/utility.cc:129] Using deprecated option 'envoy.api.v2.listener.Filter.config'. This configuration will be removed from Envoy soon.
** [2019-08-12 22:12:59.001][13][warning][misc] [external/envoy/source/common/protobuf/utility.cc:174] Using deprecated option 'envoy.api.v2.Listener.use_original_dst' from file lds.proto. This configuration will be removed from Envoy soon.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-681[MAISTRA-681] and link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2686[KIALI-2686] When the control plane has many namespaces, it can lead to performance issues.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-622[MAISTRA-622] In Maistra 0.12.0/TP12, permissive mode does not work. The user has the option to use Plain text mode or Mutual TLS mode, but not permissive.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-465[MAISTRA-465] The Maistra operator fails to create a service for operator metrics.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-453[MAISTRA-453] If you create a new project and deploy pods immediately, sidecar injection does not occur. The operator fails to add the `maistra.io/member-of` before the pods are created, therefore the pods must be deleted and recreated for sidecar injection to occur.


* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-348[MAISTRA-348] To access a TCP service by using the ingress gateway on a port other than 80 or 443, use the service hostname provided by the AWS load balancer rather than the OpenShift router.
+
The istio-ingressgateway route hostname (for example, `istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.apps.[cluster name].openshift.com`) works with port 80 or port 443 traffic. However, that route hostname does not support other port traffic.
+
To access service(s) running on the ingress gateway TCP port(s), you can retrieve the istio-ingressgateway external hostname (for example,
`[uuid].[aws region].elb.amazonaws.com`) and then check traffic by using that external hostname value.
+
To retrieve the external IP hostname value, issue this command:
+
----
$ oc -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-193[MAISTRA-193] Unexpected console info messages are visible when health checking is enabled for citadel.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-158[MAISTRA-158] Applying multiple gateways referencing the same hostname will cause all gateways to stop functioning.

== Kiali known issues

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3265[KIALI-3265] The Service Details page generates an unnecessary Notification in the Message Center that Kiali could not fetch Traces, even though it is displaying trace data on the page.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3262[KIALI-3262] In the Kiali console, when you click on Distributed Tracing in the navigation or on a Traces tab, you are asked to accept the certificate, and then asked to provide your OpenShift login credentials. This happens due to an issue with how the framework displays the Trace pages in the Console. The Workaround is to open the URL for the Jaeger console in another browser window and log in. Then you can view the embedded tracing pages in the Kiali console.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3251[KIALI-3251] In the Kiali Console, on the Istio Config page, if you cancel changes to a YAML file, the changes are not canceled and the YAML tab is marked with an asterisk (*) as having been edited.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3246[KIALI-3246] In the Kiali Console, on the Istio Config page, the Istio Config List cannot filter on more than a single Istio Name. The second Name selected overrides the first Name selected and the results returned are only filtered by the second Name. This issue only affects Istio Names, you can have multiple values of the other filter criteria.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3239[KIALI-3239] If a Kiali Operator pod has failed with a status of “Evicted” it blocks the Kiali operator from deploying. The workaround is to delete the Evicted pod and redeploy the Kiali operator.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3118[KIALI-3118] After changes to the ServiceMeshMemberRoll, for example adding or removing projects, the Kiali pod restarts and then displays errors on the Graph page while the Kiali pod is restarting.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3070[KIALI-3070] This bug only affects custom dashboards, not the default dashboards. When you select labels in metrics settings and refresh the page, your selections are retained in the menu but your selections are not displayed on the charts.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2206[KIALI-2206] When you are accessing the Kiali console for the first time, and there is no cached browser data for Kiali, the “View in Grafana” link on the Metrics tab of the Kiali Service Details page redirects to the wrong location. The only way you would encounter this issue is if you are accessing Kiali for the first time.

* link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/507[KIALI-507] Kiali does not support Internet Explorer 11. This is because the underlying frameworks do not support Internet Explorer. To access the Kiali console, use one of the two most recent versions of the Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari browser.
