Consequence - What user action or situation would make this problem appear (Selecting the Foo option with the Bar version 1.3 plugin enabled results in an error message)?  What did the customer experience as a result of the issue? What was the symptom?
Cause (if it has been identified) - Why did this happen?
Workaround (If there is one)- What can you do to avoid or negate the effects of this issue in the meantime?  Sometimes if there is no workaround it is worthwhile telling readers to contact support for advice. Never promise future fixes.
Result - If the workaround does not completely address the problem.

These limitations exist in {ProductName}:

* link:https://github.com/istio/old_issues_repo/issues/115[{ProductName} does not support IPv6], as it is not supported by the upstream Istio project, nor fully supported by OpenShift.

* Graph layout - The layout for the Kiali graph can render differently, depending on your application architecture and the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions). Because it is difficult if not impossible to create a single layout that renders nicely for every situation, Kiali offers a choice of several different layouts. To choose a different layout, you can choose a different *Layout Schema* from the *Graph Settings* menu.

* {ProductName} does not support installation on a restricted network.

[NOTE]
====
While Kafka publisher is included in the release as part of Jaeger, it is not supported.

== {ProductName} known issues

These are the known issues in {ProductName}:

* link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821432[Bug 1821432] Toggle controls in {product-title} Control Resource details page do not update the CR correctly. UI Toggle controls in the Service Mesh Control Plane (SMCP) Overview page in the {product-title} web console sometimes update the wrong field in the resource. To update a SMCP, edit the YAML content directly or update the resource from the command line instead of clicking the toggle controls. 

* link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4970771[Jaeger/Kiali Operator upgrade blocked with operator pending] When upgrading the Jaeger or Kiali Operators with Service Mesh 1.0.x installed, the operator status shows as Pending. There is a solution in progress and a workaround. See the linked Knowledge Base article for more information.

* link:https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/14743[Istio-14743] Due to limitations in the version of Istio that this release of {ProductName} is based on, there are several applications that are currently incompatible with {ProductShortName}. See the linked community issue for details.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-681[MAISTRA-681] and link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2686[KIALI-2686] When the control plane has many namespaces, it can lead to performance issues.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-465[MAISTRA-465] The Maistra operator fails to create a service for operator metrics.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-453[MAISTRA-453] If you create a new project and deploy pods immediately, sidecar injection does not occur. The operator fails to add the `maistra.io/member-of` before the pods are created, therefore the pods must be deleted and recreated for sidecar injection to occur.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-193[MAISTRA-193] Unexpected console info messages are visible when health checking is enabled for citadel.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-158[MAISTRA-158] Applying multiple gateways referencing the same hostname will cause all gateways to stop functioning.

If the `istio-operator` pod is evicted while deploying the control pane, delete the evicted `istio-operator` pod.

== Kiali known issues

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3262[KIALI-3262] In the Kiali console, when you click on Distributed Tracing in the navigation or on a Traces tab, you are asked to accept the certificate, and then asked to provide your OpenShift login credentials. This happens due to an issue with how the framework displays the Trace pages in the Console. The Workaround is to open the URL for the Jaeger console in another browser window and log in. Then you can view the embedded tracing pages in the Kiali console.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3239[KIALI-3239] If a Kiali Operator pod has failed with a status of “Evicted” it blocks the Kiali operator from deploying. The workaround is to delete the Evicted pod and redeploy the Kiali operator.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3118[KIALI-3118] After changes to the ServiceMeshMemberRoll, for example adding or removing projects, the Kiali pod restarts and then displays errors on the Graph page while the Kiali pod is restarting.

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2206[KIALI-2206] When you are accessing the Kiali console for the first time, and there is no cached browser data for Kiali, the “View in Grafana” link on the Metrics tab of the Kiali Service Details page redirects to the wrong location. The only way you would encounter this issue is if you are accessing Kiali for the first time.

* link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/507[KIALI-507] Kiali does not support Internet Explorer 11. This is because the underlying frameworks do not support Internet Explorer. To access the Kiali console, use one of the two most recent versions of the Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari browser.
