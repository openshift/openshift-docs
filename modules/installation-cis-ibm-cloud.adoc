= Using IBM Cloud Internet Services for DNS resolution

The installation program uses IBM Cloud Internet Services (CIS) to configure cluster DNS resolution and provide name lookup for a public cluster.

[NOTE]
====
This offering does not support IPv6, so dual stack or IPv6 environments are not possible.
====

You must create a domain zone in CIS in the same account as your cluster. You must also ensure the zone is authoritative for the domain. You can do this using a root domain or subdomain.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the link:https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cli[IBM Cloud CLI].
* You have an existing domain and registrar. For more information, see the IBM link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dns?topic=dns-getting-started[documentation].

.Procedure

. Create a CIS instance to use with your cluster:

.. Install the CIS plugin:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud plugin install cis
----

.. Create the CIS instance:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud cis instance-create <instance_name> standard <1>
----
<1> At a minimum, a `Standard` plan is required for CIS to manage the cluster subdomain and its DNS records.

. Connect an existing domain to your CIS instance:

.. Set the context instance for CIS:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud cis instance-set <instance_crn> <1>
----
<1> The instance cloud resource name.

.. Add the domain for CIS:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud cis domain-add <domain_name> <1>
----
<1> The fully qualified domain name. You can use either the root domain or subdomain value as the domain name, depending on which you plan to configure.
+
[NOTE]
====
A root domain uses the form `openshiftcorp.com`. A subdomain uses the form `clusters.openshiftcorp.com`.
====

. Open the link:https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/internet-services[CIS web console], navigate to the *Overview* page, and note your CIS name servers. These name servers will be used in the next step.

. Configure the name servers for your domains or subdomains at the domain's registrar or DNS provider. For more information, see the IBM Cloud link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-getting-started#configure-your-name-servers-with-the-registrar-or-existing-dns-provider[documentation].
