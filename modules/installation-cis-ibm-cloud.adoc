= Configuring DNS resolution using Cloud Internet Services

IBM Cloud Internet Services (CIS) is used by the installation program to configure cluster DNS resolution and provide name lookup for the cluster to external resources. Only public DNS is supported with IBM Cloud VPC.

[NOTE]
====
IBM Cloud VPC does not support IPv6, so dual stack or IPv6 environments are not possible.
====

You must create a domain zone in CIS in the same account as your cluster. You must also ensure the zone is authoritative for the domain. You can do this using a root domain or subdomain.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the link:https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cli[IBM Cloud CLI].

.Procedure

. If you do not already have an existing domain and registrar, you must acquire them. For more information, see IBM's link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dns?topic=dns-getting-started[documentation].

. Create a CIS instance to use with your cluster.

.. Install the CIS plugin:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud plugin install cis
----

.. Create the CIS instance:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud cis instance-create <instance_name> standard <1>
----
<1> At a minimum, a `Standard` plan is required for CIS to manage the cluster subdomain and its DNS records.

. Connect an existing domain to your CIS instance.

.. Set the context instance for CIS:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud cis instance-set <instance_crn> <1>
----
<1> The instance cloud resource name.

.. Add the domain for CIS:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud cis domain-add <domain_name> <1>
----
<1> The fully qualified domain name. You can use either the root domain or subdomain value as the domain name, depending on which you plan to configure.
+
[NOTE]
====
A root domain uses the form `openshiftcorp.com`. A subdomain uses the form `clusters.openshiftcorp.com`.
====

. Open the link:https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/internet-services[CIS web console], navigate to the *Overview* page, and note your CIS name servers. These name servers will be used in the next step.

. Configure the name servers for your domains or subdomains at the domain's registrar or DNS provider. For more information, see IBM Cloud's link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-getting-started#configure-your-name-servers-with-the-registrar-or-existing-dns-provider[documentation].
