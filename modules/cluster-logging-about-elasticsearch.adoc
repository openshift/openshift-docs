= About the log store 

{product-title} uses link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch (ES)] to organize the log data from Fluentd into datastores, or _indices_. 

Elasticsearch subdivides each index into multiple pieces called _shards_, which it spreads across a set of Elasticsearch nodes in an Elasticsearch cluster.
You can configure Elasticsearch to make copies of the shards, called _replicas_. Elasticsearch also spreads these replicas across
the Elasticsearch nodes. The `ClusterLogging`allows you to specify the replication policy in theDefinition (CRD) to provide data redundancy and resilience to failure.

The cluster logging Elasticsearch instance is optimized and tested for short term storage of approximately seven days. If you want to retain your logs over a longer term, it is recommended that you move the data to a third-party storage system. 

[NOTE]
====
The number of primary shards for the index templates is equal to the number of Elasticsearch data nodes.
====

The Cluster Logging Operator and companion Elasticsearch Operator ensure that each Elasticsearch node is deployed using a unique environment that includes its own storage volume.
You can use a `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) to increase the number of Elasticsearch nodes.
Refer to
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/hardware.html[Elastic's
documentation] for considerations involved in choosing storage and
network location as directed below.

[NOTE]
====
A highly-available Elasticsearch environment requires at least three Elasticsearch nodes,
each on a different host.
====

Role-based access control (RBAC) applied on the Elasticsearch indices enables the controlled access of the logs to the developers. Access to the indexes with the `project.{project_name}.{project_uuid}.*` format is restricted based on the permissions of the user in the specific project.
