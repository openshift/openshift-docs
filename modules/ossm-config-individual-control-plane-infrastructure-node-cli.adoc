[id="ossm-config-individual-control-plane-infrastructure-node-cli_{context}"]
= Configuring individual control plane components to run on infrastructure nodes using the CLI

Perform this task if individual components deployed by the {SMProductShortName} control plane will run on infrastructure nodes. These deployed components include Istiod, the Ingress Gateway, and the Egress Gateway.

If the control plane will run on a worker node, skip this task.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator.
ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to {product-title} as`cluster-admin`.

.Procedure

. Open the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource as a YAML file.

----
$ oc -n istio-system edit smcp <name> <1>
----
<1>  `<name>` represents the name of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

. To run the Istiod component on an infrastructure node, add the `nodeSelector` and the `tolerations` fields to the `spec.runtime.components.pilot.pod` spec in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.
