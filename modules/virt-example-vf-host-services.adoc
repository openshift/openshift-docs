= Example: Node network configuration policy for virtual functions (Technology Preview)

Update host network settings for Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) network virtual functions (VF) in an existing cluster by applying a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest.

:FeatureName: Updating host network settings for SR-IOV network VFs
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

You can apply a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest to an existing cluster to complete the following tasks:

* Configure QoS or MTU host network settings for VFs to optimize performance.
* Add, remove, or update VFs for a network interface.
* Manage VF bonding configurations.

[NOTE]
====
To update host network settings for SR-IOV VFs by using NMState on physical functions that are also managed through the SR-IOV Network Operator, you must set the `externallyManaged` parameter in the relevant `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` resource to `true`. For more information, see the _Additional resources_ section.
====

The following YAML file is an example of a manifest that defines QoS policies for a VF.
This file includes samples values that you must replace with your own information.

The following YAML file is an example of a manifest that creates a VLAN interface on top of a VF and adds it to a bonded network interface.
It includes samples values that you must replace with your own information.
