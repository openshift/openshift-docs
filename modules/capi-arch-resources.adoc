= Cluster API primary resources

The Cluster API consists of the following primary resources. For the Technology Preview of this feature, you must create these resources manually in the `openshift-cluster-api` namespace.

Cluster:: A fundamental unit that represents a cluster that is managed by the Cluster API.

Infrastructure:: A provider-specific resource that defines properties that are shared by all the compute machine sets in the cluster, such as the region and subnets.

Machine template:: A provider-specific template that defines the properties of the machines that a compute machine set creates.

Machine set:: A group of machines.
+
Compute machine sets are to machines as replica sets are to pods.
To add machines or scale them down, change the `replicas` field on the compute machine set custom resource to meet your compute needs.
+
With the Cluster API, a compute machine set references a `Cluster` object and a provider-specific machine template.

Machine:: A fundamental unit that describes the host for a node.
+
The Cluster API creates machines based on the configuration in the machine template.
