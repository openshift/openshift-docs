[NOTE]
====
If an application requires permissions to the active Service Account to access the {product-title} namespace and delete active pods, the following error may occur when looking at `odo log` from the back-end component:

`Message: Forbidden!Configured service account doesn't have access. Service account may have been revoked`

To resolve this error, add permissions for the Service Account role:

----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n <project>
$ oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts -n <project>
----

Do not do this on a production cluster.
