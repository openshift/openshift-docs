= Release Notes for Red Hat {ServerlessProductName} 1.7.0

[id="new-features-1-7-0_{context}"]
== New features
* {ServerlessProductName} 1.7.0 is now Generally Available (GA) on {product-title} 4.3 and newer versions. In previous versions, {ServerlessProductName} was a Technology Preview.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving 0.13.2.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving Operator 0.13.2.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative `kn` CLI 0.13.2.
* Knative `kn` CLI downloads now support disconnected, or restricted network installations.
* Knative `kn` CLI libraries are now signed by Red Hat.
* Knative Eventing is now available as a Technology Preview with {ServerlessProductName}. {ServerlessProductName} uses Knative Eventing 0.13.2.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before upgrading to the latest Serverless release, you must remove the community Knative Eventing Operator if you have previously installed it. Having the Knative Eventing Operator installed will prevent you from being able to install the latest Technology Preview version of Knative Eventing that is included with {ServerlessProductName} 1.7.0.
====

* High availability (HA) is now enabled by default for the `autoscaler-hpa`, `controller`, `activator` , `kourier-control`, and `kourier-gateway` components.
+
If you have installed a previous version of {ServerlessProductName}, after the KnativeServing custom resource (CR) is updated, the deployment will default to a HA configuration with `KnativeServing.spec.high-availability.replicas = 2`.
+
You can disable HA for these components by completing the procedure in the _Configuring high availability components_ documentation.
* {ServerlessProductName} now supports the `trustedCA` setting in {product-title}'s cluster-wide proxy, and is now fully compatible with {product-title}'s proxy settings.
* {ServerlessProductName} now supports HTTPS using the wildcard certificate that is registered for {product-title} routes. For more information on `http` and `https` on Knative Serving, see the documentation on _Verifying your serverless application deployment_.

[id="fixed-issues-1-7-0_{context}"]
== Fixed issues
* In previous versions, requesting KnativeServing custom resources (CRs) without specifying an API group, for example, `oc get knativeserving -n knative-serving`, occasionally caused errors. This issue is fixed in {ServerlessProductName} 1.7.0.
* In previous versions, the Knative Serving controller was not notified when a new service CA certificate was generated due to service CA certificate rotation. New revisions created after a service CA certificate rotation were failing with the error:
+

[source,terminal]
----
Revision "foo-1" failed with message: Unable to fetch image "image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/eap/eap-app": failed to resolve image to digest: failed to fetch image information: Get https://image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/v2/: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority.
----

+
The {ServerlessOperatorName} now restarts the Knative Serving controller whenever a new service CA certificate is generated, which ensures that the controller is always configured to use the current service CA certificate. For more information, see the {product-title} documentation on _Securing service traffic using service serving certificate secrets_ under _Authentication_.

[id="known-issues-1-7-0_{context}"]
== Known issues
* When upgrading from {ServerlessProductName} 1.6.0 to 1.7.0, support for HTTPS requires a change to the format of routes. Knative services created on {ServerlessProductName} 1.6.0 are no longer reachable at the old format URLs. You must retrieve the new URL for each service after upgrading {ServerlessProductName}. For more information, see the documentation on _Upgrading OpenShift Serverless_.
* If you are using Knative Eventing on an Azure cluster, it is possible that the `imc-dispatcher` pod may not start. This is due to the pod's default `resources` settings. As a work-around, you can remove the `resources` settings.
* If you have 1000 Knative services on a cluster, and then perform a reinstall or upgrade of Knative Serving, there will be a delay when you create the first new service after KnativeServing becomes Ready.
+
`3scale-kourier-control` reconciles all previous Knative services before processing the creation of a new service, which causes the new service to spend approximately 800 seconds in an `IngressNotConfigured` or `Unknown` state before the state will update to `Ready`.
