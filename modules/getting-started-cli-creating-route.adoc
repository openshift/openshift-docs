= Exposing the front-end service

By default, services running on {product-title} are not accessible externally.

To expose your service so that external clients can access it, you can create a _route_. A `Route` object is a {product-title} networking resource similar to a Kubernetes `Ingress` object. The default {product-title} router (HAProxy) uses the HTTP header of the incoming request to determine where to proxy the connection.

Optionally, you can define security, such as TLS, for the route.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed the `parksmap` front-end application.
* You have `cluster-admin` or project-level `admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* Create a route to expose the `parksmap` front-end application by running the following command:

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create route edge parksmap --service=parksmap
----

.Verification

* Verify that the application route was successfully created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get route parksmap
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
