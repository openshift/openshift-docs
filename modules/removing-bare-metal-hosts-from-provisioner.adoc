= Removing bare metal hosts from the provisioner node

In certain circumstances, you might want to temporarily remove bare metal hosts from the provisioner node.
For example, during provisioning when a bare metal host reboot is triggered by using the {product-title} administration console or as a result of a Machine Config Pool update, {product-title} logs into the integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDrac) and issues a delete of the job queue.

To prevent the management of the number of `Machine` objects that matches the number of available `BareMetalHost` objects, add a `baremetalhost.metal3.io/detached` annotation to the `MachineSet` object.
[NOTE]
====
This annotation has an effect for only `BareMetalHost` objects that are in either `Provisioned`, `ExternallyProvisioned` or `Ready/Available` state.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install {op-system} bare metal compute machines for use in the cluster and create corresponding `BareMetalHost` objects.
* Install the {product-title} CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Annotate the compute machine set that you want to remove from the provisioner node by adding the `baremetalhost.metal3.io/detached` annotation.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api 'baremetalhost.metal3.io/detached'
----
+
Wait for the new machines to start.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you use a `BareMetalHost` object to create a machine in the cluster and labels or selectors are subsequently changed on the `BareMetalHost`, the `BareMetalHost` object continues be counted against the `MachineSet` that the `Machine` object was created from.
====

. In the provisioning use case, remove the annotation after the reboot is complete by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api 'baremetalhost.metal3.io/detached-'
