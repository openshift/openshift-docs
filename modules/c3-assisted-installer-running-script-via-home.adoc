. Create `OpenShift\createResourceOnHomeRegion` folders.

. Copy the `createInfraResources.tf` and `terraform.tfvars` files from the C3_PCA GitHub repository into the `createResourceOnHomeRegion` folder.

. Ensure that you have access to the source environment, and that your C3 certificate has been exported.

. Run the `createInfraResources.tf` Terraform script.
