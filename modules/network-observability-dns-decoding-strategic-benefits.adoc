= Strategic benefits of DNS resolution analysis

[role="_abstract"]
Use DNS resolution analysis to differentiate between network transport failures and service discovery issues by enriching eBPF flow records with domain names and status codes.

Standard flow logs only show that traffic occurred on port 53. DNS decoding allows you to complete the following tasks:

* Reduced Mean Time to Identification (MTTI): Distinguish immediately between a network routing failure and a DNS resolution failure, such as an `NXDOMAIN` error.
* Measure internal service latency: Track the time it takes for CoreDNS to respond to specific internal lookups (e.g., `my-service.namespace.svc.cluster.local`).
* Audit external dependencies: Audit which external APIs or third-party domains your workloads are communicating with without requiring sidecars or manual packet captures.
* Improved security posture: Detect potential data exfiltration or Command and Control (C2) activity by auditing the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) queried by internal workloads.
* Architectural efficiency: Analyze the *DNS Class* to ensure traffic follows expected Internet (IN) protocols and identify legacy or non-standard configurations.

== DNS flow enrichment
When this feature is active, the eBPF agent enriches the flow record with a `dns_properties` object. This metadata allows you to group and filter traffic by the intent of the connection (the domain) rather than just the destination IP.

//follows JTBD framework, Vale/DITA compliant

== Understanding enhanced DNS decoding
Enhanced DNS decoding allows the eBPF agent to inspect UDP and TCP traffic on port 53. While standard network flows identify traffic only by IP address and port, decoded DNS flows provide the specific intent of the request.
