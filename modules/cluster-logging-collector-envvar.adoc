= Configuring the logging collector using environment variables

You can use environment variables to modify the
configuration of the Fluentd log collector.

See the link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging/blob/master/fluentd/README.md[Fluentd README] in Github for lists of the
available environment variables.

.Prerequisite

* Set cluster logging to the unmanaged state. Operators in an unmanaged state are unsupported and the cluster administrator assumes full control of the individual component configurations and upgrades.

.Procedure

Set any of the Fluentd environment variables as needed:

----
oc set env ds/fluentd <env-var>=<value>
----

For example:

----
oc set env ds/fluentd LOGGING_FILE_AGE=30
----
