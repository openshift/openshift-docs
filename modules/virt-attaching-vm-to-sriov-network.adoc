= Attaching a virtual machine to an SR-IOV network

You can attach the virtual machine to the SR-IOV network by including the network details in the virtual machine configuration. 

.Procedure

. Include the SR-IOV network details in the `spec.domain.devices.interfaces` and `spec.networks` of the virtual machine configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: VirtualMachine
...
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:
      - name: <default> <1>
        masquerade: {} <2>
      - name: <nic1> <3>
        sriov: {}
  networks:
  - name: <default> <4>
    pod: {}
  - name: <nic1> <5>
    multus:
        networkName: <sriov-network> <6>
...
----
<1> A unique name for the interface that is connected to the Pod network.
<2> The `masquerade` binding to the default Pod network.
<3> A unique name for the SR-IOV interface.
<4> The name of the Pod network interface. This must be the same as the `interfaces.name` that you defined earlier.
<5> The name of the SR-IOV interface. This must be the same as the `interfaces.name` that you defined earlier.
<6> The name of the SR-IOV network attachment definition.

. Apply the virtual machine configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <vm-sriov.yaml> <1>
----
<1> The name of the virtual machine YAML file.
