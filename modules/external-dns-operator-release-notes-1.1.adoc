Bug fixes:

* Previously, the ExternalDNS Operator enforced an empty `defaultMode` value for volumes, which caused constant updates due to a conflict with the OpenShift API. Now, the `defaultMode` value is not enforced and operand deployment does not update constantly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2793[OCPBUGS-2793])
