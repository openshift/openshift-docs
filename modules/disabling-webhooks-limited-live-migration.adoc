= Setting webhook timeouts for the limited live migration

The limited live migration from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kuberenetes can stall and fail if active admission webhooks are present on the cluster. You must set a timeout value for each webhook before initiating the limited live migration.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Obtain a list of webhooks by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get validatingwebhookconfiguration
----

. Set the timeout value for each webhook to 3 seconds by specifying the timeout value for the `timeoutSeconds` parameter:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch ValidatingWebhookConfiguration <webhook_name> --type='json' \ <1>
-p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/webhooks/0/timeoutSeconds", "value": 3}]'
----
<1> Where `<webhook_name>` is the name of your webhook.
