= About adding projects to a service mesh

After installing the Operators and creating the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, add one or more projects to the service mesh.

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title}, a project is essentially a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, such as the range of user IDs that can be used in the project. Typically, the {product-title} web console uses the term project, and the CLI uses the term namespace, but the terms are essentially synonymous.
====

You can add projects to an existing service mesh using either the {product-title} web console or the CLI. There are three methods to add a project to a service mesh:

* Specifying the project name in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.

* Configuring label selectors in the `spec.labelSelectors` field of the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.

* Creating the `ServiceMeshMember` resource in the project.

If you use the first method, then you must create the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.
