= Using Source-to-Image (S2I) BuildConfig environment

You can add environment variables to the `sourceStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig`. The environment variables defined there are visible during the `assemble` script execution and will be defined in the output image, making them also available to the `run` script and application code.

.Procedure

* For example, to disable assets compilation for your Rails application:

[source,yaml]
----
sourceStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION"
      value: "true"
----

.Additional resources

* The Build environment section provides more advanced instructions.
* You can also manage environment variables defined in the `BuildConfig` with the `oc set env` command.
