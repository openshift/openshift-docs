= Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects

Cluster administrators can enable monitoring for user-defined projects by setting the `enableUserWorkload: true` field in the cluster monitoring ConfigMap.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {product-title} {product-version} you must remove any custom Prometheus instances before enabling monitoring for user-defined projects.
====

[NOTE]
====
You must have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role to enable monitoring for user-define projects in {product-title}. Cluster administrators can then optionally grant users permission to configure the components that are responsible for monitoring user-defined projects.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have optionally created and configured the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project. You can add configuration options to this ConfigMap for the components that monitor user-defined projects.
+
[NOTE]
====
Every time you save configuration changes to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap, the pods in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project are redeployed. It can sometimes take a while for these components to redeploy. You can create and configure the ConfigMap before you first enable monitoring for user-defined projects, to prevent having to redeploy the pods often.
====

.Procedure

. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Add `enableUserWorkload: true` under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true <1>
----
<1> When set to `true`, the `enableUserWorkload` parameter enables monitoring for user-defined projects in a cluster.

. Save the file to apply the changes. Monitoring for user-defined projects is then enabled automatically.
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap, the pods and other resources in the `openshift-monitoring` project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
====

. Check that the `prometheus-operator`, `prometheus-user-workload` and `thanos-ruler-user-workload` pods are running in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project. It might take a short while for the pods to start:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get pod
----
+
