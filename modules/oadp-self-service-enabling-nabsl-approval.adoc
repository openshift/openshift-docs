= Enabling NonAdminBackupStorageLocation administrator approval workflow

The `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` (NABSL) custom resource (CR) administrator approval workflow is an opt-in feature. As a cluster administrator, you must explicitly enable the feature in the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) CR by setting the `nonAdmin.requireApprovalForBSL` field to `true`.

You also need to set the `noDefaultBackupLocation` field in the DPA CR to `true`. This setting indicates that, there is no default backup storage location configured in the DPA CR and the namespace admin user can create a NABSL CR and send the CR request for approval.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* You have enabled {oadp-short} Self-Service in the `DataProtectionApplication` CR.

.Procedure

* To enable the NABSL administrator approval workflow, edit the DPA CR by using the following example configuration:
