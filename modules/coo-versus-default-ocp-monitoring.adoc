[id="coo-versus-default-ocp-monitoring_{context}"]
= {coo-short} compared to default monitoring stack

The {coo-short} components function independently of the default in-cluster monitoring stack, which is deployed and managed by the {cmo-first}.
Monitoring stacks deployed by the two Operators do not conflict. You can use a {coo-short} monitoring stack in addition to the default platform monitoring components deployed by the {cmo-short}.

The key differences between {coo-short} and the default in-cluster monitoring stack are shown in the following table:

[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Feature      | {coo-short}      | Default monitoring stack

| **Scope and integration**
| Offers comprehensive monitoring and analytics for enterprise-level needs, covering cluster and workload performance. 

However, it lacks direct integration with {product-title} and typically requires an external Grafana instance for dashboards.
| Limited to core components within the cluster, for example, API server and etcd, and to OpenShift-specific namespaces. 

There is deep integration into {product-title} including console dashboards and alert management in the console.

| **Configuration and customization**
| Broader configuration options including data retention periods, storage methods, and collected data types. 

The {coo-short} can delegate ownership of single configurable fields in custom resources to users by using Server-Side Apply (SSA), which enhances customization.
| Built-in configurations with limited customization options. 

| **Data retention and storage**
| Long-term data retention, supporting historical analysis and capacity planning
| Shorter data retention times, focusing on short-term monitoring and real-time detection.
