Apply a configuration to a resource by file name or stdin

.Example usage
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

  oc apply -k dir/

  # Apply the JSON passed into stdin to a pod
  cat pod.json | oc apply -f -

  # Apply the configuration from all files that end with '.json' - i.e. expand wildcard characters in file names
  oc apply -f '*.json'

  # Note: --prune is still in Alpha
  # Apply the configuration in manifest.yaml that matches label app=nginx and delete all other resources that are not in the file and match label app=nginx
  oc apply --prune -f manifest.yaml -l app=nginx

  # Apply the configuration in manifest.yaml and delete all the other config maps that are not in the file
  oc apply --prune -f manifest.yaml --all --prune-whitelist=core/v1/ConfigMap
