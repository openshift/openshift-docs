= BMC addressing for HPE iLO

[role="_abstract"]
You can connect to an HPE iLO system using the Redfish virtual media protocol, the Redfish network boot protocol, or the IPMI protocol.

The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the {product-title} cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

|Protocol|Address Format
|Redfish virtual media| `redfish-virtualmedia://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1`
|Redfish network boot| `redfish://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1`
|IPMI| `ipmi://<out_of_band_ip>`

== Redfish virtual media for HPE iLO

To enable Redfish virtual media for HPE servers, use `redfish-virtualmedia://` in the `address` setting. The following example demonstrates using Redfish virtual media within the `install-config.yaml` file.

platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish-virtualmedia://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

It is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the out-of-band management addresses. For {product-title} 4.16 and earlier, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. For {product-title} 4.17 and later, you can include `disableCertificateVerification: False` when used in conjunction with the `bmcCACert` parameter.

The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration by using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: True

The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration by using the `disableCertificateVerification: False` configuration parameter along with the `bmcCACert` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

          disableCertificateVerification: False

[NOTE]
====
Redfish virtual media is not supported on 9th generation systems running iLO4, because Ironic does not support iLO4 with virtual media.

== Redfish network boot for HPE iLO

To enable Redfish, use `redfish://` or `redfish+http://` to disable TLS. The installation program requires both the hostname or the IP address and the path to the system ID. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.
