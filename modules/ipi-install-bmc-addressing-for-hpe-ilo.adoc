= BMC addressing for HPE iLO

The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the {product-title} cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: <host name>

<1> The `address` configuration setting specifies the protocol.

For HPE integrated Lights Out (iLO), Red Hat supports Redfish virtual media, Redfish network boot, and IPMI.

.BMC address formats for HPE iLO
[frame="topbot",options="header"]
|====
|Protocol|Address Format
|Redfish virtual media| `redfish-virtualmedia://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1`
|Redfish network boot| `redfish://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1`
|IPMI| `ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>`

See the following sections for additional details.

.Redfish virtual media for HPE iLO

To enable Redfish virtual media for HPE servers, use `redfish-virtualmedia://` in the `address` setting. The following example demonstrates using Redfish virtual media within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish-virtualmedia://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

While it is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the out-of-band management addresses, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: True
----

[NOTE]
====
Redfish virtual media is not supported on 9th generation systems running iLO4, because Ironic does not support iLO4 with virtual media.

.Redfish network boot for HPE iLO

To enable Redfish, use `redfish://` or `redfish+http://` to disable TLS. The installer requires both the host name or the IP address and the path to the system ID. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.
