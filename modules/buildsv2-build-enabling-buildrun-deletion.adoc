= Enabling BuildRun deletion

A `Build` can automatically delete a related `BuildRun` object. To enable this feature, you set the `build.shipwright.io/build-run-deletion` annotation to `true` in the `Build` instance. This annotation is not present in a `Build` definition by default.

.Prerequisites

* You have a `Build` definition.

.Procedure

* In a `Build` definition, set the  `build.shipwright.io/build-run-deletion` annotation to `true`.
