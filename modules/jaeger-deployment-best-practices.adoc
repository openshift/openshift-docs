= Deployment best practices
:pantheon-module-type: CONCEPT


* Jaeger instance names must be unique. If you want to have multiple Jaeger instances and are using sidecar injected Jaeger agents, then the Jaeger instances should have unique names, and the injection annotation should explicitly specify the Jaeger instance name the tracing data should be reported to.

* If you have a multitenant implementation and tenants are separated by namespaces, deploy a Jaeger instance to each tenant namespace.

** Jaeger agent as a daemonset is not supported for multitenant installations or OpenShift Dedicated. Jaeger agent as a sidecar is the only supported configuration for these use cases.

* If you are installing Jaeger as part of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh, Jaeger resources must be installed in the same namespace as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.
