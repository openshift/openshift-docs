= How the live migration process works

The following table summarizes the live migration process by segmenting between the user-initiated steps in the process and the actions that the migration script performs in response.

| Add the `unsupported-red-hat-internal-testing` annotation to the cluster-level network configuration. 
| The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) acknowledges the unsupported testing environment.

Cluster Network Operator (CNO)::
+
--
* Sets migration-related fields in the `network.operator` custom resource (CR) and waits for routable MTUs to be applied to all nodes.
* Patches the `network.operator` CR to set the migration mode to `Live` for OVN-Kubernetes and deploys the OpenShift SDN network plugin in migration mode.
* Deploys OVN-Kubernetes with hybrid overlay enabled, ensuring that no racing conditions occur.
* Waits for the OVN-Kubernetes deployment and updates the conditions in the status of the `network.config` CR.
* Triggers the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to apply the new machine config to each machine config pool, which includes node cordoning, draining, and rebooting.
* OVN-Kubernetes adds nodes to the appropriate zones and recreates pods using OVN-Kubernetes as the default CNI plugin.
* Removes migration-related fields from the network.operator CR and performs cleanup actions, such as deleting OpenShift SDN resources and redeploying OVN-Kubernetes in normal mode with the necessary configurations.
* Waits for the OVN-Kubernetes redeployment and updates the status conditions in the `network.config` CR to indicate migration completion. If your migration is blocked, see "Checking live migration metrics" for information on troubleshooting the issue.

If a rollback to OpenShift SDN is required, the following table describes the process.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must wait until the migration process from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes network plugin is successful before initiating a rollback.

|User-initiated steps|Migration activity

|Suspend the MCO to ensure that it does not interrupt the migration.
|The MCO stops.

|
Set the `migration` field of the `Network.operator.openshift.io` custom resource (CR) named `cluster` to `OpenShiftSDN`. Make sure the `migration` field is `null` before setting it to a value.
|
CNO:: Updates the status of the `Network.config.openshift.io` CR named `cluster` accordingly.

|Update the `networkType` field.
|
CNO:: Performs the following actions:
+
--
* Destroys the OVN-Kubernetes control plane pods.
* Deploys the OpenShift SDN control plane pods.
* Updates the Multus objects to reflect the new network plugin.
--

|
Reboot each node in the cluster.
|
Cluster:: As nodes reboot, the cluster assigns IP addresses to pods on the OpenShift-SDN network.

|
Enable the MCO after all nodes in the cluster reboot.
|
MCO:: Rolls out an update to the systemd configuration necessary for OpenShift SDN; the MCO updates a single machine per pool at a time by default, so the total time the migration takes increases with the size of the cluster.
