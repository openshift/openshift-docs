= How the live migration process works

The following table summarizes the live migration process by segmenting between the user-initiated steps in the process and the actions that the migration script performs in response.

| Add the `unsupported-red-hat-internal-testing` annotation to the cluster-level network configuration. 
| The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) acknowledges the unsupported testing environment.

| Patch the cluster-level networking configuration by changing the `networkType` from `OpenShiftSDN` to `OVNKubernetes`.

* Sets migration related fields in the `network.operator` custom resource (CR) and waits for routable MTUs to be applied to all nodes.
* Patches the `network.operator` CR to set the migration mode to `Live` for OVN-Kubernetes and deploys the OpenShift SDN network plugin in migration mode.
* Deploys OVN-Kubernetes with hybrid overlay enabled, ensuring that no racing conditions occur.
* Waits for the OVN-Kubernetes deployment and updates the conditions in the status of the `network.config` CR.
* Triggers the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to apply the new machine config to each machine config pool, which includes node cordoning, draining, and rebooting.
* OVN-Kubernetes adds nodes to the appropriate zones and recreates pods using OVN-Kubernetes as the default CNI plugin.
* Removes migration-related fields from the network.operator CR and performs cleanup actions, such as deleting OpenShift SDN resources and redeploying OVN-Kubernetes in normal mode with the necessary configurations.
* Waits for the OVN-Kubernetes redeployment and updates the status conditions in the `network.config` CR to indicate migration completion. If your migration is blocked, see "Checking live migration metrics" for information on troubleshooting the issue.
