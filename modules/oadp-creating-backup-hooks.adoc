= Creating backup hooks

You create backup hooks to run commands in a container in a pod by editing the `Backup` custom resource (CR).

_Pre_ hooks run before the pod is backed up. _Post_ hooks run after the backup.

.Procedure

* Add a hook to the `spec.hooks` block of the `Backup` CR, as in the following example:

<1> Optional: You can specify namespaces to which the hook applies. If this value is not specified, the hook applies to all namespaces.
<2> Optional: You can specify namespaces to which the hook does not apply.
<3> Currently, pods are the only supported resource that hooks can apply to.
<4> Optional: You can specify resources to which the hook does not apply.
<5> Optional: This hook only applies to objects matching the label. If this value is not specified, the hook applies to all namespaces.
<6> Array of hooks to run before the backup.
<7> Optional: If the container is not specified, the command runs in the first container in the pod.
<8> This is the entrypoint for the init container being added.
<9> Allowed values for error handling are `Fail` and `Continue`. The default is `Fail`.
<10> Optional: How long to wait for the commands to run. The default is `30s`.
<11> This block defines an array of hooks to run after the backup, with the same parameters as the pre-backup hooks.
