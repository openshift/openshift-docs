= Creating backup hooks

You create backup hooks to run commands in a container in a pod by editing the `Backup` custom resource (CR).

_Pre_ hooks run before the pod is backed up. _Post_ hooks run after the backup.

.Procedure

* Add a hook to the `spec.hooks` block of the `Backup` CR, as in the following example:

----
<1> Array of namespaces to which the hook applies. If this value is not specified, the hook applies to all namespaces.
<2> Currently, pods are the only supported resource.
<3> Optional: This hook only applies to objects matching the label selector.
<4> Array of hooks to run before the backup.
<5> Optional: If the container is not specified, the command runs in the first container in the pod.
<6> Array of commands that the hook runs.
<7> Allowed values for error handling are `Fail` and `Continue`. The default is `Fail`.
<8> Optional: How long to wait for the commands to run. The default is `30s`.
<9> This block defines an array of hooks to run after the backup, with the same parameters as the pre-backup hooks.
