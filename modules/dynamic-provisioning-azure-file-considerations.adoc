= Considerations when using Azure File

The following file system features are not supported by the default Azure File StorageClass:

* Symlinks
* Hard links
* Extended attributes
* Sparse files
* Named pipes

Additionally, the owner user identifier (UID) of the Azure File mounted directory is different from the process UID of the container. The `uid` mount option can be specified in the StorageClass to define
a specific user identifier to use for the mounted directory.

The following StorageClass demonstrates modifying the user and group identifier, along with enabling symlinks for the mounted directory.
