= Deprecated annotations

The following Operator annotations are deprecated.

[discrete]
== operators.openshift.io/infrastructure-features

Starting in {product-title} 4.14, the `operators.openshift.io/infrastructure-features` group of annotations are deprecated by the group of annotations with the `features.operators.openshift.io` namespace. While you are encouraged to use the newer annotations, both groups are currently accepted when used in parallel.

These annotations detail the infrastructure features that an Operator supports. Users can view and filter by these features when discovering Operators through OperatorHub in the web console or on the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/search?deployed_as=Operator[Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog].

|`csi`
|Operator provides a Container Storage Interface (CSI) Kubernetes plugin.

|`fips`

[IMPORTANT]
====
When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
====

|`proxy-aware`
|Operator supports running on a cluster behind a proxy. Operator accepts the standard proxy environment variables  `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`, which Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) provides to the Operator automatically when the cluster is configured to use a proxy. Required environment variables are passed down to Operands for managed workloads.
