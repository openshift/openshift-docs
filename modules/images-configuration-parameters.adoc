= Image controller configuration parameters

The `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` resource offers the following
configuration parameters.

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`Image`
|Holds cluster-wide information about how to handle images. The canonical, and
only valid name is `cluster`.

`spec`: Holds user-settable values for configuration. You can edit the `spec`
subsection.

`status`: Holds observed values from the cluster.

|`ImageSpec`
|`allowedRegistriesForImport`: Limits the container image registries from which
normal users may import images. Set this list to the registries that you trust
to contain valid images, and that you want applications to be able to
import from. Users with permission to create images or `ImageStreamMappings`
from the API are not affected by this policy. Typically only cluster
administrators will have the appropriate permissions.

`additionalTrustedCA`: A reference to a ConfigMap containing additional CAs that
should be trusted during `ImageStream import`, `pod image pull`,
`openshift-image-registry pullthrough`, and builds.

The namespace for this ConfigMap is `openshift-config`. The format of the
ConfigMap is to use the registry hostname as the key, and the base64-encoded
certificate as the value, for each additional registry CA to trust.

`registrySources`: Contains configuration that determines how the container
runtime should treat individual registries when accessing images for builds and
pods. For instance, whether or not to allow insecure access. It does not contain
configuration for the internal cluster registry.

|`ImageStatus`
|`internalRegistryHostname`: Set by the Image Registry Operator, which controls
the `internalRegistryHostname`. It sets the hostname for the default internal
image registry. The value must be in `hostname[:port]` format. For backward
compatibility, you can still use the `OPENSHIFT_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` environment
variable, but this setting overrides the environment variable.

`externalRegistryHostnames`: Provides the hostnames for the default external
image registry. The external hostname should be set only when the image registry
is exposed externally. The first value is used in `publicDockerImageRepository`
field in ImageStreams. The value must be in `hostname[:port]` format.

|`RegistryLocation`
|Contains a location of the registry specified by the registry domain name.
The domain name might include wildcards.

`domainName`: Specifies a domain name for the registry. In case the registry uses a
non-standard (80 or 443) port, the port should be included in the domain name
as well.

`insecure`: Insecure indicates whether the registry is secure or insecure.
By default, if not otherwise specified, the registry is assumed to be secure.

|`RegistrySources`
|Holds cluster-wide information about how to handle the registries config.

`insecureRegistries`: Registries which do not have a valid TLS certificate or
only support HTTP connections.

`blockedRegistries`: Blacklisted for image pull and push actions. All other
registries are allowed.

`allowedRegistries`: Whitelisted for image pull and push actions. All other
registries are blocked.

Only one of `blockedRegistries` or `allowedRegistries` may be set
