= Account-wide IAM role and policy reference

This section provides details about the account-wide IAM roles and policies that are required for ROSA deployments that use STS, including the Operator policies. It also includes the JSON files that define the policies.

The account-wide roles and policies are specific to an {product-title} minor release version, for example {product-title} 4.17, and are compatible with earlier versions. You can minimize the required STS resources by reusing the account-wide roles and policies for multiple clusters of the same minor version, regardless of their patch version.

[id="rosa-sts-account-wide-roles-and-policies-creation-methods_{context}"]
== Methods of account-wide role creation

You can create account-wide roles by using the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI, `rosa`, or the {cluster-manager-url} guided installation. You can create the roles manually or by using an automatic process that uses predefined names for these roles and polices.

[id="rosa-sts-account-wide-roles-and-policies-creation-methods-manual_{context}"]
=== Manual ocm-role resource creation

You can use the manual creation method if you have the necessary CLI access to create these roles on your system. You can run this option in your desired CLI tool or from {cluster-manager}. After you start the manual creation process, the CLI presents a series of commands for you to run that create the roles and link them to the needed policies.

=== Automatic ocm-role resource creation

If you created an `ocm-role` resource with administrative permissions, you can use the automatic creation method from {cluster-manager}. The ROSA CLI does not require that you have this admin `ocm-role` IAM resource to automatically create these roles and polices. Selecting this method creates the roles and policies that uses the default names.

If you use the ROSA guided installation on {cluster-manager}, you must have created an `ocm-role` resource with administrative permissions in the first step of the guided cluster installation. Without this role, you cannot use the automatic Operator role and policy creation option, but you can still create the cluster and its roles and policies with the manual process.

==== Example CLI output for policies attached to a role 

When a policy is attached to a role, the ROSA CLI displays a confirmation output. The output depends on the type of policy.

* If the policy is a trust policy, the ROSA CLI outputs the role name and the content of the policy.
** For the target role with policy attached, ROSA CLI outputs the role name and the console URL of the target role.

* If the policy is a permission policy, the ROSA CLI outputs the name and public link of this policy or the ARN depending on whether or not the policy is an AWS managed policy or customer-managed policy.
