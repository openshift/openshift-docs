= Thinking model generates delineator prompt

In some cases, thinking or reasoning models produce output that has delineators, such as `THOUGHT` or `reasoning`, to separate the thinking process from the model output that the {ols-long} Service uses to answer your question. 

The {ols-long} Service does not configure the delineator behavior or produce the delineators in the output. The delineator feature is a model configuration setting. Typically, you can disable the feature using one of the following methods:

* Append your question prompt with the specific keyword that the model requires to disable the delineator feature, for example, `/nothink`. For more information, see the documentation for the model you are using.
* Modify the inference server configuration settings to disable the delineator feature. For more information, see the documentation for the inference server or for the model you are using.
