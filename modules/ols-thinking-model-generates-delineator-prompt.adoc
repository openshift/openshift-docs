= Thinking model generates delineator prompt

[role="_abstract"]
Reasoning models use delineators, such as `THOUGHT` or `reasoning`, to distinguish internal thought processes from the final response provided by the {ols-long} Service.

The {ols-long} Service does not configure the delineator behavior or produce the delineators in the output. The delineator feature is a model configuration setting. Typically, you can disable the feature using one of the following methods:

* Append your question prompt with the specific keyword that the model requires to disable the delineator feature, for example, `/nothink`. For more information, see the documentation for the model you are using.
* Modify the inference server configuration settings to disable the delineator feature. For more information, see the documentation for the inference server or for the model you are using.
