[id="cluster-logging-logstore-limits_{context}"]
= Configuring CPU and memory requests for the log store

Each component specification allows for adjustments to both the CPU and memory requests.
You should not have to manually adjust these values as the OpenShift Elasticsearch
Operator sets values sufficient for your environment.

[NOTE]
====
In large-scale clusters, the default memory limit for the Elasticsearch proxy container might not be sufficient, causing the proxy container to be OOMKilled. If you experience this issue, increase the memory requests and limits for the Elasticsearch proxy.
====

Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting though this is *not* recommended for production deployments.
For production use, you should have no less than the default 16Gi allocated to each pod. Preferably you should allocate as much as possible, up to 64Gi per pod.

.Prerequisites

* OpenShift Logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

.Procedure

. Edit the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) in the `openshift-logging` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit ClusterLogging instance
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "instance"
....
spec:
    logStore:
      type: "elasticsearch"
      elasticsearch:
        resources: <1>
          requests:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "64Gi"
        proxy: <2>
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: 100Mi
            requests:
              memory: 100Mi
----
<1> Specify the CPU and memory requests for Elasticsearch as needed. If you leave these values blank,
the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator sets default values that should be sufficient for most deployments. The default values are `16Gi` for the memory request and `1` for the CPU request.
<2> Specify the CPU and memory requests for the Elasticsearch proxy as needed. If you leave these values blank, the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator sets default values that should be sufficient for most deployments. The default values are `256Mi` for the memory request and `100m` for the CPU request.

If you adjust the amount of Elasticsearch memory, you must change both the request value and the limit value.

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: "32Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "8"
          memory: "32Gi"
----

Kubernetes generally adheres the node configuration and does not allow Elasticsearch to use the specified limits.
Setting the same value for the `requests` and `limits` ensures that Elasticsearch can use the memory you want, assuming the node has the memory available.
