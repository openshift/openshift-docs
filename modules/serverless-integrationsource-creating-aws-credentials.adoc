= Creating AWS credentials

To connect to Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources, the `IntegrationSource` requires a Kubernetes Secret that contains valid AWS credentials. You must create this Secret in the same namespace as the `IntegrationSource` resource and must include both the AWS access key and secret key.

.Prerequisites

* You have an AWS account with an access key ID and secret access key that allow access to the Amazon DynamoDB Streams service.
* You have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed and are logged in to the cluster.
* You have identified the namespace in which the `IntegrationSource` resource will be created.

.Procedure

* Create the Secret by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <namespace> create secret generic my-secret \
  --from-literal=aws.accessKey=<accessKey> \
  --from-literal=aws.secretKey=<secretKey>
----
+
Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace where the `IntegrationSource` resource resides, and substitute `<accessKey>` and `<secretKey>` with the corresponding AWS credentials.
