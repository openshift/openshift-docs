= Creating an edge route with a custom certificate

You can configure a secure route using edge TLS termination with a custom
certificate by using the `oc create route` command. With an edge route, the
Ingress Controller terminates TLS encryption before forwarding traffic to the
destination pod. The route specifies the TLS certificate and key that the
Ingress Controller uses for the route.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a certificate/key pair in PEM-encoded files, where the certificate
is valid for the route host.

* You may have a separate CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file that completes
the certificate chain.

* You must have a service that you want to expose.

[NOTE]
====
Password protected key files are not supported. To remove a passphrase from a
key file, use the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ openssl rsa -in password_protected_tls.key -out tls.key
----
====

.Procedure

This procedure creates a `Route` resource with a custom certificate and edge TLS
termination. The following assumes that the certificate/key pair are in the
`tls.crt` and `tls.key` files in the current working directory. You may also
specify a CA certificate if needed to complete the certificate chain.
Substitute the actual path names for `tls.crt`, `tls.key`, and (optionally)
`ca.crt`. Substitute the name of the service that you want to expose
for `frontend`. Substitute the appropriate hostname for `www.example.com`.

* Create a secure `Route` resource using edge TLS termination and a custom certificate.

----
$ oc create route edge --service=frontend --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --ca-cert=ca.crt --hostname=www.example.com

If you examine the resulting `Route` resource, it should look similar to the
following:
