= Creating an edge route with a custom certificate

[role="_abstract"]
To secure traffic by using a custom certificate, configure a route with edge TLS termination by running the `oc create route` command. This configuration terminates encryption at the Ingress Controller before forwarding traffic to the destination pod.

The route specifies the TLS certificate and key that the Ingress Controller uses for the route.

The procedure creates a `Route` resource with a custom certificate and edge TLS termination. The procedure assumes that the certificate/key pair are in the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` files in the current working directory. You may also specify a CA certificate if needed to complete the certificate chain. Substitute the actual path names for `tls.crt`, `tls.key`, and (optionally) `ca.crt`. Substitute the name of the service that you want to expose for `frontend`. Substitute the appropriate hostname for `www.example.com`.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a certificate/key pair in PEM-encoded files, where the certificate is valid for the route host.
* You might have a separate CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file that completes the certificate chain.
* You must have a service that you want to expose.

[NOTE]
====
Password protected key files are not supported. To remove a passphrase from a key file, use the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ openssl rsa -in password_protected_tls.key -out tls.key
----

.Procedure

* Create a secure `Route` resource using edge TLS termination and a custom certificate.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create route edge --service=frontend --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --ca-cert=ca.crt --hostname=www.example.com
----

If you examine the resulting `Route` resource, the resource should have a configuration similar to the following example:
