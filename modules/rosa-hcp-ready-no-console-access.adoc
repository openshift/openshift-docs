= Verifying access to {product-title} web console for {hcp-title} cluster in ready state

{hcp-title} clusters return a `ready` status when the control plane hosted in the {product-title} service account becomes ready. Cluster console workloads are deployed on the cluster's worker nodes. The {product-title} web console will not be available and accessible until the worker nodes have joined the cluster and console workloads are running.

If your {hcp-title} cluster is ready but you are unable to access the {product-title} web console for the cluster, wait for the worker nodes to join the cluster and retry accessing the console.

You can either log in to the {hcp-title} cluster or use the `rosa describe machinepool` command in the `rosa` CLI watch the nodes.
