== New Features and Enhancements

////
TOFIX:
=== Log Collection

* This enhancement adds the source `iostream` to the attributes sent from collected container logs. The value is set to either `stdout` or `stderr` based on how the collector received it. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5292[LOG-5292])

* With this update, the default memory limit for the collector increases from 1024 Mi to 2048 Mi. Users should adjust resource limits based on their cluster’s specific needs and specifications. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6072[LOG-6072])

* With this update, users can now set the syslog output delivery mode of the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR to either `AtLeastOnce` or `AtMostOnce.` (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6355[LOG-6355])

=== Log Storage

* With this update, the new `1x.pico` LokiStack size supports clusters with fewer workloads and lower log volumes (up to 50GB/day). (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5939[LOG-5939])
