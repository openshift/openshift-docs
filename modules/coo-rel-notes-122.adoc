== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the installation of the incident detection feature could fail intermittently. The symptoms include the incident detection UI being visible but not including any data. In addition, the health-analyzer `ServiceMonitor` resource is in a failed state, with the error message `tls: failed to verify certificate: x509`. With this update, the incident detection feature installs correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1062[COO-1062])
+
If you are upgrading from 1.2.1 where the bug was occurring, you must recreate the monitoring UI plugin to resolve the issue.
