= Preparing an Agent-based cluster deployment for the multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator while disconnected

You can mirror the required {product-title} container images, the multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator, and the Local Storage Operator (LSO) into your local mirror registry in a disconnected environment.
Ensure that you note the local DNS hostname and port of your mirror registry.

[NOTE]
====
To mirror your {product-title} image repository to your mirror registry, you can use either the `oc adm release image` or `oc mirror` command. In this procedure, the `oc mirror` command is used as an example.
====

.Procedure

. Create an `<assets_directory>` folder to contain valid `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` files. This directory is used to store all the assets.

. To mirror an {product-title} image repository, the multicluster engine, and the LSO, create a `ImageSetConfiguration.yaml` file with the following settings:
+
.Example `ImageSetConfiguration.yaml`

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
  kind: ImageSetConfiguration
  apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
  archiveSize: 4 <1>
  storageConfig: <2>
    imageURL: <your-local-registry-dns-name>:<your-local-registry-port>/mirror/oc-mirror-metadata <3>
    skipTLS: true
  mirror:
    platform:
      architectures:
        - "amd64"
      channels:
        - name: stable-{product-version} <4>
          type: ocp
    additionalImages:
      - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest
    operators:
      - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v{product-version} <5>
        packages: <6>
          - name: multicluster-engine <7>
          - name: local-storage-operator <8>
----
+
<1> Specify the maximum size, in GiB, of each file within the image set.
<2> Set the back-end location to receive the image set metadata. This location can be a registry or local directory. It is required to specify `storageConfig` values.
<3> Set the registry URL for the storage backend.
<4> Set the channel that contains the {product-title} images for the version you are installing.
<5> Set the Operator catalog that contains the {product-title} images that you are installing.
<6> Specify only certain Operator packages and channels to include in the image set. Remove this field to retrieve all packages in the catalog.
<7> The multicluster engine packages and channels.
<8> The LSO packages and channels.
+
[NOTE]
====
This file is required by the `oc mirror` command when mirroring content.
====

. To mirror a specific {product-title} image repository, the multicluster engine, and the LSO, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror --dest-skip-tls --config ocp-mce-imageset.yaml docker://<your-local-registry-dns-name>:<your-local-registry-port>
----

. Update the registry and certificate in the `install-config.yaml` file:
+
.Example `imageContentSources.yaml`

[source,yaml]
----
  imageContentSources:
    - source: "quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release"
      mirrors:
        - "<your-local-registry-dns-name>:<your-local-registry-port>/openshift/release-images"
    - source: "quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev"
      mirrors:
        - "<your-local-registry-dns-name>:<your-local-registry-port>/openshift/release"
    - source: "registry.redhat.io/ubi9"
      mirrors:
        - "<your-local-registry-dns-name>:<your-local-registry-port>/ubi9"
    - source: "registry.redhat.io/multicluster-engine"
      mirrors:
        - "<your-local-registry-dns-name>:<your-local-registry-port>/multicluster-engine"
    - source: "registry.redhat.io/rhel8"
      mirrors:
        - "<your-local-registry-dns-name>:<your-local-registry-port>/rhel8"
    - source: "registry.redhat.io/redhat"
      mirrors:
        - "<your-local-registry-dns-name>:<your-local-registry-port>/redhat"
----
+
Additionally, ensure your certificate is present in the `additionalTrustBundle` field of the `install-config.yaml`.
+
.Example `install-config.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
additionalTrustBundle: |
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  zzzzzzzzzzz
  -----END CERTIFICATE-------
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `oc mirror` command  creates a folder called `oc-mirror-workspace` with several outputs.
This includes the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file that identifies all the mirrors you need for {product-title} and your selected Operators.
====

. Generate the cluster manifests by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install agent create cluster-manifests
----
This command updates the cluster manifests folder to include a `mirror` folder that contains your mirror configuration.
