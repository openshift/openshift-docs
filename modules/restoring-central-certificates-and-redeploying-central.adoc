= Restoring the Central certificates and redeploying Central

You must restore the Central certificates and redeploy Central to ensure that authentication certificates for secured clusters and API tokens remain valid for the redeployed Central instance. 

.Procedure

* Run the `roxctl central generate interactive` command and provide the path to your backup file, which creates a central-bundle folder with the necessary manifests and scripts. 
+
You can then use these files to install Central, ensuring that all your authentication certificates and API tokens remain valid.
