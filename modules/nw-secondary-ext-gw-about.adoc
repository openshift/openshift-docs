= How {product-title} determines the external gateway IP address

You configure a secondary external gateway with the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` custom resource (CR) from the the `k8s.ovn.org` API group. The CR supports static and dynamic approaches to specifying an external gateway's IP address.

Each namespace that a `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` CR targets cannot be selected by any other `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` CR. A namespace cannot have concurrent secondary external gateways.

Changes to policies are isolated in the controller. If a policy fails to apply, changes to other policies do not trigger a retry of other policies. Policies are only re-evaluated, applying any differences that might have occurred by the change, when updates to the policy itself or related objects to the policy such as target namespaces, pod gateways, or namespaces hosting them from dynamic hops are made.

Static assignment:: You specify an IP address directly.
Dynamic assignment:: You specify an IP address indirectly, with namespace and pod selectors, and an optional network attachment definition.

- If the name of a network attachment definition is provided, the external gateway IP address of the network attachment is used.
- If the name of a network attachment definition is not provided, the external gateway IP address for the pod itself is used. However, this approach works only if the pod is configured with `hostNetwork` set to `true`.
