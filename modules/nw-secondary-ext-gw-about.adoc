= How {product-title} determines the external gateway IP address

You configure a secondary external gateway with the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` custom resource from the the `k8s.ovn.org` API group. The custom resource (CR) supports static and dynamic approaches to specifying an external gateway's IP address. Each namespace that a `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` CR targets cannot be selected by any other `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` CR. A namespace cannot have concurrent secondary external gateways.

Static assignment:: You specify an IP address directly.
Dynamic assignment:: You specify an IP address indirectly, with namespace and pod selectors, and an optional network attachment definition.

- If the name of a network attachment definition is provided, the external gateway IP address of the network attachment is used.
- If the name of a network attachment definition is not provided, the external gateway IP address for the pod itself is used. However, this approach works only if the pod is configured with `hostNetwork` set to `true`.
