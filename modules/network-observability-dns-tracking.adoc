= Working with DNS tracking 
Using DNS tracking, you can monitor your network, conduct security analysis, and troubleshoot DNS issues. You can track DNS by editing the `FlowCollector` to the specifications in the following YAML example.

[IMPORTANT]
====
CPU and memory usage increases are observed in the eBPF agent when this feature is enabled.

.Procedure
. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*. 
. Select *cluster* then select the *YAML* tab.
. Configure the `FlowCollector` custom resource. A sample configuration is as follows:

<1> You can set the `spec.agent.ebpf.features` parameter list to enable DNS tracking of each network flow in the web console.
<2> Note that the `spec.agent.ebpf.privileged` specification value must be `true` for DNS tracking to be enabled.

. When you refresh the *Network Traffic* page, there are new DNS representations you can choose to view in the *Overview* and *Traffic Flow* views and new filters you can apply.
.. Select new DNS choices in *Manage panels* to display graphical visualizations and DNS metrics in the *Overview*.
.. Select new choices in *Manage columns* to add DNS columns to the *Traffic Flows* view.
.. Filter on specific DNS metrics, such as *DNS Id*, *DNS Latency* and *DNS Response Code*, and see more information from the side panel.
