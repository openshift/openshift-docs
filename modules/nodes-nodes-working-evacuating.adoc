= Understanding how to evacuate pods on nodes

Evacuating pods allows you to migrate all or selected pods from a given node or
nodes.

You can only evacuate pods backed by a replication controller. The replication controller creates new pods on
other nodes and removes the existing pods from the specified node(s).

Bare pods, meaning those not backed by a replication controller, are unaffected by default.
You can evacuate a subset of pods by specifying a pod-selector. Pod selectors are
based on labels, so all the pods with the specified label will be evacuated.

.Procedure

. Mark the nodes unschedulable before performing the pod evacuation.

.. Mark the node as unschedulable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm cordon <node1>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
node/<node1> cordoned
----

.. Check that the node status is `NotReady,SchedulingDisabled`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get node <node1>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        STATUS                        ROLES     AGE       VERSION
<node1>     NotReady,SchedulingDisabled   worker    1d        v1.23.0
----

. Evacuate the pods using one of the following methods:

** Evacuate all or selected pods on one or more nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain <node1> <node2> [--pod-selector=<pod_selector>]
----

** Force the deletion of bare pods using the `--force` option. When set to
`true`, deletion continues even if there are pods not managed by a replication
controller, replica set, job, daemon set, or stateful set:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain <node1> <node2> --force=true
----

** Set a period  of time in seconds for each Pod to
terminate gracefully, use `--grace-period`. If negative, the default value specified in the Pod will
be used:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain <node1> <node2> --grace-period=-1
----

** Ignore pods managed by daemon sets using the `--ignore-daemonsets` flag set to `true`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain <node1> <node2> --ignore-daemonsets=true
----

** Set the length of time to wait before giving up using the `--timeout` flag. A
value of `0` sets an infinite length of time:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain <node1> <node2> --timeout=5s
----

** Delete pods even if there are pods using emptyDir using the `--delete-local-data` flag set to `true`. Local data is deleted when the node
is drained:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain <node1> <node2> --delete-local-data=true
----

** List objects that will be migrated without actually performing the evacuation,
using the `--dry-run` option set to `true`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain <node1> <node2>  --dry-run=true
----
+
Instead of specifying specific node names (for example, `<node1> <node2>`), you
can use the `--selector=<node_selector>` option to evacuate pods on selected
nodes.

. Mark the node as schedulable when done.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm uncordon <node1>
----
