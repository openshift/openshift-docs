= Embedding workload container images for offline use

To embed container images in devices at the edge that do not have any network connection, you must create a new container, mount the ISO, and then copy the contents into the file system.

.Prerequisites

* You have root access to the host.
* Application RPMs have been added to a blueprint.
* You installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Render the manifests, extract all of the container image references, and translate the application image to blueprint container sources by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc kustomize ~/manifests | grep "image:" | grep -oE '[^ ]+$' | while read line; do echo -e "[[containers]]\nsource = \"${line}\"\n"; done >><my_blueprint>.toml
----

. Push the updated blueprint to image builder by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ sudo composer-cli blueprints push <my_blueprint>.toml
----

. If your workload containers are located in a private repository, you must provide image builder with the necessary pull secrets:

.. Set the `auth_file_path` in the `[containers]` section of the `osbuilder worker` configuration in the `/etc/osbuild-worker/osbuild-worker.toml` file to point to the pull secret.

.. If needed, create a directory and file for the pull secret, for example:
+
.Example directory and file
+
[source,terminal]
----
[containers]
auth_file_path = "/<path>/pull-secret.json" <1>
----
<1> Use the custom location previously set for copying and retrieving images.

. Build the container image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo composer-cli compose start-ostree <my_blueprint> edge-commit
----

. Proceed with your preferred `rpm-ostree` image flow, such as waiting for the build to complete, exporting the image and integrating it into your `rpm-ostree` repository or creating a bootable ISO.
