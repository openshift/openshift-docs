= Configuring high availability replicas for Serving

You can scale Knative Serving components by modifying the `spec.high-availability.replicas` value in the KnativeServing custom resource.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster with cluster administrator permissions.
* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *OperatorHub* -> *Installed Operators*.

.Example YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeServing
metadata:
  name: knative-serving
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  high-availability:
    replicas: 3 <1>
----
<1> Sets the number of replicas to `3`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not modify any YAML contained inside the `config` field. Some of the configuration values in this field are injected by the {ServerlessOperatorName}, and modifying them will cause your deployment to become unsupported.
====
+
* The `replicas` value sets the replica count for all HA controllers.
* The default `replicas` value is `2`.
* You can increase the number of replicas by changing the value to `3` or more.
