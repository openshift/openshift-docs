= Restarting hosted control plane components

If you are an administrator for {hcp}, you can use the `hypershift.openshift.io/restart-date` annotation to restart all control plane components for a particular `HostedCluster` resource. For example, you might need to restart control plane components for certificate rotation.

.Procedure

* To restart a control plane, annotate the `HostedCluster` resource by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate hostedcluster \
  -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> \
  <hosted_cluster_name> \
  hypershift.openshift.io/restart-date=$(date --iso-8601=seconds) <1>
----
<1> The control plane is restarted whenever the value of the annotation changes. The `date` command serves as the source of a unique string. The annotation is treated as a string, not a timestamp.


.Verification

After you restart a control plane, the following {hcp} components are typically restarted:

[NOTE]
====
You might see some additional components restarting as a side effect of changes implemented by the other components.
