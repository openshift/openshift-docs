Virtual machine storage migration is Generally Available

Previously a Technology Preview feature, virtual machine storage migration with {mtc-short} is now considered Generally Available (GA).

This GA status applies when using {VirtProductName} 4.19 and later with {mtc-short} 1.8.9 and later.

{mtc-short} is still required for this functionality in {product-title} 4.19 and 4.20.
