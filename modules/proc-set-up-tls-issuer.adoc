= Add a TLS certificate issuer

[role="_abstract"]
To secure communication to your Gateways, you must define a certification authority as an issuer for TLS certificates.

[NOTE]
====
This example uses the Let's Encrypt TLS certificate issuer for simplicity, but you can use any certificate issuer supported by `cert-manager`. In multicluster environments, you must add your TLS issuer in each {ocp} cluster.

kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: ${KUADRANT_CLUSTER_ISSUER_NAME}
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
EOF
----

. Wait for the `ClusterIssuer` to become ready as follows:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl wait clusterissuer/${KUADRANT_CLUSTER_ISSUER_NAME} --for=condition=ready=true
