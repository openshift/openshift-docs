= Exposing the reporting API

On {product-title} the default metering installation automatically exposes a route, making the reporting API available. This provides the following features:

* Automatic DNS
* Automatic TLS based on the cluster CA

Also, the default installation makes it possible to use the {product-title} service for serving certificates to protect the reporting API with TLS. The {product-title} OAuth proxy is deployed as a sidecar container for the Reporting Operator, which protects the reporting API with authentication.

[id="metering-openshift-authentication_{context}"]
== Using {product-title} Authentication

By default, the reporting API is secured with TLS and authentication. This is done by configuring the Reporting Operator to deploy a pod containing both the Reporting Operator's container, and a sidecar container running {product-title} auth-proxy.

To access the reporting API, the Metering Operator exposes a route. After that route has been installed, you can run the following command to get the route's hostname.

[source,terminal]
----
$ METERING_ROUTE_HOSTNAME=$(oc -n openshift-metering get routes metering -o json | jq -r '.status.ingress[].host')
----

Next, set up authentication using either a service account token or basic authentication with a username and password.

[id="metering-authenticate-using-service-account_{context}"]
=== Authenticate using a service account token
With this method, you use the token in the Reporting Operator's service account, and pass that bearer token to the Authorization header in the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ TOKEN=$(oc -n openshift-metering serviceaccounts get-token reporting-operator)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -k "https://$METERING_ROUTE_HOSTNAME/api/v1/reports/get?name=[Report Name]&namespace=openshift-metering&format=[Format]"
----

Be sure to replace the `name=[Report Name]` and `format=[Format]` parameters in the URL above. The `format` parameter can be json, csv, or tabular.

[id="metering-authenticate-using-username-password_{context}"]
=== Authenticate using a username and password

Metering supports configuring basic authentication using a username and password combination, which is specified in the contents of an htpasswd file. By default, a secret containing empty htpasswd data is created. You can, however, configure the `reporting-operator.spec.authProxy.htpasswd.data` and `reporting-operator.spec.authProxy.htpasswd.createSecret` keys to use this method.

Once you have specified the above in your `MeteringConfig` resource, you can run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -u testuser:password123 -k "https://$METERING_ROUTE_HOSTNAME/api/v1/reports/get?name=[Report Name]&namespace=openshift-metering&format=[Format]"
----

Be sure to replace `testuser:password123` with a valid username and password combination.

[id="metering-manually-configure-authentication_{context}"]
== Manually Configuring Authentication
To manually configure, or disable OAuth in the Reporting Operator, you must set `spec.tls.enabled: false` in your `MeteringConfig` resource.

[WARNING]
====
This also disables all TLS and authentication between the Reporting Operator, Presto, and Hive. You would need to manually configure these resources yourself.
====

Authentication can be enabled by configuring the following options. Enabling authentication configures the Reporting Operator pod to run the {product-title} auth-proxy as a sidecar container in the pod. This adjusts the ports so that the reporting API is not exposed directly, but instead is proxied to via the auth-proxy sidecar container.

* `reporting-operator.spec.authProxy.enabled`
* `reporting-operator.spec.authProxy.cookie.createSecret`
* `reporting-operator.spec.authProxy.cookie.seed`

You need to set `reporting-operator.spec.authProxy.enabled` and `reporting-operator.spec.authProxy.cookie.createSecret` to `true` and `reporting-operator.spec.authProxy.cookie.seed` to a 32-character random string.

You can generate a 32-character random string using the following command.

[source,terminal]
----
$ openssl rand -base64 32 | head -c32; echo.
----

[id="metering-token-authentication_{context}"]
=== Token authentication

When the following options are set to `true`, authentication using a bearer token is enabled for the reporting REST API. Bearer tokens can come from service accounts or users.

* `reporting-operator.spec.authProxy.subjectAccessReview.enabled`
* `reporting-operator.spec.authProxy.delegateURLs.enabled`

When authentication is enabled, the Bearer token used to query the reporting API of the user or service account must be granted access using one of the following roles:

* report-exporter
* reporting-admin
* reporting-viewer
* metering-admin
* metering-viewer

The Metering Operator is capable of creating role bindings for you, granting these permissions by specifying a list of subjects in the `spec.permissions` section. For an example, see the following `advanced-auth.yaml` example configuration.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metering.openshift.io/v1
kind: MeteringConfig
metadata:
  name: "operator-metering"
spec:
  permissions:
    # anyone in the "metering-admins" group can create, update, delete, etc any
    # metering.openshift.io resources in the namespace.
    # This also grants permissions to get query report results from the reporting REST API.
    meteringAdmins:
    - kind: Group
      name: metering-admins
    # Same as above except read only access and for the metering-viewers group.
    meteringViewers:
    - kind: Group
      name: metering-viewers
    # the default serviceaccount in the namespace "my-custom-ns" can:
    # create, update, delete, etc reports.
    # This also gives permissions query the results from the reporting REST API.
    reportingAdmins:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: default
      namespace: my-custom-ns
    # anyone in the group reporting-readers can get, list, watch reports, and
    # query report results from the reporting REST API.
    reportingViewers:
    - kind: Group
      name: reporting-readers
    # anyone in the group cluster-admins can query report results
    # from the reporting REST API. So can the user bob-from-accounting.
    reportExporters:
    - kind: Group
      name: cluster-admins
    - kind: User
      name: bob-from-accounting

  reporting-operator:
    spec:
      authProxy:
        # htpasswd.data can contain htpasswd file contents for allowing auth
        # using a static list of usernames and their password hashes.
        #
        # username is 'testuser' password is 'password123'
        # generated htpasswdData using: `htpasswd -nb -s testuser password123`
        # htpasswd:
        #   data: |
        #     testuser:{SHA}y/2sYAj5yrQIN4TL0YdPdmGNKpc=
        #
        # change REPLACEME to the output of your htpasswd command
        htpasswd:
          data: |
            REPLACEME
----

Alternatively, you can use any role which has rules granting `get` permissions to `reports/export`. This means `get` access to the `export` sub-resource of the `Report` resources in the namespace of the Reporting Operator. For example: `admin` and `cluster-admin`.

By default, the Reporting Operator and Metering Operator service accounts both have these permissions, and their tokens can be used for authentication.

[id="metering-basic-authentication_{context}"]
=== Basic authentication with a username and password
For basic authentication you can supply a username and password in the `reporting-operator.spec.authProxy.htpasswd.data` field. The username and password must be the same format as those found in an htpasswd file. When set, you can use HTTP basic authentication to provide your username and password that has a corresponding entry in the `htpasswdData` contents.
