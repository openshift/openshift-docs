= Performing administrative Elasticsearch operations

An administrator certificate, key, and CA that can be used to communicate with and perform
administrative operations on Elasticsearch are provided within the
*elasticsearch* secret in the `openshift-logging` project. 

[NOTE]
====
To confirm whether or not your cluster logging installation provides these, run:
----
$ oc describe secret elasticsearch -n openshift-logging
----
====

. Connect to an Elasticsearch pod that is in the cluster on which you are
attempting to perform maintenance.

. To find a pod in a cluster use:
+
----
$ oc get pods -l component=elasticsearch -o name -n openshift-logging  | head -1
----

. Connect to a pod:
+
----
$ oc rsh <your_Elasticsearch_pod>
----

. Once connected to an Elasticsearch container, you can use the certificates
mounted from the secret to communicate with Elasticsearch per its
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/indices.html[Indices APIs documentation].
+
Fluentd sends its logs to Elasticsearch using the index format *project.{project_name}.{project_uuid}.YYYY.MM.DD*
where YYYY.MM.DD is the date of the log record.
+
For example, to delete all logs for the *openshift-logging* project with uid *3b3594fa-2ccd-11e6-acb7-0eb6b35eaee3*
from June 15, 2016, we can run:
+
----
$ curl --key /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-key \
  --cert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-cert \
  --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-ca -XDELETE \
  "https://localhost:9200/project.openshift-logging.664360-11e9-92d0-0eb4e1b4a396.2019.03.10"
