== CRDs

* `ClusterAutoscaler`: This is a singleton resource, which controls the configuration
of the cluster's autoscaler instance. The Operator will only respond to the
`ClusterAutoscaler` resource named `default` in the managed namespace, the
value of the `WATCH_NAMESPACE` environment variable.
* `MachineAutoscaler`: This resource targets a node group and manages the
annotations to enable and configure autoscaling for that group, the `min` and
`max` size. Currently only `MachineSet` objects can be targeted.
