= User-defined networks

User-defined networks (UDN) improve the flexibility and segmentation capabilities of the default Layer 3 topology for a Kubernetes pod network by enabling custom Layer 2 and Layer 3 network segments, where all these segments are isolated by default. These segments act as primary or secondary networks for container pods and virtual machines that use the default OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin.

UDNs enable a wide range of network architectures and topologies, enhancing network flexibility, security, and performance.

When the `UDNMapping` feature is enabled with Network Observability, the *Traffic* flow table has a *UDN labels* column. You can filter on *Source Network Name* and *Destination Network Name*.
