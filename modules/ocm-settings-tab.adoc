= Settings tab

The **Settings** tab provides a few options for the cluster owner:

* **Monitoring**, which is enabled by default, allows for reporting done on user-defined actions. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/observability/monitoring/monitoring-overview.html#understanding-the-monitoring-stack_monitoring-overview.html[Understanding the monitoring stack].
* **Update strategy** allows you to determine if the cluster automatically updates on a certain day of the week at a specified time or if all updates are scheduled manually.
* **Node draining** sets the duration that protected workloads are respected during updates. When this duration has passed, the node is forcibly removed.
* **Update status** shows the current version and if there are any updates available.
