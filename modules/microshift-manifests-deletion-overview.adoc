= How manifest deletion works

By default, {microshift-short} searches for deletion manifests in the `delete` subdirectories within the manifests path. When a user places a manifest in these subdirectories, {microshift-short} removes the manifests when the system is started. Read through the following to understand how manifests deletion works in {microshift-short}.

. Each time the system starts, before applying the manifests, {microshift-short} scans the following `delete` subdirectories within the configured manifests directory to identify the manifests that need to be deleted:

* `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests/delete`
* `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/delete/*`
* `/etc/microshift/manifests/delete`
* `/etc/microshift/manifests.d/delete/*`

. {microshift-short} deletes the resources defined in the manifests found in the `delete` directories by running the equivalent of the `kubectl delete --ignore-not-found -k` command.
