= Compatibility with multi-network policy

The multi-network policy API, which is provided by the `MultiNetworkPolicy` custom resource definition (CRD) in the `k8s.cni.cncf.io` API group, is compatible with an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network. When defining a network policy, the network policy rules that can be used depend on whether the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network defines the `subnets` field. Refer to the following table for details:

.Supported multi-network policy selectors based on `subnets` CNI configuration
[cols=".^3,.^7",options="header"]
|====
a|`subnets` field specified|Allowed multi-network policy selectors

|
Yes
a|
* `podSelector` and `namespaceSelector`
* `ipBlock`

|
No
a|
* `ipBlock`

|====

You can use the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/policy-for` annotation on a `MultiNetworkPolicy` object to point to a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) custom resource (CR). The NAD CR defines the network to which the policy applies. The following example multi-network policy is valid only if the `subnets` field is defined in the secondary network CNI configuration for the secondary network named `blue2`:

The following example uses the `ipBlock` network policy selector, which is always valid for an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network:
