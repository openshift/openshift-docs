= Collecting data for Red Hat Support

You can use the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command to collect the information about your {kueue-name} instance that is most likely needed for debugging issues, including:

* {kueue-name} custom resources, such as workloads, cluster queues, local queues, resource flavors, admission checks, and their corresponding cluster resource definitions (CRDs)
* Services
* Endpoints
* Webhook configurations
* Logs from the `openshift-kueue-operator` namespace and `kueue-controller-manager` pods

Collected data is written into a new directory named `must-gather/` in the current working directory by default.

.Prerequisites

* The {kueue-name} Operator is installed on your cluster.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.

. Collect `must-gather` data by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/kueue/kueue-must-gather-rhel9:<version>
----
+
Where `<version>` is your current version of {kueue-name}.

. Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory that was just created in your working directory. Make sure you provide the date and cluster ID for the unique `must-gather` data. For more information about how to find the cluster ID, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5280291[How to find the cluster-id or name on OpenShift cluster].

. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/list[the *Customer Support* page] of the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal.
