= Updating mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift from a remote host

This procedure explains how to update the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ from a remote host using the `upgrade` command. Updating to the latest version ensures bug fixes and security vulnerability fixes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When updating, there is intermittent downtime of your mirror registry, as it is restarted during the update process.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ on a remote host.

.Procedure

* To upgrade the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ from a remote host, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo ./mirror-registry upgrade -v --targetHostname <remote_host_url> --targetUsername <user_name> -k ~/.ssh/my_ssh_key
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Users who upgrade the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ with the `./mirror-registry upgrade -v` flag must include the same credentials used when creating their mirror registry. For example, if you installed the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ with `--quayHostname <host_example_com>` and `--quayRoot <example_directory_name>`, you must include that string to properly upgrade the mirror registry.
