= Creating a primary cluster-scoped user-defined network by using the web console

You can connect multiple namespaces to the same primary user-defined network (UDN) by creating a `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource in the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure
. From the *Administrator* perspective, click *Networking* -> *UserDefinedNetworks*.

. From the *Create* list, select *ClusterUserDefinedNetwork*.

. In the *Name* field, specify a name for the cluster-scoped UDN.

. Specify a value in the *Subnet* field.

. In the *Project(s) Match Labels* field, add the appropriate labels to select namespaces that the cluster UDN applies to.

. Click *Create*. The cluster-scoped UDN serves as the default primary network for pods and virtual machines located in namespaces that contain the labels that you specified in step 5.
