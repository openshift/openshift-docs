= Manually rotate the service CA certificate

The service CA is valid for one year after {product-title} is
installed. Follow these steps to manually refresh the service CA before the expiration date.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a cluster admin.

.Procedure

. View the expiration date of the current service CA certificate by
using the following command.
+
----
$ oc get secrets/signing-key -n openshift-service-ca \
     -o template='{{index .data "tls.crt"}}' \
     | base64 -d \
     | openssl x509 -noout -enddate
----

. Manually rotate the service CA. This process generates a new service CA
which will be used to sign the new service certificates.
+
----
$ oc delete secret/signing-key -n openshift-service-ca
----

. To apply the new certificates to all services, restart all the Pods
in your cluster. This command ensures that all services use the
updated certificates.
+
----
$ for I in $(oc get ns -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]} {.metadata.name}{"\n"} {end}'); \
      do oc delete pods --all -n $I; \
      sleep 1; \
      done
----

[WARNING]
====
This command will cause a service interruption, as it goes through and
deletes every running pod in every namespace. These pods will automatically
restart after they are deleted.
