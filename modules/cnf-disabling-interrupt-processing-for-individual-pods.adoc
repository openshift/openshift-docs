= Disabling interrupt processing for CPUs where pinned containers are running

To achieve low latency for workloads, some containers require that the CPUs they are pinned to do not process device interrupts. A pod annotation, `irq-load-balancing.crio.io`, is used to define whether device interrupts are processed or not on the CPUs where the pinned containers are running. When configured, CRI-O disables device interrupts where the pod containers are running.

To disable interrupt processing for CPUs where containers belonging to individual pods are pinned, ensure that `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is set to `false` in the performance profile. Then, in the pod specification, set the `irq-load-balancing.crio.io` pod annotation to `disable`.

The following pod specification contains this annotation:
[source,yaml]
