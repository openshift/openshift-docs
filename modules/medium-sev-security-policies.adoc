The following table lists the default security policies in {product-title} that are of medium severity. The policies are organized by life cycle stage.

[options="header"]
|====
|Life cycle stage |Name |Description | Status

|Build |Docker CIS 4.4: Ensure images are scanned and rebuilt to include security patches |Alerts when images are not scanned and rebuilt to include security patches. It is important to scan images often to find vulnerabilities, rebuild the images to include security patches, and then instantiate containers for the images. |Disabled
|Deploy |30-Day Scan Age |Alerts when a deployment has not been scanned in 30 days. |Enabled
|Deploy |CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability added |Alerts when a deployment includes containers that are escalating with CAP_SYS_ADMIN. |Enabled
|Deploy |Container using read-write root filesystem |Alerts when a deployment includes containers that have read-write root file systems. |Disabled
|Deploy |Container with privilege escalation allowed |Alerts when a container might be running with unintended privileges, creating a security risk. This situation can happen when a container process that has more privileges than its parent process allows the container to run with unintended privileges. |Enabled
|Deploy |Deployments should have at least one Ingress Network Policy |Alerts if deployments are missing an Ingress Network Policy. |Disabled
|Deploy |Deployments with externally exposed endpoints |Detects if a deployment has any service that is externally exposed through any methods. Deployments with services exposed outside of the cluster are at a higher risk of attempted intrusions because they are reachable outside of the cluster. This policy provides an alert so that you can verify that service exposure outside of the cluster is required. If the service is only needed for intra-cluster communication, use service type ClusterIP. |Disabled
|Deploy |Docker CIS 5.1: Ensure that, if applicable, an AppArmor profile is enabled |Uses AppArmor to protect the Linux operating system and applications by enforcing a security policy that is known as an AppArmor profile. AppArmor is a Linux application security system that is available on some Linux distributions by default, such as Debian and Ubuntu. |Enabled
|Deploy |Docker CIS 5.15: Ensure that the host's process namespace is not shared |Creates process-level isolation between the containers and the host. The Process ID (PID) namespace isolates the process ID space, which means that processes in different PID namespaces can have the same PID. |Enabled
|Deploy |Docker CIS 5.16: Ensure that the host's IPC namespace is not shared |Alerts when the IPC namespace on the host is shared with containers. The IPC (POSIX/SysV IPC) namespace separates named shared memory segments, semaphores, and message queues. |Enabled
|Deploy| Docker CIS 5.19: Ensure mount propagation mode is not enabled |Alerts when mount propagation mode is enabled. When mount propagation mode is enabled, you can mount container volumes in Bidirectional, Host to Container, and None modes. Do not use Bidirectional mount propagation mode unless it is explicitly needed. |Enabled
|Deploy |Docker CIS 5.21: Ensure the default seccomp profile is not disabled |Alerts when the seccomp profile is disabled. The seccomp profile uses an allowlist to permit common system calls and blocks all others. |Disabled
|Deploy |Docker CIS 5.7: Ensure privileged ports are not mapped within containers |Alerts when privileged ports are mapped within containers. The TCP/IP port numbers that are lower than 1024 are privileged ports. Normal users and processes can not use them for security reasons, but containers might map their ports to privileged ports. |Enabled
|Deploy |Docker CIS 5.9 and 5.20: Ensure that the host's network namespace is not shared |Alerts when the host's network namespace is shared. When HostNetwork is enabled, the container is not placed inside a separate network stack, and the container's networking is not containerized. As a result, the container has full access to the host's network interfaces, and a shared UTS namespace is enabled. The UTS namespace provides isolation between the hostname and the NIS domain name, and it sets the hostname and the domain, which are visible to running processes in that namespace. Processes that run within containers do not typically require to know the hostname or the domain name, so the UTS namespace should not be shared with the host.|Enabled
|Deploy |Images with no scans|Alerts when a deployment includes images that were not scanned. |Disabled
|Runtime |Kubernetes Actions: Port Forward to Pod |Alerts when the Kubernetes API receives a port forward request. |Enabled
|Deploy |Mount Container Runtime Socket |Alerts when a deployment has a volume mount on the container runtime socket. |Enabled
|Deploy |Mounting Sensitive Host Directories |Alerts when a deployment mounts sensitive host directories. |Enabled
|Deploy |No resource requests or limits specified |Alerts when a deployment includes containers that do not have resource requests and limits. |Enabled
|Deploy |Pod Service Account Token Automatically Mounted |Protects pod default service account tokens from being compromised by minimizing the mounting of the default service account token to only those pods whose applications require interaction with the Kubernetes API. |Enabled
|Deploy |Privileged Container |Alerts when a deployment includes containers that run in privileged mode. |Enabled
|Runtime |crontab Execution |Detects the usage of the crontab scheduled jobs editor. |Enabled
|Runtime |Netcat Execution Detected |Detects when netcat runs in a container. |Enabled
|Runtime |OpenShift: Advanced Cluster Security Central Admin Secret Accessed |Alerts when someone accesses the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Central secret. |Enabled
|Runtime |OpenShift: Kubernetes Secret Accessed by an Impersonated User |Alerts when someone impersonates a user to access a secret in the cluster. |Enabled
|Runtime |Remote File Copy Binary Execution |Alerts when a deployment runs a remote file copy tool. |Enabled
