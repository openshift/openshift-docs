= Forward audit logs to the log store

Because the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch log store does not provide secure storage for audit logs, by default audit logs are not stored in the internal Elasticsearch instance. 

If you want to send the audit logs to the internal log store, for example to view the audit logs in Kibana, you must use the Log Forwarding API.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The internal {product-title} Elasticsearch log store does not provide secure storage for audit logs. We recommend you ensure that the system to which you forward audit logs is compliant with your organizational and governmental regulations and is properly secured. {product-title} cluster logging does not comply with those regulations.
====

.Procedure

To use the Log Forwarding API to forward audit logs to the internal Elasticsearch instance:

. Create a Log Forwarding CR YAML file or edit your existing CR:
+
* Create a CR to send all log types to the internal Elasticsearch instance. You can use the following example without making any changes:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  pipelines: <1>
  - name: all-to-default
    inputRefs:
    - infrastructure
    - application
    - audit
    outputRefs:
    - default
----
<1> A pipeline defines the type of logs to forward using the specified output. The default output forwards logs to the internal Elasticsearch instance.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must specify all three types of logs in the pipeline: application, infrastructure, and audit. If you do not specify a log type, those logs are not stored and will be lost. 
====
+
* If you have an existing LogForwarding CR, add a pipeline to the default output for the audit logs. You do not need to define the default output. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:

   - name: audit-logs
     inputRefs: audit
     outputRefs:
     - elasticsearch-secure
     - default <1>
----
<1> This pipeline sends the audit logs to the internal Elasticsearch instance in addition to an external instance.
