= Volumes and volume mounts definition

[role="_abstract"] 

A build strategy includes the definition of volumes and volume mounts. The volumes defined in a build strategy support all of the usual `volumeSource` types. The build steps refer to the volumes by creating a volume mount.

[NOTE]
====
The volume mount defined in build steps allows you to access volumes defined in a `BuildStrategy`, `Build` or `BuildRun` resource.
====

Volumes in build strategy use an `overridable` boolean flag, which is set to `false` by default. If a `Build` or `BuildRun` resource tries to override the volumes defined in a `BuildStrategy` resource, it will fail because the default value of the `overridable` flag is `false`.

The following example shows a `BuildStrategy` resource that defines the `volumes` and `volumeMounts` fields:
