* You have installed the {ocp} CLI (`oc`).
* You have obtained the {ocp} API route for Thanos Querier.

----
$ oc get routes -n openshift-monitoring thanos-querier -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}'
----

. Retrieve a list of metrics in JSON format from the Thanos Querier API route by running the following command. This command uses `oc` to authenticate with a bearer token.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" https://<thanos_querier_route>/api/v1/metadata
