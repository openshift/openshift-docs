== Fixed issues

TargetDown alert triggered after upgrade is resolved::
Before this update, Operator upgrades could trigger the `TargetDown` alert due to a 403 forbidden response from the metrics endpoint. With this update, role-based access control (RBAC) permissions explicitly allow access to the `/metrics` non-resource URL by using `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects. As a result, Prometheus successfully scrapes metrics and resolves the `TargetDown` alert.

Operator upgrades synchronize redis-ha-haproxy replica counts::
Before this update, the redis-ha-haproxy deployment retained an outdated replica configuration during Operator upgrades. As a consequence, the deployment did not automatically reflect the desired state. With this update, the deployment synchronizes the replica count during the reconciliation process. As a result, `redis-ha-haproxy` replicas remain synchronized with the configuration across upgrades.

Reconciliation timeout values map correctly to environment variables::
Before this update, reconciliation timeout values configured in the `extraConfig field did not map correctly to the Operator environment variables. With this update, the `timeout.reconciliation` field is correctly mapped to the appropriate environment variable in the Operator's deployment logic. As a result, the Operator correctly applies user-defined timeouts for consistent control over sync cycles.
