= Configuring an identity provider


After your {product-title} cluster is created, you must configure identity providers to determine how users log in to access the cluster. This example configures a GitHub identity provider.

[WARNING]
====
Configuring GitHub authentication allows users to log in to {product-title} with their GitHub credentials. To prevent anyone with any GitHub user ID from logging in to your {product-title} cluster, you must restrict access to only those in specific GitHub organizations or teams.
====

.Prerequisites

* The OAuth application must be created directly within the GitHub link:https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-organization-settings[organization settings] by the GitHub organization administrator.
* link:https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams[GitHub organizations or teams] are set up in your GitHub account.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the *Clusters* page and select the cluster that you need to configure identity providers for.

. Click the *Access control* tab.

. Click *Add identity provider*.

[NOTE]
====
You can also click the *Add Oauth configuration* link in the warning message displayed after cluster creation to configure your identity providers.
====

. Select *GitHub* from the drop-down menu.

. Enter a unique name for the identity provider. This name cannot be changed later.
** An *OAuth callback URL* is automatically generated in the provided field. You will use this to register the GitHub application.

. Return to {product-title} and select a mapping method from the drop-down menu. *Claim* is recommended in most cases.

. Enter the *Client ID* and *Client secret* provided by GitHub.

. Enter a *hostname*. A hostname must be entered when using a hosted instance of GitHub Enterprise.

. Optional: You can use a certificate authority (CA) file to validate server certificates for the configured GitHub Enterprise URL. Click *Browse* to locate and attach a *CA file* to the identity provider.

. Select *Use organizations* or *Use teams* to restrict access to a particular GitHub organization or a GitHub team.

. Enter the name of the organization or team you would like to restrict access to. Click *Add more* to specify multiple organizations or teams that users can be a member of.

. Click *Confirm*.

.Verification

* The configured identity provider is now visible on the *Access control* tab of the *Clusters* page.
