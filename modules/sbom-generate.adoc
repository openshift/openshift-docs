= Generating SBOMs

You can generate SBOMs by using the following methods:

Using the {product-title-short} portal:: Go to *Vulnerability Management* -> *Results* and locate the image that you want to use. Do one of the following actions:

* In the image row, click the overflow menu {kebab}, and then select *Generate SBOM*.
* Select the image to view the image details, and then click *Generate SBOM*.

+
A window opens that provides information about the image and the SBOM format that is generated. After you click *Generate SBOM*, {product-title-short} creates the file in JSON format. Depending on your browser configuration, your browser can automatically download the file to your computer.

Using the `roxctl` CLI::

In the `roxctl` CLI, run the following command:

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl image sbom --image=image-name <1>
----
<1> Type the name and reference of the image that you want to generate an SBOM for, in string format. For example, `nginx:latest` or `nginx@sha256:...`.
