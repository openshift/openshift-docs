= Managing silences

You can create a silence to stop receiving notifications about an alert when it is firing. It might be useful to silence an alert after being first notified, while you resolve the underlying issue.

When creating a silence, you must specify whether it becomes active immediately or at a later time. You must also set a duration period after which the silence expires.

You can view, edit and expire existing silences.
