= Creating issues in different Jira projects

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure {product-title} to to create issues in different Jira projects so that they directly go to the right team.

.Prerequisites
* You must have an account with access to each project that you want to send the alerts to.

.Procedure
. Add an annotation similar to the following in your deployment YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
jira/project-key: <jira_project_key>
----
. Use the annotation key `jira/project-key` in the *Annotation Key For Project* field when you configure {product-title}.

After the configuration is complete, if a deployment has an annotation in the YAML file, {product-title} sends the alert to the project specified for that annotation. Otherwise, an alert is sent to the default project.
