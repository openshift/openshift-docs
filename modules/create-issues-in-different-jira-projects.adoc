= Creating issues in different Jira projects

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure {product-title} to create issues in different Jira projects so that they directly go to the correct team. After completing the configuration, if a deployment has an annotation in the YAML file, {product-title-short} creates issues in the project specified for that annotation. Otherwise, {product-title-short} creates issues in the default project.

.Prerequisites
* You must have an account with access to each project that you want to send the alerts to.

.Procedure
. Add an annotation similar to the following example in your namespace or deployment YAML file:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
annotations:
# ...
  jira/project-key: <jira_project_key>
# ...
----
. Use the annotation key `jira/project-key` in the *Annotation key for project* field when you configure {product-title}.
