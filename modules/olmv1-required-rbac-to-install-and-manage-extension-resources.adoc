= Required permissions to install and manage a cluster extension

Inspect the bundle image manifests to determine what permissions you need to assign. The service account needs enough role-based access controls (RBAC) to create and manage the following resources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Follow the principle of least privilege and scope permissions to specific resource names with the least RBAC required to run.
====

Admission plugins:: Cluster extensions need permissions to update the `blockOwnerDeletion` and `ownerReferences` finalizers. This requirement exists because {product-title} clusters use the `OwnerReferencesPermissionEnforcement` admission plugin.

Cluster role and cluster role bindings for the controllers of the extension:: You must define RBAC so that the installation service account can create and manage cluster roles and cluster role bindings for the extension controllers.

Cluster service version (CSV):: You must define RBAC for the resources defined in the CSV of the cluster extension.

Cluster-scoped bundle resources:: You must define RBAC to create and manage any cluster-scoped resources included in the bundle. If the cluster-scoped resource matches another resource type like `ClusterRole`, add it to the existing rule. You can place it under the `resources` or `resourceNames` field.

Custom resource definitions (CRDs):: You must define RBAC so that the installation service account can create and manage the CRDs for the extension. Also, you must grant the service account for the controller of the extension the RBAC to manage its CRDs.

Deployments:: Define RBAC so that the installation service account can create and manage deployments, services, and config maps needed by the extension controller.

Extension permissions:: You must include RBAC for the permissions and cluster permissions defined in the CSV. The installation service account needs the ability to grant these permissions to the extension controller, which needs these permissions to run.

Namespace-scoped bundle resources:: You must define RBAC for any namespace-scoped bundle resources. The installation service account requires permission to create and manage resources, such as config maps or services.

Roles and role bindings:: You must define RBAC for any roles or role bindings defined in the CSV. The installation service account needs permission to create and manage those roles and role bindings.

// I am deleting the secrets section because I think it covered under the "extension permissions" term. Please let me know if I should put it back and if you have a suggestion for the defintion.

Service accounts:: You must define RBAC so that the installation service account can create and manage the service accounts for the extension controllers.
