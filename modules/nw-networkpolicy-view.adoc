= Viewing network policies

You can examine the network policies in a namespace.

[NOTE]
====
If you log in with a user with the `cluster-admin` role, then you can view any network policy in the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `admin` privileges.
* You are working in the namespace where the network policy exists.

.Procedure

* List network policies in a namespace:

** To view `NetworkPolicy` objects defined in a namespace, enter the following
command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get networkpolicy
----

** Optional: To examine a specific network policy, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe networkpolicy <policy_name> -n <namespace>
----
+
--
where:

  `<policy_name>`:: Specifies the name of the network policy to inspect.
  `<namespace>`:: Optional: Specifies the namespace if the object is defined in a different namespace than the current namespace.

+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe networkpolicy allow-same-namespace
