= Install OLM Operators using {gitops-title}

{gitops-title} with cluster configurations manages specific cluster-scoped resources and takes care of installing cluster Operators or any namespace-scoped OLM Operators.

Consider a case where as a cluster administrator, you have to install an OLM Operator such as Tekton. You use the {OCP} web console to manually install a Tekton Operator or the OpenShift CLI to manually install a Tekton subscription and Tekton Operator group on your cluster.

{gitops-title} places your Kubernetes resources in your Git repository. As a cluster administrator, use {gitops-title} to manage and automate the installation of other OLM Operators without any manual procedures. For example, after you place the Tekton subscription in your Git repository by using {gitops-title}, the {gitops-title} automatically takes this Tekton subscription from your Git repository and installs the Tekton Operator on your cluster.
