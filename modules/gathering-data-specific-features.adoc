= Gathering data about specific features

You can gather debugging information about specific features by using the
`oc adm must-gather` CLI command with the `--image` or `--image-stream` argument.
The `must-gather` tool supports multiple images, so you can gather data about
more than one feature by running a single command.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* The {product-title} CLI (`oc`) installed.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.

. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command with one or more `--image` or `--image-stream`
arguments. For example, the following command gathers both the default cluster
data and information specific to {VirtProductName}:
+
----
$ oc adm must-gather \
 --image-stream=openshift/must-gather \ <1>
 --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel8 <2>
----
<1> Default {product-title} must-gather image
<2> {VirtProductName} must-gather image

. Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory that was just created
in your working directory. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux
operating system, run the following command:
+
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather.local.5421342344627712289/ <1>
----
<1> Make sure to replace `must-gather-local.5421342344627712289/` with the
actual directory name.

. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the
