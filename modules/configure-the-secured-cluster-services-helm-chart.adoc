= Configure the secured-cluster-services Helm chart

[role="_abstract"]
To configure the Helm chart for {rh-rhacs-first}, you must define custom parameters for your secured cluster services. You must create separate configuration files to manage sensitive and non-sensitive options, ensuring you secure your deployment credentials while customizing components like Sensor and Collector. This approach allows you to apply environment-specific settings effectively without modifying the base chart files.

Create the following files for configuring the Helm chart for installing {product-title-short}:

* Public configuration file `values-public.yaml`: Use this file to save all non-sensitive configuration options.
* Private configuration file `values-private.yaml`: Use this file to save all sensitive configuration options. Ensure that you store this file securely.
//TODO: Add links to sample configuration files.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While using the `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart, do not modify the `values.yaml` file that is part of the chart.
