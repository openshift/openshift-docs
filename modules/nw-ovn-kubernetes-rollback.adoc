= Using the offline migration method to roll back to the OpenShift SDN network plugin

Cluster administrators can roll back to the OpenShift SDN Container Network Interface (CNI) network plugin by using the offline migration method. During the migration you must manually reboot every node in your cluster. With the offline migration method, there is some downtime, during which your cluster is unreachable.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must wait until the migration process from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes network plugin is successful before initiating a rollback.
====

If a rollback to OpenShift SDN is required, the following table describes the process.

.Performing a rollback to OpenShift SDN
[cols="1,1a",options="header"]
|===

|User-initiated steps|Migration activity

|Suspend the MCO to ensure that it does not interrupt the migration.
|The MCO stops.

|
Set the `migration` field of the `Network.operator.openshift.io` custom resource (CR) named `cluster` to `OpenShiftSDN`. Make sure the `migration` field is `null` before setting it to a value.
|
CNO:: Updates the status of the `Network.config.openshift.io` CR named `cluster` accordingly.

|Update the `networkType` field.
|
CNO:: Performs the following actions:
+
--
* Destroys the OVN-Kubernetes control plane pods.
* Deploys the OpenShift SDN control plane pods.
* Updates the Multus objects to reflect the new network plugin.
--

|
Reboot each node in the cluster.
|
Cluster:: As nodes reboot, the cluster assigns IP addresses to pods on the OpenShift-SDN network.

|
Enable the MCO after all nodes in the cluster reboot.
|
MCO:: Rolls out an update to the systemd configuration necessary for OpenShift SDN; the MCO updates a single machine per pool at a time by default, so the total time the migration takes increases with the size of the cluster.

|===

.Prerequisites

* The {oc-first} is installed.
* Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role is available.
* The cluster is installed on infrastructure configured with the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* A recent backup of the etcd database is available.
* A manual reboot can be triggered for each node.
* The cluster is in a known good state, without any errors.

.Procedure

. Stop all of the machine configuration pools managed by the Machine Config Operator (MCO):

** Stop the `master` configuration pool by entering the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch MachineConfigPool master --type='merge' --patch \
  '{ "spec": { "paused": true } }'
----

** Stop the `worker` machine configuration pool by entering the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch MachineConfigPool worker --type='merge' --patch \
  '{ "spec":{ "paused": true } }'
----

. To prepare for the migration, set the migration field to `null` by entering the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' \
  --patch '{ "spec": { "migration": null } }'
----

. Check that the migration status is empty for the `Network.config.openshift.io` object by entering the following command in your CLI. Empty command output indicates that the object is not in a migration operation.
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc get Network.config cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.migration}'
----

. Apply the patch to the `Network.operator.openshift.io` object to set the network plugin back to OpenShift SDN by entering the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' \
  --patch '{ "spec": { "migration": { "networkType": "OpenShiftSDN" } } }'
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you applied the patch to the `Network.config.openshift.io` object before the patch operation finalizes on the `Network.operator.openshift.io` object, the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) enters into a degradation state and this causes a slight delay until the CNO recovers from the degraded state.
====

. Confirm that the migration status of the network plugin for the `Network.config.openshift.io cluster` object is `OpenShiftSDN` by entering the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc get Network.config cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.migration.networkType}'
----

. Apply the patch to the `Network.config.openshift.io` object to set the network plugin back to OpenShift SDN by entering the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch Network.config.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' \
  --patch '{ "spec": { "networkType": "OpenShiftSDN" } }'
----

. Optional: Disable automatic migration of several OVN-Kubernetes capabilities to the OpenShift SDN equivalents:
+
--
* Egress IPs
* Egress firewall
* Multicast
--
+
To disable automatic migration of the configuration for any of the previously noted OpenShift SDN features, specify the following keys:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' \
  --patch '{
    "spec": {
      "migration": {
        "networkType": "OpenShiftSDN",
        "features": {
          "egressIP": <bool>,
          "egressFirewall": <bool>,
          "multicast": <bool>
        }
      }
    }
  }'
----
+
where:
+
--
`bool`: Specifies whether to enable migration of the feature. The default is `true`.
--

. Optional: You can customize the following settings for OpenShift SDN to meet your network infrastructure requirements:
+
--
* Maximum transmission unit (MTU)
* VXLAN port
--
+
To customize either or both of the previously noted settings, customize and enter the following command in your CLI. If you do not need to change the default value, omit the key from the patch.
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge \
  --patch '{
    "spec":{
      "defaultNetwork":{
        "openshiftSDNConfig":{
          "mtu":<mtu>,
          "vxlanPort":<port>
    }}}}'
----
+
--
`mtu`::
The MTU for the VXLAN overlay network. This value is normally configured automatically, but if the nodes in your cluster do not all use the same MTU, then you must set this explicitly to `50` less than the smallest node MTU value.
`port`::
The UDP port for the VXLAN overlay network. If a value is not specified, the default is `4789`. The port cannot be the same as the Geneve port that is used by OVN-Kubernetes. The default value for the Geneve port is `6081`.
--
+
.Example patch command
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge \
  --patch '{
    "spec":{
      "defaultNetwork":{
        "openshiftSDNConfig":{
          "mtu":1200
    }}}}'
----

. Reboot each node in your cluster. You can reboot the nodes in your cluster with either of the following approaches:

** With the `oc rsh` command, you can use a bash script similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
readarray -t POD_NODES <<< "$(oc get pod -n openshift-machine-config-operator -o wide| grep daemon|awk '{print $1" "$7}')"

for i in "${POD_NODES[@]}"
do
  read -r POD NODE <<< "$i"
  until oc rsh -n openshift-machine-config-operator "$POD" chroot /rootfs shutdown -r +1
    do
      echo "cannot reboot node $NODE, retry" && sleep 3
    done
done
----

** With the `ssh` command, you can use a bash script similar to the following. The script assumes that you have configured sudo to not prompt for a password.
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

for ip in $(oc get nodes  -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type=="InternalIP")].address}')
do
   echo "reboot node $ip"
   ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no core@$ip sudo shutdown -r -t 3
done
----

. Wait until the Multus daemon set rollout completes. Run the following command to see your rollout status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-multus rollout status daemonset/multus
----
+
The name of the Multus pods is in the form of `multus-<xxxxx>` where `<xxxxx>` is a random sequence of letters. It might take several moments for the pods to restart.
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
Waiting for daemon set "multus" rollout to finish: 1 out of 6 new pods have been updated...
...
Waiting for daemon set "multus" rollout to finish: 5 of 6 updated pods are available...
daemon set "multus" successfully rolled out
----

. After the nodes in your cluster have rebooted and the multus pods are rolled out, start all of the machine configuration pools by running the following commands::
+
--
* Start the master configuration pool:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch MachineConfigPool master --type='merge' --patch \
  '{ "spec": { "paused": false } }'
----

* Start the worker configuration pool:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch MachineConfigPool worker --type='merge' --patch \
  '{ "spec": { "paused": false } }'
----
--
+
As the MCO updates machines in each config pool, it reboots each node.
+
By default the MCO updates a single machine per pool at a time, so the time that the migration requires to complete grows with the size of the cluster.

. Confirm the status of the new machine configuration on the hosts:
.. To list the machine configuration state and the name of the applied machine configuration, enter the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc describe node | egrep "hostname|machineconfig"
----
+
.Example output

machineconfiguration.openshift.io/reason:
machineconfiguration.openshift.io/state: Done
----
+
Verify that the following statements are true:
+
--
 * The value of `machineconfiguration.openshift.io/state` field is `Done`.
 * The value of the `machineconfiguration.openshift.io/currentConfig` field is equal to the value of the `machineconfiguration.openshift.io/desiredConfig` field.
--

.. To confirm that the machine config is correct, enter the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfig <config_name> -o yaml
----
+
where `<config_name>` is the name of the machine config from the `machineconfiguration.openshift.io/currentConfig` field.

. Confirm that the migration succeeded:

.. To confirm that the network plugin is OpenShift SDN, enter the following command in your CLI. The value of `status.networkType` must be `OpenShiftSDN`.
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc get Network.config/cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.networkType}{"\n"}'
----

.. To confirm that the cluster nodes are in the `Ready` state, enter the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----

.. If a node is stuck in the `NotReady` state, investigate the machine config daemon pod logs and resolve any errors.
