= Upgrading from OADP 1.2 Technology Preview Data Mover

[role="_abstract"]
Backups created with the {oadp-first} 1.2 Data Mover are not compatible with OADP 1.3. Before upgrading to OADP 1.3, create a CSI or a file system backup to help ensure continuous data protection for your applications.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To restore OADP 1.2 Data Mover backup, you must uninstall OADP, and install and configure OADP 1.2.
====

[NOTE]
====
The default timeout value for the Restic file system backup is one hour. In OADP 1.3.1 and later, the default timeout value for Restic and Kopia is four hours.
====

.Procedure

. If your cluster backups are sufficient and Container Storage Interface (CSI) storage is available,
back up the applications with a CSI backup.
. If you require off cluster backups:
.. Back up the applications with a file system backup that uses the `--default-volumes-to-fs-backup=true` or `backup.spec.defaultVolumesToFsBackup` options.
.. Back up the applications with your object storage plugins, for example, `velero-plugin-for-aws`.
