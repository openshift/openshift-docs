= Controlling the placement and distribution of monitoring components

[role="_abstract"]
You can move the monitoring stack components to specific nodes:

* Use the `nodeSelector` constraint with labeled nodes to move any of the monitoring stack components to specific nodes.
* Assign tolerations to enable moving components to tainted nodes.

By doing so, you control the placement and distribution of the monitoring components across a cluster.

By controlling placement and distribution of monitoring components, you can optimize system resource use, improve performance, and separate workloads based on specific requirements or policies.
