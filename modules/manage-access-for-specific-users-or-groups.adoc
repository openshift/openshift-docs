= Managing access for specific users or groups

[role="_abstract"]
In addition to setting up a *Minimum access role*, you can create rules that govern access to {product-title} resources.
You can create and apply these rules based on the metadata keys and values you set up in your authentication provider.

[NOTE]
====
The metadata keys are always dependent upon the configurations in your authentication provider.
For example:

* Allowed metadata keys for OpenID Connect (OIDC) are only:
** `name`
** `email`
** `uid`
** `groups`
* However, for Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)-based authentication providers, there are no restrictions and you can define custom attributes as metadata keys.
====

.Prerequisites
* You must have the *Admin* role, or read and write permissions for the `Access` resource to create, modify, and delete custom roles.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access control*.
. Under *Auth Providers*, select the authentication provider for which you want to configure user roles.
. Click *Edit Provider*.
. Under section 2 *Assign StackRox roles to your <auth_provider> users*, click on *Add New Rule*.
. Click on the *Key* to which this role applies.
. Select a *Value* for the key.
. Select the *Role* you want to assign to users matching the specified key and value.
. Click *Save*.

[NOTE]
====
* You can add more than one rule using these steps.
* When you select a *Value*, only users who accessed the system before using that value appear as an option.
You can type in custom values for users who did not log in yet.
* If a user matches to more than one of the defined rules, the user gets permissions from every matching rule.
