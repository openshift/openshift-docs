Through {cluster-manager-url}, you can create an {product-title} cluster
ifdef::osd-on-aws[]
on {AWS}

ifdef::osd-on-gcp[]
on {GCP}
endif::osd-on-gcp[]
using a standard cloud provider account owned by Red Hat.

.Procedure

. Log in to {cluster-manager-url} and click *Create cluster*.

. In the *Cloud* tab, click *Create cluster* in the *Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated* row.

. Under *Billing model*, configure the subscription type and infrastructure type:
.. Select the *Annual* subscription type. Only the *Annual* subscription type is available when you deploy a cluster using a Red Hat cloud account.
+
For information about {product-title} subscription options, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_cluster_manager/2022/html-single/managing_clusters/index#subscribing-osd-cluster_assembly-cluster-subscriptions[Managing OpenShift Dedicated cluster subscriptions] in the {cluster-manager} documentation.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must have the required resource quota for the *Annual* subscription type to be available. For more information, contact your sales representative or Red Hat support.
====
+
.. Select the *Red Hat cloud account* infrastructure type to deploy {product-title} in a cloud provider account that is owned by Red Hat.
.. Click *Next*.

ifdef::osd-on-aws[]
. Select *Run on Amazon Web Services*
endif::osd-on-aws[]
ifdef::osd-on-gcp[]
. Select *Run on Google Cloud Platform*
endif::osd-on-gcp[]
and click *Next*.

. On the *Cluster details* page, provide a name for your cluster and specify the cluster details:
.. Add a *Cluster name*.
.. Select a cluster version from the *Version* drop-down menu.
.. Select a cloud provider region from the *Region* drop-down menu.
.. Select a *Single zone* or *Multi-zone* configuration.
.. Select a *Persistent storage* capacity for the cluster. For more information, see the _Storage_ section in the {product-title} service definition.
.. Specify the number of *Load balancers* that you require for your cluster. For more information, see the _Load balancers_ section in the {product-title} service definition.
.. Leave *Enable user workload monitoring* selected to monitor your own projects in isolation from Red Hat Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) platform metrics. This option is enabled by default.
.. Optional: Select *Enable additional etcd encryption* if you require etcd key value encryption. With this option, the etcd key values are encrypted, but not the keys. This option is in addition to the control plane storage encryption that encrypts the etcd volumes in {product-title} clusters by default.
+
[NOTE]
====
By enabling etcd encryption for the key values in etcd, you will incur a performance overhead of approximately 20%. The overhead is a result of introducing this second layer of encryption, in addition to the default control plane storage encryption that encrypts the etcd volumes. Consider enabling etcd encryption only if you specifically require it for your use case.
====
.. Click *Next*.

. On the *Default machine pool* page, select a *Compute node instance type* and a *Compute node count*. The number and types of nodes that are available depend on your {product-title} subscription. If you are using multiple availability zones, the compute node count is per zone.
+
[NOTE]
====
After your cluster is created, you can change the number of compute nodes, but you cannot change the compute node instance type in a machine pool. For clusters that use the CCS model, you can add machine pools after installation that use a different instance type. The number and types of nodes available to you depend on your {product-title} subscription.
====

. Optional: Expand *Edit node labels* to add labels to your nodes. Click *Add label* to add more node labels and select *Next*.

. In the *Cluster privacy* dialog, select *Public* or *Private* to use either public or private API endpoints and application routes for your cluster.

. Click *Next*.

. In the *CIDR ranges* dialog, configure custom classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) ranges or use the defaults that are provided.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
CIDR configurations cannot be changed later. Confirm your selections with your network administrator before proceeding.

If the cluster privacy is set to *Private*, you cannot access your cluster until you configure private connections in your cloud provider.
====

. On the *Cluster update strategy* page, configure your update preferences:
.. Choose a cluster update method:
** Select *Individual updates* if you want to schedule each update individually. This is the default option.
** Select *Recurring updates* to update your cluster on your preferred day and start time, when updates are available.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can review the end-of-life dates in the update life cycle documentation for {product-title}. For more information, see _{product-title} update life cycle_.
====
+
.. Provide administrator approval based on your cluster update method:
** Individual updates: If you select an update version that requires approval, provide an administrator’s acknowledgment and click *Approve and continue*.
** Recurring updates: If you selected recurring updates for your cluster, provide an administrator’s acknowledgment and click *Approve and continue*. {cluster-manager} does not start scheduled y-stream updates for minor versions without receiving an administrator’s acknowledgment.
+
For information about administrator acknowledgment, see xref:./../upgrading/osd-upgrading-cluster-prepare.adoc#upgrade-49-acknowledgement_osd-updating-cluster-prepare[Administrator acknowledgment when upgrading to OpenShift 4.9].
.. If you opted for recurring updates, select a preferred day of the week and upgrade start time in UTC from the drop-down menus.
.. Optional: You can set a grace period for *Node draining* during cluster upgrades. A *1 hour* grace period is set by default.
.. Click *Next*.
+
[NOTE]
====
In the event of critical security concerns that significantly impact the security or stability of a cluster, Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) might schedule automatic updates to the latest z-stream version that is not impacted. The updates are applied within 48 hours after customer notifications are provided. For a description of the critical impact security rating, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification[Understanding Red Hat security ratings].
====

. Review the summary of your selections and click *Create cluster* to start the cluster installation. The installation takes approximately 30-40 minutes to complete.

.Verification

* You can monitor the progress of the installation in the *Overview* page for your cluster. You can view the installation logs on the same page. Your cluster is ready when the *Status* in the *Details* section of the page is listed as *Ready*.
