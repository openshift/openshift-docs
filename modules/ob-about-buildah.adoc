= Buildah

[role="_abstract"] 

The `buildah` cluster build strategy uses a Dockerfile to build a container image and pushes it to the target registry. You must specify the Dockerfile in the `spec.paramValues` field of the `Build` CR.

You can share the `buildah` strategy across different namespaces within your cluster because the {builds-operator} installs the `buildah` strategy at cluster level. 

You can configure the following parameters for the `buildah` strategy:
