= Recommended control plane latency for cluster reliability

Latency between each of the control plane nodes must be less than 15ms to ensure a well performing and reliable cluster. Some of the metrics to keep track of include etcd gRPC requests latency, fysnc latency and any critical alerts. Here are the PromQL queries:
