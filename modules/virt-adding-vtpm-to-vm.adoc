= Adding a vTPM device to a virtual machine

Adding a virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device to a virtual machine
(VM) allows you to run a VM created from a Windows 11 image without a physical
TPM device. A vTPM device also stores secrets for that VM.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have configured a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to use a storage class of type `Filesystem` that supports the `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode. This is necessary for the vTPM device data to persist across VM reboots.

.Procedure

. Run the following command to update the VM configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit vm <vm_name>
----

. Edit the VM specification to add the vTPM device. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
    name: example-vm
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          tpm:  <1>
            persistent: true <2>
# ...
----
<1> Adds the vTPM device to the VM.
<2> Specifies that the vTPM device state persists after the VM is shut down. The default value is `false`.

. To apply your changes, save and exit the editor.

. Optional: If you edited a running virtual machine, you must restart it for
the changes to take effect.
