= Upgrading scenarios for {hcp}

Consider the following information before you upgrade:

* You use bare metal as a management cluster platform.

* You use Agent or KubeVirt as a Hosted cluster platform.

[NOTE]
====
The management cluster is based on the installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI).
====

Review the following scenarios:

* While running your management cluster on {product-title} 4.14, you can upgrade the multicluster engine (MCE) version from 2.4 to 2.5. Then, you can upgrade your hosted cluster and node pools from {product-title} 4.14 to {product-title} 4.15.

* If you want to upgrade management cluster, MCE, hosted cluster, and node pools to their latest versions:

** Upgrade your management cluster from {product-title} 4.14 to {product-title} 4.15
** Upgrade the MCE version from 2.4 to 2.5
** Upgrade your hosted cluster and node pools from {product-title} 4.14 to {product-title} 4.15
