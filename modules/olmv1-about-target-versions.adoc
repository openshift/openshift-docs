= About target versions in OLM 1.0

In Operator Lifecycle Manager 1.0, cluster administrators the set target version of an Operator in the Operator's custom resource (CR).

If the Operator's version is not specified in the CR, then OLM 1.0 defaults to the latest stable version as the target version. When updates to the Operator are published to the catalog, the Operator automatically updates to the latest stable version.

.Example CR without a specified target version
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Operator
metadata:
  name: quay-example
spec:
  packageName: quay-operator
  version: <1> 
----
<1> Leave the target version unspecified to automatically set the version to the latest stable version.

[IMPORTANT]
====
What about a specified channel with an unspecified version?
====

If you specify the Operator's target version in the CR, OLM 1.0 installs the specified version. When the target version is specified in the Operator's CR, OLM does not update the target version.

.Example CR with the target version specified
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Operator
metadata:
  name: quay-example
spec:
  packageName: quay-operator
  channel: stable-3.8
  version: 3.8.12
----

Edit the target version to change the installed version of an Operator. As long as the update is supported by the skip ranges defined in the catalog, you can update across channels and even downgrade an Operator.

.Example CR with an updated target version
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Operator
metadata:
  name: quay-example
spec:
  packageName: quay-operator
  channel: stable-3.9
  version: 3.9.1
----

You can inspect an Operator's catalog contents, including supported versions and skip ranges, by running the following command:

.Command syntax
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get package <catalog_name>-<operator_name> -o yaml
----

After a CR is created or updated, run the following command to create or configure the Operator:

.Command syntax
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <extension_name>.yaml
