= About conditions and events

Diagnose data volume issues by examining the output of the `Conditions` and `Events` sections
generated by the command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe dv <DataVolume>
----

There are three `Types` in the `Conditions` section that display:

* `Bound`
* `Running`
* `Ready`

The `Events` section provides the following additional information:

* `Type` of event
* `Reason` for logging
* `Source` of the event
* `Message` containing additional diagnostic information.

The output from `oc describe` does not always contains `Events`.

An event is generated when either `Status`, `Reason`, or `Message` changes.
Both conditions and events react to changes in the state of the data volume.

For example, if you misspell the URL during an import operation, the import
generates a 404 message. That message change generates an event with a reason.
The output in the `Conditions` section is updated as well.
