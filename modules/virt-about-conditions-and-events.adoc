= About conditions and events

Diagnose DataVolume issues by examining both _conditions_ and _events_ generated
by the command:
----
$ oc describe dv
----
* `Conditions` are based upon the value in the `Type` field from the `k8s event
log` upon pod termination. There are three conditions that can display:
** `Bound`
** `Running`
** `Ready`
+
In the `Conditions` section, a `Reason` may be listed that displays a condition (`Bound`) or a state
in the case of an operation (`Completed`). Each condition has a `Status`,
which can be either `True` or `False`. Any time a condition has a `Status` change, an event is generated.
* `Events` are based on conditions and are generated on a
change of `Status` and list the following columns of information:
** `Type` of event
** `Reason` for logging
** `Source` of the event
** `Message` containing additional diagnostic information.
The output from `oc describe dv` does not always contains `Events`.
