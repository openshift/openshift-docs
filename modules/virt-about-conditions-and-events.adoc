= About conditions and events

Diagnose DataVolume issues by examining both _conditions_ and _events_.

* `Conditions` are based upon the value in the `Type` field from the k8s event
log upon pod termination. Conditions can be `Bound`, `Running`, or `Ready`.
* `Events` may also be listed, based on condition and their transitions to
other conditions. Events list the event `Type`, `Reason` for logging, the `Source`
of the event and a detailed `Message` detailing the issue. The output
from `oc describe dv` does not always contains Events.
