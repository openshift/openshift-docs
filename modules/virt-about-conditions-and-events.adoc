= About conditions and events

Diagnose DataVolume issues by examining both _conditions_ and _events_.

* `Conditions` are based upon the value in the `Type` field from the k8s event
log upon pod termination. There are three conditions that always display:
`Bound`, `Running`, or `Ready`. Each condition has a state, as follows.
**
So for instance if Bound goes from false to true, an event is emitted. If ready goes from false to true an event is emitted. If running goes from true to false an event is emitted.
* `Events` may also be listed, based on condition and their transitions to
other states. Events list the event `Type`, `Reason` for logging, the `Source`
of the event and a detailed `Message` detailing the issue. The output
from `oc describe dv` does not always contains Events.
