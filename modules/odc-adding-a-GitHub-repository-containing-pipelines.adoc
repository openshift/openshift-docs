= Adding a GitHub repository containing pipelines

In the *Developer* perspective, you can add your GitHub repository containing pipelines to the {product-title} cluster. This allows you to run pipelines and tasks from your GitHub repository on the cluster when relevant Git events, such as push or pull requests, are triggered.

[NOTE]
====
You can add both public and private GitHub repositories.
====

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that your cluster administrator has configured the required GitHub applications in the administrator perspective.

. In the *Developer* perspective, choose the namespace or project in which you want to add your GitHub repository.
. Navigate to *Pipelines* using the left navigation pane.
. Click *Create* -> *Repository* on the right side of the *Pipelines* page.
. Enter your *Git Repo URL* and the console automatically fetches the repository name.
. Click *Show configuration options*. By default, you see only one option *Setup a webhook*. If you have a GitHub application configured, you see two options:
* *Use GitHub App*: Select this option to install your GitHub application in your repository.
* *Setup a webhook*: Select this option to add a webhook to your GitHub application.
