= Creating a Virtual Private Cloud using Terraform

Terraform is a tool that allows you to create various resources using an established template. The following process uses the default options as required to create a {hcp-title} cluster. For more information about using Terraform, see the additional resources.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed Terraform version 1.4.0 or newer on your machine.
* You have installed Git on your machine.

.Procedure

. Open a shell prompt and clone the Terraform VPC repository by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift-cs/terraform-vpc-example
----

. Navigate to the created directory by running the following command:
ifndef::egress-lockdown-rosa[]
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd terraform-vpc-example
----
endif::egress-lockdown-rosa[]
ifdef::egress-lockdown-rosa[]
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd terraform-vpc-example/zero-egress
----
endif::egress-lockdown-rosa[]

. Initiate the Terraform file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform init
----
+
A message confirming the initialization appears when this process completes.

. To build your VPC Terraform plan based on the existing Terraform template, run the `plan` command. You must include your AWS region, availability zones, CIDR blocks, and private subnets. You can choose to specify a cluster name. A `rosa-zero-egress.tfplan` file is added to the `hypershift-tf` directory after the `terraform plan` completes. For more detailed options, see the link:https://github.com/openshift-cs/terraform-vpc-example/blob/main/README.md[Terraform VPC repository's README file].
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform plan -out rosa-zero-egress.tfplan -var region=<aws_region> \ <1>
      -var 'availability_zones=["aws_region_1a","aws_region_1b","aws_region_1c"]'\ <2>
      -var vpc_cidr_block=10.0.0.0/16 \ <3>
      -var 'private_subnets=["10.0.0.0/24", "10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]' <4>
----

--
<1> Enter your AWS region.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only use egress lockdown on clusters that use the `us-west-1, us-west-2, us-east-1, us-east-2, ap-northeast-1, ap-northeast-2, ap-northeast-3, ap-south-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, ca-central-1, eu-central-1, eu-north-1, eu-west-1, eu-west-2, eu-west-3`, and `sa-east-1` AWS regions.
====

<2> Enter the availability zones for the VPC. For example, for a VPC that uses `ap-southeast-1`, you would use the following as availability zones: `["ap-southeast-1a", "ap-southeast-1b", "ap-southeast-1c"]`.
<3> Enter the CIDR block for your VPC.
<4> Enter each of the subnets that are created for the VPC.

[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform plan -out rosa.tfplan -var region=<region>
----
endif::egress-lockdown-rosa[]

. Apply this plan file to build your VPC by running the following command:
ifdef::egress-lockdown-rosa[]
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform apply rosa-zero-egress.tfplan
----
endif::egress-lockdown-rosa[]
ifndef::egress-lockdown-rosa[]

[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform apply rosa.tfplan
----
+
.. Optional: You can capture the values of the Terraform-provisioned private, public, and machinepool subnet IDs as environment variables to use when creating your {hcp-title} cluster by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export SUBNET_IDS=$(terraform output -raw cluster-subnets-string)
----
+
.. Verify that the variables were correctly set with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo $SUBNET_IDS
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ subnet-0a6a57e0f784171aa,subnet-078e84e5b10ecf5b0
