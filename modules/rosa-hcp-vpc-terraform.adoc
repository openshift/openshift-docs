= Creating an AWS Virtual Private Cloud using Terraform

Terraform is a tool that allows you to create various resources using an established template. The following process uses the default options as required to create a {hcp} for ROSA cluster. For more information about using Terraform, see the additional resources.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed Terraform on your machine.

.Procedure

. Open a shell prompt and create a directory for your Terraform files by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir hypershift-tf
----

. Navigate to the created directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd hypershift-tf
----

. Download the VPC setup Terraform file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -s -o setup-vpc.tf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-cs/OpenShift-Troubleshooting-Templates/master/rosa-hcp-terraform/setup-vpc.tf
----

. After the template has downloaded, initiate the Terraform file by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform init
----
+
A message confirming the initialization appears when this process completes.

. To build your VPC Terraform plan based off of the downloaded template, run the `plan` command. You can specify a cluster name and your AWS region.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform plan -out rosa.plan [-var aws_region=<region>] [-var cluster_name=<cluster_name>]
----

. You should have a `rosa.plan` file in the directory that you created in the first step. Apply this plan file to build your VPC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform apply rosa.plan
----

. Optional: You can capture the values of the Terraform-provisioned private, public, and machinepool subnet IDs as environment variables to use when creating your {hcp} for ROSA cluster by running the following commands:
+
** For the private subnet ID:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ PRIVATE_SUBNET=`terraform output -raw cluster-private-subnet`
----
** For the public subnet ID:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ PUBLIC_SUBNET=`terraform output -raw cluster-public-subnet`
----
** For the machinepool subnet ID:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ MACHINEPOOL_SUBNET=`terraform output -raw node-private-subnet`
----
