= Creating a Virtual Private Cloud using Terraform

Terraform is a tool that allows you to create various resources using an established template. The following process uses the default options as required to create a {hcp-title} cluster. For more information about using Terraform, see the additional resources.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed Terraform version 1.4.0 or newer on your machine.
* You have installed Git on your machine.

.Procedure

. Open a shell prompt and clone the Terraform VPC repository by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift-cs/terraform-vpc-example
----

. Navigate to the created directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd terraform-vpc-example
----

. Initiate the Terraform file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform init
----
+
A message confirming the initialization appears when this process completes.

. To build your VPC Terraform plan based on the existing Terraform template, run the `plan` command. You must include your AWS region. You can choose to specify a cluster name. A `rosa.tfplan` file is added to the `hypershift-tf` directory after the `terraform plan` completes. For more detailed options, see the link:https://github.com/openshift-cs/terraform-vpc-example/blob/main/README.md[Terraform VPC repository's README file].
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform plan -out rosa.tfplan -var region=<region> [-var cluster_name=<cluster_name>]
----

. Apply this plan file to build your VPC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform apply rosa.tfplan
----

. Optional: You can capture the values of the Terraform-provisioned private, public, and machinepool subnet IDs as environment variables to use when creating your {hcp-title} cluster by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export SUBNET_IDS=$(terraform output -raw cluster-subnets-string)
----

.Verification

* You can verify that the variables were correctly set with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo $SUBNET_IDS
----
+
.Sample output
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ subnet-0a6a57e0f784171aa,subnet-078e84e5b10ecf5b0
