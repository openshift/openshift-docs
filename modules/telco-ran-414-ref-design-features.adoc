//CNF-7365
|{ztp} independence from managed cluster version
a|You can now use {ztp} to manage clusters that are running different versions of {product-title} compared to the version that is running on the hub cluster. You can also have a mix of {product-title} versions in the deployed fleet of clusters.

//CNF-7078
//|Intel Westport Channel e810 NIC as PTP Grandmaster clock
//a|You can use the Intel Westport Channel E810-XXVDA4T as a GNSS-sourced grandmaster clock.
//The NIC is automatically configured by the PTP Operator with the E810 hardware plugin.
//This feature is scheduled for an upcoming 4.14 z-stream release.
