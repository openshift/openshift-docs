= Disabling boot image management

By default, for {gcp-first} and {aws-first} clusters, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) manages and updates the boot image in the machine sets in your cluster whenever you update your cluster. For {vmw-first}, you can enable boot image management as a Technology Preview feature.

You can disable the boot image management feature for your cluster by editing the `MachineConfiguration` object. When disabled, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) no longer manages the boot image in your cluster and no longer updates the boot image with each cluster update.

Disabling this feature does not rollback the nodes or machine sets to the originally-installed boot image. The machine sets retain the boot image version that was present when the feature was disabled and is not updated if the cluster is upgraded to a new {product-title} version in the future. This feature has no effect on existing nodes.

After disabling the feature, you can re-enable the feature at any time. For more information, see "Enabling updated boot images".

.Procedure

. Edit the `MachineConfiguration` object to disable the boot image management feature for some or all of your machine sets:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit MachineConfiguration cluster
----

* Optional: Disable the feature for all machine sets:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfiguration
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
# ...
  managedBootImages: <1>
    machineManagers:
    - apiGroup: machine.openshift.io <2>
      resource: machinesets <3>
      selection:
        mode: None <4>
----
+
--
<1> Configures the boot image management feature.
<2> Specifies an API group. This must be `machine.openshift.io`.
<3> Specifies the resource within the specified API group to apply the change. This must be `machinesets`.
<4> Specifies that the feature is disabled for all machine sets in the cluster.
