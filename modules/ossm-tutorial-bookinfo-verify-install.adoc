.Procedure from Kiali web console

. Obtain the address for the Kiali web console.

.. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` rights. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.. Navigate to *Networking* -> *Routes*.

.. On the *Routes* page, select the {SMProductShortName} control plane project, for example `istio-system`, from the *Namespace* menu.
+
The *Location* column displays the linked address for each route.
+

.. Click the link in the *Location* column for Kiali.

.. Click *Log In With OpenShift*. The Kiali *Overview* screen presents tiles for each project namespace.

. In Kiali, click *Graph*.

. Select bookinfo from the *Namespace* list, and App graph from the *Graph Type* list.

. Click *Display idle nodes* from the *Display* menu.
+
This displays nodes that are defined but have not received or sent requests. It can confirm that an application is properly defined, but that no request traffic has been reported.
