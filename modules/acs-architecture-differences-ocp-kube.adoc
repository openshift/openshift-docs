= Architectural differences between installation on {ocp} and Kubernetes

When you install {product-title-short} on the {ocp}, there are only two architectural differences:

. {product-title-short} installs a lightweight version of Scanner on every secured cluster when you install {product-title-short} on {ocp} by using the Operator. The lightweight Scanner enables the scanning of images in the integrated OpenShift image registry. When you install {product-title-short} by using the Helm install method with the _default_ values, the lightweight version of Scanner is not installed. To install the lightweight Scanner on the secured cluster by using Helm, you must set the `scanner.disable=false` parameter.

. Sensor can communicate with the lightweight Scanner installed in the secured cluster. This connection allows Sensor to access registries directly from the secured cluster in scenarios where Central might be unable to access them. Scanner requests updated data from Sensor, Sensor forwards these requests to Central, and Central downloads the requested data from `definitions.stackrox.io`.
