= Architectural differences between installation on {ocp} and Kubernetes

When you install {product-title-short} on the {ocp}, there are only two architectural differences:

. {product-title-short} installs a lightweight version of Scanner on every secured cluster when you install {product-title-short} on the {ocp} using the Operator or the Helm install method.
The lightweight Scanner enables the scanning of images in the integrated OpenShift Container Registry (OCR).
. Sensor communicates with Scanner in the cluster where you have installed Central.
This connection allows accessing internal registries attached to the cluster.
