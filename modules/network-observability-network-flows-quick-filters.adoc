= Quick filters for network traffic

[role="_abstract"]
Quick filters are predefined query shortcuts located above the flow table. They provide immediate access to common traffic segments without requiring manual configuration of multiple filter criteria.


The following quick filters are available by default:

External ingress::
Isolates traffic originating outside the cluster entering the SDN. This is identified by the `EXT:` prefix in the subnet labels.

External egress::
Isolates traffic originating within the cluster directed toward external destinations.

Internal::
Filters for pod-to-pod and service-to-service communication within the cluster SDN.

Dropped::
Displays traffic that was blocked by network policies or infrastructure-level failures.

[NOTE]
====
Quick filters are namespace-scoped. Users with access to specific namespaces will only see filters and traffic data relevant to their authorized workloads.
