The *Vulnerability Management* view displays information you can act on in multiple widgets.
For example, you can identify the riskiest deployments in your infrastructure from the *Top Risky Deployments* widget.

To open the *Vulnerability Management* view:

* Navigate to the RHACS portal and click *Vulnerability Management* from the navigation menu and select **Dashboard**
The *Vulnerability Management* view presents information in multiple interactive widgets.

Using all these components gives you a complete view of the vulnerabilities in your environment ranging from deployments and images, to the software components from which they are built.
