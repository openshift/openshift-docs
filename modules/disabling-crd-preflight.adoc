= Disabling CRD upgrade safety preflight check

The custom resource definition (CRD) upgrade safety preflight check can be disabled by adding the `preflight.crdUpgradeSafety.disabled` field with a value of `true` to the `ClusterExtension` object that provides the CRD.

[WARNING]
====
Disabling the CRD upgrade safety preflight check could break backwards compatibility with stored versions of the CRD and cause other unintended consequences on the cluster.
====

You cannot disable individual field validators. If you disable the CRD upgrade safety preflight check, all field validators are disabled.

[NOTE]
====
The following checks are handled by the Kubernetes API server:

* The scope changes from `Cluster` to `Namespace` or from `Namespace` to `Cluster`
* An existing stored version of the CRD is removed

After disabling the CRD upgrade safety preflight check via {olmv1-first}, these two operations are still prevented by Kubernetes.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have a cluster extension installed.

.Procedure

. Edit the `ClusterExtension` object of the CRD:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit clusterextension <clusterextension_name>
----

. Set the `preflight.crdUpgradeSafety.disabled` field to `true`:
