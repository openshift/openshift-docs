= Disabling the CRD upgrade safety preflight check

[role="_abstract"]

You can disable the custom resource definition (CRD) upgrade safety preflight check. In the `ClusterExtension` object that provides the CRD, set the `install.preflight.crdUpgradeSafety.enforcement` field with the value of `None`.

[WARNING]
====
Disabling the CRD upgrade safety preflight check could break backwards compatibility with stored versions of the CRD and cause other unintended consequences on the cluster.
====

You cannot disable individual field validators. If you disable the CRD upgrade safety preflight check, you disable all field validators.

[NOTE]
====
If you disable the CRD upgrade safety preflight check in {olmv1-first}, the Kubernetes API server still prevents the following operations:

* Changing scope from `Cluster` to `Namespace` or from `Namespace` to `Cluster`
* Removing an existing stored version of the CRD
====

.Prerequisites

* You have a cluster extension installed.

.Procedure
