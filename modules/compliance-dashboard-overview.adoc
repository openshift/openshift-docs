= Compliance dashboard overview

After you have performed a compliance scan, the compliance dashboard displays the results as the compliance status for your environment. You can view compliance violations directly from the dashboard. To find out if your environment is compliant against specific benchmarks, filter the detailed view and drill down into the compliance standards.

You can use shortcuts to check the compliance status of clusters, namespaces, and nodes, which are located at the upper right of your compliance dashboard. Clicking these shortcuts, you can view the compliance snapshot and generate reports on the overall compliance of your clusters, namespaces, or nodes.
