Required::
  - `agent`

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `agent`
| `object`
| Agent configuration for flows extraction.

| `consolePlugin`
| `object`
| `consolePlugin` defines the settings related to the {product-title} Console plugin, when available.

| `deploymentModel`
| `string`
| `deploymentModel` defines the desired type of deployment for flow processing. Possible values are: +
 - `DIRECT` (default) to make the flow processor listening directly from the agents. +
 - `KAFKA` to make flows sent to a Kafka pipeline before consumption by the processor. +
 Kafka can provide better scalability, resiliency, and high availability (for more details, see https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-apache-kafka).

| `exporters`
| `array`
| `exporters` define additional optional exporters for custom consumption or storage.

| `kafka`
| `object`
| Kafka configuration, allowing to use Kafka as a broker as part of the flow collection pipeline. Available when the `spec.deploymentModel` is `KAFKA`.

| `loki`
| `object`
| Loki, the flow store, client settings.

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace where NetObserv pods are deployed. If empty, the namespace of the operator is going to be used.

| `processor`
| `object`
| `processor` defines the settings of the component that receives the flows from the agent, enriches them, generates metrics, and forwards them to the Loki persistence layer and/or any available exporter.

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `ebpf`
| `object`
| `ebpf` describes the settings related to the eBPF-based flow reporter when `spec.agent.type` is set to `EBPF`.

| `ipfix`
| `object`
| `ipfix` - _deprecated (*)_ - describes the settings related to the IPFIX-based flow reporter when `spec.agent.type` is set to `IPFIX`.

| `string`
| `type` selects the flows tracing agent. Possible values are: +
 - `EBPF` (default) to use NetObserv eBPF agent. +
 - `IPFIX` - _deprecated (*)_ - to use the legacy IPFIX collector. +
 `EBPF` is recommended as it offers better performances and should work regardless of the CNI installed on the cluster. `IPFIX` works with OVN-Kubernetes CNI (other CNIs could work if they support exporting IPFIX, but they would require manual configuration).

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `cacheActiveTimeout`
| `string`
| `cacheActiveTimeout` is the max period during which the reporter will aggregate flows before sending. Increasing `cacheMaxFlows` and `cacheActiveTimeout` can decrease the network traffic overhead and the CPU load, however you can expect higher memory consumption and an increased latency in the flow collection.

| `cacheMaxFlows`
| `integer`
| `cacheMaxFlows` is the max number of flows in an aggregate; when reached, the reporter sends the flows. Increasing `cacheMaxFlows` and `cacheActiveTimeout` can decrease the network traffic overhead and the CPU load, however you can expect higher memory consumption and an increased latency in the flow collection.

| `debug`
| `object`
| `debug` allows setting some aspects of the internal configuration of the eBPF agent. This section is aimed exclusively for debugging and fine-grained performance optimizations, such as GOGC and GOMAXPROCS env vars. Users setting its values do it at their own risk.

| `excludeInterfaces`
| `array (string)`
| `excludeInterfaces` contains the interface names that will be excluded from flow tracing. An entry is enclosed by slashes, such as `/br-/`, is matched as a regular expression. Otherwise it is matched as a case-sensitive string.

| `imagePullPolicy`
| `string`
| `imagePullPolicy` is the Kubernetes pull policy for the image defined above

| `interfaces`
| `array (string)`

| `string`
| `logLevel` defines the log level for the NetObserv eBPF Agent

| `privileged`
| `boolean`
| Privileged mode for the eBPF Agent container. In general this setting can be ignored or set to false: in that case, the operator will set granular capabilities (BPF, PERFMON, NET_ADMIN, SYS_RESOURCE) to the container, to enable its correct operation. If for some reason these capabilities cannot be set, such as if an old kernel version not knowing CAP_BPF is in use, then you can turn on this mode for more global privileges.

| `resources`
| `object`
| `resources` are the compute resources required by this container. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

| `sampling`
| `integer`
| Sampling rate of the flow reporter. 100 means one flow on 100 is sent. 0 or 1 means all flows are sampled.

| `clusterNetworkOperator`
| `object`
| `clusterNetworkOperator` defines the settings related to the {product-title} Cluster Network Operator, when available.

| `forceSampleAll`
| `boolean`
| `forceSampleAll` allows disabling sampling in the IPFIX-based flow reporter. It is not recommended to sample all the traffic with IPFIX, as it might generate cluster instability. If you REALLY want to do that, set this flag to true. Use at your own risk. When it is set to true, the value of `sampling` is ignored.

| `ovnKubernetes`
| `object`
| `ovnKubernetes` defines the settings of the OVN-Kubernetes CNI, when available. This configuration is used when using OVN's IPFIX exports, without {product-title}. When using {product-title}, refer to the `clusterNetworkOperator` property instead.

| `sampling`
| `integer`
| `sampling` is the sampling rate on the reporter. 100 means one flow on 100 is sent. To ensure cluster stability, it is not possible to set a value below 2. If you really want to sample every packet, which might impact the cluster stability, refer to `forceSampleAll`. Alternatively, you can use the eBPF Agent instead of IPFIX.
