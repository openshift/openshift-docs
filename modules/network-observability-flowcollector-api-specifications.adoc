| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and might reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers might infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| `object`
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| Defines the desired state of the FlowCollector resource.  +

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `agent`
| `object`
| Agent configuration for flows extraction.

| `consolePlugin`
| `object`
| `consolePlugin` defines the settings related to the {product-title} Console plugin, when available.

| `deploymentModel`
| `string`
| `deploymentModel` defines the desired type of deployment for flow processing. Possible values are: +
 - `DIRECT` (default) to make the flow processor listening directly from the agents. +
 - `KAFKA` to make flows sent to a Kafka pipeline before consumption by the processor. +
 Kafka can provide better scalability, resiliency, and high availability (for more details, see https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-apache-kafka).

| `exporters`
| `array`
| `exporters` define additional optional exporters for custom consumption or storage.

| `kafka`
| `object`
| Kafka configuration, allowing to use Kafka as a broker as part of the flow collection pipeline. Available when the `spec.deploymentModel` is `KAFKA`.

| `loki`
| `object`
| Loki, the flow store, client settings.

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace where Network Observability pods are deployed.

| `processor`
| `object`
| `processor` defines the settings of the component that receives the flows from the agent, enriches them, generates metrics, and forwards them to the Loki persistence layer and/or any available exporter.

|===
== .spec.agent

+
--
Agent configuration for flows extraction.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `ebpf`
| `object`
| `ebpf` describes the settings related to the eBPF-based flow reporter when `spec.agent.type` is set to `EBPF`.

| `ipfix`
| `object`
| `ipfix` [deprecated (*)] - describes the settings related to the IPFIX-based flow reporter when `spec.agent.type` is set to `IPFIX`.

| `type`
| `string`
| `type` selects the flows tracing agent. Possible values are: +
 - `EBPF` (default) to use Network Observability eBPF agent. +
 - `IPFIX` [deprecated (*)] - to use the legacy IPFIX collector. +
 `EBPF` is recommended as it offers better performances and should work regardless of the CNI installed on the cluster. `IPFIX` works with OVN-Kubernetes CNI (other CNIs could work if they support exporting IPFIX, but they would require manual configuration).

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `cacheActiveTimeout`
| `string`
| `cacheActiveTimeout` is the max period during which the reporter aggregates flows before sending. Increasing `cacheMaxFlows` and `cacheActiveTimeout` can decrease the network traffic overhead and the CPU load, however you can expect higher memory consumption and an increased latency in the flow collection.

| `cacheMaxFlows`
| `integer`
| `cacheMaxFlows` is the max number of flows in an aggregate; when reached, the reporter sends the flows. Increasing `cacheMaxFlows` and `cacheActiveTimeout` can decrease the network traffic overhead and the CPU load, however you can expect higher memory consumption and an increased latency in the flow collection.

| `debug`
| `object`
| `debug` allows setting some aspects of the internal configuration of the eBPF agent. This section is aimed exclusively for debugging and fine-grained performance optimizations, such as GOGC and GOMAXPROCS env vars. Users setting its values do it at their own risk.

| `excludeInterfaces`
| `array (string)`
| `excludeInterfaces` contains the interface names that are excluded from flow tracing. An entry is enclosed by slashes, such as `/br-/` and is matched as a regular expression. Otherwise it is matched as a case-sensitive string.

| `features`
| `array (string)`
| List of additional features to enable. They are all disabled by default. Enabling additional features might have performance impacts. Possible values are: +
 - `PacketDrop`: enable the packets drop flows logging feature. This feature requires mounting the kernel debug filesystem, so the eBPF pod has to run as privileged. If the `spec.agent.eBPF.privileged` parameter is not set, an error is reported. +
 - `DNSTracking`: enable the DNS tracking feature. This feature requires mounting the kernel debug filesystem hence the eBPF pod has to run as privileged. If the `spec.agent.eBPF.privileged` parameter is not set, an error is reported. +
 - `FlowRTT` [unsupported (*)]: enable flow latency (RTT) calculations in the eBPF agent during TCP handshakes. This feature better works with `sampling` set to 1. +


| `imagePullPolicy`
| `string`
| `imagePullPolicy` is the Kubernetes pull policy for the image defined above

| `interfaces`
| `array (string)`
| `interfaces` contains the interface names from where flows are collected. If empty, the agent fetches all the interfaces in the system, excepting the ones listed in ExcludeInterfaces. An entry is enclosed by slashes, such as `/br-/`, is matched as a regular expression. Otherwise it is matched as a case-sensitive string.

| `kafkaBatchSize`
| `integer`
| `kafkaBatchSize` limits the maximum size of a request in bytes before being sent to a partition. Ignored when not using Kafka. Default: 10MB.

| `logLevel`
| `string`
| `logLevel` defines the log level for the Network Observability eBPF Agent

| `privileged`
| `boolean`
| Privileged mode for the eBPF Agent container. In general this setting can be ignored or set to false: in that case, the operator sets granular capabilities (BPF, PERFMON, NET_ADMIN, SYS_RESOURCE) to the container, to enable its correct operation. If for some reason these capabilities cannot be set, such as if an old kernel version not knowing CAP_BPF is in use, then you can turn on this mode for more global privileges.

| `resources`
| `object`
| `resources` are the compute resources required by this container. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

| `sampling`
| `integer`
| Sampling rate of the flow reporter. 100 means one flow on 100 is sent. 0 or 1 means all flows are sampled.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `env`
| `object (string)`
| `env` allows passing custom environment variables to underlying components. Useful for passing some very concrete performance-tuning options, such as GOGC and GOMAXPROCS, that should not be publicly exposed as part of the FlowCollector descriptor, as they are only useful in edge debug or support scenarios.

| `integer-or-string`
| Limits describes the maximum amount of compute resources allowed. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

| `requests`
| `integer-or-string`

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `cacheActiveTimeout`
| `string`

| `clusterNetworkOperator`
| `object`
| `clusterNetworkOperator` defines the settings related to the {product-title} Cluster Network Operator, when available.

| `forceSampleAll`
| `boolean`
| `forceSampleAll` allows disabling sampling in the IPFIX-based flow reporter. It is not recommended to sample all the traffic with IPFIX, as it might generate cluster instability. If you REALLY want to do that, set this flag to true. Use at your own risk. When it is set to true, the value of `sampling` is ignored.

| `ovnKubernetes`
| `object`
| `ovnKubernetes` defines the settings of the OVN-Kubernetes CNI, when available. This configuration is used when using OVN's IPFIX exports, without {product-title}. When using {product-title}, refer to the `clusterNetworkOperator` property instead.

| `sampling`
| `integer`
| `sampling` is the sampling rate on the reporter. 100 means one flow on 100 is sent. To ensure cluster stability, it is not possible to set a value below 2. If you really want to sample every packet, which might impact the cluster stability, refer to `forceSampleAll`. Alternatively, you can use the eBPF Agent instead of IPFIX.
