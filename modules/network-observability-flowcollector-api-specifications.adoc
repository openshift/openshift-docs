| `advanced`
| `object`
| `advanced` allows setting some aspects of the internal configuration of the eBPF agent.
This section is aimed mostly for debugging and fine-grained performance optimizations,
such as `GOGC` and `GOMAXPROCS` env vars. Set these values at your own risk.

| `cacheActiveTimeout`
| `string`
| `cacheActiveTimeout` is the max period during which the reporter aggregates flows before sending.
Increasing `cacheMaxFlows` and `cacheActiveTimeout` can decrease the network traffic overhead and the CPU load,
however you can expect higher memory consumption and an increased latency in the flow collection.

| `cacheMaxFlows`
| `integer`
| `cacheMaxFlows` is the max number of flows in an aggregate; when reached, the reporter sends the flows.
Increasing `cacheMaxFlows` and `cacheActiveTimeout` can decrease the network traffic overhead and the CPU load,
however you can expect higher memory consumption and an increased latency in the flow collection.

| `excludeInterfaces`
| `array (string)`
| `excludeInterfaces` contains the interface names that are excluded from flow tracing.
An entry enclosed by slashes, such as `/br-/`, is matched as a regular expression.
Otherwise it is matched as a case-sensitive string.

| `features`
| `array (string)`
| List of additional features to enable. They are all disabled by default. Enabling additional features might have performance impacts. Possible values are: +

- `PacketDrop`: enable the packets drop flows logging feature. This feature requires mounting
the kernel debug filesystem, so the eBPF pod has to run as privileged.
If the `spec.agent.ebpf.privileged` parameter is not set, an error is reported. +

- `DNSTracking`: enable the DNS tracking feature. +

- `FlowRTT`: enable flow latency (sRTT) extraction in the eBPF agent from TCP traffic. +

Otherwise it is matched as a case-sensitive string.

| `kafkaBatchSize`

| `kafkaBatchSize` limits the maximum size of a request in bytes before being sent to a partition. Ignored when not using Kafka. Default: 1MB.

| `logLevel`
| `string`
| `logLevel` defines the log level for the Network Observability eBPF Agent

| `metrics`
| `object`
| `metrics` defines the eBPF agent configuration regarding metrics.

| `privileged`
| `boolean`
| Privileged mode for the eBPF Agent container. When ignored or set to `false`, the operator sets
granular capabilities (BPF, PERFMON, NET_ADMIN, SYS_RESOURCE) to the container.
If for some reason these capabilities cannot be set, such as if an old kernel version not knowing CAP_BPF
is in use, then you can turn on this mode for more global privileges.
Some agent features require the privileged mode, such as packet drops tracking (see `features`) and SR-IOV support.

| `resources`
| `object`
| `resources` are the compute resources required by this container.
For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

| `sampling`
| `integer`
| Sampling rate of the flow reporter. 100 means one flow on 100 is sent. 0 or 1 means all flows are sampled.

| Set `enable` to `true` to store flows in Loki.
The Console plugin can use either Loki or Prometheus as a data source for metrics (see also `spec.prometheus.querier`), or both.
Not all queries are transposable from Loki to Prometheus. Hence, if Loki is disabled, some features of the plugin are disabled as well,
such as getting per-pod information or viewing raw flows.
If both Prometheus and Loki are enabled, Prometheus takes precedence and Loki is used as a fallback for queries that Prometheus cannot handle.
If they are both disabled, the Console plugin is not deployed.

It is enbaled by default: set it to `false` to disable this feature.
The Console plugin can use either Loki or Prometheus as a data source for metrics (see also `spec.loki`), or both.
Not all queries are transposable from Loki to Prometheus. Hence, if Loki is disabled, some features of the plugin are disabled as well,
such as getting per-pod information or viewing raw flows.
If both Prometheus and Loki are enabled, Prometheus takes precedence and Loki is used as a fallback for queries that Prometheus cannot handle.
If they are both disabled, the Console plugin is not deployed.
