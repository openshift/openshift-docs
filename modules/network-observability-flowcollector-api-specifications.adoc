Possible values are "DIRECT" (default) to make the flow processor listening directly from the agents, or "KAFKA" to make flows sent to a Kafka pipeline before consumption by the processor. Kafka can provide better scalability, resiliency and high availability (for more details, see https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-apache-kafka).

| `exporters`
| `array`
| exporters defines additional optional exporters for custom consumption or storage. This is an experimental feature. Currently, only KAFKA exporter is available.

| `exporters[]`
| `object`
| FlowCollectorExporter defines an additional exporter to send enriched flows to

"EBPF" is recommended in most cases as it offers better performances and should work regardless of the CNI installed on the cluster. "IPFIX" works with OVN-Kubernetes CNI (other CNIs could work if they support exporting IPFIX, but they would require manual configuration).

| Property | Type | Description

| `cacheActiveTimeout`
| `string`
| cacheActiveTimeout is the max period during which the reporter will aggregate flows before sending. Increasing `cacheMaxFlows` and `cacheActiveTimeout` can decrease the network traffic overhead and the CPU load, however you can expect higher memory consumption and an increased latency in the flow collection.

| cacheMaxFlows is the max number of flows in an aggregate; when reached, the reporter sends the flows. Increasing `cacheMaxFlows` and `cacheActiveTimeout` can decrease the network traffic overhead and the CPU load, however you can expect higher memory consumption and an increased latency in the flow collection.

| `debug`
| `object`
| Debug allows setting some aspects of the internal configuration of the eBPF agent. This section is aimed exclusively for debugging and fine-grained performance optimizations, such as GOGC and GOMAXPROCS env vars. Users setting its values do it at their own risk.

| `excludeInterfaces`

| `interfaces`

| `string`
| logLevel defines the log level for the NetObserv eBPF Agent

| `privileged`
| `boolean`
| privileged mode for the eBPF Agent container. In general this setting can be ignored or set to false: in that case, the operator will set granular capabilities (BPF, PERFMON, NET_ADMIN, SYS_RESOURCE) to the container, to enable its correct operation. If for some reason these capabilities cannot be set, such as if an old kernel version not knowing CAP_BPF is in use, then you can turn on this mode for more global privileges.

| `object`
| resources are the compute resources required by this container. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

| `object`
| clusterNetworkOperator defines the settings related to the {product-title} Cluster Network Operator, when available.

| `forceSampleAll`
| `boolean`
| forceSampleAll allows disabling sampling in the IPFIX-based flow reporter. It is not recommended to sample all the traffic with IPFIX, as it might generate cluster instability. If you REALLY want to do that, set this flag to true. Use at your own risk. When it is set to true, the value of "sampling" is ignored.

| `ovnKubernetes`
| `object`
| ovnKubernetes defines the settings of the OVN-Kubernetes CNI, when available. This configuration is used when using OVN's IPFIX exports, without {product-title}. When using {product-title}, refer to the `clusterNetworkOperator` property instead.

| sampling is the sampling rate on the reporter. 100 means one flow on 100 is sent. To ensure cluster stability, it is not possible to set a value below 2. If you really want to sample every packet, which might impact the cluster stability, refer to "forceSampleAll". Alternatively, you can use the eBPF Agent instead of IPFIX.

=== .spec.processor.debug
Description::
+
--
Debug allows setting some aspects of the internal configuration of the flow processor. This section is aimed exclusively for debugging and fine-grained performance optimizations, such as GOGC and GOMAXPROCS env vars. Users setting its values do it at their own risk.

| `env`
| `object (string)`
| env allows passing custom environment variables to the NetObserv Agent. Useful for passing some very concrete performance-tuning options, such as GOGC and GOMAXPROCS that shouldn't be publicly exposed as part of the FlowCollector descriptor, as they are only useful in edge debug and support scenarios.

Required::
  - `lastTransitionTime`
  - `message`
  - `reason`
  - `status`
  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This might be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers of specific condition types might define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field might not be empty.

| `status`
| `string`
| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. --- Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deescalate is important. The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)
