= About power-based remediation of bare metal
In a bare metal cluster, remediation of nodes is critical to ensuring the overall health of the cluster. Physically remediating a cluster can be challenging and any delay in putting the machine into a safe or an operational state increases the time the cluster remains in a degraded state, and the risk that subsequent failures might bring the cluster offline. Power-based remediation helps counter such challenges.

Instead of reprovisioning the nodes, power-based remediation uses a power controller to power off an inoperable node. This type of remediation is also called power fencing.

{product-title} uses the `MachineHealthCheck` controller to detect faulty bare metal nodes. Power-based remediation is fast and reboots faulty nodes instead of removing them from the cluster.

Power-based remediation provides the following capabilities:

* Allows the recovery of control plane nodes
* Reduces the risk data loss in hyperconverged environments
* Reduces the downtime associated with recovering physical machines

[id="machine-health-checks-bare-metal_{context}"]
== MachineHealthChecks on bare metal

Machine deletion on bare metal cluster triggers reprovisioning of a bare metal host.
Usually bare metal reprovisioning is a lengthy process, during which the cluster
is missing compute resources and applications might be interrupted.
To change the default remediation process from machine deletion to host power-cycle,
annotate the `MachineHealthCheck` resource with the
`machine.openshift.io/remediation-strategy: external-baremetal` annotation.

After you set the annotation, unhealthy machines are power-cycled by using
BMC credentials.

[id="mgmt-understanding-remediation-process_{context}"]
== Understanding the remediation process

The remediation process operates as follows:

. The MachineHealthCheck (MHC) controller detects that a node is unhealthy.
. The MHC notifies the bare metal machine controller which requests to power-off the unhealthy node.
. After the power is off, the node is deleted, which allows the cluster to reschedule the affected workload on other nodes.
. The bare metal machine controller requests to power on the node.
. After the node is up, the node re-registers itself with the cluster, resulting in the creation of a new node.
. After the node is recreated, the bare metal machine controller restores the annotations and labels that existed on the unhealthy node before its deletion.

[NOTE]
====
If the power operations did not complete, the bare metal machine controller triggers the reprovisioning of the unhealthy node unless this is a control plane node (also known as the master node) or a node that was provisioned externally.

== Creating a MachineHealthCheck resource for bare metal

.Prerequisites

* The {product-title} is installed using installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI).
* Access to Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) credentials (or BMC access to each node)
* Network access to the BMC interface of the unhealthy node.

.Procedure
. Create a `healthcheck.yaml` file that contains the definition of your machine health check.
. Apply the `healthcheck.yaml` file to your cluster using the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f healthcheck.yaml
----

.Sample `MachineHealthCheck` resource for bare metal

apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1

  nodeStartupTimeout: "10m" <7>
----

<1> Specify the name of the machine health check to deploy.
<2> For bare metal clusters, you must include the `machine.openshift.io/remediation-strategy: external-baremetal` annotation in the `annotations` section to enable power-cycle remediation. With this remediation strategy, unhealthy hosts are rebooted instead of removed from the cluster.
<3> Specify a label for the machine pool that you want to check.
<4> Specify the machine set to track in `<cluster_name>-<label>-<zone>` format. For example, `prod-node-us-east-1a`.
<5> Specify the timeout duration for the node condition. If the condition is met for the duration of the timeout, the machine will be remediated. Long timeouts can result in long periods of downtime for a workload on an unhealthy machine.
<6> Specify the amount of unhealthy machines allowed in the targeted pool. This can be set as a percentage or an integer.
<7> Specify the timeout duration that a machine health check must wait for a node to join the cluster before a machine is determined to be unhealthy.

[NOTE]
====
The `matchLabels` are examples only; you must map your machine groups based on your specific needs.

[mgmt-troubleshooting-issue-power-remediation_{context}]
== Troubleshooting issues with power-based remediation

To troubleshoot an issue with power-based remediation, verify the following:

* You have access to the BMC.
* BMC is connected to the control plane node that is responsible for running the remediation task.
