= Creating a secret for Loki storage

[role="_abstract"]
Create a secret with cloud storage credentials, such as for {aws-first}, to allow the Loki Operator to access the necessary object store for log persistence.

The {loki-op} supports a few log storage options, such as AWS S3, {gcp-full} Storage, Azure, Swift, Minio, {rh-storage}. The following example shows how to create a secret for AWS S3 storage. The secret created in this example, `loki-s3`, is referenced in "Creating a LokiStack custom resource". You can create this secret in the web console or CLI.

.Procedure

. Using the web console, navigate to the *Project* -> *All Projects* dropdown and select *Create Project*.
. Name the project `netobserv` and click *Create*.
. Navigate to the Import icon, *+*, in the top right corner. Paste your YAML file into the editor.

The following shows an example secret YAML file for S3 storage:

<1> The installation examples in this documentation use the same namespace, `netobserv`, across all components. You can optionally use a different namespace for the different components

.Verification
* After you create the secret, you view the secret listed under *Workloads* -> *Secrets* in the web console.
