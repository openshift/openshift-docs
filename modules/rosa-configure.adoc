[id="rosa-configure_{context}"]
= Configuring the {rosa-cli}

[role="_abstract"]
Use the following commands to configure the {rosa-cli-first}.

[id="rosa-login_{context}"]
== login
There are several methods you can use to log in to your Red{nbsp}Hat account using the {rosa-cli-first}. These methods are described in detail below.

[id="rosa-login-sso_{context}"]
== Authenticating the {rosa-cli} with Red Hat single sign-on

You can log in to the {rosa-cli-first} with Red{nbsp}Hat single sign-on. Red{nbsp}Hat recommends using the `rosa` command line tool with Red{nbsp}Hat single sign-on, instead of using an offline authentication token.

An offline authentication token is long-lived, stored on your operating system, and cannot be revoked. These factors increase overall security risks and the likelihood of unauthorized access to your account.

Alternatively, authenticating with the Red{nbsp}Hat single sign-on method automatically sends your `rosa` instance a refresh token that is valid for 10 hours. This unique, temporary authorization code enhances security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The method of authenticating using Red{nbsp}Hat single sign-on does not break any existing automations that rely on offline tokens. Red{nbsp}Hat recommends using link:https://console.redhat.com/iam/service-accounts[services accounts] for automation purposes. If you still need to use offline tokens for automation or other purposes, you can download the OpenShift Cluster Manager API token from the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token[OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token] page.
====

Use one of the following methods of authentication:

* If your system has a web browser, see the "Authenticating the {rosa-cli} with a single sign-on authorization code" section to authenticate with Red Hat single sign-on.

* If you are working with containers, remote hosts, or other environments without a web browser, see the "Authenticating the {rosa-cli} with a single sign-on device code" section to authenticate with Red{nbsp}Hat single sign-on.

* To authenticate the {rosa-cli} using an offline token, see the "Authenticating the {rosa-cli} with an offline token" section.

[NOTE]
====
Single sign-on authorization is supported with {rosa-cli} version 1.2.36 or later.

[id="rosa-login-sso-device_{context}"]
== Authenticating the {rosa-cli} with a single sign-on device code
