[id="rosa-configure_{context}"]
= Configuring the ROSA CLI

Use the following commands to configure the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI, `rosa`.

[id="rosa-login_{context}"]
== login
There are several methods you can use to log into your Red{nbsp}Hat account using the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI (`rosa`). These methods are described in detail below.

[IMPORTANT]
====
An offline authentication token is long-lived, stored on your operating system, and cannot be revoked. These factors increase overall security risks and the likelihood of unauthorized access to your account. Alternatively, the Red{nbsp}Hat secure browser-based single sign-on (SSO) method automatically sends your CLI instance a refresh token that is valid for 10 hours. Because this authorization code is unique and temporary, it is more secure and is the Red{nbsp}Hat recommended method of authentication.
====

// Furthermore, offline authentication tokens are usually stored on your device by your operating system, which means other apps on your machine can access a token if the token is not properly secured. These offline tokens are long-lived and cannot be revoked. Users must copy and paste them manually which creates a security risk. Because of these factors, Red{nbsp}Hat recommends using the single sign-on method when logging into your account with the ROSA CLI (`rosa`). This method is more secure than logging in with an offline token.
// ====


[id="rosa-login-sso_{context}"]
=== login with single sign-on (SSO) authorization code

If your system supports a web-based browser, you can log in to the ROSA CLI (`rosa`) with a Red{nbsp}Hat single sign-on (SSO) authorization code.

[NOTE]
====
Single sign-on authorization is supported with ROSA CLI (`rosa`) version 1.2.36 or later.
====

. To log into the ROSA CLI (`rosa`) with a Red{nbsp}Hat single sign-on authorization code, run the following command:

+
.Syntax
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login --use-auth-code
----
+
Running this command will redirect you to the Red{nbsp}Hat SSO login. Log in with your Red{nbsp}Hat login or email.

To switch accounts, logout from link:https://sso.redhat.com[https://sso.redhat.com] and run the `rosa logout` command in your terminal before attempting to login again.

[id="rosa-login-sso-device_{context}"]
=== login with a single sign-on device code
If you are working with containers, remote hosts, and other environments without a web browser, you can use a Red{nbsp}Hat single sign-on (SSO) device code for secure authentication. To do this, you must use a second device that has a web browser to approve the login.
[NOTE]
====
Single sign-on authorization is supported with ROSA CLI (`rosa`) version 1.2.36 or later.
====
. To log in to ROSA CLI (`rosa`) with a Red Hat single sign-on device code, run the following command:

+
.Syntax
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login --use-device-code
----
+
Running this command will redirect you to the Red Hat SSO login and provide a log in code.

[id="rosa-login-token_{context}"]
=== login with an offline token

Log in to your Red{nbsp}Hat account, saving the credentials to the `rosa` configuration file.

To use offline tokens for automation purposes, you can download the OpenShift Cluster Manager API token from the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa[OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token] page.

To use service accounts for automation purposes, see the link:https://console.redhat.com/iam/service-accounts[Service Accounts] page.

[NOTE]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat recommends using service accounts for automation purposes.
====

// The ROSA CLI (`rosa`) looks for a token in the following priority order:

// . Command-line arguments
// . The `ROSA_TOKEN` environment variable
// . The `rosa` configuration file
// . Interactively from a command-line prompt

. To log in to ROSA CLI (`rosa`) with a Red{nbsp}Hat offline token, run the following command:
