= Configuring a new client in Keycloak

Dex is installed by default for all the Argo CD instances created by the Operator. However, you can delete the Dex configuration and add Keycloak instead to log in to Argo CD using your OpenShift credentials. Keycloak acts as an identity broker between Argo CD and OpenShift.

.Procedure

To configure Keycloak, follow these steps:

. Delete the Dex configuration by removing the following section from the Argo CD Custom Resource (CR), and save the CR: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
dex:
    openShiftOAuth: true
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 
        memory: 
      requests:
        cpu: 
        memory: 
----

. Configure Keycloak by editing the Argo CD CR, and updating the value for the `provider` parameter as `keycloak`. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: basic
spec:
  sso:
    provider: keycloak
  server:
    route:
     enabled: true
----

[NOTE]
====
The Keycloak instance takes 2-3 minutes to install and run.
