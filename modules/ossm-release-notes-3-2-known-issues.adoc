= {SMProductName} 3.2 known issues

[id="ambient-mode-not-supported-on-fips-enabled-openshift-clusters_{context}"]
== Ambient mode not supported on FIPS-enabled OpenShift clusters

{istio} ambient mode does not currently support {ocp-short-name} clusters running in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) mode. Deployments that require FIPS compliance must continue using sidecar mode until support becomes available in a future release.

[id="limitation-due-to-ztunnel-concurrency-issue_{context}"]
== Limitation due to `ztunnel` concurrency issue

A concurrency issue in `ztunnel` limits throughput scalability in {istio} ambient mode. Performance remains comparable to sidecar mode in most scenarios, but the issue can limit the potential to scale throughput performance.

[id="istio-idecars-cannot-reach-istiod-on-s390x-and-powerpc-when-using-trpoxy-mode_{context}"]
== Istio sidecars cannot reach `Istiod` on `s390x` and `PowerPC` when using `TPROXY` mode

Configuring {istio} in sidecar mode with Transparent Proxy (TPROXY) on `s390x` and `PowerPC` hardware platforms causes the `istio-proxy` container to fail certificate signing and remain unready. As a consequence, the sidecar cannot reach the `Istiod` service and the connection times out. As a result, affected workloads cannot run successfully under these conditions.

[id="waypoint-proxy-emits-incomplete-telemetry-on-s390x-platforms_{context}"]
== Waypoint proxy emits incomplete telemetry on `s390x` platforms

Running {istio} in ambient mode on the `s390x` hardware platform causes the waypoint proxy to emit incomplete telemetry after the namespace is enrolled. As a consequence, tools such as Kiali cannot generate accurate graphs or diagrams, resulting in missing edges, unknown fields, or no visualization data. As a result, telemetry-dependent observability features remain incomplete on affected clusters.
