= Required firewall settings

An IP address range for the cluster network must be enabled during firewall configuration. You can use the default values or customize the IP address range. If you choose to customize the cluster network IP address range from the default `10.42.0.0/16` setting, you must also use the same custom range in the firewall configuration.
