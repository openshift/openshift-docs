= Using {coo-full} incident detection

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console.
* You have installed the {coo-full}.
* You have installed the {coo-full} monitoring UI plugin with incident detection enabled.

[NOTE]
====
If you have installed the {coo-full} programmatically, make sure that the namespace (by default `openshift-cluster-observability-operator`) has the label `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true`. If not add it by running the comand:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label namespace openshift-cluster-observability-operator openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true 
----

.Procedure

. In the Administrator perspective of the web console, click on *Observe* -> *Alerting* and choose the **Incidents** tab.

. The Incidents Timeline UI shows the grouping of alerts into *incidents*. The color coding of the lines in the graph corresponds to the severity of the incident. By default, a seven day timeline is presented.

+
[NOTE]
====
It will take at least five minutes to process the correlations and to see the timeline, after you enable incident detection.

Status changes are recorded at five-minute intervals. You can see the last update time next to the timeline. 

The analysis and grouping into incidents is performed only for alerts that are firing after you have enabled this feature. Alerts that have been resolved before feature enablement are not included.
====

. Zoom in to a 1-day view by clicking on the drop-down to specify the duration.

+
[NOTE]
====
For performance reasons, the UI only loads the displayed data. The start time reflects the first data point rendered in the current timeline, not the absolute start time of the alert. For example, if you zoom to 1-day and an alert started two days ago, the start time will be shifted to twenty four hours before.
====

. By clicking on an incident, you can see the timeline of alerts that are part of that incident, in the Alerts Timeline UI.
