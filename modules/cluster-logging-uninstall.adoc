You can stop log aggregation by deleting the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR). After deleting the CR, there are other {logging} components that remain, which you can optionally remove.


Deleting the `ClusterLogging` CR does not remove the persistent volume claims (PVCs). To preserve or delete the remaining PVCs, persistent volumes (PVs), and associated data, you must take further action.

.Prerequisites

* The Red Hat OpenShift Logging and Elasticsearch Operators must be installed.

.Procedure

To remove OpenShift Logging:

. Use the {product-title} web console to remove the `ClusterLogging` CR:

.. Switch to the *Administration* -> *Custom Resource Definitions* page.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click *ClusterLogging*.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definition Details* page, click *Instances*.

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the instance and select *Delete ClusterLogging*.

. Optional: Delete the custom resource definitions (CRD):

.. Switch to the *Administration* -> *Custom Resource Definitions* page.

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to *ClusterLogForwarder* and select *Delete Custom Resource Definition*.

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to *ClusterLogging* and select *Delete Custom Resource Definition*.

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to *Elasticsearch* and select *Delete Custom Resource Definition*.

. Optional: Remove the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator and OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator:

.. Switch to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator and select *Uninstall Operator*.

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator and select *Uninstall Operator*.

. Optional: Remove the OpenShift Logging and Elasticsearch projects.

.. Switch to the *Home* -> *Projects* page.

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the *openshift-logging* project and select *Delete Project*.

.. Confirm the deletion by typing `openshift-logging` in the dialog box and click *Delete*.

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the *openshift-operators-redhat* project and select *Delete Project*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not delete the `openshift-operators-redhat` project if other global operators are installed in this namespace.
====

.. Confirm the deletion by typing `openshift-operators-redhat` in the dialog box and click *Delete*.

. To keep the PVCs for reuse with other pods, keep the labels or PVC names that you need to reclaim the PVCs.

. Optional: If you do not want to keep the PVCs, you can delete them.
+
[WARNING]
====
Releasing or deleting PVCs can delete PVs and cause data loss.
====

.. Switch to the *Storage* -> *Persistent Volume Claims* page.

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to each PVC and select *Delete Persistent Volume Claim*.

.. If you want to recover storage space, you can delete the PVs.
