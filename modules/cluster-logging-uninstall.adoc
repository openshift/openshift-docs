= Uninstalling the {logging}

You can stop log aggregation by deleting the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR). After deleting the CR, there are other {logging} components that remain, which you can optionally remove.

Deleting the `ClusterLogging` CR does not remove the persistent volume claims (PVCs). To preserve or delete the remaining PVCs, persistent volumes (PVs), and associated data, you must take further action.

.Prerequisites

* The {clo} and {es-op} are installed.

.Procedure

. Use the
ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
{product-title} web console

 to remove the `ClusterLogging` CR:

.. Switch to the *Administration* -> *Custom Resource Definitions* page.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click *ClusterLogging*.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definition Details* page, click *Instances*.

Releasing or deleting PVCs can delete PVs and cause data loss.
====

.. Switch to the *Storage* -> *Persistent Volume Claims* page.

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to each PVC and select *Delete Persistent Volume Claim*.
