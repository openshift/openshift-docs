= Configurable fields in build run

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the following required and optional fields in your `BuildRun` custom resource (CR):

Required fields in the `BuildRun` CR::
[options="header",cols="30%,15%,55%"]
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Field | Description

| `apiVersion`
| Specifies the API version of the resource. For example, `shipwright.io/v1beta1`.

| `kind`
| Specifies the type of the resource. For example, `BuildRun`.

| `metadata`
| Indicates the metadata that identifies the custom resource definition instance. For example, the name of the `BuildRun` resource.
|===

Optional fields in the `BuildRun` CR::
[options="header",cols="30%,15%,55%"]
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Field | Description

| `spec.build.name`
| Specifies an existing `Build` resource instance to use. You cannot use this field with the `spec.build.spec` field.

| `spec.build.spec`
| Specifies an embedded `Build` resource instance to use. You cannot use this field with the `spec.build.name` field.

| `spec.serviceAccount`
| Indicates the service account to use when building the image.

| `spec.timeout`
| Defines a custom timeout. This field value overwrites the value of the `spec.timeout` field defined in your `Build` resource.

| `spec.paramValues`
| Indicates a name-value list to specify values for parameters defined in the build strategy. The parameter value overwrites the value of the parameter that is defined with the same name in your `Build` resource.

| `spec.output.image`
| Indicates a custom location where the generated image will be pushed. This field value overwrites the value of the `output.image` field defined in your `Build` resource.

| `spec.output.pushSecret`
| Indicates an existing secret to get access to the container registry. This secret will be added to the service account along with other secrets requested by the `Build` resource.

| `spec.env`
| Defines additional environment variables that you can pass to the build container. This field value overrides any environment variables that are specified in the `Build` resource. The available variables depend on the tool used by your build strategy.

| `spec.nodeSelector`
| Specifies which nodes {builds-shortname} should run on.

| `spec.tolerations`
| Specifies the tolerations for the {builds-shortname} pod.

| `spec.schedulerName`
| Specifies the scheduler for the {builds-shortname} pod

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot use the `spec.build.name` and `spec.build.spec` fields together in the same CR because they are mutually exclusive.
