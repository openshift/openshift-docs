[role="_abstract"]
You can use the following fields in your `BuildRun` custom resource (CR):

.Fields in the `BuildRun` CR
[options="header",cols="30%,15%,55%"]
|===

| Field | Presence | Description

| `apiVersion` | Required | Specifies the API version of the resource. For example, `shipwright.io/v1beta1`.

| `kind` | Required | Specifies the type of the resource. For example, `BuildRun`.

| `metadata` | Required | Indicates the metadata that identifies the custom resource definition instance. For example, the name of the `BuildRun` resource.

| `spec.build.name` | Optional | Specifies an existing `Build` resource instance to use. You cannot use this field with the `spec.build.spec` field.

| `spec.build.spec` | Optional | Specifies an embedded `Build` resource instance to use. You cannot use this field with the `spec.build.name` field.

| `spec.serviceAccount` | Optional | Indicates the service account to use when building the image. 

| `spec.timeout` | Optional | Defines a custom timeout. This field value overwrites the value of the `spec.timeout` field defined in your `Build` resource. 

| `spec.paramValues` | Optional | Indicates a name-value list to specify values for parameters defined in the build strategy. The parameter value overwrites the value of the parameter that is defined with the same name in your `Build` resource.

| `spec.output.image` | Optional | Indicates a custom location where the generated image will be pushed. This field value overwrites the value of the `output.image` field defined in your `Build` resource. 

| `spec.output.pushSecret` | Optional | Indicates an existing secret to get access to the container registry. This secret will be added to the service account along with other secrets requested by the `Build` resource.

| `spec.env` | Optional | Defines additional environment variables that you can pass to the build container. This field value overrides any environment variables that are specified in the `Build` resource. The available variables depend on the tool that is used by your build strategy.

[NOTE] 
====
You cannot use the `spec.build.name` and `spec.build.spec` fields together in the same CR because they are mutually exclusive.
