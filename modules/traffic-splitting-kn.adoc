= Managing and splitting traffic by using the Knative CLI

`kn` provides commands that help you to control traffic mapping and how traffic is split between revisions.

You can use the `kn service update` command with the `--traffic` flag to update the traffic. This flag uses the following syntax:

[source,terminal]
----
--traffic RevisionName=Percent
----

where
* The `--traffic` flag requires two values separated by separated by an equals sign (`=`).
* The `RevisionName` string refers to the name of the revision.
* `Percent` integer denotes the traffic portion assigned to the revision.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `--traffic` flag can be specified multiple times in one command, and is valid only if the sum of the `Percent` values in all flags totals 100.
====

.Procedure

* Update the percentage of traffic to be routed to a revision:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service update --traffic <@revision_name>=<percent_integer>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use the identifier `@latest` for the revision name, to refer to the latest ready revision of the service. You can use this identifier only once per command with the `--traffic` flag.
