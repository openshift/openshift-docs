= Check your {prodname} installation and permissions

[role="_abstract"]
This guide expects that you have successfully installed {prodname} on at least one {ocp} cluster, and that you have the correct user permissions.
//TODO FIXME what are the steps here? why are we doing this? verification procedure is absent

//.Prerequisites

* You completed the {prodname} installation steps on one or more clusters, as described in {LinkRHCLInstall}[{NameRHCLInstall}].
* You have the `kubectl` or `oc` command installed.
* You have write access to the {ocp} namespaces used in this guide.
* You have an AWS account with Amazon Route 53 and a DNS zone for the examples in this guide.  {prodname} also supports Google Cloud DNS and Microsoft Azure DNS.
* Optional:
  - For rate limiting in a multicluster environment, you have installed {prodname} on more than one cluster and have a shared accessible Redis-based datastore. For more details, see {LinkRHCLInstall}[{NameRHCLInstall}].
  - For Observability, {ocp} user workload monitoring is configured to remote write to a central storage system such as Thanos, as described in {LinkRHCLObserve}[{NameRHCLObserve}].
