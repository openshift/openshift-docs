= Use custom builder image

You can define a `BuildConfig` object that uses the custom strategy in conjunction with your custom builder image to execute your custom build logic.

.Prerequisites

* Define all the required inputs for new custom builder image.
* Build your custom builder image.

.Procedure

. Create a file named `buildconfig.yaml`. This file defines the `BuildConfig` object that is created in your project and executed:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: BuildConfig
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: sample-custom-build
  labels:
    name: sample-custom-build
  annotations:
    template.alpha.openshift.io/wait-for-ready: 'true'
spec:
  strategy:
    type: Custom
    customStrategy:
      forcePull: true
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: custom-builder-image:latest
        namespace: <yourproject> <1>
  output:
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: sample-custom:latest
----
<1> Specify your project name.

. Create the `BuildConfig`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f buildconfig.yaml
----

. Create a file named `imagestream.yaml`. This file defines the image stream to which the build will push the image:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ImageStream
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: sample-custom
spec: {}
----

. Create the imagestream:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f imagestream.yaml
----

. Run your custom build:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc start-build sample-custom-build -F
----
+
When the build runs, it launches a pod running the custom builder image that was built earlier. The pod runs the `build.sh` logic that is defined as the entrypoint for the custom builder image. The `build.sh` logic invokes Buildah to build the `dockerfile.sample` that was embedded in the custom builder image, and then uses Buildah to push the new image to the `sample-custom image stream`.
