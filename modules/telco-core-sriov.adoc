= SR-IOV

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
SR-IOV enables physical network interfaces (PFs) to be divided into multiple virtual functions (VFs). VFs can then be assigned to multiple pods to achieve higher throughput performance while keeping the pods isolated. The SR-IOV Network Operator provisions and manages SR-IOV CNI, network device plugin, and other components of the SR-IOV stack.

Limits and requirements::
* Supported network interface controllers are listed in "Supported devices".
* The SR-IOV Network Operator automatically enables IOMMU on the kernel command line.
* SR-IOV VFs do not receive link state updates from PF. If link down detection is needed, it must be done at the protocol level.
* `MultiNetworkPolicy` CRs can be applied to `netdevice` networks only.
This is because the implementation uses the `iptables` tool, which cannot manage `vfio` interfaces.

Engineering considerations::
* SR-IOV interfaces in `vfio` mode are typically used to enable additional secondary networks for applications that require high throughput or low latency.

* If you exclude the `SriovOperatorConfig` CR from your deployment, the CR will not be created automatically.

* NICs that do not support firmware updates under secure boot or kernel lock-down must be pre-configured with enough VFs enabled to support the number of VFs needed by the application workload.

[NOTE]
====
The SR-IOV Network Operator plugin for these NICs might need to be disabled using the undocumented `disablePlugins` option.
