= SR-IOV

New in this release::

//CNF-5528
* `MultiNetworkPolicy` resources can now be applied to SR-IOV networks to enforce network reachability policies.

//CNF-9865
* QinQ is now supported in the SR-IOV Network Operator.
This is a Tech Preview feature.

//CNF-8804
* SR-IOV VFs can now receive all multicast traffic via the ‘allmulti’ flag when tuning the CNI.
This eliminates the need to add `NET_ADMIN` capability to the pod's security context constraints (SCCs) and enhances security by minimizing potential vulnerabilities for pods.

Description::

SR-IOV enables physical network interfaces (PFs) to be divided into multiple virtual functions (VFs). VFs can then be assigned to multiple pods to achieve higher throughput performance while keeping the pods isolated. The SR-IOV Network Operator provisions and manages SR-IOV CNI, network device plugin, and other components of the SR-IOV stack.

Limits and requirements::

* The network interface controllers supported are listed in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.html#supported-devices_about-sriov[Supported devices]
* SR-IOV and IOMMU enablement in BIOS: The SR-IOV Network Operator automatically enables IOMMU on the kernel command line.
* SR-IOV VFs do not receive link state updates from PF. If link down detection is needed, it must be done at the protocol level.
* `MultiNetworkPolicy` CRs can be applied to `netdevice` networks only.
This is because the implementation uses the `iptables` tool, which cannot manage `vfio` interfaces.

Engineering considerations::
* SR-IOV interfaces in `vfio` mode are typically used to enable additional secondary networks for applications that require high throughput or low latency.
