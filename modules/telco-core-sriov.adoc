= SR-IOV

New in this release::

* With this release, you can use the SR-IOV Network Operator to configure QinQ (802.1ad and 802.1q) tagging. QinQ tagging provides efficient traffic management by enabling the use of both inner and outer VLAN tags. Outer VLAN tagging is hardware accelerated, leading to faster network performance. The update extends beyond the SR-IOV Network Operator itself. You can now configure QinQ on externally managed VFs by setting the outer VLAN tag using `nmstate`. QinQ support varies across different NICs. For a comprehensive list of known limitations for specific NIC models, see the official documentation.

* With this release, you can configure the SR-IOV Network Operator to drain nodes in parallel during network policy updates, dramatically accelerating the setup process. This translates to significant time savings, especially for large cluster deployments that previously took hours or even days to complete.

Description::

SR-IOV enables physical network interfaces (PFs) to be divided into multiple virtual functions (VFs). VFs can then be assigned to multiple pods to achieve higher throughput performance while keeping the pods isolated. The SR-IOV Network Operator provisions and manages SR-IOV CNI, network device plugin, and other components of the SR-IOV stack.

Limits and requirements::

* The network interface controllers supported are listed in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.html#supported-devices_about-sriov[Supported devices]
* SR-IOV and IOMMU enablement in BIOS: The SR-IOV Network Operator automatically enables IOMMU on the kernel command line.
* SR-IOV VFs do not receive link state updates from PF. If link down detection is needed, it must be done at the protocol level.
* `MultiNetworkPolicy` CRs can be applied to `netdevice` networks only.
This is because the implementation uses the `iptables` tool, which cannot manage `vfio` interfaces.

Engineering considerations::
* SR-IOV interfaces in `vfio` mode are typically used to enable additional secondary networks for applications that require high throughput or low latency.

* If you exclude the `SriovOperatorConfig` CR from your deployment, the CR will not be created automatically.
