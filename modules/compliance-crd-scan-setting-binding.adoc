= ScanSettingBinding object

Use the `ScanSettingBinding` object to specify your compliance requirements with reference to the `Profile` or `TailoredProfile` object. It is then linked to a `ScanSetting` object, which provides the operational constraints for the scan. Then the Compliance Operator generates the `ComplianceSuite` object based on the `ScanSetting` and `ScanSettingBinding` objects.

.Example `ScanSettingBinding` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ScanSettingBinding
metadata:
  name: <name of the scan>
profiles: <1>
  # Node checks
  - name: rhcos4-with-usb
    kind: TailoredProfile
    apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  # Cluster checks
  - name: ocp4-moderate
    kind: Profile
    apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
settingsRef: <2>
  name: my-companys-constraints
  kind: ScanSetting
  apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
----

<1> Specify the details of `Profile` or `TailoredProfile` object to scan your environment.
<2> Specify the operational constraints, such as schedule and storage size.

The creation of `ScanSetting` and `ScanSettingBinding` objects results in the compliance suite. To get the list of compliance suite, run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get compliancesuites

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you delete `ScanSettingBinding`, then compliance suite also is deleted.
