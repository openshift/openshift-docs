= About liveness and readiness probes

When a VirtualMachineInstance (VMI) fails, _liveness probes_ stop the VMI.
Controllers such as VirtualMachine then spawn other VMIs, restoring virtual
machine responsiveness.

_Readiness probes_ tell services and endpoints that the VirtualMachineInstance
is ready to receive traffic from services. If readiness probes fail,
the VirtualMachineInstance is removed from
applicable endpoints until the probe recovers.
