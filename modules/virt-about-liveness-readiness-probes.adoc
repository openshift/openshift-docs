= About liveness and readiness probes

_Liveness probes_ determine if a virtual machine instance (VMI) is still responding. If the probe fails, the VMI is stopped. A replacement VMI is then created to restore virtual machine responsiveness.

_Readiness probes_ tell services and endpoints that the virtual machine instance
is ready to receive traffic from services. If readiness probes fail, the virtual machine instance is removed from applicable endpoints until the probe recovers.
