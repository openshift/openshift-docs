= Updating Mixer policy enforcement

In previous versions of {ProductName}, Mixerâ€™s policy enforcement was enabled by default. Mixer policy enforcement is now disabled by default. You must enable it before running policy tasks.

.Prerequisites
* Access to the {product-title} Command-line Interface (CLI) also known as `oc`.


.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI.

. Run this command to check the current Mixer policy enforcement status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cm -n istio-system istio -o jsonpath='{.data.mesh}' | grep disablePolicyChecks
----

. If `disablePolicyChecks: true`, edit the {ProductShortName} ConfigMap:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit cm -n istio-system istio
----

. Locate `disablePolicyChecks: true` within the ConfigMap and change the value to `false`.

. Save the configuration and exit the editor.

. Re-check the Mixer policy enforcement status to ensure it is set to `false`.
