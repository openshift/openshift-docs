= Storage considerations for the {logging-title}

////
An Elasticsearch index is a collection of primary shards and their corresponding replica shards. This is how Elasticsearch implements high availability internally, so there is little requirement to use hardware based mirroring RAID variants. RAID 0 can still be used to increase overall disk performance.
////

A persistent volume is required for each Elasticsearch deployment configuration. On {product-title} this is achieved using persistent volume claims.

[NOTE]
====
If you use a local volume for persistent storage, do not use a raw block volume, which is described with `volumeMode: block` in the `LocalVolume` object. Elasticsearch cannot use raw block volumes.
====

The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator names the PVCs using the Elasticsearch resource name.

Below are capacity planning guidelines for {product-title} aggregate logging.

*Example scenario*

Assumptions:

. Which application: Apache
. Bytes per line: 256
. Lines per second load on application: 1
. Raw text data -> JSON

Baseline (256 characters per minute -> 15KB/min)

Calculating the total logging throughput and disk space required for your {product-title} cluster requires knowledge of your applications. For example, if one of your applications on average logs 10 lines-per-second, each 256 bytes-per-line, calculate per-application throughput and disk space as follows:

----
 (bytes-per-line * (lines-per-second) = 2560 bytes per app per second
 (2560) * (number-of-pods-per-node,100) = 256,000 bytes per second per node
 256k * (number-of-nodes) = total logging throughput per cluster
----
////

Fluentd ships any logs from *systemd journal* and */var/log/containers/* to Elasticsearch.

Elasticsearch requires sufficient memory to perform large merge operations. If it does not have enough memory, it becomes unresponsive. To avoid this problem, evaluate how much application log data you need, and allocate approximately double that amount of free storage capacity.

By default, when storage capacity is 85% full, Elasticsearch stops allocating new data to the node. At 90%, Elasticsearch attempts to relocate existing shards from that node to other nodes if possible. But if no nodes have a free capacity below 85%, Elasticsearch effectively rejects creating new indices and becomes RED.

[NOTE]
====
These low and high watermark values are Elasticsearch defaults in the current release. You can modify these default values. Although the alerts use the same default values, you cannot change these values in the alerts.
