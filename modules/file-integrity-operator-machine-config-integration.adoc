= Machine config integration

In {product-title} 4, the cluster node configuration is delivered through
`MachineConfig` objects. You can assume that the changes to files that are
caused by a `MachineConfig` object are expected and should not cause the file
integrity scan to fail. To suppress changes to files caused by `MachineConfig`
object updates, the File Integrity Operator watches the node objects; when a
node is being updated, the AIDE scans are suspended for the duration of the
update. When the update finishes, the database is reinitialized and the scans
resume.

This pause and resume logic only applies to updates through the `MachineConfig`
API, as they are reflected in the node object annotations.
