= Smart enrichment and SDN integration

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability Operator is infrastructure-aware, particularly when using the OVN-Kubernetes network provider. The Network Observability Operator utilizes smart enrichment to correlate raw network flows with cluster resources.

The flow table tracks and displays IP addresses assigned to resources such as nodes, deployments, virtual machines, and availability zones. This enrichment allows you to manage IP address management (IPAM) directly within the Software-Defined Network (SDN) rather than relying on external DHCP solutions or manual tracking spreadsheets.

For enterprises utilizing {VirtProductName}, this integration ensures that virtual machine (VM) traffic is treated as a native cluster resource, providing full visibility into IP assignments and traffic patterns within the SDN.
