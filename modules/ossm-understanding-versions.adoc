= Understanding Service Mesh versions

In order to understand what version of {ProductName} you have deployed on your system, you need to understand how each of the component versions is managed.

The {ProductName} 2.x Operator supports both v1x and v2x service meshes.

* *Operator* version - The current Operator version is {ProductVersion}. This version number only indicates the version of the currently installed Operator. This version number is controlled by the intersection of the *Update Channel* and *Approval Strategy* specified in your Operator subscription. The version of the Operator does not determine which version of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource is deployed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading to the latest Operator version does not automatically upgrade your control plane to the latest version.
====

* *ServiceMeshControlPlane* version - The same Operator supports multiple versions of the service mesh control plane. The service mesh control plane version controls the architecture and configuration settings that are used to install and deploy {ProductName}. To set or change the service mesh control plane version, you must deploy a new control plane. When you create the service mesh control plane you can select the version in one of two ways:

** To configure in the Form View, select the version from the *Control Plane Version* menu.

** To configure in the YAML View, set the value for `spec.version` in the YAML file.

* *Control Plane* version - The version parameter specified within the SMCP resource file as `spec.version`. Supported versions are v1.1, v2.0, and v2.1.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) does not manage control plane upgrades, so the version number for your Operator and `ServiceMeshControlPlane` (SMCP) may not match, unless you have manually upgraded your SMCP.
