= Specifying Jaeger configuration in a Jaeger custom resource

You can fully customize your Jaeger deployment by configuring Jaeger in the Jaeger custom resource (CR) rather than in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` (SMCP) resource. This configuration is sometimes referred to as an "external Jaeger" since the configuration is specified outside of the SMCP.

[NOTE]
====
You must deploy the SMCP and Jaeger CR in the same namespace. For example, `istio-system`.
====

You can configure and deploy a standalone Jaeger instance and then specify the `name` of the Jaeger resource as the value for `spec.addons.jaeger.name` in the SMCP resource. If a Jaeger CR matching the value of `name` exists, the {SMProductShortName} control plane will use the existing installation. This approach lets you fully customize your Jaeger configuration.
