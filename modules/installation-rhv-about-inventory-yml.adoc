= The inventory.yml file

You use the `inventory.yml` file to define and create elements of the {product-title} cluster you are installing. This includes elements such as the {op-system-first} image, virtual machine templates, bootstrap machine, control plane nodes, and worker nodes. You also use `inventory.yml` to destroy the cluster.

The following `inventory.yml` example shows you the parameters and their default values. The quantities and numbers in these default values meet the requirements for running a production {product-title} cluster in a {rh-virtualization} environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Enter values for parameters whose descriptions begin with "Enter." Otherwise, you can use the default value or replace it with a new value.
====

.General section

* `ovirt_cluster`: Enter the name of an existing {rh-virtualization} cluster in which to install the OCP cluster.
* `ocp.assets_dir`: The path of a directory the `openshift-install` installation program creates to store the files that it generates.
* `ocp.ovirt_config_path`: The path of the `ovirt-config.yaml` file the installation program generates, for example, `./wrk/install-config.yaml`. This file contains the credentials required to interact with the REST API of the oVirt Engine/{rh-virtualization} Manager.

.{op-system-first} section

* `image_url`: Enter the URL of the {op-system} image you specified for download.
* `local_cmp_image_path`: The path of a local download directory for the compressed {op-system} image.
* `local_image_path`: The path of a local directory for the extracted {op-system} image.


.Profiles section

This section consists of two profiles:

* `control_plane`: The profile of the bootstrap and control plane nodes.
* `compute`: The profile of workers nodes in the compute plane.

These profiles have the following parameters. The default values of the parameters meet the minimum requirements for running a production cluster. You can increase or customize these values to meet your workload requirements.

* `cluster`: The value gets the cluster name from `ovirt_cluster` in the General Section.
* `memory`: The amount of memory, in GB, for the virtual machine.
* `sockets`: The number of sockets for the virtual machine.
* `cores`: The number of cores for the virtual machine.
* `template`: The name of the virtual machine template. If plan to install multiple clusters, and these clusters use templates that contain different specifications, prepend the template name with the ID of the cluster.
* `operating_system`: The type of guest operating system in the virtual machine. With oVirt/{rh-virtualization} version 4.4, this value must be `rhcos_x64` so the value of `Ignition script` can be passed to the VM.
* `type`: Enter `server` as the type of the virtual machine.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must change the value of the `type` parameter from `high_performance` to `server`.
====
* `disks`: The disk specifications. The `control_plane` and `compute` nodes can have different storage domains.
* `size`: The minimum disk size.
* `name`: Enter the name of a disk connected to the target cluster in {rh-virtualization}.
* `interface`: Enter the interface type of the disk you specified.
* `storage_domain`: Enter the storage domain of the disk you specified.
* `nics`: Enter the `name` and `network` the virtual machines use. You can also specify the virtual network interface profile. By default, NICs obtain their MAC addresses from the oVirt/{rh-virtualization} MAC pool.

.Virtual machines section

This final section, `vms`, defines the virtual machines you plan to create and deploy in the cluster. By default, it provides the minimum number of control plane and worker nodes for a production environment.

`vms`  contains three required elements:

* `name`: The name of the virtual machine. In this case, `metadata.infraID` prepends the virtual machine name with the infrastructure ID from the `metadata.yml` file.
* `ocp_type`: The role of the virtual machine in the OCP cluster. Possible values are `bootstrap`, `master`, `worker`.
* `profile`: The name of the profile from which each virtual machine inherits specifications. Possible values in this example are `control_plane` or `compute`.
+
You can override the value a virtual machine inherits from its profile. To do this, you add the name of the profile attribute to the virtual machine in `inventory.yml` and assign it an overriding value. To see an example of this, examine the `name: "{{ metadata.infraID }}-bootstrap"` virtual machine in the preceding `inventory.yml` example: It has a `type` attribute whose value, `server`, overrides the value of the `type` attribute this virtual machine would otherwise inherit from the `control_plane` profile.

// TBD https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPRHV-414
// Consider documenting *additional* optional attributes in https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-ansible-vm-infra that aren't already covered here. Hypothetically, it seems like a user could add these attributes to a profile and then want to override them in the inventory.yml.

// TBD - Consider adding a topic on how related to: Configure DHCP to assign permanent IP addresses to the virtual machines, consider using the `mac_address` attribute to assign a fixed MAC address to each virtual machine. However, avoid using the same MAC address if you are deploying more than one cluster. We should consider creating a new topic to document this/these scenario(s).

.Metadata variables

For virtual machines, `metadata.infraID` prepends the name of the virtual machine with the infrastructure ID from the `metadata.json` file you create when you build the ignition files.

The playbooks use the following code to read `infraID` from the specific file located in the `ocp.assets_dir`.
