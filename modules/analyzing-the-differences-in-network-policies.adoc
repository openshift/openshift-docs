= Analyzing the differences in network policies

You can use the static network policy connectivity difference command to analyze two sets of Kubernetes manifests, including network policies. Specify two folders that contain deployment YAMLs and network policies.

The command then analyzes the allowed cluster connectivity for each input folder and generates a list of differences in the allowed connections. This is done based on the defined workloads and network policies.
This helps you create a file that visualizes the connectivity differences between two versions of workloads and network policy manifests.
