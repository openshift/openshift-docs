<1> Using `WaitForFirstConsumer` is strongly recommended. This provisions the volume while allowing enough storage to schedule the pod on a free worker node from an available zone.
<2> Possible values are `Shared` (default), `Managed`, and `Dedicated`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat only supports the use of `kind: Managed` in the storage class.

With `Shared` and `Dedicated`, Azure creates unmanaged disks, while {product-title} creates a managed disk for machine OS (root) disks. But because Azure Disk does not allow the use of both managed and unmanaged disks on a node, unmanaged disks created with `Shared` or `Dedicated` cannot be attached to {product-title} nodes.
====

<3> Azure storage account SKU tier. Default is empty. Note that Premium VMs can attach both `Standard_LRS` and `Premium_LRS` disks, Standard VMs can only attach `Standard_LRS` disks, Managed VMs can only attach managed disks, and unmanaged VMs can only attach unmanaged disks.
+
.. If `kind` is set to `Shared`, Azure creates all unmanaged disks in a few shared storage accounts in the same resource group as the cluster.
.. If `kind` is set to `Managed`, Azure creates new managed disks.
.. If `kind` is set to `Dedicated` and a `storageAccount` is specified, Azure uses the specified storage account for the new unmanaged disk in the same resource group as the cluster. For this to work:
 * The specified storage account must be in the same region.
 * Azure Cloud Provider must have write access to the storage account.
.. If `kind` is set to `Dedicated` and a `storageAccount` is not specified, Azure creates a new dedicated storage account for the new unmanaged disk in the same resource group as the cluster.
