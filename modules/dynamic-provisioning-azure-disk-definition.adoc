kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-disk
parameters:
  storageAccount: azure_storage_account_name  <1>
  storageaccounttype: Standard_LRS  <2>
  kind: Dedicated  <3>
----
<1> Azure storage account name. This must reside in the same resource
group as the cluster. If a storage account is specified, the `location`
is ignored. If a storage account is not specified, a new storage
account gets created in the same resource group as the cluster. If you
are specifying a `storageAccount`, the value for `kind` must be `Dedicated`.
<2> Azure storage account SKU tier. Default is empty. Note that Premium
VMs can attach both `Standard_LRS` and `Premium_LRS` disks, Standard VMs
can only attach `Standard_LRS` disks, Managed VMs can only attach
managed disks, and unmanaged VMs can only attach unmanaged disks.
<3> Possible values are `Shared` (default), `Dedicated`, and `Managed`.
+
.. If `kind` is set to `Shared`, Azure creates all unmanaged disks in a
few shared storage accounts in the same resource group as the cluster.
.. If `kind` is set to `Managed`, Azure creates new managed disks.
.. If `kind` is set to `Dedicated` and a `storageAccount` is specified,
Azure uses the specified storage account for the new unmanaged disk in
the same resource group as the cluster. For this to work:
 * The specified storage account must be in the same region.
 * Azure Cloud Provider must have a write access to the storage account.
.. If `kind` is set to `Dedicated` and a `storageAccount` is not
specified, Azure creates a new dedicated storage account for the new
unmanaged disk in the same resource group as the cluster.
