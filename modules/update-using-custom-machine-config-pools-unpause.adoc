[id="update-using-custom-machine-config-pools-unpause_{context}"]
= Unpausing the machine config pools

In this canary rollout update process, after the {product-title} update is complete, unpause your custom MCPs one-by-one. Unpausing an MCP allows the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to update the nodes associated with that MCP.

To unpause an MCP:

. Patch the MCP that you want to unpause:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch mcp/<mcp_name> --patch '{"spec":{"paused":false}}' --type=merge
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc patch mcp/workerpool-canary --patch '{"spec":{"paused":false}}' --type=merge
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
machineconfigpool.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/workerpool-canary patched
----
+
You can check the progress of the update by using the `oc get machineconfigpools` command.

. Test your applications on the updated nodes to ensure that they are working as expected.

. Unpause any other paused MCPs one-by-one and verify that your applications work.

[id="update-using-custom-machine-config-pools-fail_{context}"]
== In case of application failure

In case of a failure, such as your applications not working on the updated nodes, you can cordon and drain the nodes in the pool, which moves the application pods to other nodes to help maintain the quality-of-service for the applications. This first MCP should be no larger than the excess capacity.
