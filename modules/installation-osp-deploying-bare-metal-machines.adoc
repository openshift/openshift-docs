= Deploying a cluster with bare metal machines

If you want your cluster to use bare metal machines, modify the
ifdef::osp-ipi[`install-config.yaml`]
ifndef::osp-ipi[`inventory.yaml`]
file. Your cluster can have both control plane and compute machines running on bare metal, or just compute machines.

Bare-metal compute machines are not supported on clusters that use Kuryr.

[NOTE]
====
Be sure that your `install-config.yaml` file reflects whether the {rh-openstack} network that you use for bare metal workers supports floating IP addresses or not.

====

.Prerequisites

* The {rh-openstack} link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.1/html/bare_metal_provisioning/index[Bare Metal service (Ironic)] is enabled and accessible via the {rh-openstack} Compute API.

* Bare metal is available as link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.1/html/bare_metal_provisioning/configuring-the-bare-metal-provisioning-service-after-deployment#creating-the-bare-metal-flavor_bare-metal-post-deployment[a {rh-openstack} flavor].

* The {rh-openstack} network supports both VM and bare metal server attachment.

* Your network configuration does not rely on a provider network. Provider networks are not supported.

* If you want to deploy the machines on a pre-existing network, a {rh-openstack} subnet is provisioned.

* If you want to deploy the machines on an installer-provisioned network, the {rh-openstack} Bare Metal service (Ironic) is able to listen for and interact with Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) boot machines that run on tenant networks.

ifdef::osp-ipi[]
* You created an `install-config.yaml` file as part of the {product-title} installation process.

ifndef::osp-ipi[]
* You created an `inventory.yaml` file as part of the {product-title} installation process.

.Procedure

ifdef::osp-ipi[]
. In the `install-config.yaml` file, edit the flavors for machines:
.. If you want to use bare-metal control plane machines, change the value of `controlPlane.platform.openstack.type` to a bare metal flavor.
.. Change the value of `compute.platform.openstack.type` to a bare metal flavor.
.. If you want to deploy your machines on a pre-existing network, change the value of `platform.openstack.machinesSubnet` to the {rh-openstack} subnet UUID of the network. Control plane and compute machines must use the same subnet.

added to the file.

.. If you want to use bare-metal control plane machines, change the value of `os_flavor_master` to a bare metal flavor.
.. Change the value of `os_flavor_worker` to a bare metal flavor.

[NOTE]
====
The installer may time out while waiting for bare metal machines to boot.

If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the `wait-for` command of the installer. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
