= Secured cluster services installation overview

[role="_abstract"]
To monitor your clusters, you must install secured cluster services on every cluster in your environment. You can install these services by using the {rh-rhacs-first} Operator to create the `SecuredCluster` custom resource (CR).

Installation requirements and dependencies::

Before installing the `SecuredCluster` CR, you must understand the following dependencies and placement rules:

Central dependency::: You must install the `Central` CR before installing the `SecuredCluster` CR. The installation of secured cluster services requires certificates that are generated by Central.

Namespace requirements:::
Colocation:::: If you are installing the `SecuredCluster` CR on a cluster that also hosts Central, you must install it in the same namespace as Central.
Separation:::: If the cluster does not host Central, you must install the `SecuredCluster` CR in its own project, separate from the project where the {product-title-short} Operator is installed.
Restricted namespaces:::: Do not install the `SecuredCluster` CR in the `istio-system` project or in projects named with the prefixes `kube`, `openshift`, or `redhat`.

Operator annotations and runtime defaults::

The {product-title-short} Operator uses annotations attached to the CR to manage configuration defaults. These annotations, which appear in the form `feature-defaults.platform.stackrox.io/<identifier>`, serve the following purposes:

Runtime decisions::: Allows the Operator to determine default values for configuration items at runtime based on the environment.
Persistence::: Allows previous configuration decisions to persist during updates. For example, if a default behavior changes in a new version, such as Scanner V4 enablement, the annotation ensures your existing configuration remains stable.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not change or delete these annotations. However, if you explicitly configure a value in the CR, such as setting a field to `disable`, that explicit configuration takes precedence over the default behavior managed by the annotations.
