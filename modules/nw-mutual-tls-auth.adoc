= Configuring mutual TLS authentication

You can configure the Ingress Controller to enable mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication by setting a `spec.clientTLS` value. The `clientTLS` value configures the Ingress Controller to verify client certificates. This configuration includes setting a `clientCA` value, which is a reference to a config map. The config map contains the PEM-encoded CA certificate bundle that is used to verify a client's certificate. Optionally, you can also configure a list of certificate subject filters.

If the `clientCA` value specifies an X509v3 certificate revocation list (CRL) distribution point, the Ingress Operator downloads and manages a CRL config map based on the HTTP URI X509v3 `CRL Distribution Point` specified in each provided certificate. The Ingress Controller uses this config map during mTLS/TLS negotiation. Requests that do not provide valid certificates are rejected.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have a PEM-encoded CA certificate bundle.
* If your CA bundle references a CRL distribution point, you must have also included the end-entity or leaf certificate to the client CA bundle. This certificate must have included an HTTP URI under `CRL Distribution Points`, as described in RFC 5280. For example:

         Subject: SOME SIGNED CERT            X509v3 CRL Distribution Points:

.Procedure
. In the `openshift-config` namespace, create a config map from your CA bundle:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap \
   router-ca-certs-default \
   --from-file=ca-bundle.pem=client-ca.crt \// <1>
   -n openshift-config
----
<1> The config map data key must be `ca-bundle.pem`, and the data value must be a CA certificate in PEM format.

. Edit the `IngressController` resource in the `openshift-ingress-operator` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit IngressController default -n openshift-ingress-operator
----

. Add the `spec.clientTLS` field and subfields to configure mutual TLS:
