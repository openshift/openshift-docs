[id="network-observability-operator-release-notes-1-7-0-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
= Network Observability Operator 1.7.0 new features and enhancements

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the following new features and enhancements for the Network Observability Operator 1.7.0 release.

[id="network-observability-operator-otel-1-7_{context}"]
== OpenTelemetry support
You can now export enriched network flows to a compatible OpenTelemetry endpoint, such as the Red{nbsp}Hat build of OpenTelemetry.

For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/configuring-operator.adoc#network-observability-enriched-flows_network_observability[Export enriched network flow data]

[id="network-observability-operator-developer-perspective-1-7_{context}"]
== Network observability Developer perspective
You can now use network observability in the *Developer* perspective.

For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/network-observability-overview.adoc#network-observability-openshift-console-integration_network-observability-overview[{product-title} console integration]

[id="tcp-flags-filters-1-7_{context}"]
== TCP flags filtering
You can now use the `tcpFlags` filter to limit the volume of packets processed by the eBPF program.

For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/observing-network-traffic.adoc#network-observability-flowcollector-flowfilter-parameters_nw-observe-network-traffic[Flow filter configuration parameters]
* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/observing-network-traffic.adoc#network-observability-ebpf-flow-rule-filter_nw-observe-network-traffic[eBPF flow rule filter]
* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/metrics-alerts-dashboards.adoc#network-observability-tcp-flag-syn-flood_metrics-dashboards-alerts[Detecting SYN flooding using the FlowMetric API and TCP flags]

[id="network-observability-virtualization_{context}"]
== Network observability for OpenShift Virtualization
You can observe networking patterns on an {VirtProductName} setup by identifying eBPF-enriched network flows coming from VMs that are connected to secondary networks, such as through Open Virtual Network (OVN)-Kubernetes.

For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/network-observability-secondary-networks.adoc#network-observability-virtualization-config_network-observability-secondary-networks[Configuring virtual machine (VM) secondary network interfaces for network observability]

[id="network-observability-network-policy-1-7_{context}"]
== Network policy deploys in the FlowCollector custom resource (CR)
With this release, you can configure the `FlowCollector` custom resource (CR) to deploy a network policy for network observability. Previously, if you wanted a network policy, you had to manually create one. The option to manually create a network policy is still available.

For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/network-observability-network-policy.adoc#network-observability-deploy-network-policy_network_observability[Configuring an ingress network policy by using the FlowCollector custom resource]

[id="network-observability-fips-compliance-1-7_{context}"]
== FIPS compliance
* You can install and use the Network Observability Operator in an {product-title} cluster running in FIPS mode.

[id="network-observability-dns-enhancements-1-7_{context}"]
== eBPF agent enhancements
The following enhancements are available for the eBPF agent:

* If the DNS service maps to a different port than `53`, you can specify this DNS tracking port using `spec.agent.ebpf.advanced.env.DNS_TRACKING_PORT`.
* You can now use two ports for transport protocols (TCP, UDP, or SCTP) filtering rules.
* You can now filter on transport ports with a wildcard protocol by leaving the protocol field empty.

For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/flowcollector-api.adoc#spec-agent-ebpf-advanced[FlowCollector API specifications]

[id="network-observability-cli-1-7_{context}"]
== Network Observability CLI
The Network Observability CLI (`oc netobserv`), is now generally available. The following enhancements have been made since the 1.6 Technology Preview release:

* There are now eBPF enrichment filters for packet capture similar to flow capture.
* You can now use filter `tcp_flags` with both flow and packets capture.
* The auto-teardown option is available when max-bytes or max-time is reached.

For more information, see:
