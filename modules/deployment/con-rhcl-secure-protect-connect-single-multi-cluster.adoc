= Secure, protect, and connect APIs on OpenShift with {prodname} 
:prodname: Connectivity Link

This guide walks you through using {prodname} on OpenShift to secure, protect, and connect an API exposed by a Gateway that is based on Kubernetes Gateway API. You can use this walkthrough for a Gateway deployed on a single OpenShift cluster or a Gateway distributed across multiple OpenShift clusters with a shared HTTPS listener hostname. This guide shows how the platform engineer and application developer user roles can each use {prodname} to achieve their goals.

== What {prodname} can do in multicluster environments

You can leverage {prodname}'s capabilities in single or multiple OpenShift clusters. The following features are designed to work across multiple clusters as well as in a single-cluster environment:

* *Multicluster ingress:* {prodname} provides multicluster ingress connectivity using DNS to bring traffic to your Gateways by using a strategy defined in a `DNSPolicy`.
* *Global rate limiting:* {prodname} can enable global rate limiting use cases when configured to use a shared Redis or Dragonfly store for counters based on limits defined by a `RateLimitPolicy`.
* *Global auth:* You can configure a {prodname} `AuthPolicy` to leverage external auth providers to ensure that different clusters exposing the same API authenticate and authorize in the same way.
* *Automatic TLS certificate generation:* You can configure a `TLSPolicy` to automatically provision TLS certificates based on Gateway listener hosts by using integration with cert-manager and ACME providers such as Let's Encrypt.  
* *Integration with federated metrics stores:* {prodname} has example dashboards and metrics for visualizing your Gateways and observing traffic hitting those Gateways across multiple clusters.

== User role workflows

* *Platform engineer*: This guide walks through deploying a Gateway that provides secure communication and is protected and ready for use by application development teams to deploy an API. It then walks through using this Gateway in clusters in different geographic regions, leveraging {prodname} to bring specific traffic to your geo-located Gateways. This approach reduces latency and distributes load, while still protecting and securing with global rate limiting and auth.
* *Application developer*: This guide walks through deploying your application API and shows how to override your Gateway-level global auth and rate limiting policies to configure your application-level auth and rate limiting requirements.

NOTE: For details on how both user roles can observe and monitor Gateways when the OpenShift observability stack and user workload monitoring are deployed, see {LinkRHCLObserve}[{NameRHCLObserve}].

== Deployment management tooling

While this guide uses `kubectl` commands for simplicity, working with multiple clusters is complex. It is best to use a tool such as Argo CD to manage the deployment of resources to multiple clusters.
