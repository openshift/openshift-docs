= About SBOMs

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a digital record that lists the components of a piece of software and their origins. Organizations can use SBOMs to locate the presence of vulnerable software packages and components and respond more quickly to mitigate the risk. Additionally, being able to generate SBOMs assists organizations in complying with link:https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-14028-improving-nations-cybersecurity[Executive Order 14028: Improving the Nations Cybersecurity].

SBOMs can contain different types of information, depending on the methods of data collection and how they are generated. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides a document, link:https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/types-software-bill-materials-sbom[Types of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)], that summarizes the types of SBOMs.

The type of SBOM that {product-title-short} generates is "Analyzed." CISA notes that these types of SBOMs are created through an analysis of artifacts such as executables, packages, containers, and virtual machine images. Analyzed SBOMs provide the following benefits, as summarized by CISA:

* They can provide information about software without an active development environment.
* They can be generated without access to the build process.
* You can use them to discover hidden dependencies that might be missed by other tools.

The SBOM generated by {product-title-short} is in link:https://spdx.org/rdf/terms/[System Package Data Exchange (SPDX) 2.3] format.
