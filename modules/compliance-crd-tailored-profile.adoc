= TailoredProfile object

Use the `TailoredProfile` object to modify the default `Profile` object based on your organization requirements. You can enable or disable rules, set variable values, and provide justification for the customization. After validation, the `TailoredProfile` object creates a `ConfigMap`, which can be referenced by a `ComplianceScan` object.

[TIP]
====
You can use the `TailoredProfile` object by referencing it in a `ScanSettingBinding` object. For more information about `ScanSettingBinding`, see ScanSettingBinding object.

.Example `TailoredProfile` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: TailoredProfile
metadata:
  name: rhcos4-with-usb
spec:
  extends: rhcos4-moderate <1>
  title: <title of the tailored profile>
  disableRules:
    - name: <name of a rule object to be disabled>
      rationale: <description of why this rule is checked>
status:
  id: xccdf_compliance.openshift.io_profile_rhcos4-with-usb <2>
  outputRef:
    name: rhcos4-with-usb-tp <3>
    namespace: openshift-compliance
  state: READY <4>
----

<1> This is optional. Name of the `Profile` object upon which the `TailoredProfile` is built. If no value is set, a new profile is created from the `enableRules` list.
<2> Specifies the XCCDF name of the tailored profile.
<3> Specifies the `ConfigMap` name, which can be used as the value of the `tailoringConfigMap.name` attribute of a `ComplianceScan`.
<4> Shows the state of the object such as `READY`, `PENDING`, and `FAILURE`. If the state of the object is `ERROR`, then the attribute `status.errorMessage` provides the reason for the failure.

With the `TailoredProfile` object, it is possible to create a new `Profile` object using the `TailoredProfile` construct. To create a new `Profile`, set the following configuration parameters :

* an appropriate title
* `extends` value must be empty
* scan type annotation on the `TailoredProfile` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
compliance.openshift.io/product-type: Platform/Node
----

[NOTE]
====
If you have not set the `product-type` annotation, the Compliance Operator defaults to `Platform` scan type. Adding the `-node` suffix to the name of the `TailoredProfile` object results in `node` scan type.
