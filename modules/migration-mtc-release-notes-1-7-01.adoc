== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

.Incorrect DNS validation for destination namespace
MigPlan cannot be validated because the destination namespace starts with a non-alphabetic character. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102231[*BZ#2102231*])

.Cloud propagation phase in migration controller is not functioning due to missing labels on Velero pods
The Cloud propagation phase in the migration controller is not functioning due to missing labels on Velero pods. The `EnsureCloudSecretPropagated` phase in the migration controller waits until replication repository secrets are propagated on both sides. As this label is missing on Velero pods, the phase is not functioning as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2088026[*BZ#2088026*])

.Default CPU requests on Velero/Restic are too demanding when making scheduling fail in certain environments
Default CPU requests on Velero/Restic are too demanding when making scheduling fail in certain environments. Default CPU requests for Velero and Restic Pods are set to 500m. These values are high. The resources can be configured in DPA using the `podConfig` field for Velero and Restic. Migration operator should set CPU requests to a lower value, such as 100m, so that Velero and Restic pods can be scheduled in resource constrained environments MTC often operates in. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2088022[*BZ#2088022*])

.Warning is displayed on persistentVolumes page after editing storage class conversion plan
A warning is displayed on the *persistentVolumes* page after editing the storage class conversion plan. When editing the existing migration plan, a warning is displayed on the UI `At least one PVC must be selected for Storage Class Conversion`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2079549[*BZ#2079549*])

.Velero pod log missing from downloaded logs
When downloading a compressed (.zip) folder for all logs, the velero pod is missing. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076599[*BZ#2076599*])

.Velero pod log missing from UI drop down
After a migration is performed, the velero pod log is not included in the logs provided in the dropdown list. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076593[*BZ#2076593*])
