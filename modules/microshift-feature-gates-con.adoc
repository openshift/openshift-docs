= Understanding feature gates for {microshift-short}

[role="_abstract"]
As an application developer for edge computing environments, you can now experiment with upcoming Kubernetes features to evaluate their potential benefits for specific use cases.

By using feature gates, you can test various enhancements that might improve performance in your resource-constrained edge environments. For example, you can try advanced CPU management, enhanced scheduling features, or experimental storage options.

[WARNING]
====
When you trial new features using feature gates, your {microshift-short} can become unstable or lose data. Enable feature gates only in non-production environments.
====

When planning to use feature gates for development, consider the following details:

* After you specify feature gates, you cannot update {microshift-short}.
* If your configuration is not valid, {microshift-short} can fail to start.
* The Kubernetes components you enable handle feature gate validation.
* Feature gates are disabled by default in {microshift-short}. After you enable feature gates, you cannot disable them.
