= Operator Missing from the Operator Hub list

[role="_abstract"] 
If you are not running your {ocp-product-title} cluster on an x86 architecture, for example OpenShift Local on M1 Mac, you will not see the {ols-long} Operator in Operator Hub due to the way the Operator Hub filters architectures. 

{ols-long} is only supported on x86 architecture.
