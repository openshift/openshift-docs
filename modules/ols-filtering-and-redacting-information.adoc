= Filtering and redacting information

You can configure {ols-long} to filter or redact information from being sent to the LLM provider. The following example shows how to modify the `OLSConfig` file to redact IP addresses.   

[NOTE]
====
You should test your regular expressions against sample data to confirm that they are catching the information you want to filter or redact, and that they are not accidentally catching information you do not want to filter or redact. There are several third-party websites that you can use to test your regular expressions. When using third-party sites, you should practice caution with regards to sharing your private data. Alternatively, you can test the regular expressions locally using Python. In Python, it is possible to design very computationally-expensive regular expressions. Using several complex expressions as query filters can adversely impact the performance of {ols-long}.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. 

* You have access to the {oc-first}.

* You have installed the {ols-long} Operator and deployed the {ols-long} service.

.Procedure

. Modify the `OLSConfig` file and create an entry for each regular expression to filter. The following example redacts IP addresses:

.Example custom resource file
+
[source,yaml, subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
spec:
  ols:
    queryFilters:
      - name: ip-address
        pattern: '((25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d)\.?\b){4}'
        replaceWith: <IP_ADDRESS>
----

. Run the following command to apply the modified {ols-long} custom configuration:

$ oc apply -f OLSConfig.yaml
