= Filtering and redacting information

Configure {ols-long} to filter or redact sensitive information to prevent the Service sending information to the large language model (LLM) provider. 

[NOTE]
====
You should test your regular expressions against sample data to confirm that they identify the information you want to filter or redact, and that they do not identify information you want to send to the LLM. There are several third-party websites that you can use to test your regular expressions. When using third-party sites, you should practice caution with regards to sharing your private data. Alternatively, you can test the regular expressions locally using Python. In Python, it is possible to design very computationally-expensive regular expressions. Using several complex expressions as query filters can adversely impact the performance of {ols-long}.
====

This example shows how to modify the `OLSConfig` custom resource (CR) file to redact IP addresses, but you can also filter or redact other types of sensitive information.   

[NOTE]
====
If you configure filtering or redacting in the `OLSConfig` CR file, and you configure `introspectionEnabled` to enable a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, any content that the tools return is not filtered and is visible to the LLM.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. 

* You have access to the {oc-first}.

* You have installed the {ols-long} Operator and deployed the {ols-long} service.

.Procedure

. Modify the `OLSConfig` CR file and create an entry for each regular expression to filter. The following example redacts IP addresses:

.Example custom resource file

[source,yaml,subs="attributes,verbatim"]

spec:
  ols:
    queryFilters:
      - name: ip-address
        pattern: '((25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d)\.?\b){4}'
        replaceWith: <IP_ADDRESS>

. Run the following command to apply the modified {ols-long} custom configuration:
