= Configuring the {microshift-short} bootc image for the CNI

Configure a workaround for a kernel mismatch to enable the {microshift-short} OVN-Kubernetes (OVN-K) Container Network Interface (CNI).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {microshift-short} OVN-K CNI requires the `openvswitch` kernel module to be available in the bootc image. A bootc image is started as a container that uses the host kernel. The host kernel might be different from the one used for building the image, resulting in a mismatch. A kernel version mismatch with the modules present in the `/lib/modules` directory means that the `openvswitch` module cannot be loaded in the container and the container fails to run. You can work around this problem by pre-loading the `openvswitch` module on the host.
====

.Prerequisites

* A {op-system-base-full} {op-system-version} host with an active Red Hat subscription for building {microshift-short} bootc images and running containers.
* You are logged into the {op-system-base} {op-system-version} host using the user credentials that have `sudo` permissions.

.Procedure

. Check if the `openvswitch` module is available for the current host kernel version by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -name "openvswitch*"
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
/lib/modules/5.14.0-427.28.1.el9_4.x86_64/kernel/net/openvswitch
/lib/modules/5.14.0-427.28.1.el9_4.x86_64/kernel/net/openvswitch/openvswitch.ko.xz
----

. Set the `IMAGE_NAME` environment variable by running the following command:
+
[source,termimal]
----
$ IMAGE_NAME=microshift-4.17-bootc
----

. Check the version of the kernel-core `package` used in the bootc image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman inspect "${IMAGE_NAME}" | grep kernel-core
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
"created_by": "kernel-core-5.14.0-427.26.1.el9_4.x86_64" # <1>
----
<1> The kernel version does not match the output of the `/lib/modules` directory.
+
. Preinstall the `openvswitch` module on the host as a workaround by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo modprobe openvswitch
----
