= Destroying the cluster

Destroying the cluster has been noticed to [sometimes fail](https://github.com/openshift/installer/issues/1985). We are working on patching this, but in a mean time the workaround is to simply run it again. To do so, point it to your cluster with this command:

```sh
./openshift-install --log-level debug destroy cluster --dir ostest
```

Then, you can delete the folder containing the cluster metadata:

```sh
rm -rf ostest/
```
