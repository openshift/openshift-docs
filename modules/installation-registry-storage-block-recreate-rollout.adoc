= Configuring block registry storage for VMware vSphere

To allow the image registry to use block storage types such as vSphere Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) during upgrades as a cluster administrator, you can use the `Recreate` rollout strategy.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Block storage volumes are not recommended for use with image registry on production clusters. An installation where the registry is configured on block storage is not highly available because the registry cannot have more than one replica.
====

.Procedure

. To set the image registry storage as a block storage type, patch the registry so that it uses the `Recreate` rollout strategy and runs with only `1` replica:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch config.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"rolloutStrategy":"Recreate","replicas":1}}'
----
+
. Provision the PV for the block storage device, and create a PVC for that volume. The requested block volume uses the ReadWriteOnce (RWO) access mode.
+
. Edit the registry configuration so that it references the correct PVC.
