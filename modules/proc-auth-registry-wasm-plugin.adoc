= Authenticating to registry.redhat.io for Wasm plug-in access

:prodname: Connectivity Link

For RateLimitPolicy and AuthPolicy only, you must authenticate to `registry.redhat.io` to access the Wasm plug-in image used with {service-mesh} as the Gateway API provider.

.Prerequisites

* You have credentials to access `registry.redhat.io`. If you do not have access, see https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#creating-registry-service-accounts-6[Creating Registry Service Accounts].


.Procedure

. Create the namespace for your Gateway, for example:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc create ns api-gateway
----

. Create the following secret in your Gateway namespace:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc create secret docker-registry wasm-plugin-pull-secret -n api-gateway \ --docker-server=registry.redhat.io \ --docker-username=your-registry-service-account-username \ --docker-password=your-registry-service-account-password
----

. Repeat this step in each Gateway namespace in which you deploy a RateLimitPolicy or AuthPolicy.
