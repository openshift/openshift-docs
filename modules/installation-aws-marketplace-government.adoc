.Prerequisites

* You have an {aws-short} account to purchase the offer. This account does not have to be the same account that is used to install the cluster.

.Procedure

. Complete the {product-title} subscription from the link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/fulfillment?productId=59ead7de-2540-4653-a8b0-fa7926d5c845[AWS Marketplace].

. Record the AMI ID for your specific AWS Region. As part of the installation process, you must update the `install-config.yaml` file with this value before deploying the cluster.
