= Creating the ImageContentSourcePolicy object

After mirroring Operator catalog content to your mirror registry, create the required `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) object. The ICSP object configures nodes to translate between the image references stored in Operator manifests and the mirrored registry.

.Procedure

* On a host with access to the disconnected cluster, create the ICSP by running the following command to specify the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file in your manifests directory:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc create -f <path/to/manifests/dir>/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----
+
where `<path/to/manifests/dir>` is the path to the manifests directory for your mirrored content.
+
You can now create a `CatalogSource` object to reference your mirrored index image and Operator content.
