= Labeling namespaces to allow {kueue-name} to manage jobs

The {kueue-name} Operator uses an opt-in webhook mechanism to ensure that policies are only enforced for the jobs and namespaces that it is expected to target.

You must label the namespaces where you want {kueue-name} to manage jobs with the `kueue.openshift.io/managed=true` label.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions.
* The {kueue-name} Operator is installed on your cluster, and you have created a `Kueue` custom resource (CR).
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

* Add the `kueue.openshift.io/managed=true` label to a namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label namespace <namespace> kueue.openshift.io/managed=true
----

When you add this label, you instruct the {kueue-name} Operator that the namespace is managed by its webhook admission controllers. As a result, any {kueue-name} resources within that namespace are properly validated and mutated.
