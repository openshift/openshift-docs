= Enabling IPsec encryption

As a cluster administrator, you can enable pod-to-pod IPsec encryption and IPsec encryption between the cluster and external IPsec endpoints.

You can configure IPsec in either of the following modes:

- `Full`: Encryption for pod-to-pod and external traffic
- `External`: Encryption for external traffic

If you need to configure encryption for external traffic in addition to pod-to-pod traffic, you must also complete the "Configuring IPsec encryption for external traffic" procedure.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {oc-first}.
* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have reduced the size of your cluster MTU by `46` bytes to allow for the overhead of the IPsec ESP header.

.Procedure

. To enable IPsec encryption, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch networks.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge \
-p '{
  "spec":{
    "defaultNetwork":{
      "ovnKubernetesConfig":{
        "ipsecConfig":{
          "mode":<mode>
        }}}}}'
----
+
where:
+
--
`mode`:: Specify `External` to encrypt only traffic to external hosts or specify `Full` to encrypt pod to pod traffic and optionally traffic to external hosts. By default, IPsec is disabled.
--

. Optional: If you need to encrypt traffic to external hosts, complete the "Configuring IPsec encryption for external traffic" procedure.

.Verification

. To find the names of the OVN-Kubernetes data plane pods, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes -l=app=ovnkube-node

. Verify that IPsec is enabled on your cluster by running the following command:
+
[NOTE]
====
As a cluster administrator, you can verify that IPsec is enabled between pods on your cluster when IPsec is configured in `Full` mode. This step does not verify whether IPsec is working between your cluster and external hosts.
