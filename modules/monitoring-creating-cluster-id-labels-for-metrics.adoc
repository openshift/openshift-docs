= Creating cluster ID labels for metrics

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
You can create cluster ID labels for metrics for default platform monitoring and for user workload monitoring.

For default platform monitoring, you add cluster ID labels for metrics in the `write_relabel` settings for remote write storage in the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.

For user workload monitoring, you edit the settings in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
When Prometheus scrapes user workload targets that expose a `namespace` label, the system stores this label as `exported_namespace`. 
This behavior ensures that the final namespace label value is equal to the namespace of the target pod.
You cannot override this default configuration by setting the value of the `honorLabels` field to `true` for `PodMonitor` or `ServiceMonitor` objects.

You can create cluster ID labels for metrics by editing the settings in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* *If you are configuring default platform monitoring components:*
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:*
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* The `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap object exists. This object is created by default when the cluster is created.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have configured remote write storage.

.Procedure

. Edit the `ConfigMap` object:
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
** *To create cluster ID labels for core {product-title} metrics:*
.. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

.. In the `writeRelabelConfigs:` section under `data/config.yaml/prometheusK8s/remoteWrite`, add cluster ID relabel configuration values:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
        writeRelabelConfigs: <1>
          - <relabel_config> <2>
----
<1> Add a list of write relabel configurations for metrics that you want to send to the remote endpoint.
<2> Substitute the label configuration for the metrics sent to the remote write endpoint.
+
The following sample shows how to forward a metric with the cluster ID label `cluster_id` in default platform monitoring:

apiVersion: v1

        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - sourceLabels:
          - __tmp_openshift_cluster_id__ <1>
          targetLabel: cluster_id <2>
          action: replace <3>
----
<1> The system initially applies a temporary cluster ID source label named `+++__tmp_openshift_cluster_id__+++`. This temporary label gets replaced by the cluster ID label name that you specify.
<2> Specify the name of the cluster ID label for metrics sent to remote write storage.
If you use a label name that already exists for a metric, that value is overwritten with the name of this cluster ID label.
For the label name, do not use `+++__tmp_openshift_cluster_id__+++`. The final relabeling step removes labels that use this name.
<3> The `replace` write relabel action replaces the temporary label with the target label for outgoing metrics.
This action is the default and is applied if no action is specified.

. Save the file to apply the changes to the `ConfigMap` object.
The pods affected by the updated configuration automatically restart.

[WARNING]
====
Saving changes to a monitoring `ConfigMap` object might redeploy the pods and other resources in the related project. Saving changes might also restart the running monitoring processes in that project.
