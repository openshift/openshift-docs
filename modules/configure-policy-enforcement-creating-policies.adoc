= Configuring policy enforcement

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure if {product-title-short} should only inform you with a notification when this policy is violated, or inform you and enforce the policy. Policy enforcement is determined by whether the admission controller is enabled on the cluster and the lifecycle stage of the policy. 

.Procedure

. Select an enforcement method:
* *Inform*: Include the violation in the violations list.
* *Inform and enforce*: enforce actions. If you select this option, you must select the enforcement behavior for the policy by using the toggle for each lifecycle.
The enforcement behavior you can select depends on the lifecycle stages you selected for the policy in the *Lifecycle* section of the policy definition.
The following enforcement behaviors are available depending on the lifecycle stage:
* *Build*: {product-title-short} fails your continuous integration (CI) builds when images match the criteria of the policy.
* *Deploy*: For the *Deploy* stage, {product-title-short} blocks the creation and update of deployments that match the conditions of the policy if the {product-title-short} admission controller is configured and running.
** In clusters with admission controller enforcement, the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server blocks all noncompliant deployments. In other clusters, {product-title-short} edits noncompliant deployments to prevent pods from being scheduled.
** For existing deployments, policy changes only result in enforcement at the next detection of the criteria, when a Kubernetes event occurs. For more information about enforcement, see "Security policy enforcement for the deploy stage".
* *Runtime*: {product-title-short} deletes all pods when an event in the pods matches the criteria of the policy.

[WARNING]
====
Policy enforcement can impact running applications or development processes.
Before you enable enforcement options, inform all stakeholders and plan how to respond to automated enforcement actions.
