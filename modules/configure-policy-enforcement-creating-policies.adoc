= Configuring policy enforcement

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure if {product-title-short} should only inform you with a notification when this policy is violated, or inform you and enforce the policy. Policy enforcement is determined by whether the admission controller is enabled on the cluster and the lifecycle stage of the policy. 

.Procedure

. Select an enforcement method:
* *Inform*: Include the violation in the violations list.
* *Inform and enforce*: Include the violation in the violation list and enforce actions that you have configured. If you select this option, you must select the enforcement behavior for the policy by using the toggle for the appropriate lifecycles.
. If you choose to enforce the policy, configure the enforcement behavior. The enforcement behavior you can select depends on the lifecycle stages you selected for the policy in the *Lifecycle* section of the policy definition. The following enforcement behaviors are available depending on the lifecycle stage:
* *Build*: Select *Enforce on Build* to have {product-title-short} fail your continuous integration (CI) builds when images match the criteria of the policy. You can download the `roxctl` CLI and configure the `roxctl image check` command to work with the policy.
* *Deploy*: Select *Enforce on Deploy* to have {product-title-short} block workload admission and updates that match the conditions of the policy if the {product-title-short} admission controller is configured and running.
** In clusters with admission controller enforcement, the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server blocks all noncompliant deployments. In other clusters, {product-title-short} edits noncompliant deployments to prevent pods from being scheduled.
** For existing deployments, policy changes only result in enforcement at the next detection of the criteria, when a Kubernetes event occurs. For more information about enforcement, see "Deploy stage enforcement".
* *Runtime*: Select *Enforce on Runtime* to have {product-title-short} delete all pods when an event in the pods matches the criteria of the policy.

Policy enforcement can impact running applications or development processes.
Before you enable enforcement options, inform all stakeholders and plan how to respond to automated enforcement actions.
