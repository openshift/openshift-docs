= Opening default network ports on user-defined network pods

By default, pods on a user-defined network (UDN) are isolated from the default network. This means that default network pods, such as those running monitoring services (Prometheus or Alertmanager) or the {product-title} image registry, cannot initiate connections to UDN pods.

To allow default network pods to connect to a user-defined network pod, you can use the `k8s.ovn.org/open-default-ports` annotation. This annotation opens specific ports on the user-defined network pod for access from the default network.

The following pod specification allows incoming TCP connections on port `80` and UDP traffic on port `53` from the default network:

[NOTE]
====
Open ports are accessible on the pod's default network IP, not its UDN network IP.
