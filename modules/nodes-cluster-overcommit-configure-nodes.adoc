= Understanding nodes overcommitment

In an overcommitted environment, it is important to properly configure your node to provide best system behavior.

When the node starts, it ensures that the kernel tunable flags for memory
management are set properly. The kernel should never fail memory allocations
unless it runs out of physical memory.

In an overcommitted environment, it is important to properly configure your node to provide best system behavior.

When the node starts, it ensures that the kernel tunable flags for memory
management are set properly. The kernel should never fail memory allocations
unless it runs out of physical memory.

To ensure this behavior, {product-title} configures the kernel to always overcommit
memory by setting the `vm.overcommit_memory` parameter to `1`, overriding the
default operating system setting.

{product-title} also configures the kernel not to panic when it runs out of memory
by setting the `vm.panic_on_oom` parameter to `0`. A setting of 0 instructs the
kernel to call oom_killer in an Out of Memory (OOM) condition, which kills
processes based on priority

You can view the current setting by running the following commands on your nodes:

[source,terminal]
----
$ sysctl -a |grep commit
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
vm.overcommit_memory = 1
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ sysctl -a |grep panic
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
vm.panic_on_oom = 0
----

[NOTE]
====
The above flags should already be set on nodes, and no further action is
required.

You can also perform the following configurations for each node:

* Disable or enforce CPU limits using CPU CFS quotas

* Reserve resources for system processes

* Reserve memory across quality of service tiers
