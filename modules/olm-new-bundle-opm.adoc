= Developer Preview: New Operator bundle format and `opm` CLI

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following features are in Developer Preview and not currently supported or
intended for production use. They are highlighted here to notify users of an
important upcoming change to the Operator Framework. Limited documentation is
available at this time.
====

Related to the deprecation of OperatorSources and CatalogSourceConfigs from
OperatorHub, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) will be introducing a new
_Operator bundle_ format in a future release of OKD and OpenShift Container
Platform. A bundle is a container image that stores Kubernetes manifests and
metadata associated with an Operator and is meant to present a specific version
of an Operator.

The following layout shows the directory structure of an Operator bundle
inside a bundle image:

----
/
├── manifests
│   ├── etcdcluster.crd.yaml
│   └── etcdoperator.clusterserviceversion.yaml
└── metadata
    ├── annotations.yaml
    └── dependencies.yaml
----

In addition, the new Operator Package Manager (`opm`) is introduced alongside
the new Operator bundle format. The `opm` CLI tool can:

- generate bundle annotations,
- build bundle images, and
- validate bundle images available in a registry.

[NOTE]
====
Procedures for converting from OperatorSources to using CatalogSources directly
will be provided in a future documentation update.
