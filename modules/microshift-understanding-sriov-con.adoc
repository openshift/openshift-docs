= Understanding the SR-IOV Network Operator

[role="_abstract"]
SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) is a specification that allows a single physical Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) device that supports SR-IOV, for example, a Physical Function (PF), to appear as multiple separate physical devices known as Virtual Functions (VFs). You can directly assign VFs to pods, which bypasses the host operating system network stack, improves throughput, and reduces latency for network intensive workloads.

The integration of the SR-IOV Network Operator and CNI provider into {microshift-short} enables declarative access to VFs. As a result, you can expose supported SR-IOV devices as specialized resources within your {microshift-short} pod for more predictable high-speed networking for demanding workloads. The deployed SR-IOV resources operate in the `sriov-network-operator` namespace.

You do not need to manually configure SR-IOV through the operating system. You can also treat VFs as resources that can be reliably mapped to your containerized applications. These resources reduce manual error and ensure consistent, low-latency networking for critical applications.

Here are the components of SR-IOV functionality:

* SR-IOV Network Operator: The SR-IOV Network Operator is a Kubernetes component that detects and manages SR-IOV devices. This component exposes the SR-IOV devices as schedulable resources within {microshift-short}.
* SR-IOV CNI Provider: This Container Network Interface (CNI) provider works with Multus to assign the exposed VFs to the application pods.
* Virtual Functions (VFs): VFs are lightweight PCIe functions exposed by the PF that are assigned to pods.
* NetworkAttachment Definitions: NetworkAttachmentDefinitions are custom resources (CRs) that are used to define the specific network configuration so that application developers can specify the VFs they need access. NetworkAttachmentDefinitions provide the declarative method for accessing VFs.
