= Image vulnerabilities breakdown

In the developer perspective, the project dashboard shows the *Image Vulnerabilities* link in the *Status* section. Using this link, you can view the *Image Vulnerabilities breakdown* window, which includes details regarding vulnerable container images and fixable container images. The icon color indicates severity:

* Red: High priority. Fix immediately.
* Orange: Medium priority. Can be fixed after high-priority vulnerabilities.
* Yellow: Low priority. Can be fixed after high and medium-priority vulnerabilities.

Based on the severity level, you can prioritize vulnerabilities and fix them in an organized manner.
