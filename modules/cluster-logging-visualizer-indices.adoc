= Defining Kibana index patterns

An index pattern defines the Elasticsearch indices that you want to visualize. To explore and visualize data in Kibana, you must create an index pattern. 

.Prerequisites

* A user must have the `cluster-admin` role, the `cluster-reader` role, or both roles to list the *infra* and *audit* indices in Kibana. 
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc auth can-i get pods/logs -n default
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
yes
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The audit logs are not stored in the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance by default. To view the audit logs in Kibana, you must use the Log Forwarding API to configure a pipeline that uses the `default` output for audit logs.
====

* Elasticsearch documents must be indexed before you can create index patterns. This is done automatically, but it might take a few minutes in a new or updated cluster.

.Procedure

To define index patterns and create visualizations:

. Launch Kibana by clicking the Application Launcher {launch} and select *Logging*.

. Create your Kibana index patterns:

** Regular users must manually create index patterns to see logs for their projects. Users should create a new index pattern named `app` and use the `@timestamp` time field to view their container logs. 

** Admin users need to create index patterns for the *app*, *infra*, and *audit* indices using the `@timestamp` time field. 

. Create Kibana Visualizations from the new index patterns.
