= Creating a federated {gcp-short} service account

You can use the {gcp-full} console to create a workload identity pool and provider and allow an {product-title} service account to impersonate a {gcp-short} service account.

.Prerequisites

* Your {gcp-short} cluster uses {gcp-wid-short}.

* You have access to the {gcp-full} console as a user with privileges to manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) and workload identity configurations.

* You have created a {gcp-full} project to use with your application.

.Procedure

. In the IAM configuration for your {gcp-full} project, identify the identity pool and provider that the cluster uses for {gcp-wid-short} authentication.

. Grant permission for external identities to impersonate a {gcp-short} service account. 
With these permissions, an {product-title} service account can work as a federated workload identity.
