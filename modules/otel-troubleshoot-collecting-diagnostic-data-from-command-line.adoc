= Collecting diagnostic data from the command line

When submitting a support case, it is helpful to include diagnostic information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.
You can use the `oc adm must-gather` tool to gather diagnostic data for resources of various types, such as `OpenTelemetryCollector`, `Instrumentation`, and the created resources like `Deployment`, `Pod`, or `ConfigMap`.
The `oc adm must-gather` tool creates a new pod that collects this data.

.Procedure

* From the directory where you want to save the collected data, run the `oc adm must-gather` command to collect the data:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/must-gather -- \
/usr/bin/must-gather --operator-namespace <operator_namespace> # <1>
----
<1> The default namespace where the Operator is installed is `openshift-opentelemetry-operator`.

.Verification

* Verify that the new directory is created and contains the collected data.
