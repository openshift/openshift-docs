+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc cp <local_path> <pod_name>:/<path> -c <container_name>  <1>
----
<1> Note that a Pod's first container will be selected if the `-c` option is not specified.

. Copy a file from a Pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc cp <pod_name>:/<path>  -c <container_name><local_path>  <1>
----
