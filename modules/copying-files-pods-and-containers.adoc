* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Your API service is still functional.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Copy a file to a Pod:
+
----
$ oc cp <local_path> <pod_name>:/<path> -c <container_name>  <1>
----
<1> Note that a Pod's first container will be selected if the `-c` option is not specified.

. Copy a file from a Pod:
+
----
$ oc cp <pod_name>:/<path>  -c <container_name><local_path>  <1>
----
<1> Note that a Pod's first container will be selected if the `-c` option is not specified.
