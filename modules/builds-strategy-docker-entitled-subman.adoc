= Docker builds using Subscription Manager

Docker strategy builds can use the Subscription Manager to install subscription
content.

.Prerequisites

The entitlement keys, subscription manager configuration, and subscription
manager certificate authority must be added as build inputs.

.Procedure

Use the following as an example `Dockerfile` to install content with the
Subscription Manager:

----
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel7:latest
USER root
# Copy entitlements
COPY ./etc-pki-entitlement /etc/pki/entitlement
# Copy subscription manager configurations
COPY ./rhsm-conf /etc/rhsm
COPY ./rhsm-ca /etc/rhsm/ca
# Delete /etc/rhsm-host to use entitlements from the build container
RUN rm /etc/rhsm-host && \
    # Initialize /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo
    # See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1443553
    yum repolist --disablerepo=* && \
    subscription-manager repos --enable <enabled-repo> && \
    yum -y update && \
    yum -y install <rpms> && \
    # Remove entitlements and Subscription Manager configs
    rm -rf /etc/pki/entitlement && \
    rm -rf /etc/rhsm
# OpenShift requires images to run as non-root by default
