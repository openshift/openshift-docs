[id="migration-dvm-error-node-selectors_{context}"]
= Direct volume migration does not complete

If direct volume migration does not complete, the target cluster might not have the same `node-selector` annotations as the source cluster.

{mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) migrates namespaces with all annotations in order to preserve security context constraints and scheduling requirements. During direct volume migration, {mtc-short} creates Rsync transfer pods on the target cluster in the namespaces that were migrated from the source cluster. If a target cluster namespace does not have the same annotations as the source cluster namespace, the Rsync transfer pods cannot be scheduled. The Rsync pods remain in a `Pending` state.

You can identify and fix this issue by performing the following procedure.

.Procedure

. Check the status of the `MigMigration` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe migmigration <pod_name> -n openshift-migration
----
+
The output includes the following status message:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Some or all transfer pods are not running for more than 10 mins on destination cluster
----

. On the source cluster, obtain the details of a migrated namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get namespace <namespace> -o yaml <1>
----
<1> Specify the migrated namespace.

. On the target cluster, edit the migrated namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit namespace <namespace>
----

. Add the missing `openshift.io/node-selector` annotations to the migrated namespace as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/node-selector: "region=east"
...
----

. Run the migration plan again.
