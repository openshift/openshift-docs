= Supporting services persistence configurations

The persistence configuration for supporting services in {ServerlessLogicProductName} can be either ephemeral or PostgreSQL, depending on needs of your environment. Ephemeral persistence is ideal for development and testing, while PostgreSQL persistence is recommended for production environments.

[id="serverless-logic-supporting-services-ephemeral-persistence-config_{context}"]
== Ephemeral persistence configuration

The ephemeral persistence uses an embedded PostgreSQL database that is dedicated to each service. The {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} recreates this database with every service restart, making it suitable only for development and testing purposes. You do not need any additional configuration other than the following `SonataFlowPlatform` CR:
