= Resources reference for the Cluster Monitoring Operator

[role="_abstract"]
This document describes the following resources deployed and managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO):

* link:#cmo-routes-resources_{context}[Routes]
* link:#cmo-services-resources_{context}[Services]

Use this information when you want to configure API endpoint connections to retrieve, send, or query metrics data.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In certain situations, accessing endpoints can degrade the performance and scalability of your cluster, especially if you use endpoints to retrieve, send, or query large amounts of metrics data.

To avoid these issues, follow these recommendations:

* Avoid querying endpoints frequently. Limit queries to a maximum of one every 30 seconds.
* Do not try to retrieve all metrics data via the `/federate` endpoint. Query it only when you want to retrieve a limited, aggregated data set. For example, retrieving fewer than 1,000 samples for each request helps minimize the risk of performance degradation.

=== openshift-user-workload-monitoring/alertmanager-user-workload

Expose the user-defined Alertmanager web server within the cluster on the following ports:

* Port 9095 provides access to the Alertmanager endpoints. Granting access requires binding a user to the `monitoring-alertmanager-api-reader` role (for read-only operations) or the `monitoring-alertmanager-api-writer` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
* Port 9092 provides access to the Alertmanager endpoints restricted to a given project. Granting access requires binding a user to the `monitoring-rules-edit` cluster role or `monitoring-edit` cluster role in the project.
* Port 9097 provides access to the `/metrics` endpoint only. This port is for internal use, and no other usage is guaranteed.

=== openshift-monitoring/alertmanager-main

Expose the Alertmanager web server within the cluster on the following ports:

* Port 9094 provides access to all the Alertmanager endpoints. Granting access requires binding a user to the `monitoring-alertmanager-view` role (for read-only operations) or the `monitoring-alertmanager-edit` role in the `openshift-monitoring` project.
