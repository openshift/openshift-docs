= Service CIDR

[role="_abstract"]
To allocate IP addresses for cluster services in {product-title}, specify an IP address range in the Service Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) parameter. Defining this range ensures that internal services have a dedicated block of addresses for reliable communication without overlapping with node or pod networks.

ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp,openshift-dedicated[]
Red{nbsp}Hat recommends, but this task is not mandatory, that the address block is the same between clusters. This does not create IP address conflicts.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp,openshift-dedicated[]

The range must be large enough to accommodate your workload. The address block must not overlap with any external service accessed from within the cluster. The default is `172.30.0.0/16`.
