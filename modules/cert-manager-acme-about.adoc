= About ACME issuers

The ACME issuer type for the {cert-manager-operator} represents an Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) certificate authority (CA) server. ACME CA servers rely on a _challenge_ to verify that a client owns the domain names that the certificate is being requested for. If the challenge is successful, the {cert-manager-operator} can issue the certificate. If the challenge fails, the {cert-manager-operator} does not issue the certificate.
