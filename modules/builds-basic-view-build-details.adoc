= Viewing build details

You can view build details with the web console or by using the `oc describe` CLI command.

This displays information including:

* The build source.
* The build strategy.
* The output destination.
* Digest of the image in the destination registry.
* How the build was created.

If the build uses the
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
`Docker` or
endif::[]
`Source` strategy, the `oc describe` output also includes information about the source revision used for the build, including the commit ID, author, committer, and message.

.Procedure

* To view build details, enter the following command:
