[id="virt-assigning-mdev-vm-cli_{context}"]
= Assigning a vGPU to a VM by using the CLI

Assign mediated devices such as virtual GPUs (vGPUs) to virtual machines (VMs).

.Prerequisites

* The mediated device is configured in the `HyperConverged` custom resource.
* The VM is stopped.

.Procedure

* Assign the mediated device to a virtual machine (VM) by editing the `spec.domain.devices.gpus` stanza of the `VirtualMachine` manifest:
+

      - deviceName: nvidia.com/GRID_T4-2Q
        name: gpu2
----
<1> The resource name associated with the mediated device.
<2> A name to identify the device on the VM.

.Verification

* To verify that the device is available from the virtual machine, run the following command, substituting `<device_name>` with the `deviceName` value from the `VirtualMachine` manifest:
