= Installing {builds-shortname} by using the CLI

You can also install {builds-shortname} by using the command-line interface (CLI).

.Procedure

. Create a `sub.yaml` subscription object file to subscribe a namespace to the {builds-operator}, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: openshift-builds-operator
  namespace: openshift-builds
spec:
  channel: <channel-name> <1>
  name: openshift-builds-operator <2>
  source: redhat-operators <3>
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace <4>
----
<1> The channel name from where you want to subscribe the Operator.
<2> Name of the Operator to subscribe to.
<3> Name of the CatalogSource that provides the Operator.
<4> Namespace of the CatalogSource. Use `openshift-marketplace` for the default OperatorHub CatalogSources.

. Apply the subscription object by runninng the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f sub.yml
----
+
The {builds-operator} is now installed in the default target namespace `openshift-builds`.

.Verification

After installing the Builds for Red Hat OpenShift Operator, you must verify that the following resources are created to ensure proper functioning of the Operator: 

. Run the following command to ensure that the `OpenshiftBuild` resource is created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get openshiftbuilds
----
+

. Run the following command to ensure that the `ShipwrightBuilds` resource is created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get shipwrightbuilds
----
+

. Run the following command to ensure that the following pods are created in the `openshift-builds` namespace:

* `openshift-builds` operator pod
* Build controller and build webhook pods
* SharedResource daemonset and SharedResource webhook pods
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-builds
----
+

The list of pods is displayed as shown in the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-builds
