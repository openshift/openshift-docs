= vSphere automatic migration

== New installations of {product-title}
For new installations of {product-title} 4.13, or later, automatic migration is enabled by default.

== Upgrading {product-title}
When upgrading from {product-title} 4.12, or earlier, to 4.13, automatic CSI migration for vSphere only occurs if you opt in.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Carefully review the following consequences before opting in to migration:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/node/7011683[There are known issues that can occur that can cause the migration to fail].

* Enabling migration cannot be undone.

* Migration can take awhile to complete depending on how many nodes are on the cluster.

* Migration is a disruptive process. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) has to update kubelet, which means degrading each node as it rolls out the new MachineConfig to each machine.
====

=== Using the web console to opt in to automatic CSI migration

==== Prerequisites

* Access to the {product-title} web console.

* Access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.

===== Procedure

To opt in to automatic CSI migration for vSphere:

. Log in to the web console.

. Click *Administration* -> *CustomResourceDefinitions*.

. On the *CustomResourceDefinitions* page, type "Storage" to find the `Storage` custom resource (CR).

. Click the *Storage* CR.

. On the *storages.operator.openshift.io* page, click the *Instances* tab.

. Click the name of the desired instance, and then click the *YAML* tab.

. Set the `spec.vsphereStorageDriver` parameter to `CSIWithMigrationDriver`, as shown in the following example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
....
spec:
  logLevel: Normal
  managementState: Managed
  operatorLogLevel: Normal
  vsphereStorageDriver: CSIWithMigrationDriver <1>
...
----
<1> `spec.vsphereStorageDriver` parameter set to `CSIWithMigrationDriver`

. Click *Save*.

=== Using the CLI to opt in to automatic CSI migration

==== Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.

==== Procedure

To opt in to automatic CSI migration for vSphere, run the following command:

[source, cli]
----
oc patch storage cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"vsphereStorageDriver":"CSIWithMigrationDriver"}}'
----

[NOTE]
====
You can determine when migration is complete by verifying that the `VSphereMigrationControllerAvailable` condition is set to "true" in the `Storage` object.
