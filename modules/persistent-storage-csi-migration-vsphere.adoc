[id="updating-openshift_from_4.13_{context}"]
== Updating from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14
If you are using vSphere in-tree persistent volumes (PVs) and want to update from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14, update vSphere vCenter and ESXI host to 7.0 Update 3L or 8.0 Update 2, otherwise the {product-title} update is blocked. After updating vSphere, your {product-title} update can occur and automatic migration is enabled by default.

Alternatively, if you do not want to update vSphere, you can proceed with an {product-title} update by performing an administrator acknowledgment:

[source, cli]
----
oc -n openshift-config patch cm admin-acks --patch '{"data":{"ack-4.13-kube-127-vsphere-migration-in-4.14":"true"}}' --type=merge
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do *not* update to vSphere 7.0 Update 3L or 8.0 Update 2 and use an administrator acknowledgment to update to {product-title} 4.14, known issues can occur due to CSI migration being enabled by default in {product-title} 4.14. link:https://access.redhat.com/node/7011683[Before proceeding with the administrator acknowledgement, carefully read this knowledge base article].

After updating vSphere, your {product-title} update can occur and automatic migration is enabled by default.

Alternatively, if you do not want to update vSphere, you can proceed with an {product-title} update by performing an administrator acknowledgment by running *both* of the following commands:
