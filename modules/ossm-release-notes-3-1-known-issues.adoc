== `podDisruptionBudget` object that prevents nodes from upgrading

There is currently a known issue that prevents {ocp-product-title} nodes from upgrading. The `podDisruptionBudget` resource prevents the draining of the node where the `istiod` pod is running, unless there are multiple replicas of the `istiod` pod.

Workaround: Set the `.spec.values.global.defaultPodDisruptionBudget.enabled` field in the {istio} CR to `false`. Alternatively, you can temporarily increase the number of replicas for the `istiod` deployment. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-9392[OSSM-9392]
