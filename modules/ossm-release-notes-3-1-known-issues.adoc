== Pod health check issues with OVN-K CNI in ambient mode

There is currently a known issue where pod health checks (`liveness` and `readiness` probes) may fail in ambient mode when using the OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.18 and earlier releases, such as OCP 4.16. This issue causes pods to enter a `CrashLoopBackOff` state, even though the application containers are running as expected.

Workaround: Configure the OVN-Kubernetes CNI to use local gateway mode by setting the `routingViaHost` field as `true` in the `gatewayConfig` specification in the Cluster Network Operator.

For configuration details, see “Configuring Gateway Mode”. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-9053[OSSM-9053]
