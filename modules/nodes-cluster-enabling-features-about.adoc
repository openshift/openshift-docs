= Understanding feature gates

You can use the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR) to enable specific feature sets in your cluster. A feature set is a collection of {product-title} features that are not enabled by default.

For example, the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set allows you to enable a subset of the current Technology Preview features on test clusters, where you can fully test them, while leaving the features disabled on production clusters.

You can activate any of the following feature sets by using the `FeatureGate` CR:

[options="header"]
|===
| Feature Set| Description

|`TechPreviewNoUpgrade`
a|Enables Technology Preview features that are not part of the default features. Enabling this feature set cannot be undone and prevents upgrades. This feature set is not recommended on production clusters. 

The following Technology Preview features are enabled by this feature set:

* link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/#certificate-rotation[RotateKubeletServerCertificate]. Enables the rotation of the server TLS certificate on the kubelet.
* link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pid-limiting/#pod-pid-limits[Pod PID limits (SupportPodPidsLimit)]. Enables limiting process IDs (PIDs) in pods.
* `InsightsOperatorPullingSCA`. Enables importing of RHEL Simple Content Access (SCA) certificates from {cloud-redhat-com}.

|`CustomNoUpgrade` ^[2]^
|Allows the enabling or disabling of any feature. Turning on this feature set on is not supported, cannot be undone, and prevents upgrades.

1. 
2. If you use the `CustomNoUpgrade` feature set to disable a feature that appears in the web console, you might see that feature, but
no objects are listed. For example, if you disable builds, you can see the *Builds* tab in the web console, but there are no builds present. If you attempt to use commands associated with a disabled feature, such as `oc start-build`, {product-title} displays an error.

[NOTE]
====
If you disable a feature that any application in the cluster relies on, the application might not
function properly, depending upon the feature disabled and how the application uses that feature.
