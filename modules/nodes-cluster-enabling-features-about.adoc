= Understanding feature gates

You can use the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR) to enable specific feature sets in your cluster. A feature set is a collection of {product-title} features that are not enabled by default.

You can activate the following feature set by using the `FeatureGate` CR:

* `TechPreviewNoUpgrade`. This feature set is a subset of the current Technology Preview features. This feature set allows you to enable these Technology Preview features on test clusters, where you can fully test them, while leaving the features disabled on production clusters.
+
[WARNING]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on your cluster cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. You should not enable this feature set on production clusters.
====

The following Technology Preview features are enabled by this feature set:
+
--
** CSI automatic migration. Enables automatic migration for supported in-tree volume plugins to their equivalent Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers. Supported for:
*** Azure File (`CSIMigrationAzureFile`)
*** VMware vSphere (`CSIMigrationvSphere`)
** Shared Resources CSI Driver and Build CSI Volumes in OpenShift Builds. Enables the Container Storage Interface (CSI). (`CSIDriverSharedResource`)
** CSI volumes. Enables CSI volume support for the {product-title} build system. (`BuildCSIVolumes`)
** Swap memory on nodes. Enables swap memory use for {product-title} workloads on a per-node basis. (`NodeSwap`)
** cgroups v2. Enables cgroup v2, the next version of the Linux cgroup API. (`CGroupsV2`)
** crun. Enables the crun container runtime. (`Crun`)
** Insights Operator. Enables the Insights Operator, which gathers {product-title} configuration data and sends it to Red Hat. (`InsightsConfigAPI`)
** External cloud providers. Enables support for external cloud providers for clusters on vSphere, AWS, Azure, and GCP. Support for OpenStack is GA. (`ExternalCloudProvider`)
** Pod topology spread constraints. Enables the `matchLabelKeys` parameter for pod topology constraints. The parameter is list of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. (`MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread`)
** Pod security admission enforcement. Enables restricted enforcement for pod security admission. Instead of only logging a warning, pods are rejected if they violate pod security standards. (`OpenShiftPodSecurityAdmission`)
** Pod disruption budget (PDB) unhealthy pod eviction policy. Enables support for specifying how unhealthy pods are considered for eviction when using PDBs. (`PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy`)

|`CustomNoUpgrade` ^[2]^
|Allows the enabling or disabling of any feature. Turning on this feature set on is not supported, cannot be undone, and prevents upgrades.

1.
2. If you use the `CustomNoUpgrade` feature set to disable a feature that appears in the web console, you might see that feature, but
no objects are listed. For example, if you disable builds, you can see the *Builds* tab in the web console, but there are no builds present. If you attempt to use commands associated with a disabled feature, such as `oc start-build`, {product-title} displays an error.

[NOTE]
====
If you disable a feature that any application in the cluster relies on, the application might not
function properly, depending upon the feature disabled and how the application uses that feature.
