= Understanding feature gates

You can use the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR) to enable specific feature sets in your cluster. A feature set is a collection of {product-title} features that are not enabled by default.

You can activate the following feature set by using the `FeatureGate` CR:

* `TechPreviewNoUpgrade`. This feature set is a subset of the current Technology Preview features. This feature set allows you to enable these tech preview features on test clusters, where you can fully test them, while leaving the features disabled on production clusters. Enabling this feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. This feature set is not recommended on production clusters.
+
The following Technology Preview features are enabled by this feature set:
+
** Microsoft Azure File CSI Driver Operator. Enables the provisioning of persistent volumes (PVs) by using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Microsoft Azure File Storage.
** CSI automatic migration. Enables automatic migration for supported in-tree volume plug-ins to their equivalent Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers. Supported for:
*** Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
*** Google Compute Engine Persistent Disk
*** Azure File
*** VMware vSphere
** Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator. Enables the Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator rather than the in-tree cloud controller. Available as a Technology Preview for:
*** Alibaba Cloud
*** Amazon Web Services (AWS)
*** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
*** IBM Cloud
*** Microsoft Azure
*** {rh-openstack-first}
*** VMware vSphere
** Shared resource CSI driver
** CSI volume support for the {product-title} build system
** Swap memory on nodes
** Cluster API. Enables the integrated upstream Cluster API in {product-title} with the `ClusterAPIEnabled` feature gate. Available as a Technology Preview for:
*** Amazon Web Services (AWS)
*** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

|`CustomNoUpgrade` ^[2]^
|Allows the enabling or disabling of any feature. Turning on this feature set on is not supported, cannot be undone, and prevents upgrades.

1.
2. If you use the `CustomNoUpgrade` feature set to disable a feature that appears in the web console, you might see that feature, but
no objects are listed. For example, if you disable builds, you can see the *Builds* tab in the web console, but there are no builds present. If you attempt to use commands associated with a disabled feature, such as `oc start-build`, {product-title} displays an error.

[NOTE]
====
If you disable a feature that any application in the cluster relies on, the application might not
function properly, depending upon the feature disabled and how the application uses that feature.
