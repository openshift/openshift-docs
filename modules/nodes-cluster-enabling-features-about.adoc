= Understanding feature gates

You can use the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR) to enable specific feature sets in your cluster. A feature set is a collection of {product-title} features that are not enabled by default.

You can activate the following feature set by using the `FeatureGate` CR:

* `TechPreviewNoUpgrade`. This feature set is a subset of the current Technology Preview features. This feature set allows you to enable these Technology Preview features on test clusters, where you can fully test them, while leaving the features disabled on production clusters.
+
[WARNING]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on your cluster cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. You should not enable this feature set on production clusters.
====
+
The following Technology Preview features are enabled by this feature set:
+
--
** External cloud providers. Enables support for external cloud providers for clusters on vSphere, AWS, Azure, and GCP. Support for OpenStack is GA. This is an internal feature that most users do not need to interact with. (`ExternalCloudProvider`)
** Shared Resources CSI Driver in OpenShift Builds. Enables the Container Storage Interface (CSI). (`CSIDriverSharedResource`)
** Swap memory on nodes. Enables swap memory use for {product-title} workloads on a per-node basis. (`NodeSwap`)
** OpenStack Machine API Provider. This gate has no effect and is planned to be removed from this feature set in a future release. (`MachineAPIProviderOpenStack`)
** Insights Operator. Enables the Insights Operator, which gathers {product-title} configuration data and sends it to Red Hat. (`InsightsConfigAPI`)
** Retroactive Default Storage Class. Enables {product-title} to retroactively assign the default storage class to PVCs if there was no default storage class when the PVC was created.(`RetroactiveDefaultStorageClass`)
** Dynamic Resource Allocation API. Enables a new API for requesting and sharing resources between pods and containers. This is an internal feature that most users do not need to interact with. (`DynamicResourceAllocation`)
** Pod security admission enforcement. Enables the restricted enforcement mode for pod security admission. Instead of only logging a warning, pods are rejected if they violate pod security standards. (`OpenShiftPodSecurityAdmission`)
** StatefulSet pod availability upgrading limits. Enables users to define the maximum number of statefulset pods unavailable during updates which reduces application downtime. (`MaxUnavailableStatefulSet`)
** Admin Network Policy and Baseline Admin Network Policy. Enables `AdminNetworkPolicy` and `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` resources, which are part of the Network Policy V2 API, in clusters running the OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin. Cluster administrators can apply cluster-scoped policies and safeguards for an entire cluster before namespaces are created. Network administrators can secure clusters by enforcing network traffic controls that cannot be overridden by users. Network administrators can enforce optional baseline network traffic controls that can be overridden by users in the cluster, if necessary. Currently, these APIs support only expressing policies for intra-cluster traffic. (`AdminNetworkPolicy`)
** `MatchConditions` is a list of conditions that must be met for a request to be sent to this webhook. Match conditions filter requests that have already been matched by the rules, namespaceSelector, and objectSelector. An empty list of `matchConditions` matches all requests. (`admissionWebhookMatchConditions`)
** Gateway API. To enable the {product-title} Gateway API, set the value of the `enabled` field to `true` in the `techPreview.gatewayAPI` specification of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.(`gateGatewayAPI`)
** `sigstoreImageVerification`
** `gcpLabelsTags`
** `vSphereStaticIPs`
** `routeExternalCertificate`
** `automatedEtcdBackup`

|`CustomNoUpgrade` ^[2]^
|Allows the enabling or disabling of any feature. Turning on this feature set on is not supported, cannot be undone, and prevents upgrades.

1.
2. If you use the `CustomNoUpgrade` feature set to disable a feature that appears in the web console, you might see that feature, but
no objects are listed. For example, if you disable builds, you can see the *Builds* tab in the web console, but there are no builds present. If you attempt to use commands associated with a disabled feature, such as `oc start-build`, {product-title} displays an error.

[NOTE]
====
If you disable a feature that any application in the cluster relies on, the application might not
function properly, depending upon the feature disabled and how the application uses that feature.
