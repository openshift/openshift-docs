= Understanding feature gates

You can use the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR) to enable specific feature sets in your cluster. A feature set is a collection of {product-title} features that are not enabled by default.

You can activate the following feature set by using the `FeatureGate` CR:

* `IPv6DualStackNoUpgrade`. This feature gate enables the dual-stack networking mode in your cluster. Dual-stack networking supports the use of IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously. Enabling this feature set is _not supported_, cannot be undone, and prevents updates. This feature set is not recommended on production clusters.

Do not document per Derek Carr: https://github.com/openshift/api/pull/370#issuecomment-510632939
|`CustomNoUpgrade` ^[2]^
|Allows the enabling or disabling of any feature. Turning on this feature set on is not supported, cannot be undone, and prevents upgrades.

1. 
2. If you use the `CustomNoUpgrade` feature set to disable a feature that appears in the web console, you might see that feature, but
no objects are listed. For example, if you disable builds, you can see the *Builds* tab in the web console, but there are no builds present. If you attempt to use commands associated with a disabled feature, such as `oc start-build`, {product-title} displays an error.

[NOTE]
====
If you disable a feature that any application in the cluster relies on, the application might not
function properly, depending upon the feature disabled and how the application uses that feature.
