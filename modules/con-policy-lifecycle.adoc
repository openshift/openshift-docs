= Understanding policies and lifecycle phases

[role="_abstract"]
When configuring policies, you can select the lifecycle stages that apply to your policy, and you can select more than one stage for a policy.

You can select from the following lifecycle stages:

* Build phase policies: These policies apply to image fields such as CVEs and Dockerfile instructions.
* Deploy phase policies: These policies can include all build-time policy criteria. They can also have data from your cluster configurations, such as running in privileged mode or mounting the Docker daemon socket.
* Runtime policies: These policies scan include all build-time and deploy-time policy criteria, and data about process executions during runtime. You can further configure runtime policies to trigger policy violations based on the following events:
** Deployments: {product-title-short} triggers policy violations when event sources include process and network activity, such as executing a command in a pod and pod port forwarding.
** Audit logs: {product-title-short} triggers policy violations when event sources match Kubernetes audit log records.
