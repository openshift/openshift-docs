= Confirming node network policy updates on nodes

[role="_abstract"]
When you apply a node network policy, a `NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment` object is created for every node in the cluster. The node network configuration enactment is a read-only object that represents the status of execution of the policy on that node.

If the policy fails to be applied on the node, the enactment for that node includes a traceback for troubleshooting.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. To confirm that a policy has been applied to the cluster, list the policies and their status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nncp
----

. Optional: If a policy is taking longer than expected to successfully configure, you can inspect the requested state and status conditions of a particular policy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nncp <policy> -o yaml
----

. Optional: If a policy is taking longer than expected to successfully configure on all nodes, you can list the status of the enactments on the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nnce
----

. Optional: To view the configuration of a particular enactment, including any error reporting for a failed configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nnce <node>.<policy> -o yaml
----
