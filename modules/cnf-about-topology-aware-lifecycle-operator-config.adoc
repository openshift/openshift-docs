= About the Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator configuration

The Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator manages the deployment of {rh-rhacm-first} policies for one or more {product-title} clusters. TALO allows you to control the following actions:

* The timing of the update
* The number of {rh-rhacm}-managed clusters
* The update order of the clusters

TALO supports the orchestration of the {product-title} y-stream and z-stream updates, and day-two operations on y-stream and z-streams.

== About managed policies used with Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator

TALO uses {rh-rhacm} policies for cluster updates.

You can deploy managed policies with TALO that meet the following requirements:

* The policy is for a subscription or platform update.
* The `remediationAction` of the policy is in `inform` mode.

For more information about managed policies, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html-single/governance/index#policy-overview[Policy Overview] in the {rh-rhacm} documentation.

TALO supports the use of both user-defined custom resources (CR) and the `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resource definition (CRD). For more information about the `PolicyGenTempalte` CRD, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/scalability_and_performance/ztp-deploying-disconnected.html#ztp-the-policygentemplate_ztp-deploying-disconnected[The PolicyGenTemplate].
