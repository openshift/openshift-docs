= About the Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator configuration

The Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator manages the deployment of {rh-rhacm-first} policies for one or more {product-title} clusters. When TALO is used in a large network of clusters, TALO allows the phased rollout of policies to the clusters in limited batches. This can be helpful in minimizing overall service disruption that may be caused by these updates. TALO allows you to control the following actions:

* The timing of the update
* The number of {rh-rhacm}-managed clusters
* The subset of managed clusters to apply the policies to
* The update order of the clusters
* The set of policies remediated to the cluster
* The order of policies remediated to the cluster

TALO supports the orchestration of the {product-title} y-stream and z-stream updates, and day-two operations on y-stream and z-streams.
