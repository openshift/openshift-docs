= Example for creating DNS zones

DNS records are required for clusters that use user-provisioned infrastructure.
You should choose the DNS strategy that fits your scenario.

ifndef::ash[]
For this example, link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-overview[Azure's DNS solution]
is used, so you will create a new public DNS zone for external (internet)
visibility and a private DNS zone for internal cluster resolution.
endif::ash[]
ifdef::ash[]
For this example, link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/operator/azure-stack-integrate-dns?view=azs-2102[Azure Stack Hub's datacenter DNS integration] is used, so you will create a DNS zone.

[NOTE]
====
The public DNS zone is not required to exist in the same resource group as the
cluster deployment and might already exist in your organization for the desired base domain. If that is the case, you can skip creating the public DNS zone; be sure the installation config you generated earlier reflects that scenario.
