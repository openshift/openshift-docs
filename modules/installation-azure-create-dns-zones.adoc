= Example for creating DNS zones

DNS records are required for clusters that use user-provisioned infrastructure.
You should choose the DNS strategy that fits your scenario.

For this example, link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-overview[Azure's DNS solution]
is used, so you will create a new public DNS zone for external (internet)
visibility and a private DNS zone for internal cluster resolution.

[NOTE]
====
The public DNS zone is not required to exist in the same resource group as the
cluster deployment and might already exist in your organization for the desired
base domain. If that is the case, you can skip creating the public DNS zone; be
sure the installation config you generated earlier reflects that scenario.
====

.Prerequisites

* Configure an Azure account.

* Generate the Ignition config files for your cluster.

.Procedure

. Create the new public DNS zone in the resource group exported in the
`BASE_DOMAIN_RESOURCE_GROUP` environment variable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az network dns zone create -g ${BASE_DOMAIN_RESOURCE_GROUP} -n ${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN}
----
+
You can skip this step if you are using a public DNS zone that already exists.

. Create the private DNS zone in the same resource group as the rest of this
deployment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az network private-dns zone create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} -n ${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN}
----
