The following table provides an overview of ways that administrators can manage their Ingress traffic:

|Method |Description

|Ingress
|Ingress accept external requests and proxy them based on the route. An Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that provides some of the same features as routes (which is an {product-title} resource). You can only allow certain types of traffic: HTTP, HTTPS and server name identification (SNI), and TLS with SNI. In {product-title}, routes are generated to meet the conditions specified by the Ingress object.

|Route
|Routes provide Ingress traffic to services in the cluster. The concept of Routes in {product-title}  serve a similar purpose as Kubernetes Ingress objects and provide more features. Routes provide advanced features that may not be supported by Kubernetes Ingress Controllers through a standard interface, such as TLS re-encryption, TLS passthrough, and split traffic for blue-green deployments.

|External load balancer
|This resource instructs {product-title} to create a load balancer in a cloud environment.

|Service external IP
|This method instructs {product-title} to set NAT rules to redirect traffic from one of the cluster IPs to the container.

|Node Port
|With this method, {product-title} exposes a service on a static port on the node IP address. You must ensure that the external IP addresses are properly routed to the nodes.
