= Cleaning all data and keeping the container images

You can retain the {microshift-short} container images while cleaning all data by running the `microshift-cleanup-data` script with the `--all` and `--keep-images` arguments.

Keeping the container images helps speed up {microshift-short} restart after data clean up because the necessary container images are already present locally when you start the service.

When you run the script with the `--all` and `--keep-images` arguments, you perform the following clean up actions:

* Stop and disable all {microshift-short} services
* Delete all {microshift-short} pods
* Reset network configuration
* Delete the `/var/lib/microshift` data directory
* Delete OVN-K networking configuration

[WARNING]
====
This option deletes all {microshift-short} data and user workloads. Use with caution.
====

.Prerequisites
* You are logged into {microshift-short} as an administrator with root-user access.
* You have filed a support case.

.Procedure
