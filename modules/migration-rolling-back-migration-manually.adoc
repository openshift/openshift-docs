= Rolling back a migration manually

You can roll back a failed migration manually by deleting the `stage` pods and unquiescing the application.

If you run the same migration plan successfully, the resources from the failed migration are deleted automatically.

[NOTE]
====
The following resources remain in the migrated namespaces after a failed direct volume migration (DVM):

* Config maps (source and destination clusters)
* `Secret` objects (source and destination clusters)
* `Rsync` CRs (source cluster)

These resources do not affect rollback. You can delete them manually.

.Procedure

. Delete the `stage` pods on all clusters:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete $(oc get pods -l migration.openshift.io/is-stage-pod -n <namespace>) <1>
----
<1> Namespaces specified in the `MigPlan` CR.

. Unquiesce the application on the source cluster by scaling the replicas to their premigration number:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deployment <deployment> --replicas=<premigration_replicas>
----
+
The `migration.openshift.io/preQuiesceReplicas` annotation in the `Deployment` CR displays the premigration number of replicas:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: "1"
    migration.openshift.io/preQuiesceReplicas: "1"
----

. Verify that the application pods are running on the source cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -n <namespace>
----
