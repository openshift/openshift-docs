= About network policy

In {product-title} {product-version}, `NetworkPolicy` is the default mode for
the OpenShift SDN plug-in for the Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI).

[NOTE]
====
The Kubernetes `v1` NetworkPolicy features are available in {product-title}
except for egress policy types and IPBlock.
====

In a cluster using `NetworkPolicy`, network isolation is controlled entirely by
`NetworkPolicy` objects. By default, all Pods in a project are accessible from
other Pods and network endpoints. To isolate one or more Pods in a project, you
can create `NetworkPolicy` objects in that project to indicate the allowed
incoming connections. Project administrators can create and delete
`NetworkPolicy` objects within their own project.

If a Pod is matched by selectors in one or more `NetworkPolicy` objects, then
the Pod will accept only connections that are allowed by at least one of those
`NetworkPolicy` objects. A Pod that is not selected by any `NetworkPolicy`
objects is fully accessible.

The following example `NetworkPolicy` objects demonstrate supporting different
scenarios:

* Deny all traffic:
+
To make a project deny by default, add a `NetworkPolicy` object that matches all
Pods but accepts no traffic:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-by-default
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress: []
----

* Only allow connections from the {product-title} Ingress router:
+
* To make a project allow only connections from the {product-title} Ingress
router, add the following `NetworkPolicy` object: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
----
* Only accept connections from Pods within a project:
+
To make Pods accept connections from other Pods in the same project, but reject
all other connections from Pods in other projects, add the following
`NetworkPolicy` object: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-same-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
----

* Only allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic based on Pod labels:
+
To enable only HTTP and HTTPS access to the Pods with a specific label
(`role=frontend` in following example), add a `NetworkPolicy` object similar to:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-http-and-https
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: frontend
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
----

`NetworkPolicy` objects are additive, which means you can combine multiple
`NetworkPolicy` objects together to satisfy complex network requirements.

For example, for the `NetworkPolicy` objects defined in previous samples, you
can define both `allow-same-namespace` and `allow-http-and-https` policies
within the same project. Thus allowing the Pods with the label `role=frontend`,
to accept any connection allowed by each policy. That is, connections on any
port from Pods in the same namespace, and connections on ports `80` and
`443` from Pods in any namespace.
