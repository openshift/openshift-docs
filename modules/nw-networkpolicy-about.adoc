= About network policy

In a cluster using a network plugin that supports Kubernetes network policy, network isolation is controlled entirely by `NetworkPolicy` objects.
In {product-title} {product-version}, OpenShift SDN supports using network policy in its default network isolation mode.

[WARNING]
====
Network policy does not apply to the host network namespace. Pods with host networking enabled are unaffected by network policy rules. However, pods connecting to the host-networked pods might be affected by the network policy rules.

Network policies cannot block traffic from localhost or from their resident nodes.
====

By default, all pods in a project are accessible from other pods and network endpoints. To isolate one or more pods in a project, you can create `NetworkPolicy` objects in that project to indicate the allowed incoming connections. Project administrators can create and delete `NetworkPolicy` objects within their own project.

If a pod is matched by selectors in one or more `NetworkPolicy` objects, then the pod will accept only connections that are allowed by at least one of those `NetworkPolicy` objects. A pod that is not selected by any `NetworkPolicy` objects is fully accessible.

A network policy applies to only the TCP, UDP, ICMP, and SCTP protocols. Other protocols are not affected.

The following example `NetworkPolicy` objects demonstrate supporting different scenarios:

* Deny all traffic:
+
To make a project deny by default, add a `NetworkPolicy` object that matches all pods but accepts no traffic:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-by-default
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress: []
----

* Only allow connections from the {product-title} Ingress Controller:
+
To make a project allow only connections from the {product-title} Ingress Controller, add the following `NetworkPolicy` object.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
----

* Only accept connections from pods within a project:
+
To make pods accept connections from other pods in the same project, but reject all other connections from pods in other projects, add the following `NetworkPolicy` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-same-namespace
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
----

* Only allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic based on pod labels:
+
To enable only HTTP and HTTPS access to the pods with a specific label (`role=frontend` in following example), add a `NetworkPolicy` object similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-http-and-https
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: frontend
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
----

* Accept connections by using both namespace and pod selectors:
+
To match network traffic by combining namespace and pod selectors, you can use a `NetworkPolicy` object similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-pod-and-namespace-both
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      name: test-pods
  ingress:
    - from:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            project: project_name
        podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            name: test-pods
----

`NetworkPolicy` objects are additive, which means you can combine multiple `NetworkPolicy` objects together to satisfy complex network requirements.

For example, for the `NetworkPolicy` objects defined in previous samples, you can define both `allow-same-namespace` and `allow-http-and-https` policies within the same project. Thus allowing the pods with the label `role=frontend`, to accept any connection allowed by each policy. That is, connections on any port from pods in the same namespace, and connections on ports `80` and `443` from pods in any namespace.

[id="nw-networkpolicy-allow-from-router_{context}"]
== Using the allow-from-router network policy

Use the following `NetworkPolicy` to allow external traffic regardless of the router configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-router
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          policy-group.network.openshift.io/ingress: ""<1>
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
----
<1> `policy-group.network.openshift.io/ingress:""` label supports both OpenShift-SDN and OVN-Kubernetes.


[id="nw-networkpolicy-allow-from-hostnetwork_{context}"]
== Using the allow-from-hostnetwork network policy

Add the following `allow-from-hostnetwork` `NetworkPolicy` object to direct traffic from the host network pods:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-hostnetwork
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          policy-group.network.openshift.io/host-network: ""
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
