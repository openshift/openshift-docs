= About network policy

In a cluster using a Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in that supports Kubernetes network policy, network isolation is controlled entirely by NetworkPolicy Custom Resource (CR) objects.
In {product-title} {product-version}, OpenShift SDN supports using NetworkPolicy in its default network isolation mode.

[NOTE]
====
IPBlock is supported in NetworkPolicy with limitations for OpenShift SDN; it
supports IPBlock without except clauses. If you create a policy with an IPBlock
section including an except clause, the SDN pods log generates warnings and the
entire IPBlock section of that policy is ignored.
====

[WARNING]
====
Network policy does not apply to the host network namespace. Pods with host networking enabled are unaffected by NetworkPolicy object rules.
====

By default, all pods in a project are accessible from other pods and network
endpoints. To isolate one or more pods in a project, you can create
NetworkPolicy objects in that project to indicate the allowed incoming
connections. Project administrators can create and delete NetworkPolicy objects
within their own project.

If a pod is matched by selectors in one or more NetworkPolicy objects, then the
pod will accept only connections that are allowed by at least one of those
NetworkPolicy objects. A pod that is not selected by any NetworkPolicy objects
is fully accessible.

The following example NetworkPolicy objects demonstrate supporting different
scenarios:

* Deny all traffic:
+
To make a project deny by default, add a NetworkPolicy object that matches all
pods but accepts no traffic:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-by-default
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress: []
----

* Only allow connections from the {product-title} Ingress Controller:
+
To make a project allow only connections from the {product-title} Ingress
Controller, add the following NetworkPolicy object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
----

+
If the Ingress Controller is configured with `endpointPublishingStrategy: HostNetwork`, then the Ingress Controller pod runs on the host network.
When running on the host network, the traffic from the Ingress Controller is assigned the `netid:0` Virtual Network ID (VNID).
The `netid` for the namespace that is associated with the Ingress Operator is different, so the `matchLabel` in the `allow-from-openshift-ingress` network policy does not match traffic from the `default` Ingress Controller.
Because the `default` namespace is assigned the `netid:0` VNID, you can allow traffic from the `default` Ingress Controller by labeling your `default` namespace with `network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress`.

* Only accept connections from pods within a project:
+
To make pods accept connections from other pods in the same project, but reject
all other connections from pods in other projects, add the following
NetworkPolicy object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-same-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
----

* Only allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic based on pod labels:
+
To enable only HTTP and HTTPS access to the pods with a specific label
(`role=frontend` in following example), add a NetworkPolicy object similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-http-and-https
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: frontend
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
----

* Accept connections by using both namespace and pod selectors:
+
To match network traffic by combining namespace and pod selectors, you can use a NetworkPolicy object similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-pod-and-namespace-both
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      name: test-pods
  ingress:
    - from:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            project: project_name
        podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            name: test-pods
----


NetworkPolicy objects are additive, which means you can combine multiple
NetworkPolicy objects together to satisfy complex network requirements.

For example, for the NetworkPolicy objects defined in previous samples, you
can define both `allow-same-namespace` and `allow-http-and-https` policies
within the same project. Thus allowing the pods with the label `role=frontend`,
to accept any connection allowed by each policy. That is, connections on any
port from pods in the same namespace, and connections on ports `80` and
`443` from pods in any namespace.
