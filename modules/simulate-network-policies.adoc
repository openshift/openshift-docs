= Simulating network policies

[role="_abstract"]
Your current network policies might allow unneeded network communications.
To simulate the effects of a new set of network policies, use the network policy simulator.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, select *Network Graph* from the left-hand navigation menu.
. On the *Network Graph* view header, select *Network Policy Simulator*.
. Select *Upload and simulate network policy YAML* and upload your proposed YAML file.
The network graph view displays what your proposed network policies would achieve.
. To share your proposed policies with your team, select *Share YAML*.
To apply your policy directly, select *Apply Network Policies*.

[WARNING]
====
Directly applying network policies might cause problems for running applications.
Always download and test the network policies in a development environment or test clusters before applying them to production workloads.
