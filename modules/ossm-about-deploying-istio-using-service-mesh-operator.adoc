= About deploying Istio using the {SMProductName} Operator

To deploy {istio} using the {SMProductName} Operator, you must create an `{istio}` resource. Then, the Operator creates an `IstioRevision` resource, which represents one revision of the {istio} control plane. Based on the `IstioRevision` resource, the Operator deploys the {istio} control plane, which includes the `istiod` `Deployment` resource and other resources.

The {SMProductName} Operator may create additional instances of the `IstioRevision` resource, depending on the update strategy defined in the `{istio}` resource.
