= LVMS system requirements

Using LVMS in {product-title} requires the following system specifications.

[id="lvms-volume-group-name_{context}"]
== Volume group name

The default integration of LVMS selects the default volume group (VG) dynamically. If there are no volume groups on the {product-title} host, LVMS is disabled.

If there is only one VG on the {product-title} host, that VG is used. If there are multiple volume groups, the group `microshift` is used. If the `microshift` group is not found, LVMS is disabled.

If you want to use a specific VG, LVMS must be configured to select that VG. You can change the default name of the VG in the configuration file. For details, read the "Configuring the LVMS" section of this document.

You can change the default name of the VG in the configuration file. For details, read the "Configuring the LVMS" section of this document.

Prior to launching, the `lvmd.yaml` configuration file must specify an existing VG on the node with sufficient capacity for workload storage. If the VG does not exist, the node controller fails to start and enters a `CrashLoopBackoff` state.

[id="lvms-volume-size-increments_{context}"]
== Volume size increments

The LVMS provisions storage in increments of 1 gigabyte (GB). Storage requests are rounded up to the nearest GB. When the capacity of a VG is less than 1 GB, the `PersistentVolumeClaim` registers a `ProvisioningFailed` event, for example:
