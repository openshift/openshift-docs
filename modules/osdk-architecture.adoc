= Architecture of the Operator SDK

The link:https://coreos.com/operators/[Operator Framework] is an open source toolkit to manage Kubernetes native applications, called _Operators_, in an effective, automated, and scalable way. Operators take advantage of Kubernetes extensibility to deliver the automation advantages of cloud services like provisioning, scaling, and backup and restore, while being able to run anywhere that Kubernetes can run.

Operators make it easy to manage complex, stateful applications on top of Kubernetes. However, writing an Operator today can be difficult because of challenges such as using low-level APIs, writing boilerplate, and a lack of modularity, which leads to duplication.

The Operator SDK is a framework designed to make writing Operators easier by providing:

- High-level APIs and abstractions to write the operational logic more intuitively
- Tools for scaffolding and code generation to quickly bootstrap a new project
- Extensions to cover common Operator use cases

== Workflow

The Operator SDK provides the following workflow to develop a new Operator:

. Create a new Operator project using the Operator SDK command line interface (CLI).
. Define new resource APIs by adding custom resource definitions (CRDs).
. Specify resources to watch using the Operator SDK API.
. Define the Operator reconciling logic in a designated handler and use the Operator SDK API to interact with resources.
. Use the Operator SDK CLI to build and generate the Operator deployment manifests.

At a high level, an Operator using the Operator SDK processes events for watched resources in an Operator author-defined handler and takes actions to reconcile the state of the application.

== Manager file

The main program for the Operator is the manager file at `cmd/manager/main.go`. The manager automatically registers the scheme for all custom resources (CRs) defined under `pkg/apis/` and runs all controllers under `pkg/controller/`.

The manager can restrict the namespace that all controllers watch for resources:

[source,go]
----
mgr, err := manager.New(cfg, manager.Options{Namespace: namespace})
----

By default, this is the namespace that the Operator is running in. To watch all
namespaces, you can leave the namespace option empty:

[source,go]
----
mgr, err := manager.New(cfg, manager.Options{Namespace: ""})
----
