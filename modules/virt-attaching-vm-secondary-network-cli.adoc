[id="virt-attaching-vm-additional-network-cli_{context}"]
= Attaching a virtual machine to an additional network in the CLI

Attach a virtual machine to an additional network by adding a bridge interface and specifying a network attachment definition in the virtual machine configuration.

This procedure uses a YAML file to demonstrate editing the configuration and applying the updated file to the cluster. You can alternatively use the `oc edit <object> <name>` command to edit an existing virtual machine.

.Prerequisites

* Shut down the virtual machine before editing the configuration. If you edit a running virtual machine, you must restart the virtual machine for the changes to take effect.

.Procedure

. Create or edit a configuration of a virtual machine that you want to connect to the bridge network.
. Add the bridge interface to the `spec.template.spec.domain.devices.interfaces` list and the network attachment definition to the `spec.template.spec.networks` list. This example adds a bridge interface called `bridge-net` that connects to the `a-bridge-network` network attachment definition:

        - name: <default>
          pod: {}

          multus:
            networkName: <network-namespace>/<a-bridge-network> <3>
...
----
<1> The name of the bridge interface.
<2> The name of the network. This value must match the `name` value of the corresponding `spec.template.spec.domain.devices.interfaces` entry.
<3> The name of the network attachment definition, prefixed by the namespace where it exists. The namespace must be either the `default` namespace or the same namespace where the VM is to be created. In this case, `multus` is used. Multus is a cloud network interface (CNI) plugin that allows multiple CNIs to exist so that a pod or virtual machine can use the interfaces it needs.

. Apply the configuration:

$ oc apply -f <example-vm.yaml>

. Optional: If you edited a running virtual machine, you must restart it for the changes to take effect.
