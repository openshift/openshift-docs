= About multicast

[role="_abstract"]
With IP multicast, data is broadcast to many IP addresses simultaneously.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* At this time, multicast is best used for low-bandwidth coordination or service discovery and not a high-bandwidth solution.
* By default, network policies affect all connections in a namespace. However, multicast is unaffected by network policies. If multicast is enabled in the same namespace as your network policies, it is always allowed, even if there is a `deny-all` network policy.
* Cluster administrators must consider the implications of the exemption of multicast from network policies before enabling it.
====

Multicast traffic between {product-title} pods is disabled by default. If you are using the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, you can enable multicast on a per-project basis.
