[id="nw-about-multicast_{context}"]
= About multicast

With IP multicast, data is broadcast to many IP addresses simultaneously.

[IMPORTANT]
====
At this time, multicast is best used for low-bandwidth coordination or service
discovery and not a high-bandwidth solution.
====

Multicast traffic between {product-title} pods is disabled by default. If you are using the {sdn} default Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider, you can enable multicast on a per-project basis.

ifdef::openshift-sdn[]
When using the OpenShift SDN network plug-in in `networkpolicy` isolation mode:

* Multicast packets sent by a pod will be delivered to all other pods in the
project, regardless of NetworkPolicy objects. Pods might be able to communicate
over multicast even when they cannot communicate over unicast.
* Multicast packets sent by a pod in one project will never be delivered to pods
in any other project, even if there are NetworkPolicy objects that allow
communication between the projects.

When using the OpenShift SDN network plug-in in `multitenant` isolation mode:

* Multicast packets sent by a pod will be delivered to all other pods in the
project.
* Multicast packets sent by a pod in one project will be delivered to pods in
other projects only if each project is joined together and multicast is enabled
in each joined project.
