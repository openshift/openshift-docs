= Authentication enabled Red Hat registry

All container images available through the Red Hat Container Catalog are hosted
on an image registry, `registry.redhat.io`.

The registry, `registry.redhat.io`, requires authentication for access to
images and hosted content on {product-title}. Following the move to the new
registry, the existing registry will be available for a period of time.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} pulls images from `registry.redhat.io`, so you must configure
your cluster to use it.
====

The new registry uses standard OAuth mechanisms for authentication,
with the following methods:

* *Authentication token.*  Tokens, which are generated by administrators,
are service accounts that give systems the ability to authenticate against the
container image registry.
Service accounts are not affected by changes in user accounts, so the token
authentication method is reliable and resilient. This is the only supported
authentication option for production clusters.
* *Web username and password.* This is the standard set of credentials you use
to log in to resources such as `access.redhat.com`.
While it is possible to use this authentication method with {product-title}, it
is not supported for production deployments. Restrict this authentication method
to stand-alone projects outside {product-title}.

You can use `podman login` with your credentials, either username and password
or authentication token, to access content on the new registry.

All imagestreams point to the new registry, which uses the installation pull secret to authenticate.

You must place your credentials in either of the following places:

* *`openshift` namespace*. Your credentials must exist in the OpenShift
namespace so that the imagestreams in the `openshift` namespace can import.
* *Your host*. Your credentials must exist on your host because Kubernetes
uses the credentials from your host when it goes to pull images.
