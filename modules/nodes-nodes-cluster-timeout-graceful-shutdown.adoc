= About graceful node shutdown

During a graceful node shutdown, the kubelet sends a termination signal to pods running on the node and postpones the node shutdown until all the pods evicted. If a node unexpectedly shuts down, the graceful node shutdown feature minimizes interruption to workloads running on these pods. 

During a graceful node shutdown, the kubelet stops pods in two phases:

* Regular pod termination
* Critical pod termination

You can define shutdown grace periods for regular and critical pods by configuring the following specifications in the `KubeletConfig` custom resource:

* `shutdownGracePeriod`: Specifies the total duration for pod termination for regular and critical pods.
* `shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods`: Specifies the duration for critical pod termination. This value must be less than the `shutdownGracePeriod` value.

For example, if the `shutdownGracePeriod` value is `30s`, and the `shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods` value is `10s`, the kubelet delays the node shutdown by 30 seconds. During the shutdown, the first 20 (30-10) seconds are reserved for gracefully shutting down regular pods, and the last 10 seconds are reserved for gracefully shutting down critical pods. 

To define a critical pod, assign a pod priority value greater than or equal to `2000000000`. To define a regular pod, assign a pod priority value of less than `2000000000`. 

For more information about how to define a priority value for pods, see the _Additional resources_ section.
