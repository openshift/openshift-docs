[id="policy-enforcement-hard_{context}"]
= Hard enforcement

Hard enforcement is performed by the {product-title-short} admission controller. In clusters with admission controller enforcement, the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server blocks all noncompliant deployments. The admission controller blocks `CREATE` and `UPDATE` operations. Any pod create or update request that satisfies a policy configured with deploy-time enforcement enabled will fail.

[NOTE]
====
Kubernetes admission webhooks support only `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `CONNECT` operations. The {product-title-short} admission controller supports only `CREATE` and `UPDATE` operations. Operations such as `kubectl patch`, `kubectl set`, and `kubectl scale` are PATCH operations, not UPDATE operations. Because PATCH operations are not supported in Kubernetes, {product-title-short} cannot perform enforcement on PATCH operations.
====

For blocking enforcement, you must enable the following settings for the cluster in {product-title-short}:

* *Enforce on Object Creates*: This toggle in the *Dynamic Configuration* section controls the behavior of the admission control service.
You must have the *Configure Admission Controller Webhook to listen on Object Creates* toggle in the *Static Configuration* section turned on for this to work.
* *Enforce on Object Updates*: This toggle in the *Dynamic Configuration* section controls the behavior of the admission control service.
You must have the *Configure Admission Controller Webhook to listen on Object Updates* toggle in the *Static Configuration* section turned on for this to work.

If you make changes to settings in the *Static Configuration* setting, you must redeploy the secured cluster for those changes to take effect.
