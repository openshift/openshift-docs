= Hard enforcement

[role="_abstract"]
Hard enforcement is performed by the {product-title-short} admission controller. In clusters with admission controller enforcement, the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server blocks all noncompliant deployments. The admission controller blocks `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, and `SCALE` operations. Any pod create, update, or scale request that satisfies a policy configured with deploy-time enforcement enabled will fail. The admission controller also blocks user-initiated container commands such as `pod exec` and `port forward` for policies configured with runtime enforcement.

[NOTE]
====
Kubernetes admission webhooks support only `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `CONNECT` operations. The {product-title-short} admission controller supports only `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, and `SCALE` operations. Operations such as `kubectl patch`, `kubectl set`, and `kubectl scale` are `PATCH` operations, not `UPDATE` operations. Because `PATCH` operations are not supported in Kubernetes, {product-title-short} cannot perform enforcement on PATCH operations. However, enforcement against `SCALE` operations is supported.
====

For hard enforcement, enable the enforcement settings for the cluster in {product-title-short}. To verify that enforcement is enabled, in the *Dynamic configuration* section, in the *Admission controller enforcement behavior* field, ensure that *Enforce policies* is selected. Additionally, for each policy that you want to enforce, select *Inform and enforce* when configuring the policy.
