= Pausing the machine config pools

In this canary rollout update process, after you label the nodes that you do not want to update with the rest of your {product-title} cluster and create the machine config pools (MCPs), you pause those MCPs. Pausing an MCP prevents the Machine Config Operator (MCO) from updating the nodes associated with that MCP.

[NOTE]
====
Pausing the MCP also pauses the kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-signer automatic CA certificates rotation. New CA certificates are generated at 292 days from the installation date and old certificates are removed 365 days from the installation date. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5651701[Understand CA cert auto renewal in Red Hat OpenShift 4] to find out how much time you have before the next automatic CA certificate rotation. Make sure the pools are unpaused when the CA cert rotation happens. If the MCPs are paused, the cert rotation does not happen, which causes the cluster to become degraded and causes failure in multiple `oc` commands, including but not limited to `oc debug`, `oc logs`, `oc exec`, and `oc attach`.

To pause an MCP:

. Patch the MCP that you want paused:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch mcp/<mcp_name> --patch '{"spec":{"paused":true}}' --type=merge
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc patch mcp/workerpool-canary --patch '{"spec":{"paused":true}}' --type=merge
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
machineconfigpool.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/workerpool-canary patched
