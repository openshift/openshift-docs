= Release notes for {gitops-title} 1.17.3

{gitops-title} 1.17.3 is now available on {OCP} 4.12, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17, 4.18, and 4.19.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After completing the upgrade, run the `audit-operator-roles.sh` audit script to review namespace-scoped access created by the {gitops-title} Operator. The script identifies `Role` and `RoleBinding` objects that grant cross-namespace access when the _Applications in any namespace_ feature or _ApplicationSets in any namespace_ feature is enabled using the Argo CD custom resource (CR) (`.spec.sourceNamespaces` and `.spec.applicationSet.sourceNamespaces`). These features are disabled by default. The script scans all namespaces and reports `Role`/`RoleBinding` combinations that meet the following conditions:

* Grant access to the `argoproj.io/Application` resource
* Are labeled with `app.kubernetes.io/part-of=argocd`
* Bind to a service account in a different namespace, resulting in cross-namespace access

Review the script output to ensure that cross-namespace access is limited to the intended namespaces only.

For more information about the script, see link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/gitops-operator/blob/master/scripts/audit-namespace-roles/audit-operator-roles.sh[Audit Operator script].

For more information about the steps to execute the script, see link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/gitops-operator/blob/master/scripts/audit-namespace-roles/README.md[Audit Operator script readme].

[id="fixed-issues-1-17-3_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

GitOps Operator pulls images from `registry.redhat.io`::
Before this update, when the `.spec.version` field was set in the Argo CD CR, the {gitops-title} Operator incorrectly pulled upstream images from `quay.io`. With this update, this issue is fixed. The {gitops-title} Operator pulls images from `registry.redhat.io` and only uses certified images from the Red Hat registry.
+

Revised rolling update strategy for `HAProxy` deployment::
Before this update, the `openshift-gitops-redis-ha-haproxy` deployment failed to upgrade on a three-worker node cluster due to a combination of pod anti-affinity rules and the update strategy. With this update, the {gitops-title} Operator revises the rolling update strategy to fix the issue.

Added ingress permissions for successful reconciliation::
Before this update, the {gitops-title} Operator failed to reconcile when `.spec.applicationSet.webhookServer.route.enabled` was set to `true` in the Argo CD CR. This issue occurred because the {gitops-title} Operator lacked the required ingress permissions for `config.openshift.io`. With this update, the {gitops-title} Operator includes the necessary permissions and reconciles successfully.
+

Improved Redis HA startup reliability::
Before this update, in the Redis high availability (HA) mode, the Redis config `init` container could hang for several minutes while detecting the master container, causing Redis pods to take a long time to reach the `Ready` status. With this update, the master container detection logic includes a connection timeout, which prevents the `init` container from blocking and ensures a faster, more reliable Redis HA startup.
