= Moving monitoring components to different nodes

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
To specify the nodes in your cluster on which monitoring stack components will run, configure the `nodeSelector` constraint in the component's `ConfigMap` object to match labels assigned to the nodes.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot add a node selector constraint directly to an existing scheduled pod.
====
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
You can move any of the components that monitor workloads for user-defined projects to specific worker nodes. It is not permitted to move components to control plane or infrastructure nodes.

.Prerequisites
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* *If you are configuring core {product-title} monitoring components*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* The `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object exists. This object is created by default when the cluster is created.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. If you have not done so yet, add a label to the nodes on which you want to run the monitoring components:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label nodes <node-name> <node-label>
----
. Edit the `ConfigMap` object:
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
** *To move a component that monitors core {product-title} projects*:

.. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

.. Specify the node labels for the `nodeSelector` constraint for the component under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: <1>
      nodeSelector:
        <node-label-1> <2>
        <node-label-2> <3>
        <...>
----
<1> Substitute `<component>` with the appropriate monitoring stack component name.
<2> Substitute `<node-label-1>` with the label you added to the node.
<3> Optional: Specify additional labels.
If you specify additional labels, the pods for the component are only scheduled on the nodes that contain all of the specified labels.
+
[NOTE]
====
If monitoring components remain in a `Pending` state after configuring the `nodeSelector` constraint, check the pod events for errors relating to taints and tolerations.

. Save the file to apply the changes.
The components specified in the new configuration are moved to the new nodes automatically.
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

[NOTE]
====
Configurations applied to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object are not activated unless a cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.

+
[WARNING]
====
When you save changes to a monitoring config map, the pods and other resources in the project might be redeployed.
The running monitoring processes in that project might also restart.
