== Installing {product-title-short} on Kubernetes platforms by using Helm charts

. Add the {product-title-short} Helm charts repository.
. Install the `central-services` Helm chart on the cluster that will contain Central, called the Central cluster.
. Log in to the {product-title-short} web console from the Central cluster and create an init bundle or cluster registration secret (CRS) that you need to apply to the cluster that you want to secure, called the secured cluster. The init bundle or the CRS contains the cryptographic artifacts that {product-title-short} uses to establish trusted connections between Central and secured clusters.

. For each secured cluster, install the `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart by running one of the following commands:
* For an init bundle, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ helm install -n stackrox \
  --create-namespace stackrox-secured-cluster-services rhacs/secured-cluster-services \
  -f <name_of_cluster_init_bundle.yaml> \

  -f <path_to_values_private.yaml> \// <2>
  --set imagePullSecrets.username=<username> \// <3>
  --set imagePullSecrets.password=<password> <4>
----
<1> Use the `-f` option to specify the paths for your public YAML configuration file.
<2> Use the `-f` option to specify the paths for your private YAML configuration file.
<3> Include the user name for your pull secret for Red{nbsp}Hat Container Registry authentication.
<4> Include the password for your pull secret for Red{nbsp}Hat Container Registry authentication.
* For a CRS, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ helm install -n stackrox \
  --create-namespace stackrox-secured-cluster-services rhacs/secured-cluster-services \
  --set-file crs.file=<crs_file_name.yaml> \ <1>

  -f <path_to_values_private.yaml> \// <3>
  --set imagePullSecrets.username=<username> \// <4>
  --set imagePullSecrets.password=<password> <5>
----
<1> Use the name of the file in which the generated CRS has been stored.
<2> Use the `-f` option to specify the paths for your public YAML configuration file.
<3> Use the `-f` option to specify the paths for your private YAML configuration file.
<4> Include the user name for your pull secret for Red{nbsp}Hat Container Registry authentication.
<5> Include the password for your pull secret for Red{nbsp}Hat Container Registry authentication.

== Installing {product-title-short} on Kubernetes platforms by using the `roxctl` CLI

This installation method is also called the _manifest installation method_.

. Install the `roxctl` CLI.
. On the Kubernetes cluster that will contain Central, perform these steps:
.. In the terminal window, run the interactive install command by using the `roxctl` CLI.
.. Run the setup shell script.
.. In the terminal window, create the Central resources by using the `kubectl create` command.
. Perform one of the following actions:
* In the {product-title-short} web console, create and download the sensor YAML file and keys.
* On the cluster that you want to secure, called the secured cluster, use the `roxctl sensor generate openshift` command.
. On the secured cluster, run the sensor installation script.
