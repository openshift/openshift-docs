= Annotations for automatically pruning task runs and pipeline runs 

To automatically prune the resources associated with task runs and pipeline runs in a namespace, you can set the following annotations in the namespace:

* `operator.tekton.dev/prune.schedule`: If the value of this annotation is different from the value specified in the `TektonConfig` custom resource definition, a new cron job in that namespace is created.

* `operator.tekton.dev/prune.skip`: When set to `true`, the namespace for which it is configured is not pruned.

* `operator.tekton.dev/prune.resources`: This annotation accepts a comma-separated list of resources. To prune a single resource such as a pipeline run, set this annotation to `"pipelinerun"`. To prune multiple resources, such as task run and pipeline run, set this annotation to `"taskrun, pipelinerun"`.

* `operator.tekton.dev/prune.keep`: Use this annotation to retain a resource without pruning.

* `operator.tekton.dev/prune.keep-since`: Use this annotation to retain resources based on their age. The value for this annotation must be equal to the age of the resource in minutes. For example, to retain resources which were created not more than five days ago, set `keep-since` to `7200`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `keep` and `keep-since` annotations are mutually exclusive. For any resource, you must configure only one of them.
====

* `operator.tekton.dev/prune.strategy`: Set the value of this annotation to either `keep` or `keep-since`.

For example, consider the following annotations that retain all task runs and pipeline runs created in the last five days, and deletes the older resources:
