= Installing OpenShift GitOps Operator in web console

.Prerequisites

* Access to the {product-title} web console.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} cluster as an administrator.

[WARNING]
====
If you have already installed the Community version of the Argo CD Operator, remove the Argo CD Community Operator before you install the {gitops-title} Operator.
====

.Procedure

. Open the *Administrator* perspective of the web console and navigate to *Operators* â†’ *OperatorHub* in the menu on the left.

. Search for `OpenShift GitOps`, click the *{gitops-title}* tile, and then click *Install*.
+
{gitops-title} will be installed in all namespaces of the cluster.

After the {gitops-title} Operator is installed, it automatically sets up a ready-to-use Argo CD instance that is available in the `openshift-gitops` namespace, and an Argo CD icon is displayed in the console toolbar.
You can create subsequent Argo CD instances for your applications under your projects.
