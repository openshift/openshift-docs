[id="ossm-multi-tenant-install-1x_{context}"]
= {ProductName} control plane

{ProductName} installs a multi-tenant control plane by default. You specify the projects that can access the {ProductShortName}, and isolate the {ProductShortName} from other control plane instances.

[id="ossm-mt-vs-clusterwide_{context}"]
= Multi-tenancy in {ProductName} versus cluster-wide installations

The main difference between a multi-tenant installation and a cluster-wide installation is the scope of privileges used by the control plane deployments, for example, Galley and Pilot. The components no longer use cluster-scoped Role Based Access Control (RBAC) resource `ClusterRoleBinding`, but rely on project-scoped `RoleBinding`.

Every project in the `members` list will have a `RoleBinding` for each service account associated with a control plane deployment and each control plane deployment will only watch those member projects. Each member project has a `maistra.io/member-of` label added to it, where the `member-of` value is the project containing the control plane installation.

{ProductName} configures each member project to ensure network access between itself, the control plane, and other member projects. The exact configuration differs depending on how OpenShift software-defined networking (SDN) is configured. See About OpenShift SDN for additional details.

If the {product-title} cluster is configured to use the SDN plug-in:

* *`NetworkPolicy`*: {ProductName} creates a `NetworkPolicy` resource in each member project allowing ingress to all pods from the other members and the control plane. If you remove a member from {ProductShortName}, this `NetworkPolicy` resource is deleted from the project.
+
[NOTE]
====
This also restricts ingress to only member projects. If ingress from non-member projects is required, you need to create a `NetworkPolicy` to allow that traffic through.
====

* *Multitenant*: {ProductName} joins the `NetNamespace` for each member project to the `NetNamespace` of the control plane project (the equivalent of running `oc adm pod-network join-projects --to control-plane-project member-project`). If you remove a member from the {ProductShortName}, its `NetNamespace` is isolated from the control plane (the equivalent of running `oc adm pod-network isolate-projects member-project`).

* *Subnet*: No additional configuration is performed.

[id="ossm-automatic-injection_{context}"]
= Automatic injection

The upstream Istio community installation automatically injects the sidecar into pods within the projects you have labeled.

{ProductName} does not automatically inject the sidecar to any pods, but requires you to specify the `sidecar.istio.io/inject` annotation as illustrated in the Automatic sidecar injection section.

[id="ossm-rbac_{context}"]
= Istio Role Based Access Control features

Istio Role Based Access Control (RBAC) provides a mechanism you can use to control access to a service. You can identify subjects by user name or by specifying a set of properties and apply access controls accordingly.

The upstream Istio community installation includes options to perform exact header matches, match wildcards in headers, or check for a header containing a specific prefix or suffix.

{ProductName} extends the ability to match request headers by using a regular expression. Specify a property key of `request.regex.headers` with a regular expression.

[id="ossm-openssl_{context}"]
= OpenSSL

{ProductName} replaces BoringSSL with OpenSSL. OpenSSL is a software library that contains an open source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. The {ProductName} Proxy binary dynamically links the OpenSSL libraries (libssl and libcrypto) from the underlying Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system.


[id="ossm-cni_{context}"]
= The Istio Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in

{ProductName} includes CNI plug-in, which provides you with an alternate way to configure application pod networking. The CNI plug-in replaces the `init-container` network configuration eliminating the need to grant service accounts and projects access to Security Context Constraints (SCCs) with elevated privileges.

The Istio CNI plugin is enabled through Multus CNI. The Istio operator creates a
`NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object in each project that is part of the mesh.
This object is referenced in the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks` annotation, which
is added to a pod during injection.

== Using Istio CNI with other Multus CNI plugins

By default, if a pod contains an existing `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks` annotation, such as when using Multus CNI to add a macvlan network to the pod, the value of the annotation is overwritten. To preserve the value and instead append Istio CNI to the end, the field `spec.istio.sidecarInjectorWebhook.injectPodRedirectAnnot` must be set to `true` in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` object as shown in the following example.

The link:https://intel.github.io/multus-cni/doc/how-to-use.html#lauch-pod-with-json-annotation[JSON form] support was
introduced in {ProductName} version 1.1.5. In previous {ProductName} versions, only the link:https://intel.github.io/multus-cni/doc/how-to-use.html#lauch-pod-with-text-annotation-with-interface-name[text form]
of the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks` annotation was supported.

= Envoy, Secret Discovery Service, and Certificates

* {ProductName} does not support QUIC-based services.
* Deployment of TLS certificates using the Secret Discovery Service (SDS) functionality of Istio is not currently supported in {ProductName}. The Istio implementation depends on a node agent container that uses hostPath mounts.
