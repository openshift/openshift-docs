= Configuring Confidential VM by using machine sets

By editing the machine set YAML file, you can configure the Confidential VM options that a machine set uses for machines that it deploys.

For more information about Confidential VM features, functions, and compatibility, see the GCP Compute Engine documentation about link:https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing/confidential-vm/docs/about-cvm#confidential-vm[Confidential VM].

[NOTE]
====
Confidential VMs are currently not supported on 64-bit ARM architectures.
====
[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} {product-version} does not support some Confidential Compute features, such as Confidential VMs with AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP).

.Procedure

. In a text editor, open the YAML file for an existing machine set or create a new one.

. Edit the following section under the `providerSpec` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ifndef::cpmso[]
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
endif::cpmso[]
ifdef::cpmso[]
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1
kind: ControlPlaneMachineSet
endif::cpmso[]
...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      providerSpec:
        value:
          confidentialCompute: Enabled <1>
          onHostMaintenance: Terminate <2>
          machineType: n2d-standard-8 <3>
...
----
<1> Specify whether Confidential VM is enabled. Valid values are `Disabled` or `Enabled`.
<2> Specify the behavior of the VM during a host maintenance event, such as a hardware or software update. For a machine that uses Confidential VM, this value must be set to `Terminate`, which stops the VM. Confidential VM does not support live VM migration.
<3> Specify a machine type that supports Confidential VM. Confidential VM supports the N2D and C2D series of machine types.

.Verification

* On the Google Cloud console, review the details for a machine deployed by the machine set and verify that the Confidential VM options match the values that you configured.
