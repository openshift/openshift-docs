= Role-based access control

The release deployment YAML file includes two cluster-wide roles for using {builds-shortname} objects. The following roles are installed by default:

* `shpwright-build-aggregate-view`: Grants you read access to the {builds-shortname} resources, such as `BuildStrategy`, `ClusterBuildStrategy`, `Build`, and `BuildRun`. This role is aggregated to the Kubernetes `view` role.
* `shipwright-build-aggregate-edit`: Grants you write access to the {builds-shortname} resources that are configured at namespace level. The build resources include `BuildStrategy`, `Build`, and `BuildRun`. Read access is granted to all `ClusterBuildStrategy` resources. This role is aggregated to the Kubernetes `edit` and `admin` roles.

Only cluster administrators have write access to the `ClusterBuildStrategy` resources. You can change this setting by creating a separate Kubernetes `ClusterRole` role with these permissions and binding the role to appropriate users.
