= Overview

Kubernetes secrets are stored with Base64 encoding. etcd provides encryption at rest for these secrets, but when secrets are retrieved, they are decrypted and presented to the user. If role-based access control is not configured properly on your cluster, anyone with API or etcd access can retrieve or modify a secret. Additionally, anyone who is authorized to create a pod in a namespace can use that access to read any secret in that namespace. 

For secure storage and management of your secrets, the {product-title} Secrets Store Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator allows you to mount secrets from an external secret management system, such as Azure Key Vault using a provider plugin. Applications can use the secret, but the secret does not persist on the system after the application pod is destroyed.

The Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator, `secrets-store.csi.k8s.io`, allows {product-title} to mount multiple secrets, keys, and certificates stored in enterprise-grade external secrets stores into pods as a volume. The Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator communicates with the provider using gRPC to fetch the mount contents from the specified external secrets store. After the volume is attached, the data in it is mounted into the container's file system. Secrets store volumes are mounted in-line.
