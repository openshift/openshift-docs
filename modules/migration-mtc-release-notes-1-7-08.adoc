== Resolved issues

This release has the following major resolved issues:

.Velero image cannot be overridden in the MTC operator
In previous releases, it was not possible to override the velero image using the `velero_image_fqin` parameter in the `MigrationController` Custom Resource (CR). (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2143389[*BZ#2143389*])

.Adding a MigCluster from the UI fails when the domain name has more than six characters
In previous releases, adding a MigCluster from the UI failed when the domain name had more than six characters. The UI code expected a domain name of between two and six characters. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2152149[*BZ#2152149*])

.UI fails to render the Migrations' page: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
In previous releases, the UI failed to render the Migrations' page, returning `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2163485[*BZ#2163485*])

.Creating DPA resource fails on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.6 clusters
In previous releases, when deploying MTC on an {OCP} 4.6 cluster, the DPA failed to be created according to the logs, which resulted in some pods missing. From the logs in the migration-controller in the OCP 4.6 cluster, it indicated that an unexpected `null` value was passed, which caused the error. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2173742[*BZ#2173742*])
