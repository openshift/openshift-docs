= Identifying Ignition configs

[role="_abstract"]
To manually install {op-system}, identify the distinct Ignition configuration types and their specific deployment purposes. By understanding these configurations, you can provide the correct provisioning instructions for your infrastructure requirements.

When manually installing {op-system}, you can provide the following two types of Ignition configs:

* **Permanent install Ignition config**: Every manual {op-system} installation needs to pass one of the Ignition config files generated by `openshift-installer`, such as `bootstrap.ign`, `master.ign` and `worker.ign`, to carry out the installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not modify these Ignition config files directly. You can update the manifest files that are wrapped into the Ignition config files, as outlined in examples in the preceding sections.
====

For PXE installations, you can pass the Ignition configs on the `APPEND` line using the `coreos.inst.ignition_url=` option. For ISO installations, after the ISO boots to the shell prompt, you must identify the Ignition config on the `coreos-installer` command line with the `--ignition-url=` option. In both cases, only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.

* **Live install Ignition config**: This type can be created by using the `coreos-installer` `customize` subcommand of `coreos-installer` and its various options. With this method, the Ignition config passes to the live install medium, runs immediately upon booting, and performs setup tasks before or after the {op-system} system installs to disk. This method must be only used for performing tasks that must be done once and not applied again later, such as with advanced partitioning that cannot be done using a machine config.

For PXE or ISO boots, you can create the Ignition config and `APPEND` the `ignition.config.url=` option to identify the location of the Ignition config. You also need to append `ignition.firstboot ignition.platform.id=metal` else the `ignition.config.url` option is ignored.
