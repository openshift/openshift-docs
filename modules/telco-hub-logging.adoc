= Logging

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
Use the Cluster Logging Operator to collect and ship logs off the node for remote archival and analysis.
The reference configuration uses Kafka to ship audit and infrastructure logs to a remote archive.

Limits and requirements::
* The reference configuration does not include local log storage.
* The reference configuration does not include aggregation of managed cluster logs at the hub cluster.

Engineering considerations::
* The impact of cluster CPU use is based on the number or size of logs generated and the amount of log filtering configured.
* The reference configuration does not include shipping of application logs.
The inclusion of application logs in the configuration requires you to evaluate the application logging rate and have sufficient additional CPU resources allocated to the reserved set.
