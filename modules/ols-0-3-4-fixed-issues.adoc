= Fixed issues

The following issues are fixed with {ols-official} 0.3.4:

* Previously, when you tried to attach logs to an {ols-long} query, the entire {ols-short} window and icon disappeared. Now, when you attach logs to a query the {ols-short} window and icon remain accessible. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1634[OLS-1634].

* In earlier versions, the {ols-long} Operator failed to validate the large language model (LLM) provider credential settings on the {azure-official} platform with {entra-id}. Now, the Operator can validate the LLM credential settings on the {azure-official} platform with {entra-id}. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1630[OLS-1630].

* Previously, the {ols-long} Operator could not use additional CA certificates to connect to {rhelai} or {rhoai}, preventing secure calls to the large language model (LLM) provider. This release adds support for custom CA certificates, enabling authenticated connections to {rhelai} or {rhoai}. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1527[OLS-1527].
