= Enabling your Operator for multiple architectures 

As an Operator author, your CSV must meet the following additional requirements
for your Operator to run properly with multiple architectures:

* Specify supported architecture and operating system if not amd64 and linux.

You must add a label for every supported architecture and operating system that your operator supports in the CSV
CSV:

* in `metadata.labels`:
+
[source,yaml]

labels:
  operatorframework.io/arch.arm: supported <1>
  operatorframework.io/os.windows: supported <2>
  operatorframework.io/os.linux: supported <3>
  operatorframework.io/arch.amd64: supported

<1> Adding support for arm architecture
<2> Adding support for windows operatating system
