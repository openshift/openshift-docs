= Enabling your Operator for multiple architectures and operating systems

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) assumes that all Operators run on Linux hosts. However, as an Operator author, you can specify whether your Operator supports managing workloads on other architectures, if worker nodes are available in the {product-title} cluster.

If your Operator supports variants other than AMD64 and Linux, you can add labels to the cluster service version (CSV) that provides the Operator to list the supported variants. Labels indicating supported architectures and operating systems are defined by the following:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
    operatorframework.io/arch.<arch>: supported <1>
    operatorframework.io/os.<os>: supported <2>
----
<1> Set `<arch>` to a supported string.
<2> Set `<os>` to a supported string.

[NOTE]
====
Only the labels on the channel head of the default channel are considered for filtering package manifests by label. This means, for example, that providing an additional architecture for an Operator in the non-default channel is possible, but that architecture is not available for filtering in the `PackageManifest` API.
====

If a CSV does not include an `os` label, it is treated as if it has the following Linux support label by default:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
    operatorframework.io/os.linux: supported
----

If a CSV does not include an `arch` label, it is treated as if it has the following AMD64 support label by default:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
    operatorframework.io/arch.amd64: supported
----

If an Operator supports multiple node architectures or operating systems, you can add multiple labels, as well.

.Prerequisites

* An Operator project with a CSV.
* To support listing multiple architectures and operating systems, your Operator image referenced in the CSV must be a manifest list image.
* For the Operator to work properly in restricted network, or disconnected, environments, the image referenced must also be specified using a digest (SHA) and not by a tag.

.Procedure

* Add a label in the `metadata.labels` of your CSV for each supported architecture and operating system that your Operator supports:
+
[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  operatorframework.io/arch.s390x: supported
  operatorframework.io/os.linux: supported <1>
  operatorframework.io/arch.amd64: supported <1>
----
<1> After you add a new architecture or operating system, you must also now include the default `os.linux` and `arch.amd64` variants explicitly.
