= Customizing a live {op-system} ISO or PXE install
You can use the live ISO image or PXE environment to install {op-system} by injecting an Ignition config file directly into the image. This creates a customized image that you can use to provision your system.

For an ISO image, the mechanism to do this is the `coreos-installer iso customize` subcommand, which modifies the `.iso` file with your configuration. Similarly, the mechanism for a PXE environment is the `coreos-installer pxe customize` subcommand, which creates a new `initramfs` file that includes your customizations.

The `customize` subcommand is a general purpose tool that can embed other types of customizations as well. The following tasks are examples of some of the more common customizations:

* Inject custom CA certificates for when corporate security policy requires their use.
* Configure network settings without the need for kernel arguments.
* Embed arbitrary preinstall and post-install scripts or binaries.
