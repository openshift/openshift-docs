= Service account definition

[role="_abstract"] 

You can define a service account in your `BuildRun` resource. The service account hosts all secrets referenced in your `Build` resource, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: BuildRun
metadata:
  name: buildah-buildrun
spec:
  build:
    name: buildah-build
  serviceAccount: pipeline <1>
----
<1> You can also set the value of the `spec.serviceAccount` field to `".generate"` to generate the service account during runtime. The name of the generated service account corresponds with the name of the `BuildRun` resource.

[NOTE]
====
When you do not define the service account, the `BuildRun` resource uses the `pipeline` service account if it exists in the namespace. Otherwise, the `BuildRun` resource uses the `default` service account.
