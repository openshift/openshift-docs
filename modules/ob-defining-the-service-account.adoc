= Service account definition

[role="_abstract"]
Define a service account in your `BuildRun` resource. The service account hosts all secrets referenced in your `Build` resource, as shown in the following example:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: BuildRun
metadata:
  name: buildah-buildrun
spec:
  build:
    name: buildah-build
  serviceAccount: pipeline
----
* `spec.serviceAccount`:: Defines the name of the generated service account corresponding to the name of the `BuildRun` resource. You can also set the value to `".generate"` to generate the service account during runtime.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you do not define the service account, the `BuildRun` resource uses the `pipeline` service account if it exists in the namespace. Otherwise, the `BuildRun` resource uses the `default` service account.
