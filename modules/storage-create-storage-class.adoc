= Creating the {StorageClass} storage class

Storage classes are used to differentiate and delineate storage levels and
usages. By defining a storage class, users can obtain dynamically provisioned
persistent volumes.

ifeval::["{Provisioner}" == "efs.csi.aws.com"]
The _AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator_, after being installed, does not create a storage class by default. However, you can manually create the AWS EFS storage class.
