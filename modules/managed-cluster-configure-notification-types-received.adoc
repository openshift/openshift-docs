* You are logged in to the {hybrid-console-second}.

.Procedure

. Click **Settings** -> **Notifications** to open the Notifications overview.
. Click **Notification Preferences**.
. On the My Notifications page, under OpenShift, click **Cluster Manager**.
. Specify the notification types that you want to receive by selecting or clearing the relevant checkbox.
. Click **Save**.
