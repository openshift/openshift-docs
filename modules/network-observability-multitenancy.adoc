= Enable multi-tenancy in Network Observability
Multi-tenancy in the Network Observability Operator allows and restricts individual user access, or group access, to the flows stored in Loki. Access is enabled for project admins. Project admins who have limited access to some namespaces can access flows for only those namespaces.

.Prerequisite
* You have installed link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/openshift-logging/loki-rhel8-operator/622b46bcae289285d6fcda39[Loki Operator version 5.7] 
* The `FlowCollector` `spec.loki.authToken` configuration must be set to `FORWARD`.
* You must be logged in as a project administrator

.Procedure

. Authorize reading permission to `user1` by running the following command: 
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user netobserv-reader user1
----
+
Now, the data is restricted to only allowed user namespaces. For example, a user that has access to a single namespace can see all the flows internal to this namespace, as well as flows going from and to this namespace.
Project admins have access to the Administrator perspective in the {product-title} console to access the Network Flows Traffic page.
