[id="installation-dns-user-infra_{context}"]
= User-provisioned DNS requirements

The following DNS records are required for an {product-title} cluster that uses
user-provisioned infrastructure. In each record, `<cluster_name>` is the cluster
name and `<base_domain>` is the cluster base domain that you specify in the
`install-config.yaml` file.

|Component
|Record
|Description

.2+a|Kubernetes API
|`api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`
|This DNS record must point to the load balancer
for the control plane machines. This record must be resolvable by both clients
external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

|`api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`
|This DNS record must point to the load balancer
for the control plane machines. This record must be resolvable from all the
nodes within the cluster.
[IMPORTANT]
====
The API server must be able to resolve the worker nodes by the host names
that are recorded in Kubernetes. If it cannot resolve the node names, proxied
API calls can fail, and you cannot retrieve logs from Pods.
====

|Routes
|`*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`
|A wildcard DNS record that points to the load balancer that targets the
machines that  run the Ingress router pods, which are the worker nodes by
default. This record must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster
and from all the nodes within the cluster.

.2+|etcd
|`etcd-<index>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`
|{product-title} requires DNS records for each etcd instance to point to the
control plane machines that host the instances. The etcd instances are
differentiated by `<index>` values, which start with `0` and end with `n-1`,
where `n` is the number of control plane machines in the cluster. The DNS
record must resolve to an unicast IPv4 address for the control plane machine,
and the records must be resolvable from all the nodes in the cluster.

|`_etcd-server-ssl._tcp.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`
|For each control plane machine, {product-title} also requires a SRV DNS
record for etcd server on that machine with priority `0`, weight `10` and
port `2380`. A cluster that uses three control plane machines requires the
following records:
