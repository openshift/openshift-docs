[id="installation-dns-user-infra_{context}"]
= User-provisioned DNS requirements

DNS is used for name resolution and reverse name resolution. DNS A/AAAA or CNAME records
are used for name resolution and PTR records are used for reverse name resolution.
The reverse records are important because {op-system-first} uses the reverse records to set the host name for
all the nodes. Additionally, the reverse records are used to generate the certificate signing requests
(CSR) that {product-title} needs to operate.

The following DNS records are required for an {product-title} cluster that uses
user-provisioned infrastructure. In each record, `<cluster_name>` is the cluster
name and `<base_domain>` is the cluster base domain that you specify in the
`install-config.yaml` file. A complete DNS record takes the form: `<component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`.

.Required DNS records
[cols="1a,3a,5a",options="header"]
|===

|Component
|Record
|Description

.2+a|Kubernetes API
|`api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|Add a DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record, and a DNS PTR record, to identify the load balancer
for the control plane machines. These records must be resolvable by both clients
external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

|`api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|Add a DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record, and a DNS PTR record, to identify the load balancer
for the control plane machines. These records must be resolvable from all the
nodes within the cluster.
[IMPORTANT]
====
The API server must be able to resolve the worker nodes by the host names
that are recorded in Kubernetes. If the API server cannot resolve the node
names, then proxied API calls can fail, and you cannot retrieve logs from pods.
====

|Routes
|`*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|Add a wildcard DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record that refers to the load balancer that targets the
machines that run the Ingress router pods, which are the worker nodes by
default. These records must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster
and from all the nodes within the cluster.

|Bootstrap
|`bootstrap.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|Add a DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record, and a DNS PTR record, to identify the bootstrap
machine. These records must be resolvable by the nodes within the cluster.

|Master hosts
|`<master><n>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|DNS A/AAAA or CNAME records and DNS PTR records to identify each machine
for the control plane nodes (also known as the master nodes). These records must be resolvable by the nodes within the cluster.

|Worker hosts
|`<worker><n>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|Add DNS A/AAAA or CNAME records and DNS PTR records to identify each machine
for the worker nodes. These records must be resolvable by the nodes within the cluster.

|===

[TIP]
====
You can use the `nslookup <hostname>` command to verify name resolution. You can use the
`dig -x <ip_address>` command to verify reverse name resolution for the PTR records.

The following example of a BIND zone file shows sample A records for name resolution. The
purpose of the example is to show the records that are needed. The example is not meant
to provide advice for choosing one name resolution service over another.
