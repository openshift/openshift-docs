[id="installation-dns-user-infra_{context}"]
= User-provisioned DNS requirements

The following DNS records are required for an {product-title} cluster that uses
user-provisioned infrastructure. In each record, `<cluster_name>` is the cluster
name and `<base_domain>` is the cluster base domain that you specify in the
`install-config.yaml` file. A complete DNS record takes the form: `<component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`.

|Component
|Record
|Description

.2+a|Kubernetes API
|`api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|This DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record must point to the load balancer
for the control plane machines. This record must be resolvable by both clients
external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

|`api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|This DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record must point to the load balancer
for the control plane machines. This record must be resolvable from all the
nodes within the cluster.
[IMPORTANT]
====
The API server must be able to resolve the worker nodes by the host names
that are recorded in Kubernetes. If it cannot resolve the node names, proxied
API calls can fail, and you cannot retrieve logs from Pods.
====

|Routes
|`*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|A wildcard DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record that points to the load balancer that targets the
machines that run the Ingress router pods, which are the worker nodes by
default. This record must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster
and from all the nodes within the cluster.
