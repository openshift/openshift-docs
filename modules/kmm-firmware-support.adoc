= KMM firmware support

Kernel modules sometimes need to load firmware files from the file system. KMM supports copying firmware files from the ModuleLoader image to the node's file system.

The contents of `.spec.moduleLoader.container.modprobe.firmwarePath` are copied into the `/var/lib/firmware` path on the node before running the `modprobe` command to insert the kernel module.

All files and empty directories are removed from that location before running the `modprobe -r` command to unload the kernel module, when the pod is terminated.
