== Resolved issues

The following highlighted issues are resolved in OADP 1.2.3:


.Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack)

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, the HTTP/2 protocol was susceptible to a denial of service attack because request cancellation could reset multiple streams quickly. The server had to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection. This resulted in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. For a list of all OADP issues associated with this CVE, see the following link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2868?filter=12421248[Jira list].

[id="known-issues-1-2-3_{context}"]
== Known issues

The {oadp-short} 1.2.3 has the following known issue:

.Data Protection Application (DPA) does not reconcile when the credentials secret is updated

Currently, the {oadp-short} Operator does not reconcile when you update the `cloud-credentials` secret. This occurs because there are no {oadp-short} specific labels or owner references on the `cloud-credentials` secret. If you create a `cloud-credentials` secret with incorrect credentials, such as empty data, the Operator reconciles and creates a Backup Storage Location (BSL) and registry deployment with the empty data. As a result, when you update the `cloud-credentials` secret with the correct credentials, the Operator does not immediately reconcile to catch the new credentials. 

Workaround: Update to {oadp-short} 1.3.
