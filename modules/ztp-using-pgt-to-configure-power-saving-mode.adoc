= Configuring power saving mode using {policy-gen-cr} CRs

Follow this example to set power saving mode by updating the `workloadHints` fields in the generated `PerformanceProfile` CR for the reference configuration, based on the `{policy-gen-cr}` CR in the `{policy-prefix}group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml`.

The power saving mode balances reduced power consumption with increased latency.

.Prerequisites

* You enabled C-states and OS-controlled P-states in the BIOS.

.Procedure

. Update the `{policy-gen-cr}` entry for `PerformanceProfile` in the `{policy-prefix}group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` reference file in `{argocd-folder}` as follows to configure power saving mode. It is recommended to configure the CPU governor for the power saving mode through the additional kernel arguments object.
+
ifeval::["{policy-gen-cr}" == "PolicyGenTemplate"]
include::snippets/pgt-ztp-using-pgt-to-configure-power-saving-mode.adoc[]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{policy-gen-cr}" == "PolicyGenerator"]
include::snippets/pg-ztp-using-pg-to-configure-power-saving-mode.adoc[]
endif::[]

. Commit the `{policy-gen-cr}` change in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the {ztp} Argo CD application.

.Verification

.  Select a worker node in your deployed cluster from the list of nodes identified by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----

. Log in to the node by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node-name>
----
+
Replace `<node-name>` with the name of the node you want to verify the power state on.

. Set `/host` as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host’s root file system in `/host` within the pod. By changing the root directory to `/host`, you can run binaries contained in the host’s executable paths as shown in the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# chroot /host
----

. Run the following command to verify the applied power state:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# cat /proc/cmdline
----

.Expected output

* For power saving mode the `intel_pstate=passive`.
