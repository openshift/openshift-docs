You must install the {product-title} cluster on a VMware vSphere version 6 or 7 instance that meets the requirements for the components that you use.

.Minimum supported vSphere version for VMware components
|===
|Component | Minimum supported versions |Description

|Hypervisor
|vSphere 6.5 and later with HW version 13
|This version is the minimum version that {op-system-first} supports. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/ecosystem/search/#/ecosystem/Red%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux?sort=sortTitle%20asc&vendors=VMware&category=Server[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 supported hypervisors list].

|Networking (NSX-T)
|vSphere 6.5U3 or vSphere 6.7U2 and later
|vSphere 6.5U3 or vSphere 6.7U2+ are required for {product-title}. VMware's NSX Container Plug-in (NCP) 3.0.2 is certified with {product-title} 4.6 and NSX-T 3.x+.


|Storage with in-tree drivers
|vSphere 6.5 and later
|This plug-in creates vSphere storage by using the in-tree storage drivers for vSphere included in {product-title} and can be used when vSphere CSI drivers are not available.

|Storage with vSphere CSI driver
|vSphere 6.7U3 and later
|This plug-in creates vSphere storage by using the standard Container Storage Interface. The vSphere CSI driver is provided and supported by VMware.

|===

If you use a vSphere version 6.5 instance, consider upgrading to 6.7U3 or 7.0 before
you install {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must ensure that the time on your ESXi hosts is synchronized before you install {product-title}. See link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-8756D419-A878-4AE0-9183-C6D5A91A8FB1.html[Edit Time Configuration for a Host] in the VMware documentation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A limitation of using VPC is that the Storage Distributed Resource Scheduler (SDRS) is not supported. See link:https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-kubernetes/documentation/faqs.html[vSphere Storage for Kubernetes FAQs] in the VMware documentation.
