[id="installation-vsphere-infrastructure_{context}"]
= VMware vSphere infrastructure requirements

You must install the {product-title} cluster on VMware vSphere 6.5, vSphere 6.7 Update 2, or later.

While vSphere 6.5 with hardware version 13 is supported, {product-title} does not support NSX-T software-defined networking (SDN).

If you are using vSphere 6.5, VMware recommends upgrading to 6.7 Update 2 or later before
you install {product-title}.

vSphere 6.7 Update 2 includes:

* Support for VMware NSX-T SDN
* Support for vSAN, VMFS, and NFS, using the in-tree vSphere Cloud Provider (VCP)

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must ensure that the time on your ESXi hosts is synchronized before you install {product-title}. See link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-8756D419-A878-4AE0-9183-C6D5A91A8FB1.html[Edit Time Configuration for a Host] in the VMware documentation.
