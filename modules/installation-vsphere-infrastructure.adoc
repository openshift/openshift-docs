[id="installation-vsphere-infrastructure_{context}"]
= VMware vSphere infrastructure requirements

You must install the {product-title} cluster on a VMware vSphere version 7.0 Update 2 or later instance that meets the requirements for the components that you use.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} version {product-version} supports VMware vSphere version 8.0.
====

You can host the VMware vSphere infrastructure on-premise or on a link:https://cloud.vmware.com/providers[VMware Cloud Verified provider] that meets the requirements outlined in the following tables:

.Version requirements for vSphere virtual environments
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Virtual environment product |Required version
|VMware virtual hardware | 15 or later
|vSphere ESXi hosts | 7.0 Update 2 or later
|vCenter host   | 7.0 Update 2 or later
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must ensure that the time on your ESXi hosts is synchronized before you install {product-title}. See link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-8756D419-A878-4AE0-9183-C6D5A91A8FB1.html[Edit Time Configuration for a Host] in the VMware documentation.

.Minimum supported vSphere version for VMware components
|===
|Component | Minimum supported versions |Description

|Hypervisor
|vSphere 7.0 Update 2 and later with virtual hardware version 15
|This version is the minimum version that {op-system-first} supports. For more information about supported hardware on the latest version of {op-system-base-full} that is compatible with {op-system}, see link:https://catalog.redhat.com/hardware/search[Hardware] on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

|Storage with in-tree drivers
|vSphere 7.0 Update 2 and later
|This plugin creates vSphere storage by using the in-tree storage drivers for vSphere included in {product-title}.

|Optional: Networking (NSX-T)
|vSphere 7.0 Update 2 and later
|vSphere 7.0 Update 2 is required for {product-title}. For more information about the compatibility of NSX and {product-title}, see the Release Notes section of VMware's link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Container-Plugin/index.html[NSX container plugin documentation].

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure the best performance conditions for your cluster workloads that operate on {oci-first} and on the {ocvs-first} service, ensure volume performance units (VPUs) for your block volume are sized for your workloads.

The following list provides some guidance in selecting the VPUs needed for specific performance needs:

* Test or proof of concept environment: 100 GB, and 20 to 30 VPUs.
* Base-production environment: 500 GB, and 60 VPUs.
* Heavy-use production environment: More than 500 GB, and 100 or more VPUs.

Consider allocating additional VPUs to give enough capacity for updates and scaling activities. See link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/blockvolumeperformance.htm[Block Volume Performance Levels] in the Oracle documentation.
