= VMware vSphere infrastructure requirements

You must install the {product-title} cluster on a VMware vSphere version 6.5
or 6.7U2 or later instance.

VMware recommends using vSphere Version 6.7 U2 or later with your {product-title}
cluster.
vSphere 6.7U2 includes:

* Support for VMware NSX-T
* Support for vSAN, VMFS and NFS, using the in-tree VCP

While vSphere 6.5 with Hardware version 13 is supported, {product-title}
clusters are subject to the following restrictions:

* NSX-T SDN is not supported.
* You must use another SDN or storage provider that {product-title} supports.

If you use a vSphere version 6.5 instance, consider upgrading to 6.7U2 before
you install {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must ensure that the time on your ESXi hosts is synchronized before you install {product-title}. See link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-8756D419-A878-4AE0-9183-C6D5A91A8FB1.html[Edit Time Configuration for a Host] in the VMware documentation.
