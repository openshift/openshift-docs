Before you install {product-title} on {oci-first}, you must create an {oci} environment on your virtual machine (VM) shape. By creating this environment, you can install {product-title} and deploy a cluster on infrastructure that supports a wide range of cloud options and strong security policies.

.Prerequisites
* You have prior knowledge of {oci} components. See link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Concepts/concepts.htm[Learn About Oracle Cloud Basics] in the Oracle documentation.  
* Your organization signed up for an Oracle account and Identity Domain. This step is required so that you can access an administrator account, which is the initial cloud-identity and access management (IAM) user for your organization. See link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm#ariaid-title4[The administrators group and policy] section in the Oracle documentation.
* You have logged into your organization’s {oci} account with administrator privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a compartment and ensure you defined your {ocid-first} in the compartment. A compartment is a component where you can organize and isolate your cloud resources. After you create a compartment, Oracle automatically assigns an {ocid} to your organization’s account. An administrator can access all compartments tagged to your organization’s {oci} account.

. Create a virtual cloud network (VCN). A compute instance, load balancer, and other resources need this network infrastructure to connect to each other over an internet connection. To establish an on-premise network you must manually create subnets, gateways, routing rules, and security policies. Ensure that you complete the following steps:
.. In **Primary VNIC IP addresses > Primary network**, select a VCN, such as *oci-cluster-vcn*. 
.. From the **Subnet** section, select your subnet, such as *ici-cluster-private-subnet*. 
.. For public IPV4 subnets, ensure that you select the **Do not assign a public IPv4 address** checkbox.

. Create a network security group (NSG) in your VCN. You can use the NSG to establish advanced security rules for your network. You must locate the NSG in your compartment, so that certain groups can access network resources. Ensure that you complete the following steps:
.. Click **Show advanced options**. 
.. Select the **Use network security groups** to control traffic checkbox.
.. Set your NSG, such as *oci-cluster-controlplane-nsg*.

. Create a dynamic group that hosts compute instances. After you create the dynamic group, you can then create a policy statement that defines rules for your cluster environment. This statement sets the precedent  for each compute instance to join your {product-title} cluster as a self-managed node. 

. Create a policy statement. You must create a policy so that your administrator can grant access to your groups, users, or resources that operate in your network.

. Create a load balancer, so that you can provide automated traffic distribution on your VCN.

. Create three Domain Name System (DNS) records and then add the records to a DNS, so that Oracle’s edge-network can maintain your domain’s DNS queries.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure compatibility with {product-title}, set `A` as the record type for each DNS record and name records as follows:

* `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which targets the `apiVIP` parameter of the API load balancer.
* `api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which targets the `apiVIP` parameter of the API load balancer.
* `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which targets the `ingressVIP` parameter of the Ingress load balancer.

The `api.+*+` and `api-int.+*+` DNS records relate to control plane machines, so you must ensure that all nodes in your installed {product-title} cluster can access these DNS records.
