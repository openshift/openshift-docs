== MetricName and Remap fields are validated

Before this update, users could create a `FlowMetric` custom resource (CR) with an invalid metric name. Although the `FlowMetric` CR was successfully created, the underlying metric would fail silently without providing any error feedback to the user.

With this release, the `FlowMetric`, `metricName`, and `remap` fields are now validated before creation, so users are immediately notified if they enter an invalid name.
