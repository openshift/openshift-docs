= Network Observability Operator 1.11 fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability Operator 1.11 release contains several fixed issues that improve performance and the user experience.

Missing dates in charts::
Before this update, the chart tooltip date display issue was due to an incorrect title function in `chart-voronoi.tsx`. As a consequence, users experienced missing date information in the {product-title} web console plugin's *Overview* tab chart, affecting data context.
+
With this release, the chart tooltip now displays date from `datum` or falls back to `label`. As a result, the web console plugin's *Overview* tab now displays dates on the x-axis, enhancing data readability.

Warning message for Direct mode not refreshed after upscaling::
Before this update, cluster information was not refreshed after scaling, causing a warning message to persist in large clusters, not updating with changes.
+
With this release, cluster information is now refreshed when it changes, resulting in the warning message for large clusters in `Direct` mode updating with changes in cluster size, improving user visibility.

Unenriched OVN IPs::
Before this update, IPs declared by OVN-Kubernetes were not enriched when using the new `Service` deployment model, causing unenriched IPs like `100.64.0.x` to not appear in `Machines` network. As a consequence, IPs not enriched caused the wrong network visibility for users.
+
With this release, missing IPs in OVN-Kubernetes are now enriched, appearing in `Machines` network. As a result, IPs declared by OVN-Kubernetes are correctly enriched, improving the visibility of network traffic sources in `Machines` network.

Agents crashing: stack size too big::
Before this update, split maps were used to avoid stack size error in DNS processing. As a consequence, end users experienced `CrashLoopBackOff` due to insufficient permissions in {product-title} 4.18.
+
With this release, the split maps approach has been maintained to avoid stack size error. As a result, agents deploy smoothly on {product-title} 4.18, eliminating `CrashLoopBackOff` errors.

eBPF agents in CLBO on OCP<=4.18::
Before this update, Network Observability Operator 1.11 deployment prevented `eBPF` agents from functioning with `FlowCollector` in {product-title} versions below 4.18. As a consequence, users experienced `eBPF` agents not functioning with Network Observability Operator 1.11 and ``FlowCollector` deployment.
+
With this release, eBPF agents now deploy correctly with Network Observability Operator 1.11 and `FlowCollector`. As a result, eBPF agents deploy successfully with `FlowCollector`, improving network monitoring for OCP<4.18 users.

Follow this format:

MetricName and Remap fields are validated::
+
Before this update, users could create a `FlowMetric` custom resource (CR) with an invalid metric name. Although the `FlowMetric` CR was successfully created, the underlying metric would fail silently without providing any error feedback to the user.
+
With this release, the `FlowMetric`, `metricName`, and `remap` fields are now validated before creation, so users are immediately notified if they enter an invalid name.
