= Security hardening measures implemented

== Disabling USB boot, wireless and bluetooth access  

To prevent unauthorized modifications to the operating system and to reduce the risk of physical attack vectors, USB boot, wireless, and Bluetooth are disabled in the BIOS settings. These settings are not controlled by using ZTP configuration. Disabling USB boot prevents attackers from booting from a USB drive and gaining unauthorized access to the system. The recommended firmware configuration is described in "Configuring host firmware for low latency and high performance".

== Preventing unauthorized reboots
 
Disabling `CtrlAltDelBurstAction` and `Ctrl+Alt+Del` actions prevents unauthorized reboots.

== Restricting direct SSH access
  
Direct SSH access to {product-title} is limited by disabling the `root` login.

== Disabling passwordless logins
  
This feature enforces strict authentication policies by disabling logins for accounts without passwords to ensure compliance with security best practices and reduce unauthorized access risks.

== Ensure that the RBAC setup follows the principle of least privilege

To minimize the risk of unauthorized access, the RBAC setup follows the principle of least privilege, as described in "Using RBAC to define and apply permissions", granting users the minimum required permissions. 

{product-title} provides the tools for creating minimal permissions. However, you must assess the needs of users and services within your environment and apply the principle of least privilege accordingly.

For example, consider creating a role that:

* Provides permissions to control user access, such as granting users the ability to view resources without modifying them.
* Enables developers to manage only deployments and services within a specific namespace, without granting access to sensitive resources. 
* Allows users to view configuration resources, such as `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets`, but not change them.

Regularly review and update permissions to ensure that users have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
