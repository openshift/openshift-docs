== Elastic load balancer (ELB) `AccessDenied` error

If you have not created a load balancer in your AWS account, it is possible that the service role for the elastic load balancer (ELB) might not exist yet. You may receive the following error:

[source,terminal]
----
Error: Error creating network Load Balancer: AccessDenied: User: arn:aws:sts::xxxxxxxxxxxx:assumed-role/ManagedOpenShift-Installer-Role/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is not authorized to perform: iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/aws-service-role/elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing"
----

To resolve this issue, ensure that the role exists on your AWS account. If not, create this role with the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
aws iam get-role --role-name "AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing" || aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name "elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com"
----

[NOTE]
====
This command only needs to be executed once per account.
