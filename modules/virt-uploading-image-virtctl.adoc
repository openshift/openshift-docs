= Creating a VM from an uploaded image by using the CLI

You can upload an operating system image by using the `virtctl` command-line tool. You can use an existing data volume or create a new data volume for the image.

.Prerequisites

* You must have an `ISO`, `IMG`, or `QCOW2` operating system image file.
* For best performance, compress the image file by using the link:https://libguestfs.org/virt-sparsify.1.html[virt-sparsify] tool or the `xz` or `gzip` utilities.
* The client machine must be configured to trust the {product-title} router's
certificate.
* You have installed the `virtctl` CLI.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Upload the image by running the `virtctl image-upload` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl image-upload dv <datavolume_name> \
  --size=<datavolume_size> \
  --image-path=</path/to/image>
----
+
`<datavolume_name>`:: The name of the data volume.
`<datavolume_size>`:: The size of the data volume. For example: `--size=500Mi`, `--size=1G`
`</path/to/image>`:: The file path of the image.
+
[NOTE]
====
* If you do not want to create a new data volume, omit the `--size` parameter and include the `--no-create` flag.
* When uploading a disk image to a PVC, the PVC size must be larger than the size of the uncompressed virtual disk.
* To allow insecure server connections when using HTTPS, use the `--insecure` parameter. When you use the `--insecure` flag, the authenticity of the upload endpoint is *not* verified.
====

. Optional. To verify that a data volume was created, view all data volumes by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get dvs
