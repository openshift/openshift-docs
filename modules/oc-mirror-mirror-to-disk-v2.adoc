== Mirroring from mirror to disk

You can use the oc-mirror plugin v2 to generate an image set and save the content to disk. Afterwards, you can transfer the generated image set to the disconnected environment and mirror it to the target registry.

oc-mirror plugin v2 retrieves the container images from the source specified in the image set configuration file and packs them into a tar archive in a local directory.

.Procedure

* Mirror the images from the specified image set configuration to the disk by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror -c <image_set_configuration> file://<file_path> --v2
----
+
where:

<image_set_configuration>:: Specifies the name of the image set configuration file.
<file_path>:: Specifies the directory where the archives containing the image sets will be generated in.

// Should there be an explicit step in this procedure or the next one to physically transfer the disk to the disconnected environment?

.Verification

. Navigate to the `<file_path>` directory that was generated.
. Verify that the archive files have been generated.
