= Creating Helm releases using the Developer perspective

You can use either the *Developer* perspective in the web console or the CLI to select and create a release from the Helm charts listed in the *Developer Catalog*. You can create Helm releases by installing Helm charts and see them in the *Developer* perspective of the web console.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to the web console and have switched to xref:../../web_console/web-console-overview.adoc#about-developer-perspective_web-console-overview[the *Developer* perspective].

. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to the *+Add* view and select a project. Then click *Helm Chart* option to see all the Helm Charts in the *Developer Catalog*.

+
. In the *Create Helm Release* page:
.. Enter a unique name for the release in the *Release Name* field.
.. Select the required chart version from the *Chart Version* drop-down list.
.. Configure your Helm chart by using the *Form View* or the *YAML View*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Where available, you can switch between the *YAML View* and *Form View*. The data is persisted when switching between the views.
====
+
.. Click *Create* to create a Helm release. The web console displays the new release in the *Topology* view.
+
If a Helm chart has release notes, the web console displays them.
+
If a Helm chart creates workloads, the web console displays them on the *Topology* or *Helm release details* page. The workloads are `DaemonSet`, `CronJob`, `Pod`, `Deployment`, and `DeploymentConfig`.

.. View the newly created Helm release in the *Helm Releases* page.

You can upgrade, rollback, or delete a Helm release by using the *Actions* button on the side panel or by right-clicking a Helm release.
