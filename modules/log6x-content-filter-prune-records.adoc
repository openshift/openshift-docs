= Configuring content filters to prune log records

When the `prune` filter is configured, the log collector evaluates log streams according to the filters before forwarding. The collector prunes log records by removing low value fields such as pod annotations.

.Procedure

. Add a configuration for a filter to the `prune` spec in the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR.
+
The following example shows how to configure the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR to prune log records based on field paths:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If both are specified, records are pruned based on the `notIn` array first, which takes precedence over the `in` array. After records have been pruned by using the `notIn` array, they are then pruned by using the `in` array.

.Example `ClusterLogForwarder` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
# ...
spec:
  serviceAccount:
    name: <service_account_name>
  filters:
  - name: <filter_name>
    type: prune # <1>
    prune: # <2>
      in: [.kubernetes.annotations, .kubernetes.namespace_id] # <3>
      notIn: [.kubernetes,.log_type,.message,."@timestamp"] # <4>
  pipelines:
  - name: <pipeline_name> # <5>
    filterRefs: ["<filter_name>"]
# ...
----
<1> Specify the type of filter. The `prune` filter prunes log records by configured fields.
<2> Specify configuration options for applying the `prune` filter. The `in` and `notIn` fields are specified as arrays of dot-delimited field paths, which are paths to fields in log records. These paths can contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (`a-zA-Z0-9_`), for example, `.kubernetes.namespace_name`. If segments contain characters outside of this range, the segment must be in quotes, for example, `.kubernetes.labels."foo.bar-bar/baz"`.
<3> Optional: Any fields that are specified in this array are removed from the log record.
<4> Optional: Any fields that are not specified in this array are removed from the log record.
<5> Specify the pipeline that the `prune` filter is applied to.

[NOTE]
====
The filters exempts the `log_type`, `.log_source`, and `.message` fields.
