= Initial planning considerations

Consider the following tested object maximums when you plan your {product-title} cluster.

These guidelines are based on a cluster of 102 workers in a multi-availability zone configuration. For smaller clusters, the maximums are lower.

The sizing of the control plane and infrastructure nodes is dynamically calculated during the installation process, based on the number of worker nodes. If you change the number of worker nodes after the installation, control plane and infra nodes must be resized manually. Infra nodes are resized by the Red Hat SRE team, and you can link:https://access.redhat.com/[open a ticket in the Customer Portal] to request the infra node resizing.

The following table lists the size of control plane and infrastructure nodes that are assigned during installation.

[options="header",cols="3*"]

| Number of worker nodes |Control plane size |Infrastructure node size

|1 to 25
|m5.2xlarge

1. The maximum number of worker nodes on ROSA is 180

For larger clusters, infrastructure node sizing can become a large impacting factor to scalability. There are many factors that influence the stated thresholds, including the etcd version or storage data format.

Exceeding these limits does not necessarily mean that the cluster will fail. In most cases, exceeding these numbers results in lower overall performance.

The OpenShift Container Platform version used in all of the tests is OCP 4.8.0.
