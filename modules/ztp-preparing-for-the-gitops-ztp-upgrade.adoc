= Preparing for the upgrade

Use the following procedure to prepare your site for the GitOps zero touch provisioning (ZTP) upgrade.

.Procedure

. Obtain the latest version of the GitOps ZTP container from which you can extract a set of custom resources (CRs) used to configure the GitOps operator on the hub cluster for use in the GitOps ZTP solution.

. Extract the `argocd/deployment` directory using the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir -p ./out
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run --log-driver=none --rm registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ztp-site-generate-rhel8:v4.10 extract /home/ztp --tar | tar x -C ./out
----
+
The `/out` directory contains the following subdirectories:
+
* `out/extra-manifest`: contains the source CR files that the `SiteConfig` CR uses to generate the extra manifest `configMap`.
* `out/source-crs`: contains the source CR files that the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR uses to generate the {rh-rhacm-first} policies.
* `out/argocd/deployment`: contains patches and YAML files to apply on the hub cluster for use in the next step of this procedure.
* `out/argocd/example`: contains example `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` files that represent the recommended configuration.

. Update the `clusters-app.yaml` and `policies-app.yaml` files to reflect the name of your applications and the URL, branch, and path for your Git repository.

If the upgrade includes changes to policies that may result in obsolete policies, these policies should be removed prior to performing the upgrade.
