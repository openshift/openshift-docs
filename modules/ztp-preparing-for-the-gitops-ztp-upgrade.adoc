= Preparing for the upgrade

Use the following procedure to prepare your site for the {ztp-first} upgrade.

.Procedure

. Get the latest version of the {ztp} container that has the custom resources (CRs) used to configure {gitops-title} for use with {ztp}.

. Extract the `argocd/deployment` directory by using the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir -p ./update
----
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run --log-driver=none --rm registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ztp-site-generate-rhel8:v{product-version} extract /home/ztp --tar | tar x -C ./update
----
+
The `/update` directory contains the following subdirectories:
+
* `update/extra-manifest`: contains the source CR files that the `SiteConfig` CR uses to generate the extra manifest `configMap`.
* `update/source-crs`: contains the source CR files that the `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` CR uses to generate the {rh-rhacm-first} policies.
* `update/argocd/deployment`: contains patches and YAML files to apply on the hub cluster for use in the next step of this procedure.
* `update/argocd/example`: contains example `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` files that represent the recommended configuration.

. Update the `clusters-app.yaml` and `policies-app.yaml` files to reflect the name of your applications and the URL, branch, and path for your Git repository.
+
If the upgrade includes changes that results in obsolete policies, the obsolete policies should be removed prior to performing the upgrade.

. Diff the changes between the configuration and deployment source CRs in the `/update` folder and Git repo where you manage your fleet site CRs. Apply and push the required changes to your site repository.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When you update {ztp} to the latest version, you must apply the changes from the `update/argocd/deployment` directory to your site repository. Do not use older versions of the `argocd/deployment/` files.
