{product-title} supports the use of AWS Local Zones, which are metropolis-centralized availability zones where customers can place latency-sensitive application workloads. Local Zones are extensions of AWS Regions that have their own internet connection. For more information about AWS Local Zones, see the AWS documentation link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/local-zones/latest/ug/how-local-zones-work.html[How Local Zones work].
