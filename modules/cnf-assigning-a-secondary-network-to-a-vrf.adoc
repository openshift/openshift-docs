[id="cnf-assigning-a-secondary-network-to-a-vrf_{context}"]
= Assigning a secondary network to a VRF

As a cluster administrator, you can configure an additional network for your VRF domain by using the CNI VRF plug-in. The virtual network created by this plug-in is associated with a physical interface that you specify.

[id="cnf-creating-an-additional-network-attachment-with-the-cni-vrf-plug-in_{context}"]
== Creating an additional network attachment with the CNI VRF plug-in

The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) manages additional network definitions. When you specify an additional network to create, the CNO creates the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resource (CR) automatically.

[NOTE]
====
Do not edit the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRs that the Cluster Network Operator manages. Doing so might disrupt network traffic on your additional network.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the {product-title} CLI (oc).
* Log in to the OpenShift cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

.Procedure

. Create the CNO CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
----
. Extend the CR that you are creating by adding the `rawCNIConfig` configuration for the additional network, as in the example CR below. The following YAML configures the CNI VRF plug-in:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
  spec:
  additionalNetworks:
  - name: test-network-1
    namespace: test-1
    type: Raw
    rawCNIConfig: '{
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "name": "macvlan-vrf",
      "plugins": [  <1>
      {
        "type": "macvlan",  <2>
        "master": "eth1",
        "ipam": {
            "type": "static",
            "addresses": [
            {
                "address": "191.168.1.23/24"
            }
            ]
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "vrf",
        "vrfname": "example-vrf-name",  <3>
        "table": 1001   <4>
      }]
    }'
----
<1> `plugins` must be a list. The first item in the list must be secondary network underpinning the VRF network. The second item in the list is the VRF plugin configuration.
<2> `type` must be set to `vrf`.
<3> `vrfname` is the name of the VRF that the interface is assigned to. If it does not exist in the pod, it is created.
<4> `table` is the routing table ID. Optional. By default, the `tableid` parameter is used. If it is not specified, the CNI assigns a free routing table ID to the VRF.
+
[NOTE]
====
VRF will function correctly only when the resource is of type `netdevice`.
====
. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.
. Confirm that the CNO created the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CR by running the following command. Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace that you specified when configuring the network attachment. There might be a delay before the CNO creates the CR.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions -n <namespace>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                       AGE

.Verifying that the additional VRF network attachment is successful

To verify that the VRF CNI is correctly configured and the additional network attachment is attached, do the following:

. Create a network that uses the VRF CNI.
. Assign the network to a pod.
. Verify that the pod network attachment is connected to the VRF additional network. SSH into the pod and run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ip vrf show
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
Name              Table
-----------------------
red                 10
----
. Confirm the VRF interface is master of the secondary interface:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ip link
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
