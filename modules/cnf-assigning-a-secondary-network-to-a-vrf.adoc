= Creating an additional network attachment with the CNI VRF plugin

The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) manages additional network definitions. When you specify an additional network to create, the CNO creates the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resource (CR) automatically.

[NOTE]
====
Do not edit the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRs that the Cluster Network Operator manages. Doing so might disrupt network traffic on your additional network.
====

To create an additional network attachment with the CNI VRF plugin, perform the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {product-title} CLI (oc).
* Log in to the OpenShift cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

.Procedure

. Create the `Network` custom resource (CR) for the additional network attachment and insert the `rawCNIConfig` configuration for the additional network, as in the following example CR. Save the YAML as the file `additional-network-attachment.yaml`.

----
<1> `plugins` must be a list. The first item in the list must be the secondary network underpinning the VRF network. The second item in the list is the VRF plugin configuration.
<2> `type` must be set to `vrf`.
<3> `vrfname` is the name of the VRF that the interface is assigned to. If it does not exist in the pod, it is created.
<4> Optional. `table` is the routing table ID. By default, the `tableid` parameter is used. If it is not specified, the CNI assigns a free routing table ID to the VRF.
+
[NOTE]
====
VRF functions correctly only when the resource is of type `netdevice`.
====

. Create the `Network` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f additional-network-attachment.yaml
----

. Confirm that the CNO created the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CR by running the following command. Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace that you specified when configuring the network attachment, for example, `additional-network-1`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions -n <namespace>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                       AGE
additional-network-1       14m
----
+
[NOTE]
====
There might be a delay before the CNO creates the CR.
====

.Verification

. Create a pod and assign it to the additional network with the VRF instance:

.. Create a YAML file that defines the `Pod` resource:
+
.Example `pod-additional-net.yaml` file

$ ip vrf show
