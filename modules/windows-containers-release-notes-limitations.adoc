* Windows nodes do not support pulling container images from private registries. You can use images from public registries or pre-pull the images.

* Windows nodes do not support workloads created by using deployment configs. You can use a deployment or other method to deploy workloads.

* Windows nodes are not supported in clusters that are in a disconnected environment.

* {productwinc} does not support adding Windows nodes to a cluster through a trunk port. The only supported networking configuration for adding Windows nodes is through an access port that carries traffic for the VLAN.

* Kubernetes has identified the following link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/windows/intro/#limitations[node feature limitations] :
** Huge pages are not supported for Windows containers.
** Privileged containers are not supported for Windows containers.
** Pod termination grace periods require the containerd container runtime to be installed on the Windows node.

* Kubernetes has identified link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/windows/intro/#api[several API compatibility issues].
