= About mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)

In {SMProduct} 3, you use the `Istio` resource instead of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to configure mTLS settings. 

In {SMProduct} 3, you configure `STRICT` mTLS mode by using the `PeerAuthentication` and `DestinationRule` resources. You set TLS protocol versions through Istio Workload Minimum TLS Version Configuration.

Review the following `Istio` resources and concepts to configure mTLS settings properly:

`PeerAuthentication`:: defines the type of mTLS traffic a sidecar accepts. In `PERMISSIVE` mode, both plaintext and mTLS traffic are accepted. In `STRICT` mode, only mTLS traffic is allowed.

`DestinationRule`:: configures the type of TLS traffic a sidecar sends. In `DISABLE` mode, the sidecar sends plaintext. In `SIMPLE`, `MUTUAL`, and `ISTIO_MUTUAL` modes, the sidecar establishes a TLS connection.

`Auto mTLS`:: ensures that all inter-mesh traffic is encrypted with mTLS by default, regardless of the `PeerAuthentication` mode configuration. `Auto mTLS` is controlled by the global mesh configuration field `enableAutoMtls`, which is enabled by default in {SMProduct} 2 and 3. The mTLS setting operates entirely between sidecar proxies, requiring no changes to application or service code.

By default, `PeerAuthentication` is set to `PERMISSIVE` mode, allowing sidecars in the {SMProductShortName} to accept both plain-text and mTLS-encrypted traffic.
