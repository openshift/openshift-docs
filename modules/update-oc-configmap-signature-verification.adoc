[id="update-oc-configmap-signature-verification_{context}"]
= Creating the config map for image signature verification by using the `oc` CLI

Before you update your cluster, you must manually create a config map that contains the signatures of the release images that you use. This signature allows the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) to verify that the release images have not been modified by comparing the expected and actual image signatures.

[NOTE]
====
If you are upgrading from a release prior to version 4.4.8, you must use the manual method for creating the config map instead of this procedure. The commands that this procedure uses are not in earlier versions of the `oc` command-line interface (CLI).
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), version 4.4.8 or later.

.Procedure

. Obtain the image signature for the version that you are upgrading to from either link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/signatures/openshift/release[mirror.openshift.com] or link:https://storage.googleapis.com/openshift-release/official/signatures[Google Cloud Storage (GCS)].

. Use `oc` command-line interface (CLI) to log into the cluster that you are upgrading.

. Apply the mirrored release image signature config map to the connected cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <image_signature_file> <1>
----
<1> For `<image_signature_file>`, specify the path and name of the file, for example, `mirror/config/signature-sha256-81154f5c03294534.yaml`.
