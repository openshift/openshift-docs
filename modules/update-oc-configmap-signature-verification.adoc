= Creating the config map for image signature verification by using the `oc` CLI

Use the `oc` CLI to simplify the creation of the image signature config map.

[NOTE]
====
If you are upgrading from a release prior to version 4.4.8, you must use the manual method for creating the config map instead of this procedure. The commands that this procedure uses are not in earlier versions of the `oc` command-line interface (CLI).
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), version 4.4.8 or later.

.Procedure

. Obtain the image signature for the version that you are upgrading to from either link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/signatures/openshift/release[mirror.openshift.com] or link:https://storage.googleapis.com/openshift-release/official/signatures[Google Cloud Storage (GCS)].

. Use `oc` command-line interface (CLI) to log in to the cluster that you are upgrading.

. Apply the mirrored release image signature config map to the connected cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <image_signature_file> <1>
----
<1> For `<image_signature_file>`, specify the path and name of the file, for example, `mirror/config/signature-sha256-81154f5c03294534.yaml`.
