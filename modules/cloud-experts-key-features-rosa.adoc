* *AWS service integration:* AWS has a robust portfolio of cloud services, such as compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, and machine learning. All of these services are directly accessible through {product-title}. This makes it easier to build, operate, and scale globally and on-demand through a familiar management interface.
* *Maximum Availability:* Deploy clusters across multiple availability zones in supported regions to maximize availability and maintain high availability for your most demanding mission-critical applications and data.
* *Cluster node scaling:* Easily add or remove compute nodes to match resource demand.
* *Optimized clusters:* Choose from memory-optimized, compute-optimized, or general purpose EC2 instance types with clusters sized to meet your needs.
