= Setting up log collection

This release of Cluster Logging requires administrators to explicitly grant log collection permissions to the service account associated with *ClusterLogForwarder*. This was not required in previous releases for the legacy logging scenario consisting of a *ClusterLogging* and, optionally, a *ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io* resource.

The {clo} provides `collect-audit-logs`, `collect-application-logs`, and `collect-infrastructure-logs` cluster roles, which enable the collector to collect audit logs, application logs, and infrastructure logs respectively.

Setup log collection by binding the required cluster roles to your service account.

== Legacy service accounts
To use the existing legacy service account `logcollector`, create the following *ClusterRoleBinding*:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user collect-application-logs system:serviceaccount:openshift-logging:logcollector
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user collect-infrastructure-logs system:serviceaccount:openshift-logging:logcollector
----

Additionally, create the following *ClusterRoleBinding* if collecting audit logs:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user collect-audit-logs system:serviceaccount:openshift-logging:logcollector
----


== Creating service accounts
.Prerequisites

* The {clo} is installed in the `openshift-logging` namespace.
* You have administrator permissions.

.Procedure

. Create a service account for the collector. If you want to write logs to storage that requires a token for authentication, you must include a token in the service account.

. Bind the appropriate cluster roles to the service account:
+
.Example binding command
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user <cluster_role_name> system:serviceaccount:<namespace_name>:<service_account_name>
----

=== Cluster Role Binding for your Service Account
The role_binding.yaml file binds the ClusterLogging operator's ClusterRole to a specific ServiceAccount, allowing it to manage Kubernetes resources cluster-wide.
