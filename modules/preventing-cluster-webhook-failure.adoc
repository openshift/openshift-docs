= Prevent cluster failure due to webhooks

[role="_abstract"]
To prevent potential cluster failure and ensure pods can always start, you must configure third-party admission webhooks to exclude infrastructure namespaces. Implementing specific selectors and adopting `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` provides a more stable environment for cluster recovery and management.

When possible, use a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy instead of an admission webhook. It does not require an external service, has no timeout limitations, and cannot cause cluster-wide failures.

If you use admission webhooks take the following precautions:
+
* Configure the webhook to exclude OpenShift and Kubernetes infrastructure namespaces.

* Configure webhook timeouts to 10 seconds or less to provide a safety buffer for the system enforced 13-second limit.

* Set `failurePolicy: Ignore` for non-critical webhooks so that requests can proceed if the webhook is unavailable.
