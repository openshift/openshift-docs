= Configuring a three-node cluster

ifndef::ibm-z,ibm-z-kvm[]
Optionally, you can deploy zero compute machines in a bare metal cluster that consists of three control plane machines only. This provides smaller, more resource efficient clusters for cluster administrators and developers to use for testing, development, and production.

ifdef::ibm-z,ibm-z-kvm[]
Optionally, you can deploy zero compute machines in a minimal three node cluster that consists of three control plane machines only. This provides smaller, more resource efficient clusters for cluster administrators and developers to use for testing, development, and production.
endif::ibm-z,ibm-z-kvm[]

In three-node {product-title} environments, the three control plane machines are schedulable, which means that your application workloads are scheduled to run on them.

.Prerequisites

* You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

* Ensure that the number of compute replicas is set to `0` in your `install-config.yaml` file, as shown in the following `compute` stanza:
+
[source,yaml]
----
compute:
- name: worker
  platform: {}
  replicas: 0
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must set the value of the `replicas` parameter for the compute machines to `0` when you install {product-title} on user-provisioned infrastructure, regardless of the number of compute machines you are deploying. In installer-provisioned installations, the parameter controls the number of compute machines that the cluster creates and manages for you. This does not apply to user-provisioned installations, where the compute machines are deployed manually.
====
ifdef::ibm-z,ibm-z-kvm[]
+
[NOTE]
====
The preferred resource for control plane nodes is six vCPUs and 21 GB. For three control plane nodes this is the memory + vCPU equivalent of a minimum five-node cluster. You should back the three nodes, each installed on a 120 GB disk, with three IFLs that are SMT2 enabled. The minimum tested setup is three vCPUs and 10 GB on a 120 GB disk for each control plane node.
====
endif::ibm-z,ibm-z-kvm[]
.Next steps

For three-node cluster installations, follow these next steps:

* If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes. See the _Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure_ section for more information.

* When you create the Kubernetes manifest files in the following procedure, ensure that the `mastersSchedulable` parameter in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` file is set to `true`. This enables your application workloads to run on the control plane nodes.

* Do not deploy any compute nodes when you create the {op-system-first} machines.
