[id="installation-three-node-cluster_{context}"]
= Configuring a three-node cluster

You can optionally install and run three-node clusters in {product-title} with no workers. This provides smaller, more resource efficient clusters for cluster administrators and developers to use for development, production, and testing.

.Procedure

* Edit the `install-config.yaml` file to set the number of compute replicas, which are also known as worker replicas, to `0`, as shown in the following `compute` stanza:
+
[source,yaml]
----
compute:
- name: worker
  platform: {}
  replicas: 0
