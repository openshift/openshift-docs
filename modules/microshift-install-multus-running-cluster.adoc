= Installing the Multus CNI plugin on a running cluster

If you want to attach additional networks to a pod for high-performance network configurations, you can install the {microshift-short} Multus RPM package. After installation, a host restart is required to recreate all the pods with the Multus annotation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Uninstalling the Multus CNI plugin is not supported.
====

.Prerequisites

. You have root access to the host.

.Procedure

. Install the Multus RPM package by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install microshift-multus
----
+
[TIP]
====
If you create your custom resources (CRs) for additional networks now, you can complete your installation and apply configurations with one restart.
====

. To apply the package manifest to an active cluster, restart the host by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart
----

.Verification

. After restarting, ensure that the Multus CNI plugin components are created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -A | grep multus
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
openshift-multus      dhcp-daemon-ktzqf     1/1   Running   0     45h
openshift-multus      multus-4frf4          1/1   Running   0     45h

.Next steps

. If you have not done so, configure and apply the additional networks you want to use.

. Deploy your applications that use the created CRs.
