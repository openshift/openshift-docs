= Deploying manifests in the GitOps repository

With the `kam boostrap` command, you can bootstrap GitOps CI/CD with a starter configuration. You can run it in an interactive mode or specify the GitOps CI/CD parameters by using flags.

.Procedure

* To run `kam` in an interactive mode:
. Run the command without any flags:
+
----
$ kam bootstrap
----

. Specify the values according to prompts in the terminal.
+
`kam` will generate the GitOps directory and the required resources.


* To specify all the values by using flags:
+
----
$ kam bootstrap \
--service-repo-url https://github.com/<your organization>/taxi.git \ <1>
--gitops-repo-url https://github.com/<your organization>/gitops.git \
--image-repo quay.io/<username>/<image-repo> \
--dockercfgjson ~/Downloads/<username>-robot-auth.json \
--git-host-access-token <your git access token> \
--output <path to write GitOps resources> \
--push-to-git=true  <2>
----
<1> The name of the app and service is created from the last component of your `service-repo-url`. In this example, `kam` will bootstrap an app called `app-taxi` and a service called `taxi`.
<2> Use the `--push-to-git=true` flag to push the generated resources to your GitOps repository. When run with this flag, `kam` executes Git locally authenticating the push by using your local SSH key. 

[NOTE]
====
If you use a self-hosted GitHub Enterprise, GitLab Community, or GitLab Enterprise Edition and the driver name is not evident from the repository URL, use the `--private-repo-driver` flag to specify _github_ or _gitlab_.
====

The bootstrap process of `kam` creates:

* files that describe your application and configuration for a complete CI pipeline and deployments from Argo CD.

* two environments: dev and stage

* namespaces for the dev and the stage environments

* a private GitOps repository if the credentials are provided. This  repository is used for pushing your generated resources which will be pushed to your Git hosting service.
