= Configuring GNSS failover to NTP for time synchronization continuity

[role="_abstract"]
Automatic failover from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) to Network Time Protocol (NTP) maintains time synchronization continuity when the primary signal is lost, ensuring system stability for telco operations.

Telco operators require time source redundancy to ensure time synchronization continuity and system stability.

{product-title} provides automatic failover capabilities to maintain synchronization. The system utilizes GNSS (delivered by `phc2sys`) as the primary time source. To protect against primary signal loss, such as jamming or antenna failure, the system automatically transitions to the secondary time source, NTP delivered by `chronyd`. Upon signal recovery, the system automatically switches back to and resumes synchronization with `phc2sys`.

You can control the resilience of the time synchronization by setting the `ts2phc.holdover` parameter in seconds. This value dictates the maximum time the internal control algorithm can continue synchronizing the PHC after the main time of day (ToD) source such as a GNSS receiver is lost. The algorithm can only continue if it remains in a stable state (SERVO_LOCKED_STABLE). When the process exits this configured holdover period, it signifies an unrecoverable primary signal loss. The system then allows failover to a secondary source such as NTP.
