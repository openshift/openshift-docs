= Implementing worker latency profiles at cluster creation

[IMPORTANT]
====
To edit the configuration of the installer, you will first need to use the command `openshift-install create manifests` to create the default node manifest as well as other manifest YAML files. This file structure must exist before we can add workerLatencyProfile. The platform on which you are installing may have varying requirements. Refer to the Installing section of the documentation for your specific platform.
====

The `workerLatencyProfile` must be added to the manifest in the following sequence:

. Create the manifest needed to build the cluster, using a folder name appropriate for your installation.
. Create a YAML file to define `config.node`. The file must be in the `manifests` directory.
. When defining `workerLatencyProfile` in the manifest for the first time, specify any of the profiles at cluster creation time: `Default`, `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` or `LowUpdateSlowReaction`.

.Verification
* Here is an example manifest creation showing the `spec.workerLatencyProfile` `Default` value in the manifest file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir=<cluster-install-dir>
----
* Edit the manifest and add the value. In this example we use `vi` to show an example manifest file with the "Default" `workerLatencyProfile` value added:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vi <cluster-install-dir>/manifests/config-node-default-profile.yaml
----
+
.Example output
