= Implementing worker latency profiles at cluster creation

[IMPORTANT]
====
To edit the configuration of the installation program, first use the command `openshift-install create manifests` to create the default node manifest and other manifest YAML files. This file structure must exist before you can add `workerLatencyProfile`. The platform on which you are installing might have varying requirements. Refer to the Installing section of the documentation for your specific platform.
====

The `workerLatencyProfile` must be added to the manifest in the following sequence:

. Create the manifest needed to build the cluster, using a folder name appropriate for your installation.
. Create a YAML file to define `config.node`. The file must be in the `manifests` directory.
. When defining `workerLatencyProfile` in the manifest for the first time, specify any of the profiles at cluster creation time: `Default`, `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` or `LowUpdateSlowReaction`.

.Verification
* Here is an example manifest creation showing the `spec.workerLatencyProfile` `Default` value in the manifest file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir=<cluster-install-dir>
----
* Edit the manifest and add the value. In this example we use `vi` to show an example manifest file with the "Default" `workerLatencyProfile` value added:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vi <cluster-install-dir>/manifests/config-node-default-profile.yaml
----
+
.Example output
