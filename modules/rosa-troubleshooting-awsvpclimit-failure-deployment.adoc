.Procedure

Request a quota increase from AWS or delete unused VPCs.

* Request a quota increase from AWS.
.. Sign in to the link:https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS Management Console].
.. Click your user name and select **Service Quotas**.
.. Under **Manage quotas**, select a service to view available quotas.
.. If the quota is adjustable, you can choose the button or the name, and then choose **Request increase**.
.. For **Increase quota value**, enter the new value. The new value must be greater than the current value.
.. Choose **Request**.

* Clean unused VPCs. Before you can delete a VPC, you must first terminate or delete any resources that created a requester-managed network interface in the VPC. For example, you must terminate your EC2 instances and delete your load balancers, NAT gateways, transit gateways, and interface VPC endpoints before deleting a VPC.
.. Sign in to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[AWS EC2 console].
.. Terminate all instances in the VPC. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html[Terminate Amazon EC2 instances].
.. Open the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc[Amazon VPC console].
.. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**.
.. Select the VPC to delete and choose **Actions, Delete VPC**.
.. If you have a Site-to-Site VPN connection, select the option to delete it; otherwise, leave it unselected. Choose **Delete VPC**.
