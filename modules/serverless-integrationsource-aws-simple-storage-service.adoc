= AWS S3 with IntegrationSource

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) Kamelet allows you to consume object storage events such as file uploads or updates from an Amazon S3 bucket and forward them into Knative Eventing. This integration helps {ServerlessProductName} applications react to changes in object storage, such as new files or data updates, without the need for polling.

To configure an `IntegrationSource` for S3, you must provide valid AWS credentials, specify the Amazon S3 bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and its region, and define the event sink, such as a Knative broker.
