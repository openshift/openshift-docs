= About the ocm-role IAM resource

You must create the `ocm-role` IAM resource to enable a Red Hat organization of users to create ROSA clusters.

Some considerations for your `ocm-role` IAM resource are:

* You have only one `ocm-role` per AWS account in a Red Hat organization. You can have multiple `ocm-role` IAM roles in a Red Hat organization as long as these roles are for different AWS accounts.
* Any user in a Red Hat organization may create and link an `ocm-role` IAM resource.
* Only the Red Hat Organization Administrator can unlink an `ocm-role` IAM resource. This limitation is to protect other Red Hat organization members from disturbing the interface capabilities of other users.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you just created a Red Hat account that is not part of an existing organization, this account is also the Red Hat Organization Administrator.
====
+
* Only one `ocm-role` IAM resource can be created per AWS account per Red Hat organization.
* See the associated permission tables for a list of the AWS permissions policy for the basic and admin `ocm-role` IAM resources.

Using the `rosa` CLI, you can link your IAM resource when you create it.

[NOTE]
====
"Linking" or "associating" your IAM resources with your AWS account means creating a trust-policy with your `ocm-role` IAM role and the Red Hat {cluster-manager} AWS role. After creating and linking your IAM resource, you see a trust relationship from your `ocm-role` IAM resource in AWS with the `arn:aws:iam::7333:role/RH-Managed-OpenShift-Installer` resource.
====

After a Red Hat Organization Administrator has created and linked an `ocm-role` IAM resource, all organization members may want to create and link their own `user-role` IAM role. This IAM resource only needs to be created and linked only once per user. If another user in your Red Hat organization has already created and linked an `ocm-role` IAM resource, you need to ensure you have created and linked your own `user-role` IAM role.
