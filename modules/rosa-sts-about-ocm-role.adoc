= About the OpenShift Cluster Manager role resource

You must create the OpenShift Cluster Manager role resource to enable a Red Hat organization of users to create ROSA clusters. Within the context of linking to AWS, a Red Hat organization is a single user within {cluster-manager}.

Some considerations for your OpenShift Cluster Manager role resource are:

* Only one OpenShift Cluster Manager role can be linked per Red Hat organization; however, you can have any number of OpenShift Cluster Manager roles per AWS account. The web UI requires that only one of these roles can be linked at a time.
* Any user in a Red Hat organization may create and link an OpenShift Cluster Manager role resource.
* Only the Red Hat Organization Administrator can unlink an OpenShift Cluster Manager role resource. This limitation is to protect other Red Hat organization members from disturbing the interface capabilities of other users.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you just created a Red Hat account that is not part of an existing organization, this account is also the Red Hat Organization Administrator.

* See "Understanding the {cluster-manager} role" in the Additional resources of this section for a list of the AWS permissions policies for the basic and admin OpenShift Cluster Manager role resources.

Using the `rosa` CLI, you can link your IAM resource when you create it.

[NOTE]
====
"Linking" or "associating" your IAM resources with your AWS account means creating a trust-policy with your OpenShift Cluster Manager role IAM role and the Red Hat {cluster-manager} AWS role. After creating and linking your IAM resource, you see a trust relationship from your OpenShift Cluster Manager role resource in AWS with the `arn:aws:iam::7333:role/RH-Managed-OpenShift-Installer` resource.
====

After a Red Hat Organization Administrator has created and linked an OpenShift Cluster Manager role resource, all organization members may want to create and link their own user role. This IAM resource only needs to be created and linked only once per user. If another user in your Red Hat organization has already created and linked an OpenShift Cluster Manager role, you need to ensure you have created and linked your own user role.
