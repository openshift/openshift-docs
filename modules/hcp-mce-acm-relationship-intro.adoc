= Relationship between {hcp}, {mce-short}, and {rh-rhacm}

You can configure {hcp} by using the {mce}. The multicluster engine is an integral part of {rh-rhacm-first} and is enabled by default with {rh-rhacm}. The {mce-short} cluster lifecycle defines the process of creating, importing, managing, and destroying Kubernetes clusters across various infrastructure cloud providers, private clouds, and on-premises data centers.

The {mce-short} is the cluster lifecycle Operator that provides cluster management capabilities for {product-title} and {rh-rhacm} hub clusters. The {mce-short} enhances cluster fleet management and supports {product-title} cluster lifecycle management across clouds and data centers.

You can use the {mce-short} with {product-title} as a standalone cluster manager or as part of a {rh-rhacm} hub cluster.

[TIP]
====
A management cluster is also known as the hosting cluster.
====

You can deploy {product-title} clusters by using two different control plane configurations: standalone or hosted control planes. The standalone configuration uses dedicated virtual machines or physical machines to host the control plane. With {hcp} for {product-title}, you create control planes as pods on a management cluster without the need for dedicated virtual or physical machines for each control plane.
