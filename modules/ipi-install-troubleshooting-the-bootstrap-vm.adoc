= Troubleshooting the bootstrap VM

By default, the bootstrap VM runs on the same node as the {product-title}
installer. The bootstrap VM runs the Ironic services needed to provision the
control plane. However, running Ironic depends upon successfully downloading the
machine OS and the Ironic agent images. In some cases, the download can fail,
and the installer will report a timeout waiting for the Ironic API.

The bootstrap VM obtains an IP address from the DHCP server on the externally
routable `baremetal` network. To retrieve the IP address, execute the following:

----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases baremetal
----

If the installation program activates the provisioning network, you can use the
provisioning bootstrap IP which defaults to `172.22.0.2`. Viewing the bootstrap
VM's console with `virt-manager` can also be helpful.

To troubleshoot the Ironic services on the bootstrap VM, log in to the VM using
the core user and the SSH key defined in the installation configuration.

----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ ssh core@<bootstrap-vm> -i /path/to/ssh-key/key.txt
----

//note: Is there a specific username and default path to the key?

To view the Ironic logs, execute the following:

----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ sudo journalctl -u ironic
----

To view the logs of the individual containers, execute the following:

----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ sudo podman logs ipa-downloader
[kni@provisioner ~]$ sudo podman logs coreos-downloader
[kni@provisioner ~]$ sudo podman logs ironic
[kni@provisioner ~]$ sudo podman logs ironic-inspector
[kni@provisioner ~]$ sudo podman logs ironic-dnsmasq
