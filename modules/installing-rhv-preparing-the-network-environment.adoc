= Preparing the network environment on {rh-virtualization}

Configure three static IP addresses for the {product-title} cluster and create DNS entries using two of these addresses.

.Procedure

. Reserve three static IP addresses
.. On the network where you plan to install {product-title}, identify three static IP addresses that are outside the DHCP lease pool.
.. Connect to a host on this network and verify that each of the IP addresses is not in use. For example, use arp to check that none of the IP addresses have entries:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ arp 10.35.1.19
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
10.35.1.19 (10.35.1.19) -- no entry
----

.. Reserve three static IP addresses following the standard practices for your network environment.
.. Record these IP addresses for future reference.

. Create DNS entries for the {product-title} REST API and apps domain names using this format:
+
[source,dns]
----
api.<cluster-name>.<base-domain>   <ip-address> <1>
*.apps.<cluster-name>.<base-domain>   <ip-address> <2>
----
<1> For `<cluster-name>`, `<base-domain>`, and `<ip-address>`, specify the cluster name, base domain, and static IP address of your {product-title} API.
<2> Specify the cluster name, base domain, and static IP address of your {product-title} apps (ingress/load balancer).
+
For example:
+
[source,dns]
----
api.my-cluster.virtlab.example.com	10.35.1.19
*.apps.my-cluster.virtlab.example.com	10.35.1.20
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The third static IP address does not require a DNS entry. The {product-title} cluster uses that address for its internal DNS service.
