[id="running-compliance-scans-worker-node_{context}"]
=  Scheduling the result server pod on a worker node

The result server pod mounts the persistent volume (PV) that stores the raw Asset Reporting Format (ARF) scan results. The `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` attributes enable you to configure the location of the result server pod.

This is helpful for those environments where control plane nodes are not permitted to mount persistent volumes.

.Procedure
* Create a `ScanSetting` custom resource (CR) for the Compliance Operator:
.. Define the `ScanSetting` CR, and save the YAML file, for example, `rs-workers.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ScanSetting
metadata:
  name: rs-on-workers
  namespace: openshift-compliance
rawResultStorage:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: "" <1>
  pvAccessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  rotation: 3
  size: 1Gi
  tolerations:
  - operator: Exists <2>
roles:
- worker
- master
scanTolerations:
  - operator: Exists
schedule: 0 1 * * *
----
<1> The Compliance Operator uses this node to store scan results in ARF format.
<2> The result server pod tolerates all taints.

.. To create the `ScanSetting` CR, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f rs-workers.yaml
----

.Verification

* To verify that the `ScanSetting` object is created, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get scansettings rs-on-workers -n openshift-compliance -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
