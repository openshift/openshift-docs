= Overview of CSI volume cloning

A Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume clone represents a duplicate of an existing persistent volume that is its own unique volume on the system at a particular point in time. With cloning, the back-end device creates an exact duplicate of the specified volume, rather than creating a new empty volume. After it has been dynamically provisioned, a volume clone can be consumed as any standard volume would be.

Volume cloning is similar to volume snapshots, although it offers a more efficient method for creating a pre-populated volume copy. For example, a cluster administrator can duplicate a cluster volume by creating another instance of the existing cluster volume.

There are no new API objects required for cloning. The existing `dataSource` field in the PersistentVolumeClaim object is expanded to be able to accept the name of an existing PersistentVolumeClaim in the same namespace.

{product-title} supports CSI volume cloning by default. Be aware that:

* Support is only available for CSI drivers. In-tree and FlexVolumes are not supported.
* {product-title} does not ship with any CSI drivers. It is recommended to use the CSI drivers provided by
link:https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html[community or storage vendors]. Follow the installation instructions provided by the CSI driver.
* CSI drivers may or may not have implemented the volume cloning functionality. See documentation provided by the CSI driver for details.
* {product-title} {product-version} supports version 1.1.0 of the
link:https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec[CSI specification].
