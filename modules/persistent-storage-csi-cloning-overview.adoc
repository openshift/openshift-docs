= Overview of CSI volume cloning

A Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume clone is a duplicate of an existing persistent volume at a particular point in time.

Volume cloning is similar to volume snapshots, although it is more efficient. For example, a cluster administrator can duplicate a cluster volume by creating another instance of the existing cluster volume.

Cloning creates an exact duplicate of the specified volume on the back-end device, rather than creating a new empty volume. After dynamic provisioning, you can use a volume clone just as you would use any standard volume.

No new API objects are required for cloning. The existing `dataSource` field in the `PersistentVolumeClaim` object is expanded so that it can accept the name of an existing PersistentVolumeClaim in the same namespace.

== Support limitations

By default, {product-title} supports CSI volume cloning with these limitations:

* The destination persistent volume claim (PVC) must exist in the same namespace as the source PVC.
* The source and destination storage class must be the same.
* Support is only available for CSI drivers. In-tree and FlexVolumes are not supported.
* CSI drivers might not have implemented the volume cloning functionality. For details, see the CSI driver documentation.
