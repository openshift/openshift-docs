= Creating an AWS IAM role by using the Cloud Credential Operator utility

You can use the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) to create an {aws-short} IAM role for the {aws-short} Load Balancer Operator. An {aws-short} IAM role interacts with subnets and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).

.Prerequisites

* You must extract and prepare the `ccoctl` binary.

.Procedure

. Download the `CredentialsRequest` custom resource (CR) and store it in a directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl --create-dirs -o <credentials_requests_dir>/operator.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/aws-load-balancer-operator/main/hack/operator-credentials-request.yaml
----

. Use the `ccoctl` utility to create an {aws-short} IAM role by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl aws create-iam-roles \
    --name <name> \
    --region=<aws_region> \
    --credentials-requests-dir=<credentials_requests_dir> \
    --identity-provider-arn <oidc_arn>
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
2023/09/12 11:38:57 Role arn:aws:iam::777777777777:role/<name>-aws-load-balancer-operator-aws-load-balancer-operator created <1>
2023/09/12 11:38:57 Saved credentials configuration to: /home/user/<credentials_requests_dir>/manifests/aws-load-balancer-operator-aws-load-balancer-operator-credentials.yaml
2023/09/12 11:38:58 Updated Role policy for Role <name>-aws-load-balancer-operator-aws-load-balancer-operator created
----
<1> Note the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an {aws-short} IAM role that was created for the {aws-short} Load Balancer Operator, such as `arn:aws:iam::777777777777:role/<name>-aws-load-balancer-operator-aws-load-balancer-operator`.
