= Store the EFS variables in a ConfigMap

It is recommended to use a ConfigMap to contain all the environment
variables that are required for the EFS provisioner.

.Procedure

. Define an {product-title} ConfigMap that contains the environment
variables by creating a `configmap.yaml` file that contains following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: efs-provisioner
data:
  file.system.id: <file-system-id> <1>
  aws.region: <aws-region> <2>
  provisioner.name: openshift.org/aws-efs <3>
  dns.name: "" <4>
----
<1> Defines the Amazon Web Services (AWS) EFS file system ID.
<2> The AWS region of the EFS file system, such as `us-east-1`.
<3> The name of the provisioner for the associated StorageClass.
<4> An optional argument that specifies the new DNS name where the EFS volume
is located. If no DNS name is provided, the provisioner will search for the
EFS volume at `<file-system-id>.efs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com`.

. After the file has been configured, create it in your cluster
by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f configmap.yaml -n <namespace>
