= Grouping multiple components within an application

You can use the *+Add* view to add multiple components or services to your project and use the *Topology* view to group applications and resources within an application group.
The following procedure adds a MariaDB database service to an existing application with a Node.js component.


.Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have created and deployed a Node.js application on {product-title} using the *Developer* perspective.

.Procedure

. Create and deploy the MariaDB service to your project:
.. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to the *+Add* view and select the *From Catalog* option to view all available services in the *Developer Catalog*.
.. Select *Databases* to list all the database services and then click *MariaDB* option to see the details for the service.
.. Click *Instantiate Template* to see an automatically populated template with details for the MariaDB service, and then click *Create* to create and view the MariaDB service in the *Topology* view.

. To add the MariaDB service to the existing application group, press kbd:[Shift]+ drag the *mariadb* pod to the application group that contains the Node.Js component. The MariaDB service is added to the existing application group.

. Click the MariaDB service node and confirm that the `app.kubernetes.io/part-of=<application-name>` label is in the *Labels* section in the *Overview* Panel. Adding a component to an application group automatically adds the required labels to the component.
