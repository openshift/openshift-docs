= {ztp} and {cgu-operator-full}

{ztp-first} generates installation and configuration CRs from manifests stored in Git. These artifacts are applied to a centralized hub cluster where {rh-rhacm-first}, the assisted service, and the {cgu-operator-first} use the CRs to install and configure the managed cluster. The configuration phase of the {ztp} pipeline uses the {cgu-operator} to orchestrate the application of the configuration CRs to the cluster. There are several key integration points between {ztp} and the {cgu-operator}.

Inform policies::
By default, {ztp} creates all policies with a remediation action of `inform`. These policies cause {rh-rhacm} to report on compliance status of clusters relevant to the policies but does not apply the desired configuration. During the {ztp} process, after OpenShift installation, the {cgu-operator} steps through the created `inform` policies and enforces them on the target managed cluster(s). This applies the configuration to the managed cluster. Outside of the {ztp} phase of the cluster lifecycle, this allows you to change policies without the risk of immediately rolling those changes out to affected managed clusters. You can control the timing and the set of remediated clusters by using {cgu-operator}.

Automatic creation of ClusterGroupUpgrade CRs::
To automate the initial configuration of newly deployed clusters, {cgu-operator} monitors the state of all `ManagedCluster` CRs on the hub cluster. Any `ManagedCluster` CR that does not have a `ztp-done` label applied, including newly created `ManagedCluster` CRs, causes the {cgu-operator} to automatically create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the following characteristics:

* The `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is created and enabled in the `ztp-install` namespace.
* `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR has the same name as the `ManagedCluster` CR.
* The cluster selector includes only the cluster associated with that `ManagedCluster` CR.
* The set of managed policies includes all policies that {rh-rhacm} has bound to the cluster at the time the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` is created.
* Pre-caching is disabled.
* Timeout set to 4 hours (240 minutes).

+
The automatic creation of an enabled `ClusterGroupUpgrade` ensures that initial zero-touch deployment of clusters proceeds without the need for user intervention. Additionally, the automatic creation of a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR for any `ManagedCluster` without the `ztp-done` label allows a failed {ztp} installation to be restarted by simply deleting the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR for the cluster.

Waves::
Each policy generated from a `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` CR includes a `ztp-deploy-wave` annotation. This annotation is based on the same annotation from each CR which is included in that policy. The wave annotation is used to order the policies in the auto-generated `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. The wave annotation is not used other than for the auto-generated `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.
+
[NOTE]
====
All CRs in the same policy must have the same setting for the `ztp-deploy-wave` annotation. The default value of this annotation for each CR can be overridden in the `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate`. The wave annotation in the source CR is used for determining and setting the policy wave annotation. This annotation is removed from each built CR which is included in the generated policy at runtime.
====
+
The {cgu-operator} applies the configuration policies in the order specified by the wave annotations. The {cgu-operator} waits for each policy to be compliant before moving to the next policy. It is important to ensure that the wave annotation for each CR takes into account any prerequisites for those CRs to be applied to the cluster. For example, an Operator must be installed before or concurrently with the configuration for the Operator. Similarly, the `CatalogSource` for an Operator must be installed in a wave before or concurrently with the Operator Subscription. The default wave value for each CR takes these prerequisites into account.
+
Multiple CRs and policies can share the same wave number. Having fewer policies can result in faster deployments and lower CPU usage. It is a best practice to group many CRs into relatively few waves.

To check the default wave value in each source CR, run the following command against the `out/source-crs` directory that is extracted from the `ztp-site-generate` container image:

[source,terminal]
----
$ grep -r "ztp-deploy-wave" out/source-crs
----

Phase labels::
The `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is automatically created and includes directives to annotate the `ManagedCluster` CR with labels at the start and end of the {ztp} process.
+
When {ztp} configuration postinstallation commences, the `ManagedCluster` has the `ztp-running` label applied. When all policies are remediated to the cluster and are fully compliant, these directives cause the {cgu-operator} to remove the `ztp-running` label and apply the `ztp-done` label.
+
For deployments that make use of the `informDuValidator` policy, the `ztp-done` label is applied when the cluster is fully ready for deployment of applications. This includes all reconciliation and resulting effects of the {ztp} applied configuration CRs. The `ztp-done` label affects automatic `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR creation by {cgu-operator}. Do not manipulate this label after the initial {ztp} installation of the cluster.

Linked CRs::
The automatically created `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR has the owner reference set as the `ManagedCluster` from which it was derived. This reference ensures that deleting the `ManagedCluster` CR causes the instance of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` to be deleted along with any supporting resources.
