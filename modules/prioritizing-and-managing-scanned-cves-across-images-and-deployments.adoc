= Prioritizing and managing scanned CVEs across images and deployments

[role="_abstract"]

By viewing the *Workload CVEs* page, you can get information about the vulnerabilities in applications running on clusters in your system. You can view vulnerability information across images and deployments. 

The *Workload CVEs* page provides more advanced filtering capabilities than the dashboard, including the ability to view images and deployments with vulnerabilities and filter based on image, deployment, namespace, cluster, CVE, component, and component source.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, click *Vulnerability Management* -> *Workload CVEs*.

. Choose the appropriate method to navigate through the images and deployments from the drop-down list, which is in the upper left of the page:
** To view the images and deployments with observed CVEs, select *Image vulnerabilities*.
** To view the images and deployments without observed CVEs, select *Images without vulnerabilities*.

. Optional: Choose the appropriate method to re-organize the information in the *Workload CVEs* page:
** To sort the table in ascending or descending order, select a column heading.
** To filter the table, use the filter bar.
** To select the categories that you want to display in the table, perform the following steps:
... Click *Manage columns*.
... Choose the appropriate method to manage the columns:
**** To view all the categories, click *Select all*.
**** To reset to the default categories, click *Reset to default*.
**** To view only the selected categories, select the one or more categories that you want to view.

** To filter CVEs based on an entity, select the appropriate filters and attributes.
+
To select multiple entities and attributes, click the right arrow icon to add another criteria. Depending on your choices, enter the appropriate information such as text, or select a date or object.
+
The filter entities and attributes are listed in the following table.

** To display a list of namespaces sorted according to the risk priority, click *Prioritize by namespace view*. 
+
You can use this view to quickly identify and address the most critical areas. 
+
In this view, click *<number> deployments* in a table row to return to the workload CVE list view, with filters applied to show only deployments, images and CVEs for the selected namespace.
** To apply the default filters, click *Default filters*.
+
You can select filters for CVE severity and CVE status that are automatically applied when you visit the *Workload CVEs* page. 
+
These filters only apply to this page, and are applied when you visit the page from another section of the {product-title-short} web portal or from a bookmarked URL. They are saved in the local storage of your browser.

** To filter the table based on the severity of a CVE, from the *CVE severity* drop-down list, select one or more severity levels.
+
The following values are associated with the severity of a CVE:
+
*** `Critical`
*** `Important`
*** `Moderate`
*** `Low`

** To filter the table based on the status of a CVE, from the *CVE status* drop-down list, select one or more statuses.
+
The following values are associated with the status of a CVE:
+
*** `Fixable`
*** `Not fixable`

[NOTE]
====
The *Filtered view* icon indicates that the displayed results were filtered based on the criteria that you selected. You can click *Clear filters* to remove all filters, or remove individual filters by clicking on them.

In the list of results, click a CVE, image name, or deployment name to view more information about the item. For example, depending on the item type, you can view the following information:

* Whether a CVE is fixable
* Whether an image is active
* The Dockerfile line in the image that contains the CVE
* External links to information about the CVE in Red{nbsp}Hat and other CVE databases
