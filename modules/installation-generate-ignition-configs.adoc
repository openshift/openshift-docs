[id="installation-generate-ignition-configs_{context}"]
= Creating the Ignition config files

Because you must manually start the cluster machines, you must generate the
Ignition config files that the cluster needs to make its machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain
certificates that expire after 24 hours. You must complete your cluster
installation and keep the cluster running for 24 hours in a non-degraded state
to ensure that the first certificate rotation has finished.
====

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
ifdef::restricted[]
For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host.
endif::restricted[]

.Procedure

* Obtain the Ignition config files:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir=<installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you created an `install-config.yaml` file, specify the directory that contains
it. Otherwise, specify an empty directory. Some installation assets, like
bootstrap X.509 certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not
reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another
cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file
names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution
when copying installation files from an earlier {product-title} version.
