= Enabling the assisted service

{rh-rhacm-first} uses the assisted service to deploy {product-title} clusters. The assisted service is deployed automatically when you enable the MultiClusterHub Operator on {rh-rhacm-first}. After that, you need to configure the `Provisioning` resource to watch all namespaces and to update the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource (CR) with references to the ISO and RootFS images that are hosted on the mirror registry HTTP server.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have {rh-rhacm} with MultiClusterHub enabled.

.Procedure

. Enable the `Provisioning` resource to watch all namespaces and configure mirrors for disconnected environments. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service].

. Update the `AgentServiceConfig` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit AgentServiceConfig
----

. Add the following entry to the `items.spec.osImages` field in the CR:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
- cpuArchitecture: x86_64
    openshiftVersion: "{product-version}"
    rootFSUrl: https://<host>/<path>/rhcos-live-rootfs.x86_64.img
    url: https://<mirror-registry>/<path>/rhcos-live.x86_64.iso
----
+
where:
+
--
<host> :: Is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the target mirror registry HTTP server.
<path> :: Is the path to the image on the target mirror registry.
--
+
Save and quit the editor to apply the changes.
