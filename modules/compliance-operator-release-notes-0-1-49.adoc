== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `openshift-compliance` content did not include platform-specific checks for network types. As a result, OVN- and SDN-specific checks would show as `failed` instead of `not-applicable` based on the network configuration. Now, new rules contain platform checks for networking rules, resulting in a more accurate assessment of network-specific checks. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1994609[*BZ#1994609*])

* Previously, the `ocp4-moderate-routes-protected-by-tls` rule incorrectly checked TLS settings that results in the rule failing the check, even if the connection secure SSL/TLS protocol. Now, the check properly evaluates TLS settings that are consistent with the networking guidance and profile recommendations. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002695[*BZ#2002695*])

* Previously, `ocp-cis-configure-network-policies-namespace` used pagination when requesting namespaces. This caused the rule to fail because the deployments truncated lists of more than 500 namespaces. Now, the entire namespace list is requested, and the rule for checking configured network policies works for deployments with more than 500 namespaces. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2038909[*BZ#2038909*])

* Previously, remediations using the `sshd jinja` macros were hard-coded to specific sshd configurations. As a result, the configurations were inconsistent with the content the rules were checking for and the check would fail. Now, the sshd configuration is parameterized and the rules apply successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049141[*BZ#2049141*])

* Previously, the `ocp4-cluster-version-operator-verify-integrity` always checked the first entry in the Cluter Version Operator (CVO) history. As a result, the upgrade would fail in situations where subsequent versions of {product-title} would be verified. Now, the compliance check result for `ocp4-cluster-version-operator-verify-integrity` is able to detect verified versions and is accurate with the CVO history. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2053602[*BZ#2053602*])

* Previously, the `ocp4-api-server-no-adm-ctrl-plugins-disabled` rule did not check for a list of empty admission controller plugins. As a result, the rule would always fail, even if all admission plugins were enabled. Now, more robust checking of the `ocp4-api-server-no-adm-ctrl-plugins-disabled` rule accurately passes with all admission controller plugins enabled. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2058631[*BZ#2058631*])

* Previously, scans did not contain platform checks for running against Linux worker nodes. As a result, running scans against worker nodes that were not Linux-based resulted in a never ending scan loop. Now, the scan schedules appropriately based on platform type and labels complete successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2056911[*BZ#2056911*])
