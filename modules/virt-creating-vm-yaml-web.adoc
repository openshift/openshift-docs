= Pasting in a pre-configured YAML file to create a virtual machine

Create a virtual machine by writing or pasting a YAML configuration file in the web console in the *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines* screen. A valid `example` virtual machine configuration is provided by default whenever you open the YAML edit screen.

If your YAML configuration is invalid when you click *Create*, an error message indicates the parameter in which the error occurs. Only one error is shown at a time.

[NOTE]
====
Navigating away from the YAML screen while editing cancels any changes to the configuration you have made.
