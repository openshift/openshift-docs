|===
|Field|Type|Description

|`advertiseAddress`
|`string`
|A string that specifies the IP address from which the API server is advertised to members of the cluster. The default value is calculated based on the address of the service network.

|`auditLog.maxFileAge`
|`number`
|How long log files are kept before automatic deletion. The default value of `0` in the `maxFileAge` parameter means a log file is never deleted based on age. This value can be configured.

|`auditLog.maxFileSize`
|`number`
|By default, when the `audit.log` file reaches the `maxFileSize` limit, the `audit.log` file is rotated and {microshift-short} begins writing to a new `audit.log` file. This value can be configured.

|`auditLog.maxFiles`
|`number`
|The total number of log files kept. By default, {microshift-short} retains 10 log files. The oldest is deleted when an excess file is created. This value can be configured.

|`auditLog.profile`
|`Default`, `WriteRequestBodies`, `AllRequestBodies`, or `None`
|Logs only metadata for read and write requests; does not log request bodies except for OAuth access token requests. If you do not specify this field, the `Default` profile is used.

|`namedCertificates`
|`list`
|Defines externally generated certificates and domain names by using custom certificate authorities.

|`namedCertificates.certPath`
|`path`
|The full path to the certificate.

|`namedCertificates.keyPath`
|`path`
|The full path to the certificate key.

|`namedCertificates.names`
|`list`
|Optional. Add a list of explicit DNS names. Leading wildcards are allowed. If no names are provided, the implicit names are extracted from the certificates.

|`subjectAltNames`
|Fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), wildcards such as `*.domain.com`, or IP addresses
|Subject Alternative Names for API server certificates. SANs indicate all of the domain names and IP addresses that are secured by a certificate.

|`debugging.logLevel`
|`Normal`, `Debug`, `Trace`, or `TraceAll`
|Log verbosity. Default is `Normal`.

|`dns.baseDomain`
|`valid domain`
|Base domain of the cluster. All managed DNS records are subdomains of this base.

|`etcd.memoryLimitMB`
|`number`
|By default, `etcd` uses as much memory as needed to handle the load on the system. However, in memory constrained systems, it might be preferred or necessary to limit the amount of memory `etcd` can to use at a given time.

|`ingress.listenAddress`
|IP address, NIC name, or multiple
|Value defaults to the entire network of the host. The valid configurable value is a list that can be either a single IP address or NIC name or multiple IP addresses and NIC names.

|`ingress.ports.http`
|`80`
|Default port shown. Configurable. Valid value is a single, unique port in the 1-65535 range. The values of the `ports.http` and `ports.https` fields cannot be the same.

|`ingress.ports.https`
|`443`
|Default port shown. Configurable. Valid value is a single, unique port in the 1-65535 range. The values of the `ports.http` and `ports.https` fields cannot be the same.

|`ingress.routeAdmissionPolicy.
    namespaceOwnership`
|`Strict` or `InterNamespaceAllowed`
|Describes how hostname claims across namespaces are handled. By default, allows routes to claim different paths of the same hostname across namespaces. Specifying `Strict` prevents routes in different namespaces from claiming the same hostname. If the value is deleted in a customized {microshift-short} `config.yaml`, the `InterNamespaceAllowed` value is automatically set.

|`ingress.status`
|`Managed` or `Removed`
|Router status. Default is `Managed`.

|`kubelet`
|See the {microshift-short} low-latency instructions
|Parameter for passthrough configuration of the kubelet node agent. Used for low-latency configuration. Default value is null.

|`manifests`
|`list of paths`
|The locations on the file system to scan for `kustomization` files to use to load manifests. Set to a list of paths to scan only those paths. Set to an empty list to disable loading manifests. The entries in the list can be glob patterns to match multiple subdirectories. Default values are `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests`, `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/`, `/etc/microshift/manifests`, and `/etc/microshift/manifests.d/`.

|`network.clusterNetwork`
|IP address block
|A block of IP addresses from which pod IP addresses are allocated. IPv4 is the default. Dual-stack entries are supported. The first entry in this field is immutable after {microshift-short} starts. Default range is `10.42.0.0/16`.

|`network.serviceNetwork`
|IP address block
|A block of virtual IP addresses for Kubernetes services. IP address pool for services. IPv4 is the default. Dual-stack entries are supported. The first entry in this field is immutable after {microshift-short} starts. Default range is `10.43.0.0/16`.

|`network.serviceNodePortRange`
|`range`
|The port range allowed for Kubernetes services of type `NodePort`. If not specified, the default range of 30000-32767 is used. Services without a `NodePort` specified are automatically allocated one from this range. This parameter can be updated after {microshift-short} starts.

|`node.hostnameOverride`
|`string`
|The name of the node. The default value is the hostname. If non-empty, this string is used to identify the node instead of the hostname. This value is immutable after {microshift-short} starts.

|`node.nodeIP`
|IPv4 address
|The IPv4 address of the node. The default value is the IP address of the default route.

|`nodeIPv6`
|IPv6 address
|The IPv6 address for the node for dual-stack configurations. Cannot be configured in single stack for either IPv4 or IPv6. Default is an empty value or null.

|`storage.driver`
|`none` or `lvms`
|Default value is empty. An empty value or null field defaults to LVMS deployment.

|`storage.optionalCsiComponents`
|`array`
|Default value is null or an empty array. A null or empty array defaults to deploying `snapshot-controller` and `snapshot-webhook`. Expected values are `csi-snapshot-controller`, `csi-snapshot-webhook`, or `none`. An entry of `none` is mutually exclusive with all other values.
