= Recovering from disk failure

If you see a failure message while inspecting the events associated with the persistent volume claim (PVC), there might be a problem with the underlying volume or disk. Disk and volume provisioning issues often result with a generic error first, such as `Failed to provision volume with StorageClass <storage_class_name>`. A second, more specific error message usually follows.

.Procedure

. Inspect the events associated with a PVC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe pvc <pvc_name> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<pvc_name>` with the name of the PVC. Here are some examples of disk or volume failure error messages and their causes:
+
- *Failed to check volume existence:* Indicates a problem in verifying whether the volume already exists. Volume verification failure can be caused by network connectivity problems or other failures.
+
- *Failed to bind volume:* Failure to bind a volume can happen if the persistent volume (PV) that is available does not match the requirements of the PVC.
+
- *FailedMount or FailedUnMount:* This error indicates problems when trying to mount the volume to a node or unmount a volume from a node. If the disk has failed, this error might appear when a pod tries to use the PVC.
+
- *Volume is already exclusively attached to one node and cannot be attached to another:* This error can appear with storage solutions that do not support `ReadWriteMany` access modes.

. Establish a direct connection to the host where the problem is occurring.

. Resolve the disk issue.

After you have resolved the issue with the disk, you might need to perform the forced cleanup procedure if failure messages persist or reoccur.
