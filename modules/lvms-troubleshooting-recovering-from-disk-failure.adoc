= Recovering from disk failure

If you see a failure message while inspecting the events associated with the persistent volume claim (PVC), there can be a problem with the underlying volume or disk. 

Disk and volume provisioning issues result with a generic error message such as `Failed to provision volume with storage class <storage_class_name>`. The generic error message is followed by a specific volume failure error message.

The following table describes the volume failure error messages:

|===

|Error message |Description

|`Failed to check volume existence` 
|Indicates a problem in verifying whether the volume already exists. Volume verification failure can be caused by network connectivity problems or other failures.

|`Failed to bind volume` 
|Failure to bind a volume can happen if the persistent volume (PV) that is available does not match the requirements of the PVC.

|`FailedMount` or `FailedAttachVolume`
|This error indicates problems when trying to mount the volume to a node. If the disk has failed, this error can appear when a pod tries to use the PVC.

|`FailedUnMount`
|This error indicates problems when trying to unmount a volume from a node. If the disk has failed, this error can appear when a pod tries to use the PVC.

|`Volume is already exclusively attached to one node and cannot be attached to another` 
|This error can appear with storage solutions that do not support `ReadWriteMany` access modes.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You have logged in to the {oc-first} as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure

. Inspect the events associated with a PVC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe pvc <pvc_name> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<pvc_name>` with the name of the PVC.

. Establish a direct connection to the host where the problem is occurring.

. Resolve the disk issue.

.Next steps

* If the volume failure messages persist or recur even after you have resolved the issue with the disk, you must perform a forced clean-up. For more information, see "Performing a forced clean-up".
