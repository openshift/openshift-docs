= Manually enabling the hypershift-addon managed cluster add-on for local-cluster

Enabling the {hcp} feature automatically enables the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on. If you need to enable the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on manually, complete the following steps to use the `hypershift-addon` to install the HyperShift Operator on `local-cluster`.

.Procedure

. Create the `ManagedClusterAddon` add-on named `hypershift-addon` by creating a file that resembles the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
  name: hypershift-addon
  namespace: local-cluster
spec:
  installNamespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----

. Apply the file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----
+
Replace `filename` with the name of the file that you created.

. Confirm that the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on is installed by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedclusteraddons -n local-cluster hypershift-addon
----
+
If the add-on is installed, the output resembles the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME               AVAILABLE   DEGRADED   PROGRESSING
hypershift-addon   True
----

Your `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on is installed and the hosting cluster is available to create and manage hosted clusters.
