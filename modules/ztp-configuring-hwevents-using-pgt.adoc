= Configuring bare-metal events that use HTTP transport

You can configure bare-metal events that use HTTP transport on managed clusters that you deploy with the {ztp-first} pipeline.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.

.Procedure

. Configure the {redfish-operator} Operator by adding the following YAML to `spec.sourceFiles` in the `common-ranGen.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# Bare Metal Event Relay operator
- fileName: BareMetalEventRelaySubscriptionNS.yaml
  policyName: "subscriptions-policy"
- fileName: BareMetalEventRelaySubscriptionOperGroup.yaml
  policyName: "subscriptions-policy"
- fileName: BareMetalEventRelaySubscription.yaml
  policyName: "subscriptions-policy"
----

. Add the `HardwareEvent` CR to `spec.sourceFiles` in your specific group configuration file, for example, in the `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- fileName: HardwareEvent.yaml <1>
  policyName: "config-policy"
  spec:
    nodeSelector: {}
    transportHost: "http://hw-event-publisher-service.openshift-bare-metal-events.svc.cluster.local:9043"
    logLevel: "info"
----
<1> Each baseboard management controller (BMC) requires a single `HardwareEvent` CR only.
+
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} 4.13 or later, you do not need to set the `transportHost` field in the `HardwareEvent` custom resource (CR) when you use HTTP transport with bare-metal events.
====

. Merge any other required changes and files with your custom site repository.

. Push the changes to your site configuration repository to deploy bare-metal events to new sites with {ztp}.

. Create the Redfish Secret by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-bare-metal-events create secret generic redfish-basic-auth \
--from-literal=username=<bmc_username> --from-literal=password=<bmc_password> \
--from-literal=hostaddr="<bmc_host_ip_addr>"
