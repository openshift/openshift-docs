= Configuring bare-metal events that use HTTP transport

You can configure bare-metal events that use HTTP transport on managed clusters that you deploy with the {ztp-first} pipeline.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.

.Procedure

. Configure the {redfish-operator} Operator by adding the following YAML to `spec.sourceFiles` in the `common-ranGen.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# Bare Metal Event Relay operator
- fileName: BareMetalEventRelaySubscriptionNS.yaml
  policyName: "subscriptions-policy"
- fileName: BareMetalEventRelaySubscriptionOperGroup.yaml
  policyName: "subscriptions-policy"
- fileName: BareMetalEventRelaySubscription.yaml
  policyName: "subscriptions-policy"
----

. Add the `HardwareEvent` CR to `spec.sourceFiles` in your specific group configuration file, for example, in the `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- fileName: HardwareEvent.yaml <1>
  policyName: "config-policy"
  spec:
    nodeSelector: {}
    storageType: <storage_class_name> <2>
    transportHost: "http://hw-event-publisher-service.openshift-bare-metal-events.svc.cluster.local:9043"
    logLevel: "info"
----
<1> Each baseboard management controller (BMC) requires a single `HardwareEvent` CR only.
<2> The value that you set for `storageType` is used to populate the `StorageClassName` field for the `PersistentVolumeClaim` (`PVC`) CR that the {redfish-operator} Operator automatically deploys.
The `PVC` CR is used to persist consumer event subscriptions.
+
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} 4.13 or later, you do not need to set the `transportHost` field in the `HardwareEvent` custom resource (CR) when you use HTTP transport with bare-metal events.
====

. Configure a `PersistentVolume` (`PV`) to persist the events subscription.
+
[NOTE]
====
A `PersistentVolume` (`PV`) CR for persisting events subscriptions is required only when you use HTTP transport for events.
====
+
For example, add the following YAML to the `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- fileName: StorageLV.yaml <1>
  policyName: "config-policy"
  spec:
    storageClassDevices:
      - storageClassName: "storage-class-http-events" <2>
        volumeMode: Filesystem
        fsType: xfs
        devicePaths:
          - /dev/disk/by-partlabel/httpevent1
          - /dev/disk/by-partlabel/httpevent2
- fileName: StoragePV.yaml  <3>
  policyName: "config-policy"
  metadata:
    name: pv-storage-bmer
  spec:
    storageClassName: "storage-class-http-events" <4>
      capacity:
        storage: 10Mi
----
+
--
<1> Bare-metal events with HTTP transport requires local storage on the cluster node provided by the Local Storage Operator.
<2> You need `storage-class-http-events` to use HTTP transport with the {redfish-operator}.
Use the `ignitionConfigOverride` field in the related `SiteConfig` CR to manage the disk labels.
<3> Storage for the `cloud-event-proxy` pubsubstore.
+
[NOTE]
====
You need the `StoragePV.yaml` YAML file that creates the `PV` CR only if the `PV` CR is not dynamically created by the Local Storage Operator.
====
<4> The `storageClassName` (`storage-class-http-events`) must match the name that is set in the `PVC` CR that the {redfish-operator} Operator deploys.
--

. Configure a namespace and Operator group for the persistent storage this is used by the HTTP message transporter.
For example, add the following YAML to `spec.sourceFiles` in `common-ranGen.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- fileName: StorageNS.yaml
  policyName: "storage-sub-policy"
- fileName: StorageOperGroup.yaml
  policyName: "storage-sub-policy"
- fileName: StorageOperatorStatus.yaml
  policyName: "storage-sub-policy"
----

. Configure the individual site `SiteConfig` CR that you use to provision the managed cluster.
For example, in `example-sno-site-1.yaml`, add the following YAML to the `spec.clusters.nodes` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ignitionConfigOverride:
  '{"ignition":{"version":"3.2.0"},"storage":{"disks":[{"device":"/dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x11111000000asd123","wipeTable":false,"partitions":[{"sizeMiB":16,"label":"httpevent1","startMiB":350000},{"sizeMiB":16,"label":"httpevent2","startMiB":350016}]}],"filesystem":[{"device":"/dev/disk/by-partlabel/httpevent1","format":"xfs","wipeFilesystem":true},{"device":"/dev/disk/by-partlabel/httpevent2","format":"xfs","wipeFilesystem":true}]}}'
----

. Merge any other required changes and files with your custom site repository.

. Push the changes to your site configuration repository to deploy bare-metal events to new sites with {ztp}.

. Create the Redfish Secret by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-bare-metal-events create secret generic redfish-basic-auth \
--from-literal=username=<bmc_username> --from-literal=password=<bmc_password> \
--from-literal=hostaddr="<bmc_host_ip_addr>"
