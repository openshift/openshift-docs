= Configuration overview

When configuring mediated devices, an administrator must complete the following tasks:

* Create the mediated devices.
* Expose the mediated devices to the cluster.

The `HyperConverged` CR includes APIs that accomplish both tasks.

.Creating mediated devices

[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  mediatedDevicesConfiguration:
    mediatedDevicesTypes: <1>
    - <device_type>
    nodeMediatedDeviceTypes: <2>
    - mediatedDevicesTypes: <3>
      - <device_type>
      nodeSelector: <4>
        <node_selector_key>: <node_selector_value>
...
----
<1> Required: Configures global settings for the cluster.
<2> Optional: Overrides the global configuration for a specific node or group of nodes. Must be used with the global `mediatedDevicesTypes` configuration.
<3> Required if you use `nodeMediatedDeviceTypes`. Overrides the global `mediatedDevicesTypes` configuration for the specified nodes.
<4> Required if you use `nodeMediatedDeviceTypes`. Must include a `key:value` pair.

.Exposing mediated devices to the cluster

[source,yaml]
----
...
  permittedHostDevices:
    mediatedDevices:
    - mdevNameSelector: GRID T4-2Q <1>
      resourceName: nvidia.com/GRID_T4-2Q <2>
...
----
<1> Exposes the mediated devices that map to this value on the host.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can see the mediated device types that your device supports by viewing the contents of `/sys/bus/pci/devices/<slot>:<bus>:<domain>.<function>/mdev_supported_types/<type>/name`, substituting the correct values for your system.

For example, the name file for the `nvidia-231` type contains the selector string `GRID T4-2Q`. Using `GRID T4-2Q` as the `mdevNameSelector` value allows nodes to use the `nvidia-231` type.
====
<2> The `resourceName` should match that allocated on the node. Find the `resourceName` by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get $NODE -o json  \
| jq '.status.allocatable | \
with_entries(select(.key | startswith("nvidia.com/"))) | \
with_entries(select(.value != "0"))'
