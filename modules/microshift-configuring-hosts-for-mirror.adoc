= Configuring hosts for mirror registry access

To configure a {microshift-short} host to use a mirror registry, you must give the {microshift-short} host access to the registry by creating a configuration file that maps the Red Hat registry host names to the mirror.

.Prerequisites
* Your mirror host has access to the internet.
* The mirror host can access the mirror registry.
* You configured the mirror registry for use in your restricted network.
* You downloaded the pull secret and modified it to include authentication to your mirror repository.

.Procedure
. Log into your {microshift-short} host.

. Enable the SSL certificate trust on any host accessing the mirror registry by completing the following steps:

.. Copy the `rootCA.pem` file from the mirror registry, for example, `<registry_path>/quay-rootCA`, to the {microshift-short} host at the `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors` directory.
.. Enable the certificate in the system-wide trust store configuration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo update-ca-trust
----

. Create the `/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/999-microshift-mirror.conf` configuration file that maps the Red Hat registry host names to the mirror registry:

    location = "registry.access.redhat.com"
    mirror-by-digest-only = true

    insecure = false
----
<1> Replace `<registry_host>:<port>` with the host name and port of your mirror registry server, for example, `<microshift-quay:8443>`.

. Enable the {microshift-short} service by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl enable microshift
----

. Reboot the host by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo reboot
----
