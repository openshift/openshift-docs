= Creating a project using the CLI

If allowed by your cluster administrator, you can create a new project.

[NOTE]
====
Projects starting with `openshift-` and `kube-` are considered critical by {product-title}. As such, {product-title} does not allow you to create Projects starting with `openshift-` or `kube-` using the `oc new-project` command. Cluster administrators can create these Projects using the `oc adm new-project` command.
