[id="creating-a-project-using-the-CLI_{context}"]
= Creating a project using the CLI

If allowed by your cluster administrator, you can create a new project.

[NOTE]
====
Projects starting with `openshift-` and `kube-` are considered critical by {product-title}. As such, {product-title} does not allow you to create Projects starting with `openshift-` or `kube-` using the `oc new-project` command. Cluster administrators can create these Projects using the `oc adm new-project` command.
====

[NOTE]
====
You cannot assign an SCC to pods created in one of the default namespaces: `default`, `kube-system`, `kube-public`, `openshift-node`, `openshift-infra`, and `openshift`. You cannot use these namespaces for running pods or services.
