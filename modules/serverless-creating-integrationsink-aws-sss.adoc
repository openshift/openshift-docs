= Creating an IntegrationSink for AWS S3

You can create an `IntegrationSink` API resource to deliver CloudEvents from Knative Eventing to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. This enables you to persist event data as objects in S3, where it can be stored for long-term use, processed by analytics tools, or consumed by downstream applications. You can create an `IntegrationSink` to deliver CloudEvents to an Amazon S3 bucket by applying a YAML manifest.

.Prerequisites

* You have created your AWS credentials and stored them in a Kubernetes Secret in the same namespace as the resource.
* You have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed and are logged in to the cluster.
* You know the namespace where the `IntegrationSink` resource will be created.
* A Knative broker or another event source exists to produce CloudEvents to be delivered to this sink.

.Procedure

. Save the following YAML manifest as `integration-sink-aws-s3.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sinks.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationSink
metadata:
  name: integration-sink-aws-s3
  namespace: knative-samples
spec:
  aws:
    s3:
      arn: "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
      region: "eu-north-1"
    auth:
      secret:
        ref:
          name: "my-secret"
----

. Apply the manifest by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f integration-sink-aws-s3.yaml
----
+
This manifest configures the `IntegrationSink` API to deliver CloudEvents to the Amazon S3 bucket identified by its ARN (`arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket`) in the `eu-north-1` region. The `auth.secret.ref.name` field references the Kubernetes Secret (`my-secret`) that stores your AWS credentials.
