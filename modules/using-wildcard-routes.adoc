= Using wildcard routes

The HAProxy Ingress Controller has support for wildcard routes. The Ingress Operator uses `wildcardPolicy` to configure the `ROUTER_ALLOW_WILDCARD_ROUTES` environment variable of the Ingress Controller.

The default behavior of the Ingress Controller is to admit routes with a wildcard policy of `None`, which is backwards compatible with existing `IngressController` resources.

.Procedure

. Configure the wildcard policy.
.. Use the following command to edit the `IngressController` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit IngressController
----
+
.. Under `spec`, set the `wildcardPolicy` field to `WildcardsDisallowed` or `WildcardsAllowed`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  routeAdmission:
    wildcardPolicy: WildcardsDisallowed # or WildcardsAllowed

.Samples for using a secure wildcard edge terminated route

This example reflects TLS termination occurring on the Ingress Controller before traffic is proxied to the destination. Traffic sent to any hosts in the subdomain
`example.test` (`*.example.test`) is proxied to the exposed service.

The secure edge terminated route specifies the TLS certificate and key
information. The TLS certificate is served by the Ingress Controller front end for all hosts that match the subdomain (`*.example.test`).

. Configure the wildcard policy.

. Create a private key, certificate signing request (CSR), and certificate for the
edge secured route.
+
The instructions on how to do this are specific to your certificate authority and provider. The following example is a simple self-signed certificate for a domain named `*.example.test`:
+
----
# sudo openssl genrsa -out example-test.key 2048
#
# sudo openssl req -new -key example-test.key -out example-test.csr  \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=Mountain View/O=OS3/OU=Eng/CN=*.example.test"
#
# sudo openssl x509 -req -days 366 -in example-test.csr  \
      -signkey example-test.key -out example-test.crt
----

. Generate a wildcard route using the certificate and key:
+
----
$ cat > route.yaml  <<REOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name:  my-service
spec:
  host: www.example.test
  wildcardPolicy: Subdomain
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: my-service
  tls:
    termination: edge
    key: "$(perl -pe 's/\n/\\n/' example-test.key)"
    certificate: "$(perl -pe 's/\n/\\n/' example-test.cert)"
REOF
$ oc create -f route.yaml
----
+
Ensure your DNS entry for `*.example.test` points to your Ingress Controller instances and the route to your domain is available.
+
This example uses `curl` with a local resolver to simulate the DNS lookup:
+
----
# routerip="4.1.1.1"  #  replace with IP address of one of your router instances.
# curl -k --resolve www.example.test:443:$routerip https://www.example.test/
# curl -k --resolve abc.example.test:443:$routerip https://abc.example.test/
# curl -k --resolve anyname.example.test:443:$routerip https://anyname.example.test/
----

For Ingress Controllers that allow wildcard routes, configure the wildcard policy, there are some caveats to the ownership of a subdomain associated with a wildcard route.

Prior to wildcard routes, ownership was based on the claims made for a host name with the namespace with the oldest route winning against any other claimants.
For example, route `r1` in namespace `ns1` with a claim for `one.example.test`
would win over another route `r2` in namespace `ns2` for the same host name
`one.example.test` if route `r1` was older than route `r2`.

In addition, routes in other namespaces were allowed to claim non-overlapping
hostnames. For example, route `rone` in namespace `ns1` could claim
`www.example.test` and another route `rtwo` in namespace `d2` could claim
`c3po.example.test`.

This is still the case if there are _no_ wildcard routes claiming that same
subdomain, such as `example.test` in the previous example.

However, a wildcard route needs to claim all of the host names within a
subdomain, host names of the form `\*.example.test`. A wildcard route's claim
is allowed or denied based on whether or not the oldest route for that subdomain
(`example.test`) is in the same namespace as the wildcard route. The oldest
route can be either a regular route or a wildcard route.

For example, if there is already a route `eldest` that exists in the `ns1`
namespace that claimed a host named `owner.example.test` and, if at a later
point in time, a new wildcard route `wildthing` requesting for routes in that
subdomain (`example.test`) is added, the claim by the wildcard route will only
be allowed if it is the same namespace (`ns1`) as the owning route.

The following examples illustrate various scenarios in which claims for wildcard
routes will succeed or fail.

In the following example, a Ingress Controller that allows wildcard routes will allow non-overlapping claims for hosts in the subdomain `example.test` as long as a
wildcard route has not claimed a subdomain.

----
$ oc project ns1
$ oc expose service myservice --hostname=owner.example.test
$ oc expose service myservice --hostname=aname.example.test
$ oc expose service myservice --hostname=bname.example.test

$ oc project ns2
$ oc expose service anotherservice --hostname=second.example.test
$ oc expose service anotherservice --hostname=cname.example.test

$ oc project otherns
$ oc expose service thirdservice --hostname=emmy.example.test
$ oc expose service thirdservice --hostname=webby.example.test
----

In the following example, a Ingress Controller that allows wildcard routes will not allow the claim for `owner.example.test` or `aname.example.test` to succeed since the owning namespace is `ns1`.

----
$ oc project ns1
$ oc expose service myservice --hostname=owner.example.test
$ oc expose service myservice --hostname=aname.example.test

$ oc project ns2
$ oc expose service secondservice --hostname=bname.example.test
$ oc expose service secondservice --hostname=cname.example.test

$ # Router will not allow this claim with a different path name `/p1` as
$ # namespace `ns1` has an older route claiming host `aname.example.test`.
$ oc expose service secondservice --hostname=aname.example.test --path="/p1"

$ # Router will not allow this claim as namespace `ns1` has an older route
$ # claiming host name `owner.example.test`.
$ oc expose service secondservice --hostname=owner.example.test

$ oc project otherns

$ # Router will not allow this claim as namespace `ns1` has an older route
$ # claiming host name `aname.example.test`.
$ oc expose service thirdservice --hostname=aname.example.test
----

In the following example, a Ingress Controller that allows wildcard routes will allow the claim for `\*.example.test` to succeed since the owning namespace is `ns1` and the wildcard route belongs to that same namespace.

----
$ oc project ns1
$ oc expose service myservice --hostname=owner.example.test

$ # Reusing the route.yaml from the previous example.
$ # spec:
$ #   host: www.example.test
$ #   wildcardPolicy: Subdomain

$ oc create -f route.yaml   #  router will allow this claim.
----

In the following example, a Ingress Controller that allows wildcard routes will not allow the claim for \*.example.test` to succeed since the owning namespace is `ns1` and the wildcard route belongs to another namespace `cyclone`.

----
$ oc project ns1
$ oc expose service myservice --hostname=owner.example.test

$ # Switch to a different namespace/project.
$ oc project cyclone

$ # Reusing the route.yaml from a prior example.
$ # spec:
$ #   host: www.example.test
$ #   wildcardPolicy: Subdomain

$ oc create -f route.yaml   #  router will deny (_NOT_ allow) this claim.
----

Similarly, once a namespace with a wildcard route claims a subdomain, only
routes within that namespace can claim any hosts in that same subdomain.

In the following example, once a route in namespace `ns1` with a wildcard route
claims subdomain `example.test`, only routes in the namespace `ns1` are allowed
to claim any hosts in that same subdomain.

----
$ oc project ns1
$ oc expose service myservice --hostname=owner.example.test

$ oc project otherns

$ # namespace `otherns` is allowed to claim for other.example.test
$ oc expose service otherservice --hostname=other.example.test

$ oc project ns1

$ # Reusing the route.yaml from the previous example.
$ # spec:
$ #   host: www.example.test
$ #   wildcardPolicy: Subdomain

$ oc create -f route.yaml   #  Router will allow this claim.

$ #  In addition, route in namespace otherns will lose its claim to host
$ #  `other.example.test` due to the wildcard route claiming the subdomain.

$ # namespace `ns1` is allowed to claim for deux.example.test
$ oc expose service mysecondservice --hostname=deux.example.test

$ # namespace `ns1` is allowed to claim for deux.example.test with path /p1
$ oc expose service mythirdservice --hostname=deux.example.test --path="/p1"

$ oc project otherns

$ # namespace `otherns` is not allowed to claim for deux.example.test
$ # with a different path '/otherpath'
$ oc expose service otherservice --hostname=deux.example.test --path="/otherpath"

$ # namespace `otherns` is not allowed to claim for owner.example.test
$ oc expose service yetanotherservice --hostname=owner.example.test

$ # namespace `otherns` is not allowed to claim for unclaimed.example.test
$ oc expose service yetanotherservice --hostname=unclaimed.example.test
----

In the following example, different scenarios are shown in which the owner routes
are deleted and ownership is passed within and across namespaces. While a route
claiming host `eldest.example.test` in the namespace `ns1` exists, wildcard
routes in that namespace can claim subdomain `example.test`. When the route for
host `eldest.example.test` is deleted, the next oldest route
`senior.example.test` would become the oldest route and would not affect any
other routes. Once the route for host `senior.example.test` is deleted, the next
oldest route `junior.example.test` becomes the oldest route and block the
wildcard route claimant.

----
$ oc project ns1
$ oc expose service myservice --hostname=eldest.example.test
$ oc expose service seniorservice --hostname=senior.example.test

$ oc project otherns

$ # namespace `otherns` is allowed to claim for other.example.test
$ oc expose service juniorservice --hostname=junior.example.test

$ oc project ns1

$ # Reusing the route.yaml from the previous example.
$ # spec:
$ #   host: www.example.test
$ #   wildcardPolicy: Subdomain

$ oc create -f route.yaml   #  Router will allow this claim.

$ #  In addition, route in namespace otherns will lose its claim to host
$ #  `junior.example.test` due to the wildcard route claiming the subdomain.

$ # namespace `ns1` is allowed to claim for dos.example.test
$ oc expose service mysecondservice --hostname=dos.example.test

$ # Delete route for host `eldest.example.test`, the next oldest route is
$ # the one claiming `senior.example.test`, so route claims are unaffacted.
$ oc delete route myservice

$ # Delete route for host `senior.example.test`, the next oldest route is
$ # the one claiming `junior.example.test` in another namespace, so claims
$ # for a wildcard route would be affected. The route for the host
$ # `dos.example.test` would be unaffected as there are no other wildcard
$ # claimants blocking it.
$ oc delete route seniorservice
