= Creating the `IstioCSR` custom resource

Use this procedure to install the Istio-CSR agent through {cert-manager-operator}.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have enabled the Istio-CSR feature.
* You have created the `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer` resources required for generating certificates for the Istio-CSR agent.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using `Issuer` resource, create the `Issuer` and `Certificate` resources in the {SMProductName} or `Istiod` namespace. Certificate requests are generated in the same namespace, and role-based access control (RBAC) is configured accordingly.  
==== 

.Procedure

. Create a new project for installing Istio-CSR by running the following command. You can use an existing project and skip this step.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project <istio_csr_project_name>
----

. Create the `IstioCSR` custom resource to enable Istio-CSR agent managed by the {cert-manager-operator} for processing Istio workload and control plane certificate signing requests.
+
[NOTE]  
====  
Only one `IstioCSR` custom resource (CR) is supported at a time. If multiple `IstioCSR` CRs are created, only one will be active. Use the `status` sub-resource of `IstioCSR` to check if a resource is unprocessed.  

* If multiple `IstioCSR` CRs are created simultaneously, none will be processed.  
* If multiple `IstioCSR` CRs are created sequentially, only the first one will be processed. 
* To prevent new requests from being rejected, delete any unprocessed `IstioCSR` CRs.
* The Operator does not automatically remove objects created for `IstioCSR`. If an active `IstioCSR` resource is deleted and a new one is created in a different namespace without removing the previous deployments, multiple `istio-csr` deployments may remain active. This behavior is not recommended and is not supported.    
====  

.. Create a YAML file, for example, `istiocsr.yaml`, that defines the `IstioCSR` object:
+
.Example `IstioCSR.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioCSR
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: <istio_csr_project_name>
spec:
  IstioCSRConfig:
    certManager:
      issuerRef:
        name: istio-ca  <1>
        kind: Issuer <2>
        group: cert-manager.io
    istiodTLSConfig:
      trustDomain: cluster.local
    istio:
      namespace: istio-system
----
<1> Specify the `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer` name. It should be the same name as the CA issuer defined in the `issuer.yaml` file.
<2> Specify the `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer` kind. It should be the same kind as the CA issuer defined in the `issuer.yaml` file.

.. Create the `IstioCSR` custom resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f IstioCSR.yaml
----

.Verification

. Verify that the Istio-CSR deployment is ready by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment -n <istio_csr_project_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cert-manager-istio-csr   1/1     1            1           24s
----

. Verify that the Istio-CSR pods are running by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -n <istio_csr_project_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                  	 READY   STATUS	  RESTARTS    AGE
cert-manager-istio-csr-5c979f9b7c-bv57w  1/1     Running  0           45s
----

** Verify that the Istio-CSR pod is not reporting any errors in the logs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <istio_csr_project_name> logs <istio_csr_pod_name>
----

** Verify that the {cert-manager-operator} pod is not reporting any errors by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n cert-manager-operator logs <cert_manager_operator_pod_name>
