[id="cnf-du-required-annotations-for-workload-partitioning_{context}"]

= Required annotations for workload partitioning

Two annotations must be specified to isolate partitioned workloads from each other. Annotate the containing namespace with `workload.openshift.io/allowed` and the pod
with `target.workload.openshift.io`.

Required {product-title} pods and namespaces are already annotated. To add extra pods to the partition, such as supported post-installation operators or any user-added catalog sources, annotate both the namespace and pod on creation.

After you add the namespace annotation, you can control which workloads have access to the reserved CPU resources.
Only pods in namespaces containing the annotation `workload.openshift.io/allowed: <workload-type> [, <workload-type>]` will be considered. Annotated pods that are contained in an unannotated namespace will fail to admit to the cluster. In this case, an error is raised indicating the pod is forbidden because the namespace does not allow the `workload type <workload-type>`.

To run pods on the reserved CPUs, the pods should be isolated on the partitioned resources and must be annotated with `target.workload.openshift.io/<workload-type>`. In the current release the only supported value for <workload-type> is `management`. Future releases might support multiple values for <workload-type>. The value of the annotation is a JSON struct as shown in the following code block.

The `effect` field controls whether the request is a soft or hard rule. It can contain either `PreferredDuringScheduling` for soft requests or `RequiredDuringScheduling` for hard requests. Only `PreferredDuringScheduling` is supported in this release.

[NOTE]
====
For this implementation, pods with multiple annotations are rejected. Future versions might allow multiple workload types with different priorities to support clusters with different types of configurations.
