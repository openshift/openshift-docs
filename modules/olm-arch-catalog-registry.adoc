= Catalog Registry

The Catalog Registry stores CSVs and CRDs for creation in a cluster and stores
metadata about packages and channels.

A _package manifest_ is an entry in the Catalog Registry that associates a
package identity with sets of CSVs. Within a package, channels point to a
particular CSV. Because CSVs explicitly reference the CSV that they replace, a
package manifest provides the Catalog Operator with all of the information that
is required to update a CSV to the latest version in a channel, stepping through
each intermediate version.
