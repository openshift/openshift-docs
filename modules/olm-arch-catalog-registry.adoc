To understand Operator version updates, you must understand how the Catalog Registry organizes package manifests and channels. The registry stores the cluster service versions (CSVs), custom resource definitions (CRDs), and package metadata required for these updates.

A _package manifest_ links a package to a set of Cluster Service Versions (CSVs) in the Catalog Registry. Within a package, a channel points to a specific CSV. Each CSV identifies the older version that it replaces. The Catalog Operator uses this information to update a CSV to the latest version. To complete an update, the Operator installs every intermediate version in the path.
