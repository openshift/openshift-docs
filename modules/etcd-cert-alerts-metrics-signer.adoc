[id="etcd-cert-alerts-metrics-signer_{context}"]
= etcd certificate rotation alerts and metrics signer certificates

Two alert types inform users about pending `etcd` certificate expiration:
[horizontal]
`etcdSignerCAExpirationWarning`:: Occurs 730 days until the signer expires.
`etcdSignerCAExpirationCritical`:: Occurs 365 days until the signer expires.

You can rotate the certificate for the following reasons:

* You receive an expiration alert.
* The private key is leaked.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When a private key is leaked, you must rotate all of the certificates.
====

There is an `etcd` signer for the {product-title} metrics system. Substitute the following metrics parameters in _Rotating the etcd certificate_.

* `etcd-metric-signer` instead of `etcd-signer`
* `etcd-metrics-ca-bundle` instead of `etcd-ca-bundle`
