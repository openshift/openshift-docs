= Release notes for Red Hat {ServerlessProductName} 1.29

{ServerlessProductName} 1.29 is now available. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {ServerlessProductName} on {product-title} are included in this topic.

[id="new-features-1-29-0_{context}"]
== New features

* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving 1.8.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Eventing 1.8.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Kourier 1.8.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative (`kn`) CLI 1.8.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative for Apache Kafka 1.8.
* The `kn func` CLI plug-in now uses `func` 1.10.

* Beginning with {ServerlessProductName} 1.29, the different product versions are available as follows:
** The latest release is available through the `stable` channel.
** Releases older than the latest are available through the version-based channels.
+
To use these, update the channel parameter in the subscription object YAML file from `stable` to the corresponding version-based channel, such as `stable-1.29`.
+
This change allows you to receive updates not only for the latest release, but also for releases in the Maintenance phase.
+
Additionally, you can lock the version of the Knative (`kn`) CLI. For details, see section "Installing the Knative CLI".

* You can now create {ServerlessProductName} functions through developer console using {product-title} Pipelines.

* Multi-container support for Knative Serving is now generally available (GA). This feature allows you to use a single Knative service to deploy a multi-container pod.

* {ServerlessProductName} functions can now override the `readiness` and `liveness` probe values in the `func.yaml` file for individual Node.js and TypeScript functions.

* You can now configure your function to re-deploy automatically to the cluster when its source code changes in the GitHub repository. This allows for more seamless CI/CD integration.

* Eventing integration with Service Mesh is now available as developer preview feature. The integration includes: `PingSource`, `ApiServerSource`, Knative Source for Apache Kafka, Knative Broker for Apache Kafka, Knative Sink for Apache Kafka, `ContainerSource`, and `SinkBinding`.

* This release includes the upgraded Developer Preview for {ServerlessProductName} Logic.

* A `PodDistruptionBudget` and a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` have been added for the `3scale-kourier-gateway` deployment.
** `PodDistruptionBudget` is used to define the minimum availability requirements for pods in a deployment.
** `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` is used to automatically scale the number of pods in the deployment based on demand or on your custom metrics.

* API version `v1alpha1` of the Knative Operator Serving and Eventings CRDs has been removed. You need to use the `v1beta1` version instead. This does not affect the existing installations, because CRDs are updated automatically when upgrading the Serverless Operator.

[id="known-issues-1-29-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

* When updating the secret specified in DomainMapping, simply updating the secret does not trigger the reconcile loop. You need to either rename the secret or delete the Knative Ingress resource to trigger the reconcile loop.

* Webhook Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) settings are overridden by the {ServerlessOperatorName}. As a result, it fails to scale for higher workloads. To work around this issue, manually set the initial replica value that corresponds to your workload.

* `KafkaSource` resources created before {product-title} 1.27 get stuck when being deleted. To work around the issue, after starting to delete a `KafkaSource`, remove the finalizer from the resource.
