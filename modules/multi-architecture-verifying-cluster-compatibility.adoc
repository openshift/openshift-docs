[id="multi-architecture-verifying-cluster-compatibility_{context}"]

= Verifying cluster compatibility

Before you can start adding compute nodes of different architectures to your cluster, you must verify that your cluster is multi-architecture compatible.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)

ifdef::ibm-power-reg[]
[NOTE]
====
When using multiple architectures, hosts for {product-title} nodes must share the same storage layer. If they do not have the same storage layer, use a storage provider such as `nfs-provisioner`.
====

[NOTE]
====
You should limit the number of network hops between the compute and control plane as much as possible.
====
endif::ibm-power-reg[]

.Procedure

* You can check that your cluster uses the architecture payload by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info -o jsonpath="{ .metadata.metadata}"
----

.Verification

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "release.openshift.io/architecture": "multi",
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}
----
You can then begin adding multi-arch compute nodes to your cluster.

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is not using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
 "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/<errata_version>"
}
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To migrate your cluster so the cluster supports multi-architecture compute machines, follow the procedure in xref:../../updating/updating_a_cluster/migrating-to-multi-payload.adoc#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].
