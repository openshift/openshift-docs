= Verifying cluster compatibility 

Before you can start adding compute nodes of different architectures to your cluster, you must verify that your cluster is multi-architecture compatible. 

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)

.Procedure 

* You can check that your cluster uses the architecture payload by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info -o json | jq .metadata.metadata
----

.Verification 

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is using the multi-architecture payload: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ "release.openshift.io/architecture": "multi"
----
You can then begin adding multi-arch compute nodes to your cluster.

. If you see the following output, then your cluster is not using the multi-architecture payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ null
----
To migrate your cluster to one that supports multi-architecture compute machines, follow the procedure in "Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines".
