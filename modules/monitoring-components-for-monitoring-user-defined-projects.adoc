|Component|Description

|Prometheus Operator
|The Prometheus Operator (PO) in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project creates, configures, and manages Prometheus and Thanos Ruler instances in the same project.

|Prometheus
|Prometheus is the monitoring system through which monitoring is provided for user-defined projects. Prometheus sends alerts to Alertmanager for processing.

|Thanos Ruler
|The Thanos Ruler is a rule evaluation engine for Prometheus that is deployed as a separate process. In {product-title}

{product-version}
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
, Thanos Ruler provides rule and alerting evaluation for the monitoring of user-defined projects.

|Alertmanager
|The Alertmanager service handles alerts received from Prometheus and Thanos Ruler. Alertmanager is also responsible for sending user-defined alerts to external notification systems. Deploying this service is optional.
