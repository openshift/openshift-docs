= EgressFirewall custom resource (CR)

You can define one or more rules for an egress firewall. A rule is either an `Allow` rule or a `Deny` rule, with a specification for the traffic that the rule applies to.

The following YAML describes an `EgressFirewall` CR:

.EgressFirewall object
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: EgressFirewall
metadata:
  name: <ovn>
spec:
  egress: <egress_rules>
    ...
----
+
where:
<ovn>:: The name for the object must be `default`.
<egress_rules>:: Specifies a collection of one or more egress network policy rules as described in the following section.

[id="egress-firewall-rules_{context}"]
== EgressFirewall rules

The following YAML describes the rules for an `EgressFirewall` resource. The user can select either an IP address range in CIDR format, a domain name, or use the `nodeSelector` field to allow or deny egress traffic. The `egress` stanza expects an array of one or more objects.

// - OVN-Kubernetes does not support DNS
// - OpenShift SDN does not support port and protocol specification

.Egress policy rule stanza
[source,yaml]
----
egress:
- type: <type>
  to:
    cidrSelector: <cidr_range>
    dnsName: <dns_name>
    nodeSelector: <label_name>: <label_value>
  ports: <optional_port>
      ...
----
+
where:

<type>:: Specifies the type of rule. The value must be either `Allow` or `Deny`.
<to>:: Specifies a stanza describing an egress traffic match rule that specifies the `cidrSelector` field or the `dnsName` field. You cannot use both fields in the same rule.
<cidr_rante>:: Specifies an IP address range in CIDR format.
<dns_name>:: Specifies a DNS domain name.
<nodeSelector>:: Specifies labels which are key and value pairs that the user defines. Labels are attached to objects, such as pods. The `nodeSelector` allows for one or more node labels to be selected and attached to pods.
<ports>:: Specifies an optional field that describes a collection of network ports and protocols for the rule.

.Ports stanza
[source,yaml]
----
ports:
- port:
  protocol:
----
+
where:
<port>:: Specifies a network port, such as `80` or `443`. If you specify a value for this field, you must also specify a value for the `protocol` field.
<protocol>:: Specifies a network protocol. The value must be either `TCP`, `UDP`, or `SCTP`.

[id="egress-firewall-example_{context}"]
== Example EgressFirewall CR

The following example defines several egress firewall policy rules:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: EgressFirewall
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  egress: <1>
  - type: Allow
    to:
      cidrSelector: 1.2.3.0/24
  - type: Deny
    to:
      cidrSelector: 0.0.0.0/0
----
+
where:
<egress>:: Specifies a collection of egress firewall policy rule objects.

The following example defines a policy rule that denies traffic to the host at the `172.16.1.1/32` IP address, if the traffic is using either the TCP protocol and destination port `80` or any protocol and destination port `443`.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: EgressFirewall
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  egress:
  - type: Deny
    to:
      cidrSelector: 172.16.1.1/32
    ports:
    - port: 80
      protocol: TCP
    - port: 443

[id="configuring-NodeSelector-egfw-example_{context}"]
== Example EgressFirewall CR using nodeSelector

As a cluster administrator, you can allow or deny egress traffic to nodes in your cluster by specifying a label using `nodeSelector` field. Labels can be applied to one or more nodes. Labels can be helpful because instead of adding manual rules per node IP address, you can use node selectors to create a label that allows pods behind an egress firewall to access host network pods. The following is an example with the `region=east` label:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: EgressFirewall
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
    egress:
    - to:
        nodeSelector:
          matchLabels:
            region: east
      type: Allow
