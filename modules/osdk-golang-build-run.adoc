= Build and run the Operator

After implementing the new controller, you can build and run your Operator.

.Procedure

. Register the CRD with the Kubernetes API server:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make install
----

. Update the default unit tests. By default, Go-based Operator projects provide unit tests that use the `envtest` framework from the `controller-runtime` libraries to simulate the API portions of a real cluster. These tests require certain Kubernetes server binaries be present locally, including `kubectl`, `kube-apiserver`, and etcd.

.. Use the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/master/hack/setup-envtest.sh[provided script] to download these binaries into the `testbin/` directory and configure your environment to use them.

.. Update your Makefile by replacing your `test` target with the following target:
+
[source,go]
----
# Run tests
ENVTEST_ASSETS_DIR=$(shell pwd)/testbin
test: generate fmt vet manifests
        mkdir -p ${ENVTEST_ASSETS_DIR}
        test -f ${ENVTEST_ASSETS_DIR}/setup-envtest.sh || curl -sSLo ${ENVTEST_ASSETS_DIR}/setup-envtest.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/master/hack/setup-envtest.sh
        source ${ENVTEST_ASSETS_DIR}/setup-envtest.sh; fetch_envtest_tools $(ENVTEST_ASSETS_DIR); setup_envtest_env $(ENVTEST_ASSETS_DIR); go test ./... -coverprofile cover.out
----

.. If you use Git, add `testbin/*` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing these binaries.

.Next steps

After completing this procedure, you can choose from the following options to run your Operator, as described in the following subsections:

* Run locally outside the cluster as a Go program.
* Run as a deployment inside the cluster.
* Deploy by using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
