{SMProductShortName} includes workloads that meet the following criteria:

* The control plane has discovered the workload.
* The workload has an Envoy proxy sidecar injected.

By default, the control plane discovers workloads in all namespaces across the cluster, with the following results:

* Each proxy instance receives configuration for all namespaces, including workloads not enrolled in the mesh.
* Any workload with the appropriate pod or namespace injection label receives a proxy sidecar.

In shared clusters, you might want to limit the scope of {SMProductShortName} to only certain namespaces. This approach is especially useful if multiple service meshes run in the same cluster.
