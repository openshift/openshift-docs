[id="policy-enforcement-soft_{context}"]
= Soft enforcement

Soft enforcement is performed by {product-title-short} Sensor. This enforcement prevents an operation from being initiated. With soft enforcement, Sensor scales the replicas to 0, and prevents pods from being scheduled. In this enforcement, a non-ready deployment is available in the cluster.

By design, Sensor only performs this soft enforcement once, to prevent trapping of update requests to scale the deployment back down again.

If soft enforcement is configured, and Sensor is down, then {product-title-short} cannot perform enforcement.
