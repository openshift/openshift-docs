[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-27107
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:

where:

`name`:: The name of the NetworkPolicy object.
`spec.podSelector`:: A selector that describes the pods to which the policy applies.
ifndef::microshift[]
The policy object can only select pods in the project that defines the NetworkPolicy object.
endif::microshift[]
`ingress.from.podSelector`:: A selector that matches the pods from which the policy object allows ingress traffic. The selector matches pods in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy.
`ingress.ports`:: A list of one or more destination ports on which to accept traffic.
