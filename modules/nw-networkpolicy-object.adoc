= Example NetworkPolicy object

The following annotates an example NetworkPolicy object:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-27107 <1>
spec:
  podSelector: <2>
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: <3>
        matchLabels:
          app: app
    ports: <4>
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
----
<1> The `name` of the NetworkPolicy object.
<2> A selector describing the pods the policy applies to. The policy object can
only select pods in the project that the NetworkPolicy object is defined.
<3> A selector matching the pods that the policy object allows ingress traffic
from. The selector will match pods in any project.
<4> A list of one or more destination ports to accept traffic on.

[NOTE]
====
If you log in as a user with the `cluster-admin` role and access the policy
through the web console, your Container Network Interface (CNI) type determines
the available fields.
