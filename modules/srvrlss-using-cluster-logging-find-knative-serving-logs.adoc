= Using Cluster Logging to find Knative Serving logs

Knative Serving provides default logs for your application. 

.Prerequisites

* xref:../efk-logging-about_{context}[Cluster Logging components] are installed.

.Procedure

. To open the Kibana UI (the visualization tool for Elasticsearch), you must start a local proxy by running the following command to get the Kibana route:

`oc -n openshift-logging get route kibana`

. Log into the Kibana dashboard using the Kibana route as the URL.

. Ensure the index is set to *.all*. If the index is not set to *.all*, only the OpenShift system logs will be listed. 

. You can filter the logs by using the knative-serving namespace. Enter `kubernetes.namespace_name:knative-serving` in the search box to filter results.
+
NOTE: Knative Serving uses structured logging by default. You can enable the parsing of these logs by customizing the xref:../efk-logging-fluentd-json_{context}[ClusterLogging fluentd settings]. This makes the logs more searchable and enables filtering on the log level to quickly identify issues.
