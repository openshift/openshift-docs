= Topology Manager policies

Topology Manager aligns `Pod` resources of all Quality of Service (QoS) classes by collecting topology hints from Hint Providers, such as CPU Manager and Device Manager, and using the collected hints to align the `Pod` resources.

[NOTE]
====
To align CPU resources with other requested resources in a `Pod` spec, the CPU Manager must be enabled with the `static` CPU Manager policy.
====

Topology Manager supports four allocation policies, which you assign in the `cpumanager-enabled` custom resource (CR):

`none` policy::

This is the default policy and does not perform any topology alignment.

`best-effort` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `best-effort` topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource
availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager stores the preferred NUMA Node affinity for that container. If the affinity is not preferred, Topology Manager stores this and admits the pod to the node.

`restricted` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `restricted` topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource
availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager stores the preferred NUMA Node affinity for that container. If the affinity is not
preferred, Topology Manager rejects this pod from the node, resulting in a pod in a `Terminated` state with a pod admission failure.

`single-numa-node` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `single-numa-node` topology management policy, kubelet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager determines if a single NUMA Node affinity is possible. If it is, the pod is admitted to the node. If a single NUMA Node affinity is not possible, the Topology Manager rejects the pod from the node. This results in a pod in a Terminated state with a pod admission failure.
