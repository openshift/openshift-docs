= Topology Manager policies

Topology Manager aligns `Pod` resources of all Quality of Service (QoS) classes by collecting topology hints from Hint Providers, such as CPU Manager and Device Manager, and using the collected hints to align the `Pod` resources.

Topology Manager supports four allocation policies, which you assign in the `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) named `cpumanager-enabled`:

`none` policy::

This is the default policy and does not perform any topology alignment.

`best-effort` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `best-effort` topology management policy, kubelet tries to align all the required resources on a NUMA node according to the preferred NUMA node affinity for that container. Even if the allocation is not possible due to insufficient resources, the Topology Manager still admits the pod but the allocation is shared with other NUMA nodes.

`restricted` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `restricted` topology management policy, kubelet determines the theoretical minimum number of NUMA nodes that can fulfill the request. If the actual allocation requires more than the that number of NUMA nodes, the Topology Manager rejects the admission, placing the pod in a `Terminated` state. If the number of NUMA nodes can fulfill the request, the Topology Manager admits the pod and the pod starts running.

`single-numa-node` policy::

For each container in a pod with the `single-numa-node` topology management policy, kubelet admits the pod if all the resources required by the pod can be allocated on the same NUMA node. If a single NUMA node affinity is not possible, the Topology Manager rejects the pod from the node. This results in a pod in a `Terminated` state with a pod admission failure.
