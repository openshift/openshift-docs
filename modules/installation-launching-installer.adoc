= Deploy the cluster

You can install {product-title} on a compatible cloud.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can run the installation program only once, during initial installation.
====

.Prerequisites

* Configure an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to host your cluster.
* Obtain the {product-title} installer and the pull secret for your cluster.

.Procedure

. Run the installation program:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir=<installation_directory> <1>
----
ifeval::["{context}" == "install-customizations-cloud"]
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the location of your customized
`./install-config.yaml` file.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "installing-aws-network-customizations"]
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the location of your
customized `./install-config.yaml` file.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "installing-aws-default"]
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.  Do not use a directory which
was used for previous installations unless you want to recycle assets from
those earlier clusters.  Because some assets like bootstrap X.509 certificates
have limited expiration times, it is usually better to start with a fresh
installation directory for each new cluster.
+
--
Provide values at the prompts:

.. Optionally, select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation
debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide an SSH key that your `ssh-agent`
process uses to the installer.
====
.. Select AWS as the platform to target.
.. Select the AWS region to deploy the cluster to.
.. Select the base domain for the Route53 service that you configured for your cluster.
.. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
.. Paste the pull secret that you obtained from link:https://cloud.openshift.com/clusters/install[the OpenShift start page].
--
endif::[]
+
[NOTE]
====
If the AWS account that you configured on your host does not have sufficient
permissions to deploy the cluster, the installation process stops, and the
missing permissions are displayed.
====
+
When the cluster deployment completes, directions for accessing your cluster,
including a link to its web console and credentials for the `kubeadmin` user,
display in your terminal.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must not delete the installation program or the files that the installation
program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
====

. Optionally, remove or disable the `AdministratorAccess` policy from the IAM
account that you used to install the cluster.
