= Launching the installer

You can install {product-title} on a compatible cloud.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can run the launch command only once, during initial installation. If you
need to change your cluster later, you must update the configuration manually.
====

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} installer and the access token for your cluster.
* Obtain configuration details for your cloud.

.Procedure

. Run the installer:
+
----
$ openshift-install launch
----
+
After several minutes, things happen and you see a thing to know that your
cluster is online.
 
. Optionally, remove or disable the `AdministratorAccess` policy from the IAM
account that you used to install the cluster.
 
. Optionally, delete the installation media.
