= Deploy the cluster

You can install {product-title} on a compatible cloud.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can run the installation program only once, during initial installation.
====

.Prerequisites

* Configure an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* Obtain the {product-title} installation program and the pull secret for your
cluster.

.Procedure

. Run the installation program:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir=<installation_directory> \ <1>
    --log-level info <2>
----
ifdef::custom-config[]
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the location of your customized
`./install-config.yaml` file.
endif::custom-config[]
ifdef::no-config[]
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.
endif::no-config[]
<2> To view different installation details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or
`error` instead of `info`.
ifdef::no-config[]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Specify an empty directory. Some installation assets, like bootstrap X.509
certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an
installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another
cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file
names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution
when copying installation files from an earlier {product-title} version.
====
+
--
Provide values at the prompts:

.. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation
debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide an SSH key that your `ssh-agent`
process uses to the installation program.
====
ifdef::aws[]
.. Select AWS as the platform to target.
.. If you do not have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) profile stored on your computer, enter the AWS
access key ID and secret access key for the user that you configured to run the
installation program.
.. Select the AWS region to deploy the cluster to.
.. Select the base domain for the Route53 service that you configured for your cluster.
.. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
endif::aws[]
.. Paste the pull secret that you obtained from the
link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull Secret] page on the {cloud-redhat-com} site.
--
endif::no-config[]
+
[NOTE]
====
If the cloud provider account that you configured on your host does not have sufficient
permissions to deploy the cluster, the installation process stops, and the
missing permissions are displayed.
====
+
When the cluster deployment completes, directions for accessing your cluster,
including a link to its web console and credentials for the `kubeadmin` user,
display in your terminal.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours. You must keep the cluster running for 24 hours in a non-degraded state to ensure that the first certificate rotation has finished.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must not delete the installation program or the files that the installation
program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
====
ifdef::aws[]
. Optional: Remove or disable the `AdministratorAccess` policy from the IAM
account that you used to install the cluster.
