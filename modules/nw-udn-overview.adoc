= Overview of user-defined networks

[role="_abstract"]
To secure and improve network segmentation and isolation, administrators can create primary or secondary networks at the namespace level by using the `UserDefinedNetwork` CR.

Before the implementation of user-defined networks (UDN), the OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin for {product-title} only supported a layer 3 topology on the primary or _main_ network. Due to Kubernetes design principles: all pods are attached to the main network, all pods communicate with each other by their IP addresses, and inter-pod traffic is restricted according to network policy.

While the Kubernetes design is useful for simple deployments, this layer 3 topology restricts customization of primary network segment configurations, especially for modern multitenant deployments.

UDN improves the flexibility and segmentation capabilities of the default layer 3 topology for a Kubernetes pod network by enabling custom layer 2 and layer 3 network segments, where all these segments are isolated by default. These segments act as either primary or secondary networks for container pods and virtual machines that use the default OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin. UDNs enable a wide range of network architectures and topologies, enhancing network flexibility, security, and performance.

The following sections further emphasize the benefits and limitations of user-defined networks,`UserDefinedNetwork` CR, how to create the CR, and additional configuration details that might be relevant to your deployment.
