= Telco core RDS engineering considerations

The following engineering considerations are relevant for the telco core common use model.

Worker nodes::
* Worker nodes should run on Intel 3rd Generation Xeon (IceLake) processors or newer.
+
[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, if your worker nodes have Skylake or earlier processors, you must disable the mitigations for silicon security vulnerabilities such as Spectre.
Failure to do can result in a 40% decrease in transaction performance.
====

* Enable IRQ Balancing for worker nodes.
Set the `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` field in the `PerformanceProfile` custom resource (CR) to `false`.
Annotate pods with QoS class of `Guaranteed` to ensure that they are isolated.
See "CPU partitioning and performance tuning" for more information.

All nodes in the cluster::
* Enable Hyper-Threading for all nodes.
* Ensure CPU architecture is `x86_64` only.
* Ensure that nodes are running the stock (non-RT) kernel.
* Ensure that nodes are not configured for workload partitioning.

Power management and performance::
* The balance between power management and maximum performance varies between the `MachineConfigPool` resources in the cluster.

Cluster scaling::
* Scale number of cluster nodes to at least 120 nodes.

CPU partitioning::
* CPU partitioning is configured using `PerformanceProfile` CRs, one for every `MachineConfigPool` CR in the cluster.
See "CPU partitioning and performance tuning" for more information.
