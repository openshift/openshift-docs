= Default console configuration

{op-system-first} nodes installed from an {product-title} {product-version} boot image use a default console that is meant to accomodate most virtualized and bare metal setups. Different cloud and virtualization platforms may use different default settings depending on the chosen architecture. Bare metal installations use the kernel default settings which typically means the graphical console is the primary console and the serial console is disabled.

The default consoles may not match your specific hardware configuration or you might have specific needs that require you to adjust the default console. For example:

* You want to access the emergency shell on the console for debugging purposes.
* Your cloud platform does not provide interactive access to the graphical console, but provides a serial console.
* You want to enable multiple consoles.

Console configuration is inherited from the boot image. This means that new nodes in existing clusters are unaffected by changes to the default console.

You can configure the console for bare metal installations in the following ways:

* Using `coreos-installer` manually on the command line.
* Using the `coreos-installer iso customize` or `coreos-installer pxe customize` subcommands with the `--dest-console` option to create a custom image that automates the process.

[NOTE]
====
For advanced customization, perform console configuration using the `coreos-installer iso` or `coreos-installer pxe` subcommands, and not kernel arguments.
