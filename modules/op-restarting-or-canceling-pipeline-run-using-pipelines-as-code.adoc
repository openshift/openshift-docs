= Manually starting, restarting or canceling a pipeline run using {pac}

You can manually start, restart, or cancel a pipeline run with no events, such as sending a new commit to your branch or raising a pull request. To restart all pipeline runs, use the *Re-run all checks* feature in the GitHub App.

To manually start or restart all or specific pipeline runs, use the following comments:

* The `/test` and `/retest` comment restarts all pipeline runs that match events for this pipeline run.

* The `/test <pipeline_run_name>` and `/retest <pipeline_run_name>` comment starts or restarts a specific pipeline run. You can use this command to start any {pac} pipeline run on the repository, whether or not it was triggered by an event for this pipeline run.

To cancel all or specific pipeline runs, use the following comments:

* The `/cancel` comment cancels all pipeline runs.

* The `/cancel <pipeline_run_name>` comment cancels a specific pipeline run.

The results of the comments are visible under the *Checks* tab of the GitHub App.

The comment starts, restarts, or cancels any pipeline runs only if the comment author meets one of the following requirements:

* The author is the owner of the repository.
* The author is a collaborator on the repository.
* The author is a public member on the organization of the repository.
* The comment author is listed in the `approvers` or `reviewers` section of the `OWNERS` file in the root of the repository, as defined in the https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/owners/[Kubernetes documentation]. {pac} supports the specification for the `OWNERS` and `OWNERS_ALIASES` files. If the `OWNERS` file includes a https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/owners.md#filters[filters] section, {pac} matches approvers and reviewers only against the `.*` filter.

:FeatureName: Using a comment to start a pipeline run that does not match an event
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]


.Procedure

* If you target a pull request and you use the GitHub App, go to the *Checks* tab and click *Re-run all checks*.

* If you target a pull or merge request, use the comments inside your pull request:
+
.Example comment that cancels all pipeline runs
[source]
----
This is a comment inside a pull request.
/cancel
----

* If you target a push request, include the comments within your commit messages.
+
[NOTE]
====
This feature is supported for the GitHub provider only.
====

.. Go to your GitHub repository.

.. Click the *Commits* section.

.. Click the commit where you want to restart a pipeline run.

.. Click on the line number where you want to add a comment.
+
.Example comment that starts or restarts a specific pipeline run
[source]
----
This is a comment inside a commit.
/retest example_pipeline_run
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you run a command on a commit that exists in multiple branches within a push request, the branch with the latest commit is used.

This results in two situations:

* If you run a command on a commit without any argument, such as `/test`, the test is automatically performed on the `main` branch.

* If you include a branch specification, such as `/test branch:user-branch`, the test is performed on the commit where the comment is located with the context of the `user-branch` branch.
