= Installing a ServiceMeshMemberRoll

You must have a Service Mesh Member Roll for the control plane namespace, if the Service Mesh is configured for multi-tenancy. For applications to use the deployed control plane and ingress, their namespaces must be part of a member roll. 

A multi-tenant control plane installation only affects namespaces configured as part of the Service Mesh. You must specify the namespaces associated with the Service Mesh in a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource located in the same namespace as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource and name it `default`.

.ServiceMeshMemberRoll Custom Resource Example
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
 name: default
 Namespace: istio-system
spec:
 members:<1>
 - knative-serving
 - mynamespace
----
<1> A list of namespaces that should be joined into the Service Mesh


.Prerequisites
* Installed Service Mesh Operator.
* A custom resource file that defines the parameters of your Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh control plane.


.Procedure
. Create a YAML file that replicates the ServiceMeshMemberRoll Custom Resource sample.
. Configure the YAML file to include relevant namespaces.
+
[NOTE] 
====
Add all namespaces to which you want to deploy serverless applications. Ensure you retain the `knative-serving` namespace in the member roll.
====
+ 
. Copy the configured YAML into a file `smmr.yaml` and apply it using:
+
----
$ oc apply -f smmr.yaml
