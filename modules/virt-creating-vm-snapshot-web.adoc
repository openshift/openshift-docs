= Creating a virtual machine snapshot in the web console

You can create a virtual machine (VM) snapshot by using the web console.

[NOTE]
====
To create snapshots of an online (Running state) VM with the highest integrity, install the QEMU guest agent.

The QEMU guest agent takes a consistent snapshot by attempting to quiesce the VM’s file system as much as possible, depending on the system workload. This ensures that in-flight I/O is written to the disk before the snapshot is taken. If the guest agent is not present, quiescing is not possible and a best-effort snapshot is taken. The conditions under which the snapshot was taken are reflected in the snapshot indications that are displayed in the web console or CLI.
====

The VM snapshot only includes disks that meet the following requirements:

* Must be either a data volume or persistent volume claim
* Belong to a storage class that supports Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots

.Procedure

. Click *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines* from the side menu.

. Select a virtual machine to open the *VirtualMachine details* page.

. If the virtual machine is running, click *Actions* → *Stop* to power it down.

. Click the *Snapshots* tab and then click *Take Snapshot*.

. Fill in the *Snapshot Name* and optional *Description* fields.

. Expand *Disks included in this Snapshot* to see the storage volumes to be included in the snapshot.

. If your VM has disks that cannot be included in the snapshot and you still wish to proceed, select the *I am aware of this warning and wish to proceed* checkbox.

. Click *Save*.
