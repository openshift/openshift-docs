= Creating a disconnected registry on a registry node

In some cases, you might want to install an {product-title} cluster using a local copy of the installation registry. This might be for enhancing network efficiency because the cluster nodes are on a network that does not have access to the internet.

[NOTE]
====
If you cannot connect to your registry, or you do not have a registry, within your isolated network. Red Hat recommends that you mirror {product-title} content to the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ as the disconnected registry for your cluster. For more information, see "About disconnected installation mirroring".

The subsequent sections indicate that they are optional because they are steps that you must run only when you create a disconnected registry. To create a _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ to host a disconnected registry on a registry node, you must complete all of the subsequent sub-sections that are labeled "(optional)".

== Install the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ on a local host (optional)

This procedure explains how to install the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ on a local host using the `mirror-registry` installer tool. By doing so, users can create a local host registry running on port 443 for the purpose of storing a mirror of {product-title} images.

[NOTE]
====
Installing the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ using the `mirror-registry` CLI tool makes several changes to your machine. After installation, a `/etc/quay-install` directory is created, which has installation files, local storage, and the configuration bundle. Trusted SSH keys are generated in case the deployment target is the local host, and systemd files on the host machine are set up to ensure that container runtimes are persistent. Additionally, an initial user named `init` is created with an automatically generated password. All access credentials are printed at the end of the install routine.

.Prerequisites

Creating a local, or mirrored, copy of the registry by using the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ requires the following components:

* An {product-title} subscription.
* {op-system-base-full} 8 with Podman 3.3 and OpenSSL installed.
* A fully qualified domain name for the Red Hat Quay service, which must resolve through a DNS server.
* Passwordless `sudo` access on the target host.
* Key-based SSH connectivity on the target host. SSH keys are automatically generated for local installations. For remote hosts, you must generate your own SSH keys.
* 2 or more vCPUs.
* 8 GB of RAM.
* About 12 GB for {product-title} {product-version} release images, or about 358 GB for {product-title} {product-version} release images and {product-title} {product-version} Red Hat Operator images. Up to 1 TB per stream or more is suggested.

.Procedure

. Download the `mirror-registry.tar.gz` package for the latest version of the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ found on the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-mirror-registry[OpenShift console *Downloads*] page.

. Install the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ on your local host with your current user account by using the `mirror-registry` tool. For a full list of available flags, see "mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift flags".
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo ./mirror-registry install \
  --quayHostname <host_example_com> \
  --quayRoot <example_directory_name>
----

. Use the user name and password that was generated during installation to log into the registry by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login --authfile pull-secret.txt \
  -u init \
  -p <password> \
  <host_example_com>:8443> \
  --tls-verify=false <1>
----
<1> You can avoid running `--tls-verify=false` by configuring your system to trust the generated rootCA certificates. See "Using SSL to protect connections to Red Hat Quay" and "Configuring the system to trust the certificate authority" for more information.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also log in by accessing the UI at `\https://<host.example.com>:8443` after installation.
====

. You can mirror {product-title} images after logging in. Depending on your requirements, see either the "Mirroring the {product-title} image repository" or the "Mirroring Operator catalogs for use with disconnected clusters" sections that follow.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you experience issues with images stored by the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ due to storage layer problems, you can re-mirror the {product-title} images or reinstall mirror registry on more stable storage.
