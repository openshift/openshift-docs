= Creating a disconnected registry

In some cases, you might want to install an {product-title} cluster using a local copy of the installation registry. This could be for enhancing network efficiency because the cluster nodes are on a network that does not have access to the internet.

A local, or mirrored, copy of the registry requires the following:

* A certificate for the registry node. This can be a self-signed certificate.
* A web server that a container on a system will serve.
* An updated pull secret that contains the certificate and local repository information.

[NOTE]
====
Creating a disconnected registry on a registry node is optional. If you need to create a disconnected registry on a registry node, you must complete all of the following sub-sections.
