[role="_abstract"]
The AWS Load Balancer Operator 1.1.0 release notes summarize all new features and enhancements, notable technical changes, major corrections from the previous version, and any known bugs upon general availability. 

The AWS Load Balancer Operator version 1.1.0 supports the AWS Load Balancer Controller version 2.4.4.

The following advisory is available for the AWS Load Balancer Operator version 1.1.0:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2023:6218[RHEA-2023:6218 Release of AWS Load Balancer Operator on OperatorHub Enhancement Advisory Update]

Notable changes::

* This release uses the Kubernetes API version 0.27.2.

New features::

* The AWS Load Balancer Operator now supports a standardized Security Token Service (STS) flow by using the Cloud Credential Operator.

Bug fixes::

* A FIPS-compliant cluster must use TLS version 1.2. Previously, webhooks for the AWS Load Balancer Controller only accepted TLS 1.3 as the minimum version, resulting in an error such as the following on a FIPS-compliant cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
remote error: tls: protocol version not supported
----
+
Now, the AWS Load Balancer Controller accepts TLS 1.2 as the minimum TLS version, resolving this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-14846[*OCPBUGS-14846*])
