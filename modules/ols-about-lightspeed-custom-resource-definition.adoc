= About the Lightspeed Custom Resource

When you install the {ols-long} Operator, the `OLSConfig` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) gets installed in the {ocp-product-title} cluster. You can create a cluster-scoped custom resource named `cluster` to configure {ols-long} with your Large Language Model provider.

You can configure the `OLSConfig` CR by using either the {ocp-product-title} web console or the CLI.
