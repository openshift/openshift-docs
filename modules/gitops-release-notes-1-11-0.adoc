== New features

The current release adds the following improvement:

* With this update, you can selectively disable the `redis` and `application-controller` components for an Argo CD instance in a specified namespace. These components are enabled by default.
To disable a component, set the `enabled` flag to `false` in the `.spec.<component>.enabled` field of the Argo CD Custom Resource (CR). link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-3723[GITOPS-3723]
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
spec:
  controller:
    enabled: false
  redis:
    enabled: false
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This feature is currently limited to the `redis` and `application-controller` components. It is expected that support for other components will be included in a future {gitops-title} release.

== Fixed issues

The following issues have been resolved in the current release:

* Before this update, the Argo CD Notifications Controller did not support custom certificates added to the `argocd-tls-certs-cm` config map. As a result, notification services with custom certificates did not receive notifications due to the `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` error message. This update fixes the issue by correctly initializing the cert resolver function in the Argo CD Notifications Controller to load all certificates stored in the `argocd-tls-certs-cm` config map. Now, notification services with custom certificates can successfully receive notifications. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-2809[GITOPS-2809]

* Before this update, users would face `PrometheusOperatorRejectedResources` alerts when the {gitops-title} Operator was not installed in the `openshift-gitops-operator` namespace. The problem affected users who upgraded from earlier versions of the {gitops-title} Operator to v1.10. This update fixes the issue by updating the Operator's `serverName` metrics service to reflect the correct installation namespace. Now, users who upgrade or install the {gitops-title} Operator in namespaces other than `openshift-gitops-operator` should not see these alerts. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-3424[GITOPS-3424]
