= oc-mirror compatibility and support

The oc-mirror plugin supports mirroring {product-title} payload images and Operator catalogs for {product-title} versions 4.10 and later.

[NOTE]
====
On `aarch64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures the oc-mirror plugin is only supported for {product-title} versions 4.14 and later.
====

Use the latest available version of the oc-mirror plugin regardless of which versions of {product-title} you need to mirror.

// TODO: Remove this in 4.14
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you used the Technology Preview OCI local catalogs feature for the oc-mirror plugin for {product-title} 4.12, you can no longer use the OCI local catalogs feature of the oc-mirror plugin to copy a catalog locally and convert it to OCI format as a first step to mirroring to a fully disconnected cluster.
