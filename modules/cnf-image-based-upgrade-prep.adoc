= Moving to the Prep stage of the image-based upgrade with {lcao}

When you deploy the {lcao} on a cluster, an `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR is automatically created.
You use this CR to specify the image repository of the seed image, refer to resources for backup and restore, and to move through the different stages.

Once you have created all the resources that you need during the upgrade, you can move on to the `Prep` stage.
For more information, see the _Creating ConfigMap objects for the image-based upgrade with {lcao}_ section.

.Prerequisites

* Created resources to back up and restore your clusters.

.Procedure

. Check that you have patched your `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageBasedUpgrade
metadata:
  name: upgrade
spec:
  stage: Idle
  seedImageRef:
    version: 4.15.2 <1>
    image: <seed_container_image> <2>
    pullSecretRef: <seed_pull_secret> <3>
  autoRollbackOnFailure: {}
#    initMonitorTimeoutSeconds: 1800 <4>
  extraManifests: <5>
  - name: example-extra-manifests-cm
    namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent
  - name: example-catalogsources-cm
    namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent
  oadpContent: <6>
  - name: oadp-cm-example
    namespace: openshift-adp
----
<1> Specify the target platform version. The value must match the version of the seed image.
<2> Specify the repository where the target cluster can pull the seed image from.
<3> Specify the reference to a secret with credentials to pull container images if the images are in a private registry.
<4> (Optional) Specify the time frame in seconds to roll back if the upgrade does not complete within that time frame after the first reboot. If not defined or set to `0`, the default value of `1800` seconds (30 minutes) is used.
<5> (Optional) Specify the list of `ConfigMap` resources that contain your custom catalog sources to retain after the upgrade, and your extra manifests to apply to the target cluster that are not part of the seed image.
<6> Add the `oadpContent` section with the OADP `ConfigMap` information.

. When you are ready to start the `Prep` stage, change the value of the `stage` field to `Prep` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Prep"}}' --type=merge -n openshift-lifecycle-agent
----

If you provide `ConfigMap` objects for OADP resources and extra manifests,, {lcao} validates the specified `ConfigMap` objects during the `Prep` stage.
You may encounter the following issues:

* validation warnings or errors if the {lcao} detects any issues with `extraManifests`
* validation errors if the {lcao} detects any issues with with `oadpContent`

Validation warnings do not block the `Upgrade` stage but you must decide if it is safe to proceed with the upgrade.
These warnings, for example missing CRDs or namespaces, update the `status.conditions` and `annotation` fields in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR with details about the warning.

.Example validation warning
[source,yaml]
----
[...]
metadata:
annotations:
  extra-manifest.lca.openshift.io/validation-warning: '...'
[...]
----

However, validation errors, such as adding `MachineConfig` or Operator manifests to extra manifests, cause the `Prep` stage to fail and block the `Upgrade` stage.

When the validations pass, the cluster creates a new `ostree` stateroot, which involves pulling and unpacking the seed image, and running host level commands.
Finally, all the required images are precached on the target cluster.

.Verification

. Check the status of the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR.
