[id="ztp-image-based-upgrade-prep_{context}"]
= Moving to the Prep stage of the image-based upgrade with {lcao}

When you deploy the {lcao} on a cluster, an `ImageBasedUpgrade` custom resource (CR) is automatically created.

After you created all the resources that you need during the upgrade, you can move on to the `Prep` stage.
For more information, see the "Creating ConfigMap objects for the image-based upgrade with {lcao}" section.

.Prerequisites

* You have created resources to back up and restore your clusters.

.Procedure

. Check that you have patched your `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageBasedUpgrade
metadata:
  name: upgrade
spec:
  stage: Idle
  seedImageRef:
    version: 4.15.2 # <1>
    image: <seed_container_image> # <2>
    pullSecretRef: <seed_pull_secret> # <3>
  autoRollbackOnFailure: {}
#    initMonitorTimeoutSeconds: 1800 # <4>
  extraManifests: # <5>
  - name: example-extra-manifests-cm
    namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent

  oadpContent: # <6>

    namespace: openshift-adp

<1> Target platform version. The value must match the version of the seed image.
<2> Repository where the target cluster can pull the seed image from.
<3> Reference to a secret with credentials to pull container images if the images are in a private registry.
<4> Optional: Time frame in seconds to roll back if the upgrade does not complete within that time frame after the first reboot. If not defined or set to `0`, the default value of `1800` seconds (30 minutes) is used.
<5> Optional: List of `ConfigMap` resources that contain your custom catalog sources to retain after the upgrade and your extra manifests to apply to the target cluster that are not part of the seed image.
<6> List of `ConfigMap` resources that contain the {oadp-short} `Backup` and `Restore` CRs.

. To start the `Prep` stage, change the value of the `stage` field to `Prep` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Prep"}}' --type=merge -n openshift-lifecycle-agent
----

If you provide `ConfigMap` objects for {oadp-short} resources and extra manifests, {lcao} validates the specified `ConfigMap` objects during the `Prep` stage.
You might encounter the following issues: 

* Validation warnings or errors if the {lcao} detects any issues with the `extraManifests` parameters.
* Validation errors if the {lcao} detects any issues with the `oadpContent` parameters.

Validation warnings do not block the `Upgrade` stage but you must decide if it is safe to proceed with the upgrade.
These warnings, for example missing CRDs, namespaces, or dry run failures, update the `status.conditions` for the `Prep` stage and `annotation` fields in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR with details about the warning.

.Example validation warning
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
metadata:
annotations:
  extra-manifest.lca.openshift.io/validation-warning: '...'
# ...
----

However, validation errors, such as adding `MachineConfig` or Operator manifests to extra manifests, cause the `Prep` stage to fail and block the `Upgrade` stage.

When the validations pass, the cluster creates a new `ostree` stateroot, which involves pulling and unpacking the seed image, and running host-level commands.
Finally, all the required images are precached on the target cluster.

.Verification

* Check the status of the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
