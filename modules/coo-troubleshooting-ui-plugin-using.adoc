= Using the {coo-full} troubleshooting panel UI plugin
:icons: font

The **Troubleshooting Panel** is a side-panel that shows a graph of resources and signals related to the information displayed in the main console (in this example the `apiserver` Deployment).
You can use the troubleshooting panel on most console pages such as resources, alerts, metrics, logs, traces, network observability and others.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the {ocp-product-title} cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console.
* You have installed the {coo-full}.
* You have installed the {coo-full} troubleshooting UI plugin.

[NOTE]
====
The troubleshooting panel can display additional signals if you have installed the following Red{nbsp}Hat components in their recommended namespace:

* **Logs:**
** `{ocp-product-title} Logging` (collection)
** `{ocp-product-title} Loki Operator` (store)
* **Network events:**
** `{ocp-product-title} Network observability` (collection)
** `{ocp-product-title} Loki Operator` (store)
* **Traces:** `{ocp-product-title} Distributed Tracing` (collection and store)
====

[NOTE]
====
Users with `ClusterRole/view` (for example `kube:admin`) will get the most complete results.
Other users will see more restricted graphs, showing only data that they have permission to see.

.. Click **Focus** to re-calculate the graph from the main console at any time.
.. Click {sync} to refresh the graph that is currently displayed.
.. The root (top) node represents the resource in the main console window.
.. First-degree neighbors are directly related to the initial resource.
.. Second-degree neighbors are indirectly related via first-degree neighbors.

. Clicking on a node opens the data in the main console. For example if you click on the Log node, the following panel appears:
