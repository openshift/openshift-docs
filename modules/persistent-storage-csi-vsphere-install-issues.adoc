= Removing a third-party vSphere CSI Operator Driver

{product-title} 4.10 includes a built-in version of the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) Operator Driver that is supported by Red Hat. If you have installed a vSphere CSI driver provided by the community or another vendor, upgrades will be prevented in a future release of {product-title}.

If you remove the third-party vSphere CSI driver, you do not need to delete associated persistent volume (PV) objects, and no data loss should occur.

[NOTE]
====
These instructions may not be complete, so consult the vendor or community provider uninstall guide to ensure removal of the driver and components.
====

To uninstall the third-party vSphere CSI Driver:

. Delete the third-party vSphere CSI Driver (VMware vSphere Container Storage Plug-in) Deployment and Daemonset objects.
. Delete the configmap and secret objects that were installed previously with the third-party vSphere CSI Driver.
. Delete the third-party vSphere CSI driver `CSIDriver` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
~ $ oc delete CSIDriver csi.vsphere.vmware.com
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
csidriver.storage.k8s.io "csi.vsphere.vmware.com" deleted
----

After you have removed the third-party vSphere CSI Driver from the {product-title} cluster, installation of Red Hat's vSphere CSI Operator Driver automatically resumes, and any conditions that could block upgrades to {product-title} 4.11, or later, are automatically removed. If you had existing vSphere CSI PV objects, their lifecycle is now managed by Red Hat's vSphere CSI Operator Driver.
