= Creating service monitors

Operator authors can add service target discovery of created monitoring services using the `metrics.CreateServiceMonitor()` helper function, which accepts the newly created service.

.Prerequisites

* Go-based Operator generated using the Operator SDK
* Kubernetes-based cluster with the Prometheus Operator deployed

.Procedure

* Add the `metrics.CreateServiceMonitor()` helper function to your Operator code:

    // restConfig is used for talking to the Kubernetes apiserver

    // Pass the Service(s) to the helper function, which in turn returns the array of ServiceMonitor objects.

        // Handle errors here.
