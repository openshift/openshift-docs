= About log forwarding

By default, the {logging-title} sends logs to the default internal Elasticsearch log store, defined in the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR). If you want to forward logs to other log aggregators, you can use the log forwarding features to send logs to specific endpoints within or outside your cluster.
