Control plane:: The _control plane_, which is composed of control plane machines, manages the {product-title} cluster. The control plane machines manage workloads on the compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.

Cluster Version Operator:: The _Cluster Version Operator_ (CVO) starts the update process for the cluster. It checks with OSUS based on the current cluster version and retrieves the graph which contains available or possible update paths.

Machine Config Operator:: The _Machine Config Operator_ (MCO) is a cluster-level Operator that manages the operating system and machine configurations. Through the MCO, platform administrators can configure and update systemd, CRI-O and Kubelet, the kernel, NetworkManager, and other system features on the worker nodes.

OpenShift Update Service:: The _OpenShift Update Service_ (OSUS) provides over-the-air updates to {product-title}, including to {op-system-first}. It provides a graph, or diagram, that contains the vertices of component Operators and the edges that connect them.

Channels:: _Channels_ declare an update strategy tied to minor versions of {product-title}. The OSUS uses this configured strategy to recommend update edges consistent with that strategy.

Recommended update edge:: A _recommended update edge_ is a recommended update between {product-title} releases.  Whether a given update is recommended can depend on the cluster's configured channel, current version, known bugs, and other information. OSUS communicates the recommended edges to the CVO, which runs in every cluster.

Extended Update Support:: All post-4.7 even-numbered minor releases are labeled as _Extended Update Support_ (EUS) releases. These releases introduce a verified update path between EUS releases, permitting customers to streamline updates of worker nodes and formulate update strategies of EUS-to-EUS {product-title} releases that result in fewer reboots of worker nodes.
