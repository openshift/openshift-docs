Detailed information.

{vmw-full} 7 and VMware Cloud Foundation 4 end of general support::
+
Broadcom has ended general support for {vmw-full} 7 and VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 4. If your existing {product-title} cluster is running on either of these platforms, you must plan to migrate or upgrade your VMware infrastructure to a supported version. {product-title} supports installation on {vmw-short} 8 Update 1 or later, or VCF 5 or later.

Bare Metal Operator has read-only root filesystem by default::
+
As of this update, the Bare Metal Operator has the `readOnlyRootFilesystem` security context setting enabled to meet common hardening recommendations.

MachineSets advertise node architecture for autoscaling::
+
With this update, MachineSets advertise the architecture of their nodes, which allows the autoscaler to intelligently scale MachineSets in multi-architecture environments.

Dynamic Resource Allocation plugin is disabled in the NUMA-aware scheduler::
+
With this update, the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) is disabled so that the secondary scheduler, managed by `numaresources` operator, does not need to handle DRA resources. The Kubernetes project has recently enabled DRA by default, setting specific expectations on the scheduler-plugins project to support watching DRA resources. As a result, the OpenShift topology-aware scheduler (TAS) disables DRA plugin in its profile, and therefore ignores DRA-related custom resources (CRs) when making scheduling decisions.
