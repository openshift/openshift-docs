= Creating a Rolling deployment

Rolling deployments are the default type in {product-title}. You can create a
Rolling deployment using the CLI.

.Procedure

. Create an application based on the example deployment images found in
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/openshift/deployment-example/[DockerHub]:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example
----

. If you have the router installed, make the application available via a route (or
use the service IP directly)
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose svc/deployment-example
----

. Browse to the application at `deployment-example.<project>.<router_domain>` to
verify you see the `v1` image.

. Scale the DeploymentConfig up to three replicas:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale dc/deployment-example --replicas=3
----

. Trigger a new deployment automatically by tagging a new version of the example
as the `latest` tag:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag deployment-example:v2 deployment-example:latest
----

. In your browser, refresh the page until you see the `v2` image.

. When using the CLI, the following command shows how many pods are on version 1
and how many are on version 2. In the web console, the pods are progressively
added to v2 and removed from v1:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe dc deployment-example
----

During the deployment process, the new ReplicationController is incrementally
scaled up. After the new pods are marked as `ready` (by passing their readiness
check), the deployment process continues.

If the pods do not become ready, the process aborts, and the DeploymentConfig
rolls back to its previous version.
