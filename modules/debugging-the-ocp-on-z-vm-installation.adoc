// Module included in the following assemblies:

// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_debugging-the-ocp-on-z-vm-installation.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

== Procedure

. Once the CoreOS install completes, you can monitor the progress of the OpenShift installation by logging in to the bootstrap node from the bastion host.
....
$ ssh core@bootstrap_fqdn_or_ip
....

.. Once you’re in the bootstrap node, you can monitor the bootkube service.
....
$ journalctl -b -f -u bootkube.service
....

Or
....
$ journalctl  -u bootkube.service
....
+
. When the bootstrap process is complete, you can see which operators are online by using the oc client on the bastion host. Cluster operators should progress towards the “Available” state over time.
....
$ oc get clusteroperators
....
