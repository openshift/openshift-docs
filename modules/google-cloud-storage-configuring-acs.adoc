To configure data backups on Google Cloud Storage (GCS), create an integration in {product-title}.

.Prerequisites
* An existing *bucket*.
To create a new bucket, see the official Google Cloud Storage documentation topic link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets[Creating storage buckets].
* A *service account* with the `Storage Object Admin` IAM role in the storage bucket you want to use.
See link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions[Using Cloud IAM permissions] for more information.
* Either a link:https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity[workload identity]
or a *Service account key (JSON)* for the service account. See link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating[Creating a service account]
and link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys[Creating service account keys] for more information.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Scroll down to the *External backups* section and select *Google Cloud Storage*.
. Click *New Integration* (*`add`* icon).
. Enter a name for *Integration Name*.
. Enter the number of backups to retain in the *Backups To Retain* box.
. For *Schedule*, select the backup frequency (daily or weekly) and the time to run the backup process.
. Enter the *Bucket* name in which you want to store the backup.
. When using a workload identity, check *Use workload identity*. Otherwise, enter the contents of
  your service account key file into the *Service account key (JSON)* field.
. Select *Test* to confirm that the integration with GCS is working.
. Select *Create* to generate the configuration.

Once configured, {product-title} automatically backs up all data according to the specified schedule.
