= Using tailored profiles to extend existing ProfileBundles

While the `TailoredProfile` CR enables the most common tailoring operations, the XCCDF standard allows even more flexibility in tailoring OpenSCAP profiles. In addition, if your organization has been using OpenScap previously, you may have an existing XCCDF tailoring file and can reuse it.

The `ComplianceSuite` object contains an optional `TailoringConfigMap` attribute that you can point to a custom tailoring file. The value of the `TailoringConfigMap` attribute is a name of a config map, which must contain a key called `tailoring.xml` and the value of this key is the tailoring contents.

.Procedure

. Browse the available rules for the {op-system-first} `ProfileBundle`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get rules.compliance -n openshift-compliance -l compliance.openshift.io/profile-bundle=rhcos4
----

. Browse the available variables in the same `ProfileBundle`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get variables.compliance -n openshift-compliance -l compliance.openshift.io/profile-bundle=rhcos4
----

. Create a tailored profile named `nist-moderate-modified`:
.. Choose which rules you want to add to the `nist-moderate-modified` tailored profile. This example extends the `rhcos4-moderate` profile by disabling two rules and changing one value. Use the `rationale` value to describe why these changes were made:
+
.Example `new-profile-node.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: TailoredProfile
metadata:
  name: nist-moderate-modified
spec:
  extends: rhcos4-moderate
  description: NIST moderate profile
  title: My modified NIST moderate profile
  disableRules:
  - name: rhcos4-file-permissions-var-log-messages
    rationale: The file contains logs of error messages in the system
  - name: rhcos4-account-disable-post-pw-expiration
    rationale: No need to check this as it comes from the IdP
  setValues:
  - name: rhcos4-var-selinux-state
    rationale: Organizational requirements
    value: permissive

.Attributes for spec variables
[cols="1,2a",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute
|Description

|`extends`
|Name of the `Profile` object upon which this `TailoredProfile` is built.

|`title`
|Human-readable title of the `TailoredProfile`.

|`disableRules`
|A list of name and rationale pairs. Each name refers to a name of a rule object that is to be disabled. The rationale value is human-readable text describing why the rule is disabled.

|`manualRules`
| A list of name and rationale pairs. When a manual rule is added, the check result status will always be `manual` and remediation will not be generated. This attribute is automatic and by default has no values when set as a manual rule.

|`enableRules`
|A list of name and rationale pairs. Each name refers to a name of a rule object that is to be enabled. The rationale value is human-readable text describing why the rule is enabled.

|`description`
|Human-readable text describing the `TailoredProfile`.

|`setValues`
| A list of name, rationale, and value groupings. Each name refers to a name of the value set. The rationale is human-readable text describing the set. The value is the actual setting.
|===
+
.. Add the `tailoredProfile.spec.manualRules` attribute:
+
.Example `tailoredProfile.spec.manualRules.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: TailoredProfile
metadata:
  name: ocp4-manual-scc-check
spec:
  extends: ocp4-cis
  description: This profile extends ocp4-cis by forcing the SCC check to always return MANUAL
  title: OCP4 CIS profile with manual SCC check
  manualRules:
    - name: ocp4-scc-limit-container-allowed-capabilities
      rationale: We use third party software that installs its own SCC with extra privileges
----

.. Create the `TailoredProfile` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n openshift-compliance -f new-profile-node.yaml <1>
----
<1> The `TailoredProfile` object is created in the default `openshift-compliance` namespace.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
tailoredprofile.compliance.openshift.io/nist-moderate-modified created
----

. Define the `ScanSettingBinding` object to bind the new `nist-moderate-modified` tailored profile to the default `ScanSetting` object.
+
.Example `new-scansettingbinding.yaml`
[source,yaml]
