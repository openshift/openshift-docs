= Using tailored profiles
While the `TailoredProfile` CR enables the most common tailoring operations, the XCCDF standard allows even more flexibility in tailoring OpenSCAP profiles. In addition, if your organization has been using OpenScap previously, you may have an existing XCCDF tailoring file and can reuse it.

The `ComplianceSuite` object contains an optional `TailoringConfigMap` attribute that you can point to a custom tailoring file. The value of the `TailoringConfigMap` attribute is a name of a config map, which must contain a key called `tailoring.xml` and the value of this key is the tailoring contents.

.Procedure

. Browse the available rules for the {op-system-first} `ProfileBundle`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get rules.compliance -l compliance.openshift.io/profile-bundle=rhcos4
----

. Browse the available variables in the same `ProfileBundle`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get variables.compliance -l compliance.openshift.io/profile-bundle=rhcos4
----

. Choose which rules you want to add to the `TailoredProfile`. This `TailoredProfile` example disables two rules and changes one value. Use the `rationale` value to describe why these changes were made:
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: TailoredProfile
metadata:
  name: nist-moderate-modified
spec:
  extends: rhcos4-moderate
  title: My modified NIST moderate profile
  disableRules:
  - name: rhcos4-file-permissions-node-config
    rationale: This breaks X application.
  - name: rhcos4-account-disable-post-pw-expiration
    rationale: No need to check this as it comes from the IdP
  setValues:
  - name: rhcos4-var-selinux-state
    rationale: Organizational requirements
    value: permissive

|Attribute
|Description

|`extends`
|Name of the `Profile` object upon which this `TailoredProfile` is built.

|`title`
|Human-readable title of the `TailoredProfile`.

|`disableRules`
|A list of name and rationale pairs. Each name refers to a name of a rule object that is to be disabled. The rationale value is human-readable text describing why the rule is disabled.

|`enableRules`
|A list of name and rationale pairs. Each name refers to a name of a rule object that is to be enabled. The rationale value is human-readable text describing why the rule is enabled.

|`description`
|Human-readable text describing the `TailoredProfile`.

|`setValues`
| A list of name, rationale, and value groupings. Each name refers to a name of the value set. The rationale is human-readable text describing the set. The value is the actual setting.
