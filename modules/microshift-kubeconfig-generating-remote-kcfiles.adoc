= Generating additional kubeconfig files for remote access

You can generate additional `kubeconfig` files to use if you need more host names or IP addresses than the default remote access file provides.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must restart {microshift-short} for configuration changes to be implemented.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have created a `config.yaml` for {microshift-short}.

.Procedure

. Optional: You can show the contents of the `config.yaml`. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat /etc/microshift/config.yaml
----

. Optional: You can show the contents of the remote-access `kubeconfig` file. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat /var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/<hostname>/kubeconfig
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Additional remote access `kubeconfig` files must include one of the server names listed in the {product-title} `config.yaml` file. Additional `kubeconfig` files must also use the same CA for validation.
====

. To generate additional `kubeconfig` files for additional DNS names SANs or external IP addresses, add the entries you need to the `apiServer.subjectAltNames` field. In the following example, the DNS name used is `alt-name-1` and the IP address is `1.2.3.4`.
+
.Example `config.yaml` with additional authentication values
[source,yaml]
----
dns:
  baseDomain: example.com
node:
  hostnameOverride: "microshift-rhel9" <1>
  nodeIP: 10.0.0.1
apiServer:
  subjectAltNames:
  - alt-name-1 <2>
  - 1.2.3.4 <3>
----
<1> Hostname
<2> DNS name
<3> IP address or range

. Restart {microshift-short} to apply configuration changes and auto-generate the `kubeconfig` files you need by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart microshift
----

. To check the contents of additional remote-access `kubeconfig` files, insert the name or IP address as listed in the `config.yaml` into the `cat` command. For example, `alt-name-1` is used in the following example command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat /var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/alt-name-1/kubeconfig
----

. Choose the `kubeconfig` file to use that contains the SAN or IP address you want to use to connect your cluster. In this example, the `kubeconfig` containing`alt-name-1` in the `cluster.server` field is the correct file.

.Example contents of an additional `kubeconfig` file
[source,yaml]
----
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: <base64 CA>
    server: https://alt-name-1:6443 <1>
----
<1> The `/var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/alt-name-1/kubeconfig` file values are from the `apiServer.subjectAltNames` configuration values.

[NOTE]
====
All of these parameters are included as common names (CN) and subject alternative names (SAN) in the external serving certificates for the API server.
