[id="nw-configuring-cluster-wide-proxy_{context}"]
= Trusting the certificate authority of the cluster-wide proxy

You can configure the External DNS Operator to trust the certificate authority of the cluster-wide proxy.

.Procedure

. Create the config map to contain the CA bundle in the `external-dns-operator` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n external-dns-operator create configmap trusted-ca
----

. To inject the trusted CA bundle into the config map, add the `config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true` label to the config map by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n external-dns-operator label cm trusted-ca config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true
----

. Update the subscription of the External DNS Operator by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n external-dns-operator patch subscription external-dns-operator --type='json' -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/config", "value":{"env":[{"name":"TRUSTED_CA_CONFIGMAP_NAME","value":"trusted-ca"}]}}]'
----

.Verification

* After the deployment of the External DNS Operator is completed, verify that the trusted CA environment variable is added, outputted as `trusted-ca`, to the `external-dns-operator` deployment by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n external-dns-operator exec deploy/external-dns-operator -c external-dns-operator -- printenv TRUSTED_CA_CONFIGMAP_NAME
----
