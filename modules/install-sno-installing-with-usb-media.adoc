= Installing with USB media

Installing with USB media involves creating a bootable USB drive with the discovery ISO on the administration node. Booting the server with the USB drive prepares the node for a single node installation.

.Procedure

. On the administration node, insert a USB drive into a USB port.

. Create a bootable USB drive:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dd if=<path-to-iso> of=<path/to/usb> status=progress
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dd if=discovery_image_sno.iso of=/dev/sdb status=progress
----
+
After the ISO is copied to the USB drive, you can use the USB drive to install {product-title}.

. On the server, insert the USB drive into a USB port.

. Reboot the server and enter the BIOS settings upon reboot.

. Change boot drive order to make the USB drive boot first.

. Save and exit the BIOS settings. The server will boot with the discovery image.

. On the administration node, return to the browser and refresh the page. If necessary, reload the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters[Install OpenShift with the Assisted Installer] page and select the cluster name.

. Click *Next* until you reach step 3.

. Select a subnet from the available subnets.

. Keep *Use the same host discovery SSH key* checked. You can change the SSH public key, if necessary.

. Click *Next* to step 4.

. Click *Install cluster*.

. Monitor the installation's progress. Watch the cluster events. After the installation process finishes writing the discovery image to the server's drive, the server will reboot. Remove the USB drive and reset the BIOS to boot to the server's local media rather than the USB drive.

The server will reboot several times, deploying a control plane followed by a worker.
