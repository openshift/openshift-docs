= Creating a bootable ISO image on a USB drive

You can install software using a bootable USB drive that contains an ISO image. Booting the server with the USB drive prepares the server for the software installation.

.Procedure

. On the administration host, insert a USB drive into a USB port.

. Create a bootable USB drive, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dd if=<path_to_iso> of=<path_to_usb> status=progress
----
+
where:
+
--
<path_to_iso>:: is the relative path to the downloaded ISO file, for example, `rhcos-live.iso`.
<path_to_usb>:: is the location of the connected USB drive, for example, `/dev/sdb`.
--
+
After the ISO is copied to the USB drive, you can use the USB drive to install software on the server.
