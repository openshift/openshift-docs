= Installing with USB media

Installing with USB media involves creating a bootable USB drive with the discovery ISO on the administration node. Booting the server with the USB drive prepares the node for a single node installation.

.Procedure

. On the administration node, insert a USB drive into a USB port.

. Create a bootable USB drive:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dd if=<path-to-iso> of=<path/to/usb> status=progress
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dd if=discovery_image_sno.iso of=/dev/sdb status=progress
----
+
After the ISO is copied to the USB drive, you can use the USB drive to install {product-title}.

. On the server, insert the USB drive into a USB port.

. Reboot the server and enter the BIOS settings upon reboot.

. Change boot drive order to make the USB drive boot first.

. Save and exit the BIOS settings. The server will boot with the discovery image.
