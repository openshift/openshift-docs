= About Istio update process

After updating the {SMProduct} Operator, update the {istio} control plane to the latest supported version. The `{istio}` resource configuration determines how the control plane upgrade is performed, including which steps require manual action and which are handled automatically.

The `{istio}` resource configuration includes the following fields that are relevant to the upgrade process:

`spec.version`:: specifies the version of {istio} to install. Use the format `vX.Y.Z`, where `X.Y.Z` is the desired {istio} release. For example, set the field to `v1.24.4` to install {istio} `1.24.4`. Alternatively, set the value to an alias such as `vX.Y-latest` to automatically install the latest supported patch version for the specified minor release.

`spec.updateStrategy`:: defines the strategy for updating the {istio} control plane. The available update strategies are `InPlace` and `RevisionBased`.

[NOTE]
====
To enable automatic patch upgrades, set the approval strategy of the Operator to `Automatic`. When the Operator detects a new patch release and the `version` field uses the `vX.Y-latest` alias, the control plane is updated based on the configured `updateStrategy` type.
