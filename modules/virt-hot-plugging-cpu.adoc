= Hot plugging CPUs on a virtual machine

You can increase or decrease the number of CPU sockets allocated to a virtual machine (VM) without having to restart the VM by using the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines*.
. Select the required VM to open the *VirtualMachine details* page.
. On the *Configuration* tab, click *Edit CPU|Memory*.
. Select the *vCPU* radio button.
. Enter the desired number of vCPU sockets and click *Save*.
+
If the VM is migratable, a live migration is triggered. If not, or if the changes cannot be live-updated, a `RestartRequired` condition is added to the VM.

[NOTE]
====
Memory hot-plug changes are applied immediately. If the VM is migratable, a live migration is triggered. Otherwise, a restart is required. By default, a VM can be hot-plugged with up to 4 times its initial CPU or memory configuration. For example, a VM with 1 vCPU and 2 GiB memory can scale up to 4 vCPUs and 8 GiB before a restart is needed.
You can adjust this behavior cluster-wide using the `maxHotplugRatio` parameter or override it per VM.
