= Creating a ClusterUserDefinedNetwork CR for a Localnet topology

A `Localnet` topology connects the secondary network to the physical underlay. This enables both east-west cluster traffic and access to services running outside the cluster. This topology type requires the additional configuration of the underlying Open vSwitch (OVS) system on cluster nodes.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You created and configured the Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge mapping to associate the logical OVN-Kubernetes network with the physical node network through the OVS bridge. For more information, see "Configuration for a localnet switched topology".

.Procedure

. Create a cluster-wide user-defined network with a `Localnet` topology:

.. Create a YAML file, such as `cluster-udn-localnet.yaml`, to define your request for a `Localnet` topology as in the following example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: ClusterUserDefinedNetwork
metadata:
  name: <cudn_name> # <1>
spec:
  namespaceSelector: # <2>
    matchLabels: # <3>
      "<label_1_key>": "<label_1_value>" # <4>
      "<label_2_key>": "<label_2_value>" # <4>
  network: # <5>
    topology: Localnet # <6>
    localnet: # <7>
      role: Secondary # <8>
      physicalNetworkName: test
      ipam: {lifecycle: Persistent}
      subnets: ["192.168.0.0/16", "2001:dbb::/64"] # <9>
----
<1> Name of your `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` (CUDN) CR.
<2> A label query over the set of namespaces that the cluster CUDN CR applies to. Uses the standard Kubernetes `MatchLabel` selector. Must not point to `default`, `openshift-*`, or any other system namespaces.
<3> Uses the `matchLabels` selector type, where terms are evaluated with an `AND` relationship.
<4> In this example, the CUDN CR is deployed to namespaces that contain both `<label_1_key>=<label_1_value>` and `<label_2_key>=<label_2_value>` labels.
<5> Describes the network configuration.
<6> Specifying a `Localnet` topology type creates one logical switch that is directly bridged to one provider network.
<7> This field specifies the `localnet` topology.
<8> Specifies the `role` for the network configuration. `Secondary` is the only `role` specification supported for the `localnet` topology.
<9> For `Localnet` topology types the following specifies config details for the `subnet` field:
+
* The subnets field is optional.
* The subnets field is of type `string` and accepts standard CIDR formats for both IPv4 and IPv6.
* The subnets field accepts one or two items. For two items, they must be of a different IP family. For example, subnets values of `10.100.0.0/16` and `2001:db8::/64`.
* `localnet` subnets can be omitted. If omitted, users must configure static IP addresses for the pods. As a consequence, port security only prevents MAC spoofing. For more information, see "Configuring pods with a static IP address".

. Apply your request by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create --validate=true -f <example_cluster_udn>.yaml
----
where:
`<example_cluster_udn>.yaml`:: Is the name of your `Localnet` configuration file.

. Verify that your request is successful by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusteruserdefinednetwork <cudn_name> -o yaml
----
where:
`<cudn_name>`:: Is the name you created of your cluster-wide user-defined network.
