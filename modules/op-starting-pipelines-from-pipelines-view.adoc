= Starting pipelines from Pipelines view

After you create a pipeline, you need to start it to execute the included tasks in the defined sequence. You can start a pipeline from the *Pipelines* view, the *Pipeline Details* page, or the *Topology* view.

.Procedure
To start a pipeline using the *Pipelines* view:

. In the *Pipelines* view of the *Developer* perspective, click the *Options* {Kebab} menu adjoining a pipeline, and select *Start*.
. The *Start Pipeline* dialog box displays the *Git Resources* and the *Image Resources* based on the pipeline definition.
+
[NOTE]
====
For pipelines created using the *From Git* option, the *Start Pipeline* dialog box also displays an `APP_NAME` field in the *Parameters* section, and all the fields in the dialog box are prepopulated by the pipeline template.
====
+
.. If you have resources in your namespace, the *Git Resources* and the *Image Resources* fields are prepopulated with those resources. If required, use the drop-downs to select or create the required resources and customize the pipeline run instance.
. Optional: Modify the *Advanced Options* to add the credentials that authenticate the specified private Git server or the image registry.
+
.. Under *Advanced Options*, click *Show Credentials Options* and select *Add Secret*.
.. In the *Create Source Secret* section, specify the following:

... A unique *Secret Name* for the secret.
... In the *Designated provider to be authenticated* section, specify the provider to be authenticated in the *Access to* field, and the base *Server URL*.
... Select the *Authentication Type* and provide the credentials:
* For the *Authentication Type* `Image Registry Credentials`, specify the *Registry Server Address* that you want to authenticate, and provide your credentials in the *Username*, *Password*, and *Email* fields.
+
Select *Add Credentials* if you want to specify an additional *Registry Server Address*.

* For the *Authentication Type* `Basic Authentication`, specify the values for the *UserName* and *Password or Token* fields.
* For the *Authentication Type* `SSH Keys`, specify the value of the *SSH Private Key* field.
+
[NOTE]
====
For basic authentication and SSH authentication, you can use annotations such as:

* `tekton.dev/git-0: https://github.com`
* `tekton.dev/git-1: https://gitlab.com`.
====
+
... Select the check mark to add the secret.

+
You can add multiple secrets based upon the number of resources in your pipeline.

. Click *Start* to start the pipeline.
. The *PipelineRun details* page displays the pipeline being executed. After the pipeline starts, the tasks and steps within each task are executed.
You can:
* Use the zoom in, zoom out, fit to screen, and reset view features using the standard icons, which are in the lower left corner of the *PipelineRun details* page visualization.
* Change the zoom factor of the pipelinerun visualization using the mouse wheel. At specific zoom factors, the background color of the tasks changes to indicate the error or warning status.
* Hover over the tasks to see the details, such as the time taken to execute each step, task name, and task status.
* Hover over the tasks badge to see the total number of tasks and tasks completed.
* Click on a task to see the logs for each step in the task.
* Click the *Logs* tab to see the logs relating to the execution sequence of the tasks. You can also expand the pane and download the logs individually or in bulk, by using the relevant button.
* Click the *Events* tab to see the stream of events generated by a pipeline run.
+
You can use the *Task Runs*, *Logs*, and *Events* tabs to assist in debugging a failed pipeline run or a failed task run.
