= Troubleshooting {ztp} by validating the installation CRs

The ArgoCD pipeline uses the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` custom resources (CRs) to generate the cluster configuration CRs and {rh-rhacm-first} policies. Use the following steps to troubleshoot issues that might occur during this process.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Check that the installation CRs were created by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get AgentClusterInstall -n <cluster_name>
----
+
If no object is returned, use the following steps to troubleshoot the ArgoCD pipeline flow from `SiteConfig` files to the installation CRs.

. Verify that the `ManagedCluster` CR was generated using the `SiteConfig` CR on the hub cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedcluster
----

. If the `ManagedCluster` is missing, check if the `clusters` application failed to synchronize the files from the Git repository to the hub cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get applications.argoproj.io -n openshift-gitops clusters -o yaml
----

.. To identify error logs for the managed cluster, inspect the `status.operationState.syncResult.resources` field. For example, if an invalid value is assigned to the `extraManifestPath` in the `SiteConfig` CR, an error similar to the following is generated:
+
[source,text]
----
syncResult:
  resources:
  - group: ran.openshift.io
    kind: SiteConfig
    message: The Kubernetes API could not find ran.openshift.io/SiteConfig for
      requested resource spoke-sno/spoke-sno. Make sure the "SiteConfig" CRD is
      installed on the destination cluster
----

.. To see a more detailed `SiteConfig` error, complete the following steps:

... In the Argo CD dashboard, click the *SiteConfig* resource that Argo CD is trying to sync. 

... Check the *DESIRED MANIFEST* tab to find the `siteConfigError` field.
+
[source,text]
----
siteConfigError: >- Error: could not build the entire SiteConfig defined by /tmp/kust-plugin-config-1081291903: stat sno-extra-manifest: no such file or directory
----

.. Check the `Status.Sync` field. If there are log errors, the `Status.Sync` field could indicate an `Unknown` error:
+
