= Troubleshooting {ztp} by validating the installation CRs

The ArgoCD pipeline uses the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` custom resources (CRs) to generate the cluster configuration CRs and {rh-rhacm-first} policies. Use the following steps to troubleshoot issues that might occur during this process.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Check that the installation CRs were created by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get AgentClusterInstall -n <cluster_name>
----
+
If no object is returned, use the following steps to troubleshoot the ArgoCD pipeline flow from `SiteConfig` files to the installation CRs.

. Verify that the `ManagedCluster` CR was generated using the `SiteConfig` CR on the hub cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedcluster
----

. If the `ManagedCluster` is missing, check if the `clusters` application failed to synchronize the files from the Git repository to the hub cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe -n openshift-gitops application clusters
----

.. Check for the `Status.Conditions` field to view the error logs for the managed cluster. For example, setting an invalid value for `extraManifestPath:` in the `SiteConfig` CR raises the following error:
