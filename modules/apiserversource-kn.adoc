= Using the ApiServerSource with the Knative CLI (`kn`)

This guide describes the steps required to create, manage, and delete an ApiServerSource using `kn` commands.

.Prerequisites

* You will need to have a Knative Serving and Eventing installation.
* You will need to have created the `default` broker in the same namespace that the ApiServerSource will be installed in.
* You will need to have the `kn` CLI installed.

.Procedure

. Create a service account, role, and role binding for the ApiServerSource.
+
You can do this by creating a file named `authentication.yaml` and copying the following sample code into it:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: events-sa
  namespace: default <1>

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: event-watcher
  namespace: default <1>
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
    resources:
      - events
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: k8s-ra-event-watcher
  namespace: default <1>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: event-watcher
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: events-sa
    namespace: default <1>
----
+
<1> Change this namespace to the namespace that you have selected for installing ApiServerSource.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to re-use an existing service account with the appropriate permissions, you must modify the `authentication.yaml` for that service account.
====
+
Create the service account, role binding and cluster binding by entering the following command:
+
----
$ oc apply --filename authentication.yaml
----

. Create an ApiServerSource event source by entering the following command:
+
----
$ kn source apiserver create testevents --sink broker:default --resource "event:v1" --service-account events-sa --mode Resource
----

. To check that the ApiServerSource is set up correctly, create a Knative service that dumps incoming messages to its log by entering the following command:
+
----
$ kn service create event-display --image quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:v0.13.2
----

. Create a trigger from the `default` broker to filter events to the service created in the previous step by entering the following `kn` command:
+
----
$ kn trigger create event-display-trigger --sink svc:event-display
----

. Create events by launching a pod in the default namespace. You can do this by entering the following command:
+
----
$ oc create deployment hello-node --image=quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display
----

. Check that the controller is mapped correctly by entering the following command and inspecting the output:
+
----
$ kn source apiserver describe testevents
----
+
The output should be similar to:
+
----
Name:                testevents
Namespace:           default
Annotations:         sources.knative.dev/creator=developer, sources.knative.dev/lastModifier=developer
Age:                 3m
ServiceAccountName:  events-sa
Mode:                Resource
Sink:
  Name:       default
  Namespace:  default
  Kind:       Broker (eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1)
Resources:
  Kind:        event (v1)
  Controller:  false
Conditions:
  OK TYPE                     AGE REASON
  ++ Ready                     3m
  ++ Deployed                  3m
  ++ SinkProvided              3m
  ++ SufficientPermissions     3m
  ++ EventTypesProvided        3m
----

.Verification steps

You can verify that the Kubernetes events were sent into the Knative eventing system by looking at the message dumper function logs.

You can view the message dumper function logs by entering the following commands:
----
$ oc get pods
$ oc logs $(oc get pod -o name | grep event-display) -c user-container
----

The logs should contain lines similar to the following:
----
☁️  cloudevents.Event
Validation: valid
Context Attributes,
  specversion: 1.0
  type: dev.knative.apiserver.resource.update
  datacontenttype: application/json
  ...
Data,
  {
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "involvedObject": {
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "fieldPath": "spec.containers{hello-node}",
      "kind": "Pod",
      "name": "hello-node",
      "namespace": "default",
       .....
    },
    "kind": "Event",
    "message": "Started container",
    "metadata": {
      "name": "hello-node.159d7608e3a3572c",
      "namespace": "default",
      ....
    },
    "reason": "Started",
    ...
  }

== Deleting the ApiServerSource

You can delete the ApiServerSource, trigger, service, service account, cluster role, and cluster binding created in this guide by entering the following `kn` and `oc` commands:
----
$ kn trigger delete event-display-trigger
$ kn service delete event-display
$ kn source apiserver delete testevents
$ oc delete -f authentication.yaml
----
