= Limiting the duration of run-once pods

{product-title} relies on run-once pods to perform tasks such as deploying a pod
or performing a build. Run-once pods are pods that have a `RestartPolicy` of
`Never` or `OnFailure`.

The cluster administrator can use the `RunOnceDuration` admission control
plug-in to force a limit on the time that those run-once pods can be active.
Once the time limit expires, the cluster will try to actively terminate those
pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to
run for an excessive amount of time.

The plug-in configuration should include the default active deadline for
run-once pods. This deadline is enforced globally, but can be superseded on
a per-project basis.

.Procedure

To install the `RunOnceDuration` admission controller:

. Edit the `kubeapiserver` to add an `admissionPluginConfig`:
+
----
oc edit kubeapiserver
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: autoscaling.openshift.io <1>
kind: KubeAPIServer

....

unsupportedConfigOverrides:
  admissionPluginConfig:
    enabledPlugins:
    - RunOnceDuration 
----

<1> Specify the `autoscaling.openshift.io` API.
<2> Add the `RunOnceDuration` admission controller. No configuration is required.
