= Limiting the duration of run-once pods

{product-title} relies on run-once pods to perform tasks such as deploying a pod
or performing a build. Run-once pods are pods that have a `RestartPolicy` of
`Never` or `OnFailure`.

The cluster administrator can use the `RunOnceDuration` admission control
plugin to force a limit on the time that those run-once pods can be active.
Once the time limit expires, the cluster will try to actively terminate those
pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to
run for an excessive amount of time.

The plugin configuration should include the default active deadline for
run-once pods. This deadline is enforced globally, but can be superseded on
a per-project basis.

.Procedure

To install the `RunOnceDuration` admission controller:

. Create an *AdmissionConfiguration* object that references the file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
apiVersion: apiserver.k8s.io/v1alpha1
plugins:
- name: RunOnceDurationConfig
  activeDeadlineSecondsOverride: 3600 <1>
----

<1> Specify the global default for run-once pods in seconds.
