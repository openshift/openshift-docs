Tempo query frontend fails to fetch trace JSON::
In the Jaeger UI, clicking on *Trace* and refreshing the page, or accessing *Trace* -> *Trace Timeline* -> *Trace JSON* from the Tempo query frontend, might result in the Tempo query pod failing with an EOF error.

To work around this problem, use the distributed tracing UI plugin to view traces.
