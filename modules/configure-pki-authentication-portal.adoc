= Configuring PKI authentication by using the RHACS portal

You can configure Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication by using the {product-title-short} portal.

.Procedure
. On the {product-title-short} portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access Control*.
. Click *Create Auth Provider* and select *User Certificates* from the drop-down list.
. In the *Name* field, specify a name for this authentication provider.
. In the *CA certificate(s) (PEM)* field, paste your root CA certificate in PEM format.
. Assign a *Minimum access role* for users who access {product-title-short} using PKI authentication. A user must have the permissions granted to this role or a role with higher permissions to log in to {product-title-short}. 
+
[TIP]
====
For security, Red Hat recommends first setting the *Minimum access role* to *None* while you complete setup. Later, you can return to the *Access Control* page to set up more tailored access rules based on user metadata from your identity provider.
====

. To add access rules for users and groups accessing {product-title-short}, click *Add new rule* in the *Rules* section. For example, to give the *Admin* role to a user called `administrator`, you can use the following key-value pairs to create access rules:
+
|===
| *Key* | *Value*
|Name
|administrator
|Role
|Admin
|===
. Click *Save*.
