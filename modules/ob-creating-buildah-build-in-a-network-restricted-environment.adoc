= Creating buildah build in a network-restricted environment

[role="_abstract"]
You can create a `buildah` build in a network-restricted environment by mirroring the images required by the `buildah` build strategy. Mirroring the images eliminates the need to access public registries and ensures that your clusters only use container images that comply with your organization's controls on external content.

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster can connect and interact with the Git source that you can use to create the buildah build.

.Procedure

. Run the following command to mirror the images required by the `buildah` build strategy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror --insecure -a <registry_authentication> registry.redhat.io/ubi8/buildah@sha256:1c89cc3cab0ac0fc7387c1fe5e63443468219aab6fd531c8dad6d22fd999819e <mirror_registry>/<repo>/ubi8_buildah
----
+

. Perform the steps mentioned in the "Creating a buildah build" section.
