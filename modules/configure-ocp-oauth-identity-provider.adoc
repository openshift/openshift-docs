= Configuring {ocp} Oauth server as an identity provider in {product-title}

[role="_abstract"]
Use the instructions in this section to integrate the built-in {ocp} OAuth server as an identity provider for {product-title}.

.Prerequisites
* You must have the `AuthProvider` permission to configure identity providers in {product-title}.
* You must have already configured users and groups in {ocp} OAuth server.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access Control*.
. Open the *Add an Auth Provider* menu and select *OpenShift Auth*.
. Enter a name for the authentication provider in the *Name* field.
. Choose a *Minimum access role* for users accessing {product-title} by using the selected identity provider.
+
[TIP]
====
For security, Red Hat recommends setting the *Minimum access role* to *None* while you complete setup. Later, you can return to the *Access Control* page to set up more tailored access rules based on user metadata from your identity provider.
====
. Use the *Rules* section, to add access rules for users and groups accessing {product-title}. For example, to give *Admin* role to a user called `administrator`, select *User* as *Key*, *administrator* as *Value*, and *Admin* as the *Role*. Use *Add new rule* to add more rules.
. Click *Save*.
