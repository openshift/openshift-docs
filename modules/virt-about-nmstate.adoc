= About nmstate

{VirtProductName} uses link:https://nmstate.github.io/[`nmstate`] to report on and configure the state of the node network. This makes it possible to modify network policy configuration, such as by creating a Linux bridge on all nodes, by applying a single configuration manifest to the cluster.

Node networking is monitored and updated by the following objects:

`NodeNetworkState`:: Reports the state of the network on that node.
`NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy`:: Describes the requested network configuration on nodes. You update the node network configuration, including adding and removing interfaces, by applying a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest to the cluster.
`NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment`:: Reports the network policies enacted upon each node.

{VirtProductName} supports the use of the following nmstate interface types:

* Linux Bridge

* VLAN

* Bond

* Ethernet

[NOTE]
====
If your {product-title} cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes as the default Container Network Interface (CNI) provider, you cannot attach a Linux bridge or bonding to the default interface of a host because of a change in the host network topology of OVN-Kubernetes. As a workaround, you can use a secondary network interface connected to your host, or switch to the OpenShift SDN default CNI provider.
