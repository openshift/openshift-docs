= Upgrading the LokiStack storage schema

If you are using the {clo} with the {loki-op}, the {clo} 5.9 or later supports the `v13` schema version in the `LokiStack` custom resource. Upgrading to the `v13` schema version is recommended because it is the schema version to be supported going forward.

.Procedure

* Add the `v13` schema version in the `LokiStack` custom resource as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
# ...
spec:
# ...
  storage:
    schemas:
    # ...
      version: v12 # <1>
    - effectiveDate: "<yyyy>-<mm>-<future_dd>" # <2>
      version: v13
# ...
----
<1> Do not delete. Data persists in its original schema version. Keep the previous schema versions to avoid data loss.
<2> Set a future date that has not yet started in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone.
+
[TIP]
====
To edit the `LokiStack` custom resource, you can run the `oc edit` command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit lokistack <name> -n openshift-logging
----
====

.Verification

* On or after the specified `effectiveDate` date, check that there is no *LokistackSchemaUpgradesRequired* alert in the web console in *Administrator* -> *Observe* -> *Alerting*.
