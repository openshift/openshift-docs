= Requirements for upgrading to OpenShift 4.8

You must meet the following requirements before upgrading a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS) from version 4.7 to 4.8:

* Update the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) account-wide roles and policies, including the Operator policies to version 4.8.
* After updating the roles and policies, you must update the value of the `cloudcredential.openshift.io/upgradeable-to` annotation in the `CloudCredential` custom resource to `v4.8`. This indicates that the cluster is ready to upgrade.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the latest AWS CLI on your installation host.
* You have installed version 1.1.3 or later of the ROSA CLI on your installation host.
* You have installed version 4.8 or later of the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) on your installation host.
* You have the permissions required to update the AWS account-wide roles and policies.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
