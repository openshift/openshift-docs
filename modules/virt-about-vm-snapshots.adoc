= About virtual machine snapshots

A _snapshot_ represents the state and data of a virtual machine (VM) at a specific point in time. You can use a snapshot to restore an existing VM to a previous state (represented by
the snapshot) for backup and disaster recovery or to rapidly roll back to a previous development version.

An offline VM snapshot is created from a VM that is powered off (Stopped state). The snapshot stores a copy of each Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume attached to the VM and a copy of the VM
specification and metadata. Snapshots cannot be changed after creation.

With the offline VM snapshots feature, cluster administrators and application developers can:

* Create a new snapshot
* List all snapshots attached to a specific VM
* Restore a VM from a snapshot
* Delete an existing VM snapshot

== Virtual machine snapshot controller and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

The VM snapshot feature introduces three new API objects defined as CRDs for managing snapshots:

* `VirtualMachineSnapshot`: Represents a user request to create a snapshot. It contains information about the current state of the VM.
* `VirtualMachineSnapshotContent`: Represents a provisioned resource on the cluster (a snapshot). It is created by the VM snapshot controller and contains references to all resources required to restore the VM.
* `VirtualMachineRestore`: Represents a user request to restore a VM from a snapshot.

The VM snapshot controller binds a `VirtualMachineSnapshotContent` object with the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object for which it was created, with a one-to-one mapping.
