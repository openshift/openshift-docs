= Argo Rollouts resources

Argo Rollouts manage several resources to enable progressive delivery:

* *Rollouts-specific resources*: For example, `Rollout`, `AnalysisRun`, or `Experiment`.
* *Kubernetes networking resources*: For example, `Service`, `Ingress`, or `Route` for network traffic shaping. Argo Rollouts integrate with these resources, which are referred to as traffic management.

These resources are essential for customizing the deployment of applications through the `Rollout` CR.

Argo Rollouts support the following actions:

* Route percentage-based traffic for canary deployments.
* Forward incoming user traffic to the correct application version by using `Service` and `Ingress` resources.  
* Use multiple mechanisms to collect analysis metrics to validate the deployment of a new version of an application.

|Name |Description
|`Rollout` |This custom resource (CR) enables the deployment of applications by using canary or blue-green deployment strategies. It replaces the in-built Kubernetes `Deployment` resource.
|`AnalysisRun` |You can use this CR to perform an analysis and aggregate the results to guide the user in successfully deploying and delivering the application. The `AnalysisRun` CR is an instance of the `AnalysisTemplate` CR.
|`AnalysisTemplate` |The `AnalysisTemplate` CR is a template that provides instructions about querying metrics. The result of these instructions is attached to a rollout in the form of the `AnalysisRun` CR. The `AnalysisTemplate` CR can be defined globally on the cluster or on a specific rollout. You can link a list of `AnalysisTemplate` resources to be used on replica sets by creating an `Experiment` custom resource.
|`Experiment` |The `Experiment` CR is used to run short-lived analysis on an application during its deployment to ensure the application is deployed correctly. You can use the `Experiment` CR independently or run it as a part of the `Rollout` CR.
|`Service` and `Ingress` | Argo Rollouts natively support routing traffic by services and ingresses by using the Service and Ingress controllers.
|`Route` and `VirtualService` |The OpenShift `Route` and {SMProductName} `VirtualService` resources are used to perform traffic splitting across different application versions.
