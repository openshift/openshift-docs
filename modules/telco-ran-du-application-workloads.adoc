= {rds-caps} application workloads

DU worker nodes must have 3rd Generation Xeon (Ice Lake) 2.20 GHz or better CPUs with firmware tuned for maximum performance.

5G RAN DU user applications and workloads should conform to the following best practices and application limits:

* Develop cloud-native network functions (CNFs) that conform to the latest version of the link:https://redhat-best-practices-for-k8s.github.io/guide/[Red{nbsp}Hat Best Practices for Kubernetes].

* Use SR-IOV for high performance networking.

* Use exec probes sparingly and only when no other suitable options are available

** Do not use exec probes if a CNF uses CPU pinning.
Use other probe implementations, for example, `httpGet` or `tcpSocket`.

** When you need to use exec probes, limit the exec probe frequency and quantity.
The maximum number of exec probes must be kept below 10, and frequency must not be set to less than 10 seconds.

* Avoid using exec probes unless there is absolutely no viable alternative.

[NOTE]
====
Startup probes require minimal resources during steady-state operation.
The limitation on exec probes applies primarily to liveness and readiness probes.

A test workload that conforms to the dimensions of the reference DU application workload described in this specification can be found at link:https://github.com/openshift-kni/du-test-workloads/tree/v1.0[openshift-kni/du-test-workloads].
