= Creating serverless applications using YAML

Creating Knative resources by using YAML files uses a declarative API, which enables you to describe applications declaratively and in a reproducible manner. To create a serverless application by using YAML, you must create a YAML file that defines a Knative `Service` object, then apply it by using `oc apply`.

After the service is created and the application is deployed, Knative creates an immutable revision for this version of the application. Knative also performs network programming to create a route, ingress, service, and load balancer for your application and automatically scales your pods up and down based on traffic.

.Prerequisites

* {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file containing the following sample code:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-delivery
  namespace: default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:latest
          env:
            - name: RESPONSE
              value: "Hello Serverless!"
----
. Navigate to the directory where the YAML file is contained, and deploy the application by applying the YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
