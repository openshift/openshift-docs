= User-managed encryption

The user-managed encryption feature allows you to provide keys during installation that encrypt {product-title} node root volumes, and enables all managed storage classes to use these keys to encrypt provisioned storage volumes. You must specify the custom key in the `platform.<cloud_type>.defaultMachinePlatform` field in the install-config YAML file.

This features supports the following storage types:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Block storage (EBS)

* Microsoft Azure Disk storage

* Google Cloud Platform (GCP) persistent disk (PD) storage

* IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Block storage
