= Installation workflow

When an OperatorGroup is tied to a service account and an Operator is installed
or upgraded, OLM uses the following workflow:

. The given Subscription object is picked up by OLM.
. OLM fetches the OperatorGroup tied to this Subscription.
. OLM determines that the OperatorGroup has a service account specified.
. OLM creates a client scoped to the service account and uses the scoped client to
install the Operator. This ensures that any permission requested by the Operator
is always confined to that of the service account in the OperatorGroup.
. OLM creates a new service account with the set of permissions specified in the
CSV and assigns it to the Operator. The Operator runs as the assigned service
account.
