= Traditional sharding example

An example of a configured Ingress Controller `finops-router` that has the label selector `spec.namespaceSelector.matchExpressions` with key values set to `finance` and `ops`:

.Example YAML definition for `finops-router`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: finops-router
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  namespaceSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: name
      operator: In
      values:
      - finance
      - ops
----

An example of a configured Ingress Controller `dev-router` that has the label selector `spec.namespaceSelector.matchLabels.name` with the key value set to `dev`:

.Example YAML definition for `dev-router`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: dev-router
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  namespaceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      name: dev
----

If all application routes are in separate namespaces, such as each labeled with `name:finance`, `name:ops`, and `name:dev`, the configuration effectively distributes your routes between the two Ingress Controllers. {product-title} routes for console, authentication, and other purposes should not be handled.

In the previous scenario, sharding becomes a special case of partitioning, with no overlapping subsets. Routes are divided between router shards.

[WARNING]
====
The `default` Ingress Controller continues to serve all routes unless the `namespaceSelector` or `routeSelector` fields contain routes that are meant for exclusion. See this link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5097511[Red Hat Knowledgebase solution] and the section "Sharding the default Ingress Controller" for more information on how to exclude routes from the default Ingress Controller.
