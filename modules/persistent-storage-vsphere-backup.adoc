[id="vsphere-pv-backup_{context}"]
= Backing up VMware vSphere volumes

{product-title} provisions new volumes as independent persistent disks to freely attach and detach the volume on any node in the cluster. As a consequence, it is not possible to back up volumes that use snapshots, or to restore volumes from snapshots. See link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-53F65726-A23B-4CF0-A7D5-48E584B88613.html[Snapshot Limitations] for more information.

.Procedure

To create a backup of persistent volumes:

.  Stop the application that is using the persistent volume.
.  Clone the persistent volume.
.  Restart the application.
.  Create a backup of the cloned volume.
.  Delete the cloned volume.
