= Secret sharing encryption

Using Shamirâ€™s secret sharing (sss), a cryptographic algorithm to securely divide up, distribute, and re-assemble keys, OpenShift can support more complicated mixtures of key protection.  When you configure OpenShift to use multiple Tang servers, OpenShift uses sss to allow the _Decrypt if at least one of the specified servers is available_ nature of the Network-Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) disk encryption. You can create layers for additional security. For example, you can define a policy where OpenShift requires both the TPM and one of the given list of Tang servers to decrypt the disk.
