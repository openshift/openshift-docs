= Adding roles to users

You can use  the `oc adm` administrator CLI to manage the roles and bindings.

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
Dedicated administrators cannot manage cluster roles. They can manage
cluster role bindings and local roles and bindings.
endif::[]

Binding, or adding, a role to users or groups gives the user or group the access
that is granted by the role. You can add and remove roles to and from users and
groups using `oc adm policy` commands.

You can bind any of the default cluster roles to local users or groups in your
project.

.Procedure

. Add a role to a user in a specific project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user <role> <user> -n <project>
----
+
For example, you can add the `admin` role to the `alice` user in `joe` project
by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin alice -n joe
----

. View the local role bindings and verify the addition in the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n <project>
----
+
For example, to view the local role bindings for the `joe` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n joe
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
