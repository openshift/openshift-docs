:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="kmm-building-and-signing-a-kmod-image_{context}"]
= Building and signing a kmod image

Use this procedure if you have source code and must build your image first.

The following YAML file builds a new container image using the source code from the repository. The image produced is saved back in the registry with a temporary name, and this temporary image is then signed using the parameters in the `sign` section.

The temporary image name is based on the final image name and is set to be `<containerImage>:<tag>-<namespace>_<module name>_kmm_unsigned`.

For example, using the following YAML file, Kernel Module Management (KMM) builds an image named `example.org/repository/minimal-driver:final-default_example-module_kmm_unsigned` containing the build with unsigned kmods and pushes it to the registry. Then it creates a second image named `example.org/repository/minimal-driver:final` that contains the signed kmods. It is this second image that is pulled by the worker pods and contains the kmods to be loaded on the cluster nodes.

After it is signed, you can safely delete the temporary image from the registry. It will be rebuilt, if needed.

.Prerequisites

* The `keySecret` and `certSecret` secrets have been created in the same namespace as the rest of the resources.

.Procedure

* Apply the YAML file:

<1> Replace `default` with a valid namespace.

<2> The default `serviceAccountName` does not have the required permissions to run a module that is privileged. For information on creating a service account, see "Creating service accounts" in the "Additional resources" of this section.

<3> Used as `imagePullSecrets` in the `DaemonSet` object and to pull and push for the build and sign features.
