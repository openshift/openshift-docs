= Enabling feature sets using the CLI

You can use the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to enable feature sets for all of the nodes in a cluster by editing the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

To enable feature sets:

. Edit the `FeatureGate` CR named `cluster`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit featuregate cluster
----
+
.Sample FeatureGate custom resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster <1>
spec:
  featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade <2>
----
+
--
<1> The name of the `FeatureGate` CR must be `cluster`.
<2> Add the feature sets that you want to enable in a comma-separated list:
* `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` enables specific Technology Preview features.
--
+
[NOTE]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set cannot be undone and prevents upgrades. These feature sets are not recommended on production clusters.
