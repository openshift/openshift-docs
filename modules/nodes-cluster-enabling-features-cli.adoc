= Enabling feature sets using the CLI

You can use the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to enable feature sets for all of the nodes in a cluster by editing the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

To enable feature sets:

. Edit the `FeatureGate` CR named `cluster`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit featuregate cluster
----
+
.Sample FeatureGate custom resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster <1>
spec:
  featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade <2>
----
+
--
<1> The name of the `FeatureGate` CR must be `cluster`.
<2> Add the feature set that you want to enable:
* `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` enables specific Technology Preview features.
--
+
After you save the changes, new machine configs are created, the machine config pools are updated, and scheduling on each node is disabled while the change is being applied.
+
[NOTE]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. These feature sets are not recommended on production clusters.
====

.Verification

You can verify that the feature gates are enabled by looking at the `kubelet.conf` file on a node after the nodes return to the ready state.

. Start a debug session for a node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----

. Change your root directory to the host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# chroot /host
----

. View the `kubelet.conf` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# cat /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
----
+
.Sample output
+
[source,terminal]
----
 ...
featureGates:
  InsightsOperatorPullingSCA: true,
  LegacyNodeRoleBehavior: false
 ...
----
+
The features that are listed as `true` are enabled on your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The features listed vary depending upon the {product-title} version.
