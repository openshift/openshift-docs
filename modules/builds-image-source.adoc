= Image source

You can add additional files to the build process with images. Input images are
referenced in the same way the `From` and `To` image targets are defined. This
means both container images and imagestreamtags can be referenced. In
conjunction with the image, you must provide one or more path pairs to indicate
the path of the files or directories to copy the image and the destination to
place them in the build context.

The source path can be any absolute path within the image specified. The
destination must be a relative directory path. At build time, the image will be
loaded and the indicated files and directories will be copied into the context
directory of the build process. This is the same directory into which the source
repository content (if any) is cloned. If the source path ends in *_/._* then
the content of the directory will be copied, but the directory itself will not
be created at the destination.

Image inputs are specified in the `source` definition of the `BuildConfig`:

----
<1> An array of one or more input images and files.
<2> A reference to the image containing the files to be copied.
<3> An array of source/destination paths.
<4> The directory relative to the build root where the build process can access the file.
<5> The location of the file to be copied out of the referenced image.
<6> An optional secret provided if credentials are needed to access the input image.
