= Argo CD Agent modes

The Argo CD Agent supports two operational modes that determine where the authoritative *source of truth* for the Application `.spec` field resides:

* *Managed mode* — the control plane defines application specifications.  
* *Autonomous mode* — each workload cluster defines its own application specifications.

You can also use a *mixed mode* configuration, where different clusters operate under different modes.

[NOTE]
====
Regardless of the mode, the control plane Argo CD instance always displays up-to-date application status across all clusters. The operational mode determines only where the authoritative specification resides, the direction of synchronization, and the ability to interact with that specification from the control plane.
