= Upgrading OADP 1.0 to 1.2 for {mtc-full} 1.8.0

To upgrade OADP 1.0 to 1.2 for {mtc-full} 1.8.0, complete the following steps.

.Procedure


* For each subscription, patch the OADP operator from OADP 1.0 to OADP 1.2 by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-migration patch subscription redhat-oadp-operator-stable-1.0-mtc-operator-catalog-openshift-marketplace --type merge --patch '{"spec": {"channel":"stable-1.2"}}'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Sections indicating the user-specific returned `NAME` values that are used for the installation of MTC & OADP, respectively.
====
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
subscription.operators.coreos.com/redhat-oadp-operator-stable-1.0-mtc-operator-catalog-openshift-marketplace patched
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The returned value will be similar to `redhat-oadp-operator-stable-1.0-mtc-operator-catalog-openshift-marketplace`, which is used in this example.
====
+
--
* If the `installPlanApproval` parameter is set to `Automatic`, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) begins the upgrade process.
* If the `installPlanApproval` parameter is set to `Manual`, you must approve each `installPlan` before the OLM begins the upgrades.
--

.Verification
. Verify that the OLM has completed the upgrades of OADP and {mtc-short} by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-migration get subscriptions.operators.coreos.com mtc-operator -o json | jq '.status | (."state"=="AtLatestKnown")'
----

. When a value of `true` is returned, verify the channel used for each subscription by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-migration get sub -o json | jq -r '.items[] | {name: .metadata.name, channel: .spec.channel }'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{
  "name": "mtc-operator",
  "channel": "release-v1.8"
}
{
  "name": "redhat-oadp-operator-stable-1.0-mtc-operator-catalog-openshift-marketplace",
  "channel": "stable-1.2"
}
----

 Confirm that the `mtc-operator.v1.8.0` and `oadp-operator.v1.2.x` packages are installed by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-migration get csv
