== Fixed issues

* Before this update, installing the {pipelines-title} 1.19 displayed the Tekton Pruner API in the console. With this update, this issue is fixed and the API is no longer displayed.

* Before this update, installing {pipelines-shortname} on a FIPS-enabled cluster caused the Tekton entrypoint binary to display an error with the `FIPS mode is enabled, but this binary is not compiled with FIPS compliant mode enabled` message. With this update, this issue is fixed. {pipelines-shortname} functions correctly on FIPS-enabled clusters, and the {pipelines-title} Operator is designed and validated for use on FIPS enabled clusters.
