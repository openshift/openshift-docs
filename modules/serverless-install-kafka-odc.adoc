= Installing Apache Kafka components by using the web console

Cluster administrators can enable the use of Apache Kafka functionality in an {ServerlessProductName} deployment by instantiating the `KnativeKafka` custom resource definition provided by the *Knative Kafka* {ServerlessOperatorName} API.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {ServerlessProductName}, including Knative Eventing, in your {product-title} cluster.
* You have access to a Red Hat AMQ Streams cluster.
* You have cluster administrator permissions on {product-title}.
* You are logged in to the web console.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Check that the *Project* dropdown at the top of the page is set to *Project: knative-eventing*.
. In the list of *Provided APIs* for the {ServerlessOperatorName}, find the *Knative Kafka* box and click *Create Instance*.
. Configure the *KnativeKafka* object in the *Create Knative Kafka* page.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To use the Kafka channel or Kafka source on your cluster, you must toggle the *Enable* switch for the options you want to use to *true*. These switches are set to *false* by default. Additionally, to use the Kafka channel, you must specify the Boostrap Servers.
====
.. Using the form is recommended for simpler configurations that do not require full control of *KnativeKafka* object creation.
.. Editing the YAML is recommended for more complex configurations that require full control of *KnativeKafka* object creation. You can access the YAML by clicking the *Edit YAML* link in the top right of the *Create Knative Kafka* page.
. Click *Create* after you have completed any of the optional configurations for Kafka. You are automatically directed to the *Knative Kafka* tab where *knative-kafka* is in the list of resources.

.Verification

. Click on the *knative-kafka* resource in the *Knative Kafka* tab. You are automatically directed to the *Knative Kafka Overview* page.
. View the list of *Conditions* for the resource and confirm that they have a status of *True*.

If the conditions have a status of *Unknown* or *False*, wait a few moments to refresh the page.
. Check that the Knative Kafka resources have been created:
