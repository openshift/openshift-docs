= Installing Knative Kafka

Knative Kafka provides integration options for you to use supported versions of the Apache Kafka message streaming platform with {ServerlessProductName}. Knative Kafka functionality is available in an {ServerlessProductName} installation if you have installed the `KnativeKafka` custom resource.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing on your cluster.
* You have access to a Red Hat AMQ Streams cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) if you want to use the verification steps.

// OCP
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
* You have cluster administrator permissions on {product-title}.
endif::[]

// OSD and ROSA
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {product-title}.
endif::[]

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Check that the *Project* dropdown at the top of the page is set to *Project: knative-eventing*.

. In the list of *Provided APIs* for the {ServerlessOperatorName}, find the *Knative Kafka* box and click *Create Instance*.

. Configure the *KnativeKafka* object in the *Create Knative Kafka* page.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use the Kafka channel, source, broker, or sink on your cluster, you must toggle the *enabled* switch for the options you want to use to *true*. These switches are set to *false* by default. Additionally, to use the Kafka channel, broker, or sink you must specify the bootstrap servers.

.Example `KnativeKafka` custom resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.serverless.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeKafka
metadata:
    name: knative-kafka
    namespace: knative-eventing
spec:
    channel:
        enabled: true <1>
        bootstrapServers: <bootstrap_servers> <2>
    source:
        enabled: true <3>
    broker:
        enabled: true <4>
        defaultConfig:
            bootstrapServers: <bootstrap_servers> <5>
            numPartitions: <num_partitions> <6>
            replicationFactor: <replication_factor> <7>
    sink:
        enabled: true <8>
----
<1> Enables developers to use the `KafkaChannel` channel type in the cluster.
<2> A comma-separated list of bootstrap servers from your AMQ Streams cluster.
<3> Enables developers to use the `KafkaSource` event source type in the cluster.
<4> Enables developers to use the Knative Kafka broker implementation in the cluster.
<5> A comma-separated list of bootstrap servers from your Red Hat AMQ Streams cluster.
<6> Defines the number of partitions of the Kafka topics, backed by the `Broker` objects. The default is `10`.
<7> Defines the replication factor of the Kafka topics, backed by the `Broker` objects. The default is `3`.
<8> Enables developers to use a Kafka sink in the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `replicationFactor` value must be less than or equal to the number of nodes of your Red Hat AMQ Streams cluster.

.. Using the form is recommended for simpler configurations that do not require full control of *KnativeKafka* object creation.

.. Editing the YAML is recommended for more complex configurations that require full control of *KnativeKafka* object creation. You can access the YAML by clicking the *Edit YAML* link in the top right of the *Create Knative Kafka* page.

. Click *Create* after you have completed any of the optional configurations for Kafka. You are automatically directed to the *Knative Kafka* tab where *knative-kafka* is in the list of resources.

.Verification

. Click on the *knative-kafka* resource in the *Knative Kafka* tab. You are automatically directed to the *Knative Kafka Overview* page.

. View the list of *Conditions* for the resource and confirm that they have a status of *True*.

+
If the conditions have a status of *Unknown* or *False*, wait a few moments to refresh the page.

. Check that the Knative Kafka resources have been created:
