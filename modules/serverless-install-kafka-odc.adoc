= Installing Knative Kafka

The {ServerlessOperatorName} provides the Knative Kafka API that can be used to create a `KnativeKafka` custom resource:

.Example `KnativeKafka` custom resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.serverless.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeKafka
metadata:
    name: knative-kafka
    namespace: knative-eventing
spec:
    channel:
        enabled: true <1>
        bootstrapServers: <bootstrap_servers> <2>
    source:
        enabled: true <3>
    broker:
        enabled: true <4>
        defaultConfig:
            bootstrapServers: <bootstrap_servers> <5>
            numPartitions: <num_partitions> <6>
            replicationFactor: <replication_factor> <7>
----
<1> Enables developers to use the `KafkaChannel` channel type in the cluster.
<2> A comma-separated list of bootstrap servers from your AMQ Streams cluster.
<3> Enables developers to use the `KafkaSource` event source type in the cluster.
<4> Enables developers to use the Knative Kafka broker implementation in the cluster.
<5> A comma-separated list of bootstrap servers from your Red Hat AMQ Streams cluster.
<6> Defines the number of partitions of the Kafka topics, backed by the `Broker` objects. The default is `10`.
<7> Defines the replication factor of the Kafka topics, backed by the `Broker` objects. The default is `3`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `replicationFactor` value must match the number of nodes of your Red Hat AMQ Streams cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {ServerlessProductName}, including Knative Eventing, in your {product-title} cluster.
* You have access to a Red Hat AMQ Streams cluster.
* You have cluster administrator permissions on {product-title}.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Check that the *Project* dropdown at the top of the page is set to *Project: knative-eventing*.
. In the list of *Provided APIs* for the {ServerlessOperatorName}, find the *Knative Kafka* box and click *Create Instance*.
. Configure the *KnativeKafka* object in the *Create Knative Kafka* page.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To use the Kafka channel or Kafka source on your cluster, you must toggle the *Enable* switch for the options you want to use to *true*. These switches are set to *false* by default. Additionally, to use the Kafka channel, you must specify the Boostrap Servers.
====
.. Using the form is recommended for simpler configurations that do not require full control of *KnativeKafka* object creation.
.. Editing the YAML is recommended for more complex configurations that require full control of *KnativeKafka* object creation. You can access the YAML by clicking the *Edit YAML* link in the top right of the *Create Knative Kafka* page.
. Click *Create* after you have completed any of the optional configurations for Kafka. You are automatically directed to the *Knative Kafka* tab where *knative-kafka* is in the list of resources.

.Verification

. Click on the *knative-kafka* resource in the *Knative Kafka* tab. You are automatically directed to the *Knative Kafka Overview* page.
. View the list of *Conditions* for the resource and confirm that they have a status of *True*.

+
If the conditions have a status of *Unknown* or *False*, wait a few moments to refresh the page.
. Check that the Knative Kafka resources have been created:
