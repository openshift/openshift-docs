= Scheduling workloads on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines

When you deploy workloads on a cluster with compute nodes that use different architectures, you must align pod architecture with the architecture of the underlying node. Your workload may also require additional configuration to particular resources depending on the underlying node architecture.

You can use the Multiarch Tuning Operator to enable architecture-aware scheduling of workloads on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines. The Multiarch Tuning Operator implements additional scheduler predicates in the pods specifications based on the architectures that the pods can support at creation time.
