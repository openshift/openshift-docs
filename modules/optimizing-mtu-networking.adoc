= Optimizing the MTU for your network

There are two important maximum transmission units (MTUs): the network interface controller (NIC) MTU and the cluster network MTU.

The NIC MTU is configured at the time of {product-title} installation, and you can also change the cluster's MTU as a Day 2 operation. See "Changing cluster network MTU" for more information. The MTU must be less than or equal to the maximum supported value of the NIC of your network. If you are optimizing for throughput, choose the largest possible value. If you are optimizing for lowest latency, choose a lower value.

For OVN and Geneve, the MTU must be less than the NIC MTU by 100 bytes at a minimum.
