= Optimizing the MTU for your network

There are two important maximum transmission units (MTUs): the network interface controller (NIC) MTU and the cluster network MTU.

The NIC MTU is configured at the time of {product-title} installation, and you can also change the MTU of a cluster as a postinstallation task. For more information, see "Changing cluster network MTU".

For a cluster that uses the OVN-Kubernetes plugin, the MTU must be less than `100` bytes to the maximum supported value of the NIC of your network. If you are optimizing for throughput, choose the largest possible value, such as `8900`. If you are optimizing for lowest latency, choose a lower value.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes plugin and the network uses a NIC to send and receive unfragmented jumbo frame packets over the network, you must specify `9000` bytes as the MTU value for the NIC so that pods do not fail.
