= Building functions

Before you can run a function, you must build the function project by using the `kn func build` command. This command creates an OCI container image that can be run locally on your computer or on an {product-title} cluster. The build command uses the function project name and the image registry name to construct a fully qualified image name for your function.

The OpenShift Container Registry is used by default as the image registry for storing function images. You can override this by using the `-r` flag:

.Example build command
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn func build -r quay.io/username
----
// removed mentioning the `FUNC_REGISTRY` environment variable because we didn't provide an example and it seems unnecessary - can add it in later if it's important

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Building function image
Function image has been built, image: quay.io/username/example-function:latest
----

To learn more about `kn func build` command options, you can use the help command:

.Build help command
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn func help build
