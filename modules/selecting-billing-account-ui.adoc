[NOTE]
====
Complete the prerequisites before starting the web console deployment process. 

The `rosa` CLI is required for certain tasks, such as creating the account roles. If you are deploying {product-title} for the first time, follow this the CLI steps until running the `rosa whoami` command, before starting the web console deployment steps.

. The first step when creating a {product-title} cluster using the web console is the control plane selection. Make sure the *Hosted* option is selected before clicking the *Next* button:

* Click the *How to associate a new AWS account*, if you don not see the account into which you want to deploy the {product-title} cluster for detailed information on how to create or link account roles for this association.
* The `rosa` CLI is used for this.
* If you are using multiple AWS accounts and have their profiles configured for the AWS CLI, you can use the `--profile` selector to specify the AWS profile when working with the `rosa` CLI commands.

. The billing AWS account is selected in the immediately following section:

+
* Only AWS accounts that are linked to the user's logged in Red{nbsp}Hat account are shown.
* The specified AWS account is charged for using the {product-title} service.
* An indicator shows if the {product-title} contract is enabled or not enabled for a given AWS billing account.
** If you select an AWS billing account that shows the _Contract enabled_ label, on-demand consumption rates are charged only after the capacity of your pre-paid contract is consumed.
** AWS accounts without the _Contract enabled_ label are charged the applicable on-demand consumption rates.
