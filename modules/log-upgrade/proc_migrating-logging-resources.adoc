= Migrating logging resources

The new `ClusterLogForwarder` resource uses the new 'observability' API `ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io`. It replaces both `ClusterLogging.logging.openshift.io` and `ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io resources`.

.Prerequisites
* A bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts the steps in this module.
* Prerequisites can be full sentences or sentence fragments; however, prerequisite list items must be parallel.
* Do not use imperative statements in the Prerequisites section.

.Procedure
. Make each step an instruction.
. Include one imperative sentence for each step, for example:
.. Do this thing and then select *Next*.
.. Do this other thing, and this other thing, and then select *Next*.
. Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the procedure includes only one step.
+
NOTE: You can add text, tables, code examples, images, and other items to a step. However, these items must be connected to the step with a plus sign (+). Any items under the .Procedure heading and before one of the following approved headings that are not connected to the last step with a plus sign cannot be converted to DITA.

* List actions for the user to complete, such as entering a command, to determine the success or failure of the procedure.
* Make each step an instruction.
* Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the verification includes only one step.

.Troubleshooting
Delete this section if it does not apply to your module. Provide the user with troubleshooting steps.
