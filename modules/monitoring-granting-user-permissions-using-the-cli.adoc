= Granting user permissions by using the CLI

You can grant users permissions to monitor their own projects, by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* The user account that you are assigning the role to already exists.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* Assign a monitoring role to a user for a project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user <role> <user> -n <namespace> <1>
----
<1> Substitute `<role>` with `monitoring-rules-view`, `monitoring-rules-edit`, or `monitoring-edit`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Whichever role you choose, you must bind it against a specific project as a cluster administrator.
====
+
As an example, substitute `<role>` with `monitoring-edit`, `<user>` with `johnsmith`, and `<namespace>` with `ns1`. This assigns the user `johnsmith` permission to set up metrics collection and to create alerting rules in the `ns1` namespace.
