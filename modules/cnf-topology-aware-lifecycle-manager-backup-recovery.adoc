= Recovering a cluster after a failed upgrade

If an upgrade of a cluster fails, you can manually log in to the cluster and use the backup to return the cluster to its preupgrade state. There are two stages:

Rollback:: If the attempted upgrade included a change to the platform OS deployment, you must roll back to the previous version before running the recovery script.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A rollback is only applicable to upgrades from TALM and single-node OpenShift. This process does not apply to rollbacks from any other upgrade type.
====

Recovery:: The recovery shuts down containers and uses files from the backup partition to relaunch containers and restore clusters.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {cgu-operator-first}.
* Provision one or more managed clusters.
* Install {rh-rhacm-first}.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Run an upgrade that is configured for backup.

.Procedure

. Delete the previously created `ClusterGroupUpgrade` custom resource (CR) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete cgu/du-upgrade-4918 -n ztp-group-du-sno
----

. Log in to the cluster that you want to recover.

. Check the status of the platform OS deployment by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ostree admin status
----

----
<1> This platform OS deployment is marked for rollback.
<2> The previous deployment is pinned and can be rolled back.
--

. To trigger a rollback of the platform OS deployment, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rpm-ostree rollback -r
----

. The first phase of the recovery shuts down containers and restores files from the backup partition to the targeted directories. To begin the recovery, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ /var/recovery/upgrade-recovery.sh
----
+

. When prompted, reboot the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ systemctl reboot
----
. After the reboot, restart the recovery by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ /var/recovery/upgrade-recovery.sh  --resume
----

[NOTE]
====
If the recovery utility fails, you can retry with the `--restart` option:
[source,terminal]
----
$ /var/recovery/upgrade-recovery.sh --restart
----
====

.Verification
* To check the status of the recovery run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion,nodes,clusteroperator
