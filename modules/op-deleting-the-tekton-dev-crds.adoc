= Deleting the custom resource definitions of the `operator.tekton.dev` group

[role="_abstract"]
You can delete the `operator.tekton.dev` custom resource definitions (CRDs) to fully remove all {pipelines-shortname} traces from your cluster. This step ensures that no residual definitions remain after the Operator uninstallation.

Delete the `CustomResourceDefinitions` of the `operator.tekton.dev` group. The {pipelines-title} Operator creates these CRDs by default during installation.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Administration* -> *CustomResourceDefinitions*.

. Type `operator.tekton.dev` in the *Filter by name* box to search for the CRDs in the `operator.tekton.dev` group.

. To delete each of the displayed CRDs, complete the following steps:
.. Click the *Options* menu {kebab}.
.. Select *Delete CustomResourceDefinition*.
.. Click *Delete* to confirm the deletion of the CRD.
