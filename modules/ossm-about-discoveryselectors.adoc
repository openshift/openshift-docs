= About discovery selectors
:context: ossm-about-discoveryselectors

With discovery selectors, the mesh administrator can control which namespaces the control plane can access. By using a {k8s} label selector, the administrator sets the criteria for the namespaces visible to the control plane, excluding any namespaces that do not match the specified criteria.

[NOTE]
====
Istiod always opens a watch to {ocp-short-name} for all namespaces. However, discovery selectors ignore objects that are not selected very early in its processing, minimizing costs.
====

The `discoverySelectors` field accepts an array of {k8s} selectors, which apply to labels on namespaces. You can configure each selector for different use cases:

* Custom label names and values. For example, configure all namespaces with the label `istio-discovery=enabled`.
* A list of namespace labels by using set-based selectors with OR logic. For instance, configure namespaces with `istio-discovery=enabled` OR `region=us-east1`.
* Inclusion and exclusion of namespaces. For example, configure namespaces with `istio-discovery=enabled` AND the label `app=helloworld`.

[NOTE]
====
Discovery selectors are not a security boundary. Istiod continues to have access to all namespaces even when you have configured the `discoverySelector` field.
