= Editing a virtual machine YAML configuration using the web console

Using the web console, edit the YAML configuration of a virtual machine.

Not all parameters can be updated. If you edit values that cannot be changed and click *Save*, an error message indicates the parameter that was not able to be updated.

The YAML configuration can be edited while the virtual machine is *Running*, however the changes will only take effect after the virtual machine has been stopped and started again.

[NOTE]
====
Navigating away from the YAML screen while editing cancels any changes to the configuration you have made.
