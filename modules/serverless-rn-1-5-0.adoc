* {ServerlessProductName} has been updated to use Knative `kn` CLI 0.12.0.
* {ServerlessProductName} has been updated to use Knative Serving Operator 0.12.1.

[id="fixed-issues-1-5-0_{context}"]
== Fixed issues
* In previous releases, {product-title} scale from zero latency caused a delay of approximately 10 seconds when creating pods. This issue has been fixed in the {product-title} 4.3.5 bug fix update.

[id="known-issues-1-5-0_{context}"]
== Known issues
* Deleting `KnativeServing.operator.knative.dev` from the `knative-serving` namespace may cause the deletion process to hang. This is due to a race condition between deletion of the CRD and `knative-openshift-ingress` removing finalizers.
