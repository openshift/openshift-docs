[id="machine_pools_hcp_{context}"]
= Machine pools in Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) with Hosted Control Plane (HCP) clusters

In {hcp-title} clusters, the hosted control plane spans all three of the Availability Zones (AZ) in the installed cloud region. Each machine pool in a {hcp-title} cluster deploys in a single subnet within a single AZ. Additionally, machine Pools in {hcp-title} clusters each upgrade independently and the versions of the machine pools must remain within two minor (Y-stream) versions of the Control Plane.
