= Virtualization with vGPU

Virtual machines (VMs) can directly access a single physical GPU using NVIDIA vGPU. You can create virtual GPUs that can be shared by VMs across the enterprise and accessed by other devices.

This capability combines the power of GPU performance with the management and security benefits provided by vGPU. Additional benefits provided by vGPU includes proactive management and monitoring for your VM environment, workload balancing for mixed VDI and compute workloads, and resource sharing across multiple VMs.
