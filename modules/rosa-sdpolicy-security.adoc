[id="rosa-sdpolicy-security_{context}"]
= Security


This section provides information about the service definition for {product-title} security.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-auth-provider_{context}"]
== Authentication provider
Authentication for the cluster can be configured using either the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM)] or cluster creation process or using the `rosa` CLI. {product-title} is not an identity provider, and all access to the cluster must be managed by the customer as part of their integrated solution. The use of multiple identity providers provisioned at the same time is supported. The following identity providers are supported:

- GitHub or GitHub Enterprise
- GitLab
- Google
- LDAP
- OpenID Connect

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-privileged-containers_{context}"]
== Privileged containers
Privileged containers are available for users with the `cluster-admin` role. Usage of privileged containers as `cluster-admin` is subject to the responsibilities and exclusion notes in the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements[Red Hat Enterprise Agreement Appendix 4] (Online Subscription Services).

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-customer-admin-user_{context}"]
== Customer administrator user
In addition to normal users, {product-title} provides access to an {product-title}-specific group called `dedicated-admin`. Any users on the cluster that are members of the `dedicated-admin` group:

- Have administrator access to all customer-created projects on the cluster.
- Can manage resource quotas and limits on the cluster.
- Can add and manage `NetworkPolicy` objects.
- Are able to view information about specific nodes and PVs in the cluster, including scheduler information.
- Can access the reserved `dedicated-admin` project on the cluster, which allows for the creation of service accounts with elevated privileges and also gives the ability to update default limits and quotas for projects on the cluster.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-cluster-admin-role_{context}"]
== Cluster administration role
The administrator of {product-title} has default access to the `cluster-admin` role for your organization's cluster. While logged into an account with the `cluster-admin` role, users have increased permissions to run privileged security contexts.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-project-self-service_{context}"]
== Project self-service
By default, all users have the ability to create, update, and delete their projects. This can be restricted if a member of the `dedicated-admin` group removes the `self-provisioner` role from authenticated users:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group self-provisioner system:authenticated:oauth
----

Restrictions can be reverted by applying:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group self-provisioner system:authenticated:oauth
----

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-regulatory-compliance_{context}"]
== Regulatory compliance
See Understanding process and security for ROSA for the latest compliance information.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-network-security_{context}"]
== Network security
With {product-title}, AWS provides a standard DDoS protection on all load balancers, called AWS Shield. This provides 95% protection against most commonly used level 3 and 4 attacks on all the public facing load balancers used for {product-title}. A 10-second timeout is added for HTTP requests coming to the `haproxy` router to receive a response or the connection is closed to provide additional protection.
