[id="cnf-tuning-nodes-for-low-latency-via-performanceprofile_{context}"]
= Tuning nodes for low latency with the performance profile

The performance profile lets you control latency tuning aspects of nodes that belong to a certain machine config pool. After you specify your settings, the `PerformanceProfile` object is compiled into multiple objects that perform the actual node level tuning:

* A `MachineConfig` file that manipulates the nodes.
* A `KubeletConfig` file that configures the Topology Manager, the CPU Manager, and the {product-title} nodes.
* The Tuned profile that configures the Node Tuning Operator.

You can use a performance profile to specify whether to update the kernel to kernel-rt, to allocate huge pages, and to partition the CPUs for performing housekeeping duties or running workloads.

[NOTE]
====
You can manually create the `PerformanceProfile` object or use the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) to generate a performance profile. See the additional resources below for more information on the PPC.

<1> Use this field to isolate specific CPUs to use with application containers for workloads.
<2> Use this field to reserve specific CPUs to use with infra containers for housekeeping.
<3> Use this field to install the real-time kernel on the node. Valid values are `true` or `false`. Setting the `true` value installs the real-time kernel.
<4> Use this field to configure the topology manager policy. Valid values are `none` (default), `best-effort`, `restricted`, and `single-numa-node`. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/topology-manager/#topology-manager-policies[Topology Manager Policies].
<5> Use this field to specify a node selector to apply the performance profile to specific nodes.
