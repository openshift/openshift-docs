[id="cnf-tuning-nodes-for-low-latency-via-performanceprofile_{context}"]
= Tuning nodes for low latency with the performance profile

The performance profile lets you control latency tuning aspects of nodes that belong to a certain machine config pool. After you specify your settings, the `PerformanceProfile` object is compiled into multiple objects that perform the actual node level tuning:

* A `MachineConfig` file that manipulates the nodes.
* A `KubeletConfig` file that configures the Topology Manager, the CPU Manager, and the {product-title} nodes.
* The Tuned profile that configures the Node Tuning Operator.

You can use a performance profile to specify whether to update the kernel to kernel-rt, to allocate huge pages, and to partition the CPUs for performing housekeeping duties or running workloads.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {product-title} {product-version}, if you apply a performance profile to your cluster, all nodes in the cluster will reboot. This reboot includes control plane nodes and worker nodes that were not targeted by the performance profile. This is a known issue in {product-title} {product-version} because this release uses Linux control group version 2 (cgroup v2) in alignment with RHEL 9. The low latency tuning features associated with the performance profile do not support cgroup v2, therefore the nodes reboot to switch back to the cgroup v1 configuration.

To revert all nodes in the cluster to the cgroups v2 configuration, you must edit the `Node` resource. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-16976[*OCPBUGS-16976*])

[NOTE]
====
You can manually create the `PerformanceProfile` object or use the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) to generate a performance profile. See the additional resources below for more information on the PPC.

<1> Use this field to isolate specific CPUs to use with application containers for workloads. Set an even number of isolated CPUs to enable the pods to run without errors when hyperthreading is enabled.
<2> Use this field to reserve specific CPUs to use with infra containers for housekeeping.
<3> Use this field to install the real-time kernel on the node. Valid values are `true` or `false`. Setting the `true` value installs the real-time kernel.
<4> Use this field to configure the topology manager policy. Valid values are `none` (default), `best-effort`, `restricted`, and `single-numa-node`. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/topology-manager/#topology-manager-policies[Topology Manager Policies].
<5> Use this field to specify a node selector to apply the performance profile to specific nodes.
