= Additional configuration details for user-defined networks

The following table explains additional configurations for `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` and `UserDefinedNetwork` custom resources (CRs) that are optional. It is not recommended to set these fields without explicit need and understanding of OVN-Kubernetes network topology.

|Field|Type|Description

|`spec.joinSubnets`
|object
|When omitted, the platform sets default values for the `joinSubnets` field of `100.65.0.0/16` for IPv4 and  `fd99::/64` for IPv6. If the default address values are used anywhere in the cluster's network you must override it by setting the `joinSubnets` field. If you choose to set this field, ensure it does not conflict with other subnets in the cluster such as the cluster subnet, the `default` network cluster subnet, and the masquerade subnet.

The `joinSubnets` field configures the routing between different segments within a user-defined network. Dual-stack clusters can set 2 subnets, one for each IP family; otherwise, only 1 subnet is allowed. This field is only allowed for the `Primary` network.

|`spec.ipam.lifecycle`
|object
|The `spec.ipam.lifecycle` field configures the IP address management system (IPAM). You might use this field for virtual workloads to ensure persistent IP addresses. The only allowed value is `Persistent`, which 
ensures that your virtual workloads have persistent IP addresses across reboots and migration. These are assigned by the container network interface (CNI) and used by OVN-Kubernetes to program pod IP addresses. You must not change this for pod annotations. 

Setting a value of `Persistent` is only supported when `spec.ipam.mode` is set to `Enabled`. 

|`spec.ipam.mode`
|object
|The `spec.ipam.mode` field controls how much of the IP configuration is managed by OVN-Kubernetes. The following options are available:

**Enabled:** +
When enabled, OVN-Kubernetes applies the IP configuration to the SDN infrastructure and assigns IP addresses from the selected subnet to the individual pods. This is the default setting. When set to `Enabled`, the `subnets` field must be defined. `Enabled` is the default configuration.

**Disabled:** +
When disabled, OVN-Kubernetes only assigns MAC addresses and provides layer 2 communication, which allows users to configure IP addresses. `Disabled` is only available for layer 2 (secondary) networks. By disabling IPAM, features that rely on selecting pods by IP, for example, network policy, services, and so on, no longer function. Additionally, IP port security is also disabled for interfaces attached to this network. The `subnets` field must be empty when `spec.ipam.mode` is set to `Disabled.`

|`spec.layer2.mtu` and `spec.layer3.mtu`
|integer
|The maximum transmission units (MTU). The default value is `1400`. The boundary for IPv4 is `576`, and for IPv6 it is `1280`.
