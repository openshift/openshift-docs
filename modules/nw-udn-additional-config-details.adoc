== Additional configuration details for a UserDefinedNetworks CR

The following table explains additional configurations for UDN that are optional. It is not recommended to set these fields without explicit need and understanding of OVN-Kubernetes network topology.

|Field|Type|Description

|`spec.joinSubnets`
|object
|When omitted, the platform sets default values for the `joinSubnets` field of `100.65.0.0/16` for IPv4 and  `fd99::/64` for IPv6. If the default address values are used anywhere in the cluster's network you must override it by setting the `joinSubnets` field. If you choose to set this field, ensure it does not conflict with other subnets in the cluster such as the cluster subnet, the `default` network cluster subnet, and the masquerade subnet.

The `joinSubnets` field configures the routing between different segments within a user-defined network. Dual-stack clusters can set 2 subnets, one for each IP family; otherwise, only 1 subnet is allowed. This field is only allowed for the `Primary` network.

|`spec.IPAMLifecycle`
|object
|The `IPAMLifecycle` field configures the IP address management system (IPAM). You might use this field for virtual workloads to ensure persistent IP addresses. This field is allowed when `topology` is `layer2`. The `subnets` field must be specified when this field is specified. Setting a value of `Persistent` ensures that your virtual workloads have persistent IP addresses across reboots and migration. These are assigned by the container network interface (CNI) and used by OVN-Kubernetes to program pod IP addresses. You must not change this for pod annotations.

|`spec.layer2.mtu` and `spec.layer3.mtu`
|integer
|The maximum transmission units (MTU). The default value is `1400`. The boundary for IPv4 is `574`, and for IPv6 it is `1280`.
