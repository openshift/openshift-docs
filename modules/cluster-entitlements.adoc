[id="cluster-entitlements_{context}"]
= Internet and Telemetry access for {product-title}

In {product-title} {product-version}, you require access to the internet to install and entitle your cluster. The Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, also requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[{cloud-redhat-com}]. From there, you can allocate entitlements to your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

* Access the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[{cloud-redhat-com}] page to download the installation program and perform subscription management and entitlement. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster. If the Telemetry service cannot entitle your cluster, you must manually entitle it on the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/register[Cluster registration] page.
* Access link:http://quay.io[Quay.io] to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your cluster cannot have direct internet access, you can perform a restricted network installation on infrastructure that you provision. During that process, you download the content that is required and use it to populate a mirror registry with the packages that you need to install a cluster and generate the installation program. With some installation types, the environment that you install your cluster in will not require internet access. Before you update the cluster, you update the content of the mirror registry.
