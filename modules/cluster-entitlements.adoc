[id="cluster-entitlements_{context}"]
= Internet and Telemetry access for {product-title}

In {product-title} {product-version}, Telemetry is the component that provides
metrics about cluster health and the success of updates. To perform subscription
management, including legally entitling your purchase from Red Hat, you must use
the Telemetry service and access the
link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[{cloud-redhat-com}] page.

Because there is no disconnected subscription management, you cannot both opt
out of sending data back to Red Hat and entitle your purchase. Support for
disconnected subscription management might be added in future releases of
{product-title}
