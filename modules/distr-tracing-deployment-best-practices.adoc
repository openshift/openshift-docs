= Deployment best practices

* {DTProductName} instance names must be unique. If you want to have multiple {JaegerName} instances and are using sidecar injected agents, then the {JaegerName} instances should have unique names, and the injection annotation should explicitly specify the {JaegerName} instance name the tracing data should be reported to.

* If you have a multitenant implementation and tenants are separated by namespaces, deploy a {JaegerName} instance to each tenant namespace.

** Agent as a daemonset is not supported for multitenant installations or OpenShift Dedicated. Agent as a sidecar is the only supported configuration for these use cases.

* If you are installing {DTShortName} as part of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh, the {DTShortName} resources must be installed in the same namespace as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.
