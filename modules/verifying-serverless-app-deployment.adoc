= Verifying your serverless application deployment

To verify that your serverless application has been deployed successfully, you must get the application URL created by Knative, and then send a request to that URL and observe the output.

[NOTE]
====
{ServerlessProductName} supports the use of both HTTP and HTTPS URLs, however the output from `oc get ksvc <service_name>` will always print URLs using the `http://` format.
====

.Procedure

. Find the application URL:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ksvc <service_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
LATESTCREATED         LATESTREADY           READY     REASON
event-display   http://event-display-default.apps.ci-ln-jpht6ft-d5d6b.origin-ci-int-aws.dev.rhcloud.com   event-display-mx778   event-display-mx778   True
----

. Make a request to your cluster and observe the output.
+
.Example HTTP request
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl http://hello-default.example.com
----
+
.Example HTTPS request
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl https://hello-default.example.com
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Hello Serverless!

. Optional. If you receive an error relating to a self-signed certificate in the certificate chain, you can add the `--insecure` flag to the curl command to ignore the error.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Self-signed certificates must not be used in a production deployment. This method is only for testing purposes.
====
+
.Example
----
$ curl https://hello-default.example.com --insecure
Hello Serverless!
----

. Optional. If your {product-title} cluster is configured with a certificate that is signed by a certificate authority (CA) but not yet globally configured for your system, you can specify this with the curl command.
The path to the certificate can be passed to the curl command by using the `--cacert` flag.
+
.Example
----
$ curl https://hello-default.example.com --cacert <file>
Hello Serverless!
