= Verifying your serverless application deployment

To verify that your serverless application has been deployed successfully, you must get the application URL created by Knative, and then send a request to that URL and observe the output. {ServerlessProductName} supports the use of both HTTP and HTTPS URLs, however the output from `oc get ksvc` always prints URLs using the `http://` format.

.Prerequisites

* {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster.
* You have installed the `oc` CLI.
* You have created a Knative service.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Find the application URL:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ksvc <service_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME       URL                                   LATESTCREATED    LATESTREADY      READY   REASON
showcase   http://showcase-default.example.com   showcase-00001   showcase-00001   True
----
. Make a request to your cluster and observe the output.
+
.Example HTTP request (using HTTPie tool)
[source,terminal]
----
$ http showcase-default.example.com
----
+
.Example HTTPS request
[source,terminal]
----
$ https showcase-default.example.com
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Quarkus/2.13.7.Final-redhat-00003 Java/17.0.7
X-Config: {"sink":"http://localhost:31111","greet":"Ciao","delay":0}
X-Version: v0.7.0-4-g23d460f
content-length: 49

{
    "artifact": "knative-showcase",
    "greeting": "Ciao"
}
----
. Optional. If you don't have the HTTPie tool installed on your system, you can likely use curl tool instead:
+
.Example HTTPS request
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl http://showcase-default.example.com
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{"artifact":"knative-showcase","greeting":"Ciao"}
----
. Optional. If you receive an error relating to a self-signed certificate in the certificate chain, you can add the `--verify=no` flag to the HTTPie command to ignore the error:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ https --verify=no showcase-default.example.com
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Quarkus/2.13.7.Final-redhat-00003 Java/17.0.7
X-Config: {"sink":"http://localhost:31111","greet":"Ciao","delay":0}

{
    "artifact": "knative-showcase",
    "greeting": "Ciao"
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Self-signed certificates must not be used in a production deployment. This method is only for testing purposes.
====
. Optional. If your {ocp-product-title} cluster is configured with a certificate that is signed by a certificate authority (CA) but not yet globally configured for your system, you can specify this with the `curl` command.
The path to the certificate can be passed to the curl command by using the `--cacert` flag:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl https://showcase-default.example.com --cacert <file>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{"artifact":"knative-showcase","greeting":"Ciao"}
