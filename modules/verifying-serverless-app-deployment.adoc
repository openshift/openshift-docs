= Verifying your serverless application deployment

To verify that your serverless application has been deployed successfully, you must get the application URL created by Knative, and then send a request to that URL and observe the output.

[NOTE]
====
{ServerlessProductName} supports the use of both HTTP and HTTPS URLs, however the output from `oc get ksvc` will always print URLs using the `http://` format.
====

.Procedure

. Find the application URL by entering:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ksvc <service_name>
----

+
.Example output
+

[source,terminal]
----
NAME            URL                                        LATESTCREATED         LATESTREADY           READY   REASON
hello   http://hello-default.example.com   hello-4wsd2   hello-4wsd2   True
----

. Make a request to your cluster and observe the output.
+
.Example HTTP request

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl http://hello-default.example.com
----

+
.Example HTTPS request
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ curl https://hello-default.example.com
----

+
.Example output
+

[source,terminal]
----
Hello Serverless!
----

. Optional. If you receive an error relating to a self-signed certificate in the certificate chain, you can add the `--insecure` flag to the curl command to ignore the error:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ curl https://hello-default.example.com --insecure
----

+
.Example output
+

[source,terminal]
----
Hello Serverless!
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Self-signed certificates must not be used in a production deployment. This method is only for testing purposes.
====

. Optional. If your {product-title} cluster is configured with a certificate that is signed by a certificate authority (CA) but not yet globally configured for your system, you can specify this with the `curl` command.
The path to the certificate can be passed to the curl command by using the `--cacert` flag:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ curl https://hello-default.example.com --cacert <file>
----

+
.Example output
+

[source,terminal]
----
Hello Serverless!
----
