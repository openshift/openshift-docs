= Verifying your serverless application deployment

To verify that your serverless application has been deployed successfully, you must get the application host created by Knative, and then send a request to that host and observe the output.

NOTE: If you changed the application name from `helloworld-go` to a new name when creating the `service.yaml` file, replace `helloworld-go` in the commands with the new name you created.
