= GitOps Operator and GitOps ZTP plugins

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
+
--
The GitOps Operator provides a GitOps driven infrastructure for managing cluster deployment and configuration.
Cluster definitions and configuration are maintained in a Git repository.

ZTP plugins provide support for generating `Installation` CRs from `SiteConfig` CRs and automatically wrapping configuration CRs in policies based on {rh-rhacm} `PolicyGenerator` CRs.

The SiteConfig Operator provides improved support for generation of `Installation` CRs from `ClusterInstance` CRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Where possible, use `ClusterInstance` CRs for cluster installation instead of the `SiteConfig` with {ztp} plugin method.
====

You should structure the Git repository according to release version, with all necessary artifacts (`SiteConfig`, `ClusterInstance`, `PolicyGenerator`, and `PolicyGenTemplate`, and supporting reference CRs) included.
This enables deploying and managing multiple versions of the OpenShift platform and configuration versions to clusters simultaneously and through upgrades.

The recommended Git structure keeps reference CRs in a directory separate from customer or partner provided content.
This means that you can import reference updates by simply overwriting existing content.
Customer or partner-supplied CRs can be provided in a parallel directory to the reference CRs for easy inclusion in the generated configuration policies.
--

Limits and requirements::
* Each ArgoCD application supports up to 300 nodes.
Multiple ArgoCD applications can be used to achieve the maximum number of clusters supported by a single hub cluster.
* The `SiteConfig` CR must use the `extraManifests.searchPaths` field to reference the reference manifests.
+
[NOTE]
====
Since {product-title} 4.15, the `spec.extraManifestPath` field is deprecated.
====

Engineering considerations::
* Set the `MachineConfigPool` (`mcp`) CR `paused` field to true during a cluster upgrade maintenance window and set the `maxUnavailable` field to the maximum tolerable value.
This prevents multiple cluster node reboots during upgrade, which results in a shorter overall upgrade.
When you unpause the `mcp` CR, all the configuration changes are applied with a single reboot.
+
[NOTE]
====
During installation, custom `mcp` CRs can be paused along with setting `maxUnavailable` to 100% to improve installation times.
====

* To avoid confusion or unintentional overwriting when updating content, you should use unique and distinguishable names for custom CRs in the `reference-crs/` directory under core-overlay and extra manifests in Git.
* The `SiteConfig` CR allows multiple extra-manifest paths.
When file names overlap in multiple directory paths, the last file found in the directory order list takes precedence.
