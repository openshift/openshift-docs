= GitOps Operator and ZTP plugins

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release.

Description::
+
--
The GitOps Operator provides a GitOps driven infrastructure for managing cluster deployment and configuration.
Cluster definitions and configuration are maintained in a Git repository.

ZTP plugins provide support for generating `Installation` CRs from `SiteConfig` CRs and automatically wrapping configuration CRs in policies based on {rh-rhacm} `PolicyGenerator` CRs.

The SiteConfig Operator provides improved support for generation of `Installation` CRs from `ClusterInstance` CRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using `ClusterInstance` CRs for cluster installation is preferred over the `SiteConfig` custom resource with ZTP plugin method.
====

You should structure the Git repository according to release version, with all necessary artifacts (`SiteConfig`, `ClusterInstance`, `PolicyGenerator`, and `PolicyGenTemplate`, and supporting reference CRs) included.
This enables deploying and managing multiple versions of the {product-title} and configuration versions to clusters simultaneously and through upgrades.

The recommended Git structure keeps reference CRs in a directory separate from customer or partner provided content.
This means that you can import reference updates by simply overwriting existing content.
Customer or partner supplied CRs can be provided in a parallel directory to the reference CRs for easy inclusion in the generated configuration policies.

Limits and requirements::
// Scale results ACM-17868
* Each ArgoCD application supports up to 800 nodes.
Multiple ArgoCD applications can be used to achieve the maximum number of clusters supported by a single hub cluster.
* The `SiteConfig` CR must use the `extraManifests.searchPaths` field to reference the reference manifests.
+
[NOTE]
====
Since {product-title} 4.15, the `spec.extraManifestPath` field is deprecated.
====

Engineering considerations::
* Set the `MachineConfigPool` (`MCP`) CR `paused` field to true during a cluster upgrade maintenance window and set the `maxUnavailable` field to the maximum tolerable value.
This prevents multiple cluster node reboots during upgrade, which results in a shorter overall upgrade.
When you unpause the `mcp` CR, all the configuration changes are applied with a single reboot.
+
[NOTE]
====
During installation, custom `MCP` CRs can be paused along with setting `maxUnavailable` to 100% to improve installation times.
====

* To avoid confusion or unintentional overwriting when updating content, you should use unique and distinguishable names for custom CRs in the `reference-crs/` directory under core-overlay and extra manifests in git.
* The `SiteConfig` CR allows multiple extra-manifest paths.
When file names overlap in multiple directory paths, the last file found in the directory order list takes precedence.
