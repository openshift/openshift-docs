= Optional: Setting proxy settings

To deploy an {product-title} cluster using a proxy, make the following changes to the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: <domain>
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy.example.com:PORT
  httpsProxy: https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy.example.com:PORT
  noProxy: <WILDCARD_OF_DOMAIN>,<PROVISIONING_NETWORK/CIDR>,<BMC_ADDRESS_RANGE/CIDR>
----

The following is an example of `noProxy` with values.

[source,yaml]
----
noProxy: .example.com,172.22.0.0/24,10.10.0.0/24
----

With a proxy enabled, set the appropriate values of the proxy in the corresponding key/value pair.

Key considerations:

* If the proxy does not have an HTTPS proxy, change the value of `httpsProxy` from `https://` to `http://`.
* If using a provisioning network, include it in the `noProxy` setting, otherwise the installer will fail.
* Set all of the proxy settings as environment variables within the provisioner node. For example, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`.

[NOTE]
====
When provisioning with IPv6, you cannot define a CIDR address block in the `noProxy` settings. You must define each address separately.
