= Configuring and creating of the virtual machine

Continue configuring the virtual machine and then create it.

.Procedure

. In the *New Virtual Machine* -> *General* window, for each NIC under *Instantiate VM network interfaces by picking a vNIC profile*, select a vNIC profile.
. Go to the *New Virtual Machine* -> *System* window.
. Set *Memory Size* to *16384 MB* or more. This default value is equivalent to 16 GiB. You can adjust this value according to the workload you expect on the compute machines and the amount of memory resources that are available.
. Due to a known issue (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821215[*bz#1821215*]), set *Physical Memory Guaranteed* to *8192 MB*. This value is equivalent to 8 GiB.
. Set *Total Virtual CPUs* to *4* or more. You can adjust this value according to the workload you expect on the compute machines and the resources that are available.
. Expand *Advanced Parameters*.
. Adjust *Cores per Virtual Socket* to *4* or more so it matches the *Total Virtual CPUs* setting.
. Press btn:[OK] to save and close the *New Virtual Machine*.
+
The new virtual machine appears in the *Compute* -> *Virtual Machines* window. Because the virtual machine is not starting, it appears quickly.
