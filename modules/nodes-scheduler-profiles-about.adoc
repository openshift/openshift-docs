= About scheduler profiles

You can specify a scheduler profile to control how pods are scheduled onto nodes.

The following scheduler profiles are available:

`LowNodeUtilization`:: This profile attempts to spread pods evenly across nodes to get low resource usage per node. This profile provides the default scheduler behavior.

`HighNodeUtilization`:: This profile attempts to place as many pods as possible on to as few nodes as possible. This minimizes node count and has high resource usage per node.

`NoScoring`:: This is a low-latency profile that strives for the quickest scheduling cycle by disabling all score plugins. This might sacrifice better scheduling decisions for faster ones.
