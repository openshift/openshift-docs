= Manually pruning images

The Pruning Custom Resource enables automatic image pruning. However, administrators can manually prune images that are no longer required by the system due to age, status, or exceed limits by running the following command:

----
$ oc adm prune images <options>
----

To manually prune images, you must first log in to the CLI as a user with an
access token. The user must also have the cluster role of `system:image-pruner` or
greater (for example, `cluster-admin`).

Pruning images removes data from the integrated registry unless
`--prune-registry=false` is used.

Pruning images with the `--namespace` flag does not remove images, only
imagestreams. Images are non-namespaced resources. Therefore, limiting pruning
to a particular namespace makes it impossible to calculate its current usage.

By default, the integrated registry caches metadata of blobs to reduce the number
of requests to storage, and to increase the request-processing speed.
Pruning does not update the integrated registry cache. Images that still contain pruned layers after pruning will be broken because the pruned layers
that have metadata in the cache will not be pushed. Therefore, you must redeploy the registry to clear the cache after pruning:

----
$ oc rollout restart deployment/image-registry -n openshift-image-registry
----

If the integrated registry uses a Redis cache, you must clean the database
manually.

`oc adm prune images` operations require a route for your registry. Registry
routes are not created by default.

The *Prune images CLI configuration options* table describes the options you can use with the `oc adm prune images <options>` command.

.Prune images CLI configuration options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`--all`
|Include images that were not pushed to the registry, but have been mirrored by
pullthrough. This is on by default. To limit the pruning to images that were
pushed to the integrated registry, pass `--all=false`.

.^|`--certificate-authority`
|The path to a certificate authority file to use when communicating with the
{product-title}-managed registries. Defaults to the certificate authority data
from the current user's configuration file. If provided, a secure connection is
initiated.

.^|`--confirm`
|Indicate that pruning should occur, instead of performing a test-run. This
requires a valid route to the integrated container image registry. If this
command is run outside of the cluster network, the route must be provided
using `--registry-url`.

.^|`--force-insecure`
|Use caution with this option. Allow an insecure connection to the container
registry that is hosted via HTTP or has an invalid HTTPS certificate.

.^|`--keep-tag-revisions=<N>`
|For each imagestream, keep up to at most `N` image revisions per tag (default
`3`).

.^|`--keep-younger-than=<duration>`
|Do not prune any image that is younger than `<duration>` relative to the
current time. Alternately, do not prune any image that is referenced by any other object that
is younger than `<duration>` relative to the current time (default `60m`).

.^|`--prune-over-size-limit`
|Prune each image that exceeds the smallest limit defined in the same project.
This flag cannot be combined with `--keep-tag-revisions` nor
`--keep-younger-than`.

.^|`--registry-url`
|The address to use when contacting the registry. The command attempts to use a
cluster-internal URL determined from managed images and imagestreams. In case
it fails (the registry cannot be resolved or reached), an alternative route that
works needs to be provided using this flag. The registry host name can be
prefixed by `https://` or `http://`, which enforces particular connection
protocol.

.^|`--prune-registry`
|In conjunction with the conditions stipulated by the other options, this option
controls whether the data in the registry corresponding to the {product-title}
image API object is pruned. By default, image pruning processes both the image
API objects and corresponding data in the registry.

This option is useful when you are only concerned with removing etcd content, to reduce the number of image objects but are not concerned with cleaning up registry storage, or if you intend to do that separately by hard pruning the registry during an appropriate maintenance window for the registry.

[id="pruning-images-conditions_{context}"]
== Image prune conditions

You can apply conditions to your manually pruned images.

* To remove any image managed by {product-title}, or images with the annotation `openshift.io/image.managed`:
** Created at least `--keep-younger-than` minutes ago and are not currently referenced by any:
*** Pods created less than `--keep-younger-than` minutes ago
*** Imagestreams created less than `--keep-younger-than` minutes ago
*** Running Pods
*** Pending Pods
*** ReplicationControllers
*** Deployments
*** DeploymentConfigs
*** ReplicaSets
*** Build Configurations
*** Builds
*** `--keep-tag-revisions` most recent items in `stream.status.tags[].items`
** That are exceeding the smallest limit defined in the same project and are not currently referenced by any:
*** Running Pods
*** Pending Pods
*** ReplicationControllers
*** Deployments
*** DeploymentConfigs
*** ReplicaSets
*** Build Configurations
*** Builds
* There is no support for pruning from external registries.
* When an image is pruned, all references to the image are removed from all
imagestreams that have a reference to the image in `status.tags`.
* Image layers that are no longer referenced by any images are removed.

[NOTE]
====
The `--prune-over-size-limit` flag cannot be combined with the
`--keep-tag-revisions` flag nor the `--keep-younger-than` flags. Doing so returns
information that this operation is not allowed.
====

Separating the removal of {product-title} image API objects and image data from
the registry by using `--prune-registry=false`, followed by hard pruning the
registry, can narrow timing windows and is safer when compared to trying to
prune both through one command. However, timing windows are not completely
removed.

For example, you can still create a Pod referencing an image as pruning
identifies that image for pruning. You should still keep track of an API object
created during the pruning operations that might reference images so that you can
mitigate any references to deleted content.

Re-doing the pruning without the `--prune-registry` option or with
`--prune-registry=true` does not lead to pruning the associated storage in the image registry for images previously pruned by `--prune-registry=false`.
Any images that were pruned with `--prune-registry=false` can only be deleted from
registry storage by hard pruning the registry.

[id="pruning-images-running-operation_{context}"]
== Running the image prune operation

.Procedure

. To see what a pruning operation would delete:

.. Keeping up to three tag revisions, and keeping resources (images, imagestreams,
and Pods) younger than 60 minutes:
+
----
$ oc adm prune images --keep-tag-revisions=3 --keep-younger-than=60m
----

.. Pruning every image that exceeds defined limits:
+
----
$ oc adm prune images --prune-over-size-limit
----

. To perform the prune operation with the options from the previous step:
+
----
$ oc adm prune images --keep-tag-revisions=3 --keep-younger-than=60m --confirm
----
+
----
$ oc adm prune images --prune-over-size-limit --confirm
----

[id="pruning-images-secure-insecure_{context}"]
== Using secure or insecure connections

The secure connection is the preferred and recommended approach. It is done over
HTTPS protocol with a mandatory certificate verification. The `prune` command
always attempts to use it if possible. If it is not possible, in some cases it
can fall-back to insecure connection, which is dangerous. In this case, either
certificate verification is skipped or plain HTTP protocol is used.

The fall-back to insecure connection is allowed in the following cases unless
`--certificate-authority` is specified:

. The `prune` command is run with the `--force-insecure` option.
. The provided `registry-url` is prefixed with the `http://` scheme.
. The provided `registry-url` is a local-link address or `localhost`.
. The configuration of the current user allows for an insecure connection. This
can be caused by the user either logging in using `--insecure-skip-tls-verify`
or choosing the insecure connection when prompted.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the registry is secured by a certificate authority different from the one
used by {product-title}, it must be specified using the
`--certificate-authority` flag. Otherwise, the `prune` command fails with an
error.

== Image pruning problems

[discrete]
[id="pruning-images-not-being-pruned_{context}"]
==== Images not being pruned

If your images keep accumulating and the `prune` command removes just a small
portion of what you expect, ensure that you understand the image prune
conditions that must apply for an image to be considered a candidate for
pruning.

Ensure that images you want removed occur at higher positions in each tag
history than your chosen tag revisions threshold. For example, consider an old
and obsolete image named `sha:abz`. By running the following command in
namespace `N`, where the image is tagged, the image is tagged three times in a
single imagestream named `myapp`:

----
$ image_name="sha:abz"
$ oc get is -n N -o go-template='{{range $isi, $is := .items}}{{range $ti, $tag := $is.status.tags}}'\
  '{{range $ii, $item := $tag.items}}{{if eq $item.image "'"${image_name}"\
  $'"}}{{$is.metadata.name}}:{{$tag.tag}} at position {{$ii}} out of {{len $tag.items}}\n'\
  '{{end}}{{end}}{{end}}{{end}}'
myapp:v2 at position 4 out of 5
myapp:v2.1 at position 2 out of 2
myapp:v2.1-may-2016 at position 0 out of 1
----

When default options are used, the image is never pruned because it occurs at
position `0` in a history of `myapp:v2.1-may-2016` tag. For an image to be
considered for pruning, the administrator must either:

* Specify `--keep-tag-revisions=0` with the `oc adm prune images` command.
+
[CAUTION]
====
This action removes all the tags from all the namespaces with
underlying images, unless they are younger or they are referenced by objects
younger than the specified threshold.
====

* Delete all the `istags` where the position is below the revision threshold,
which means `myapp:v2.1` and `myapp:v2.1-may-2016`.

* Move the image further in the history, either by running new builds pushing to
the same `istag`, or by tagging other image. This is not always
desirable for old release tags.

Tags having a date or time of a particular image's build in their names should
be avoided, unless the image must be preserved for an undefined amount of time.
Such tags tend to have just one image in their history, which prevents
them from ever being pruned.

[id="pruning-images-secure-against-insecure_{context}"]
==== Using a secure connection against insecure registry

If you see a message similar to the following in the output of the `oc adm prune images`
command, then your registry is not secured and the `oc adm prune images`
client attempts to use a secure connection:

----
error: error communicating with registry: Get https://172.30.30.30:5000/healthz: http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client
----

* The recommended solution is to secure the registry. Otherwise, you can force the
client to use an insecure connection by appending `--force-insecure`  to the
command; however, this is not recommended.

[discrete]
[id="pruning-images-insecure-against-secure_{context}"]
==== Using an insecure connection against a secured registry

If you see one of the following errors in the output of the `oc adm prune images`
command, it means that your registry is secured using a certificate signed by a
certificate authority other than the one used by `oc adm prune images` client for
connection verification:

----
error: error communicating with registry: Get http://172.30.30.30:5000/healthz: malformed HTTP response "\x15\x03\x01\x00\x02\x02"
error: error communicating with registry: [Get https://172.30.30.30:5000/healthz: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority, Get http://172.30.30.30:5000/healthz: malformed HTTP response "\x15\x03\x01\x00\x02\x02"]
----

By default, the certificate authority data stored in the user's configuration files is used; the same is true for communication with the master API.

Use the `--certificate-authority` option to provide the right certificate
authority for the container image registry server.

[discrete]
[id="pruning-images-wrong-ca_{context}"]
==== Using the wrong certificate authority

The following error means that the certificate authority used to sign the
certificate of the secured container image registry is different from the
authority used by the client:

----
error: error communicating with registry: Get https://172.30.30.30:5000/: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
----

Make sure to provide the right one with the flag `--certificate-authority`.

As a workaround, the `--force-insecure` flag can be added instead. However, this
is not recommended.
