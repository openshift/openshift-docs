= Deploying Argo CD applications

[role="_abstract"]
You can deploy Argo CD Applications using either the managed agent mode or the autonomous agent mode. The deployment mode determines which mode is the source of truth and where the Argo CD application must be created.

* In managed agent mode, the *hub cluster* is the source of truth.
* In autonomous agent mode, the *spoke cluster* is the source of truth.
