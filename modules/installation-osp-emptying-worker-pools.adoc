[id="installation-osp-emptying-worker-pools_{context}"]
= Emptying compute machine pools

To proceed with an installation that uses your own infrastructure, set the number of compute machines in the installation configuration file to zero. Later, you create these machines manually.

.Prerequisites

* You have the `install-config.yaml` file that was generated by the {product-title} installation program.

.Procedure

. On a command line, browse to the directory that contains `install-config.yaml`.

. From that directory, either run a script to edit the `install-config.yaml` file or update the file manually:

** To set the value by using a script, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ python -c '
import yaml;
path = "install-config.yaml";
data = yaml.safe_load(open(path));
data["compute"][0]["replicas"] = 0;
open(path, "w").write(yaml.dump(data, default_flow_style=False))'
----

** To set the value manually, open the file and set the value of `compute.<first entry>.replicas` to `0`.
