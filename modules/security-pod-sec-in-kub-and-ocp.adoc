= Advancement of pod security in Kubernetes and {product-title}

Kubernetes initially had limited pod security. When {product-title} integrated Kubernetes, Red Hat added pod security through Security Context Constraints (SCCs). In Kubernetes version 1.3, `PodSecurityPolicy` (PSP) was introduced as a similar feature. However, Pod Security Admission (PSA) was introduced in Kubernetes version 1.21, which resulted in the deprecation of PSP in Kubernetes version 1.25.

PSA also became available in {product-title} version 4.11. While PSA improves pod security, it lacks features provided by SCCs that are still necessary for certain use cases. Therefore, {product-title} continues to support both PSA and SCCs.
