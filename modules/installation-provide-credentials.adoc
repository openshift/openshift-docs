= Configuring your computer for installation

Before you install your {product-title} cluster, add your Amazon Web Services (AWS)
credentials to you computer.

.Prerequisites

* Configure an AWS account to host your cluster and a user with sufficient
privileges to complete the installation process. You need details about the
account and user, including the access key ID and secret access key values for
the user.

.Procedure

. Download the AWS CLI and install it on your computer. See
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-bundle.html[Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer (Linux, macOS, or Unix)]
in the AWS documentation.

. Provide the configuration details for your account. Run the following command,
and provide details about your account at the prompts:
+
----
$ aws configure --profile=<profile_name> <1>

AWS Access Key ID [None]: accesskey <2>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: secretkey <2>
Default region name [None]: us-west-2 <3>
Default output format [None]:
----
<1> Enter a `<profile_name>` to store the credentials in.
<2> Enter the access key ID and secret access key values for the user that you
configured to run the installation program.
<3> Enter the name of the region that you plan to deploy your cluster to.

. Save the AWS profile:
+
----
$ export AWS_PROFILE=<profile_name> <1>
----
<1> Enter the `<profile_name>` that you specified.

. Optionally, create an SSH key to use to access machines in your cluster. You
can use this key to SSH into the master nodes as the user `core`. When you
deploy the cluster, the key is added to the `core` user's
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` list.

[NOTE]
====
Use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific approaches
such as
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[AWS key pairs].
