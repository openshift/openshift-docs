[id="oc-mirror-dry-run-v2_{context}"]
= Performing a dry run for oc-mirror plugin v2

Verify your image set configuration by performing a dry run without mirroring any images. This ensures your setup is correct and prevents unintended changes.

.Procedure

* To perform a test run, run the `oc mirror` command and append the `--dry-run` argument to the command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror -c <image_set_config_yaml> file://<oc_mirror_workspace_path> --dry-run --v2
----
+
where:

`<image_set_config_yaml>`:: Specifies the image set configuration file that you created.
`<oc_mirror_workspace_path>`:: Insert the address of the workspace path.
`<mirror_registry_url>`:: Insert the URL or address of the remote container registry from which images will be mirrored or deleted.
+
.Example output

.Verification

. Navigate to the workspace directory that was generated:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd <oc_mirror_workspace_path>
----

. Review the `mapping.txt` and `missing.txt` files that were generated. These files contain a list of all images that would be mirrored.
