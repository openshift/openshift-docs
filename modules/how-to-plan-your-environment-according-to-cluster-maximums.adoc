= How to plan your environment according to tested cluster maximums

[IMPORTANT]
====
Oversubscribing the physical resources on a node affects resource guarantees the
Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod placement. Learn what measures you can
take to avoid memory swapping.

Some of the tested maximums are stretched only in a single dimension. They will vary
when many objects are running on the cluster.

The numbers noted in this documentation are based on Red Hat's test methodology,
setup, configuration, and tunings. These numbers can vary based on your own
individual setup and environments.
====

While planning your environment, determine how many pods are expected to fit per
node:

----
Required Pods per Cluster / Pods per Node = Total Number of Nodes Needed
----

The current maximum number of pods per node is 250. However, the number of pods 
that fit on a node is dependent on the application itself. Consider the application's 
memory, CPU, and storage requirements, as described in _How to plan your environment according to application requirements_.

.Example scenario

If you want to scope your cluster at 2200 pods, assuming the 250 maximum pods 
per node, you would need at least nine nodes:

----
2200 / 250 = 8.8
----

If you increase the number of nodes to 20, then the pod distribution changes to
110 pods per node:

----
2200 / 20 = 110
----

Where:

----
Required Pods per Cluster / Total Number of Nodes = Expected Pods per Node 
----
