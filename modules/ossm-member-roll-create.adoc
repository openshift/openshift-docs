= Creating the {SMProductName} member roll

The `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` lists the projects that belong to the {SMProductShortName} control plane. Only projects listed in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` are affected by the control plane. A project does not belong to a service mesh until you add it to the member roll for a particular control plane deployment.

You must create a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource named `default` in the same project as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, for example `istio-system`.

[id="ossm-member-roll-create-console_{context}"]
== Creating the member roll from the web console

You can add one or more projects to the {SMProductShortName} member roll from the web console. In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the {SMProductShortName} control plane project.

.Prerequisites
* An installed, verified {SMProductName} Operator.
* List of existing projects to add to the service mesh.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. If you do not already have services for your mesh, or you are starting from scratch, create a project for your applications. It must be different from the project where you installed the {SMProductShortName} control plane.

.. Navigate to *Home* -> *Projects*.

.. Enter a name in the *Name* field.

.. Click *Create*.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the *Project* menu and choose the project where your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource is deployed from the list, for example `istio-system`.

. Click the {SMProductName} Operator.

. Click the *Istio Service Mesh Member Roll* tab.

. Click *Create ServiceMeshMemberRoll*

. Click *Members*, then enter the name of your project in the *Value* field. You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.

. Click *Create*.

[id="ossm-member-roll-create-cli_{context}"]
== Creating the member roll from the CLI

You can add a project to the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` from the command line.

.Prerequisites

* An installed, verified {SMProductName} Operator.
* List of projects to add to the service mesh.
* Access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --username=<NAMEOFUSER> https://<HOSTNAME>:6443
----

. If you do not already have services for your mesh, or you are starting from scratch, create a project for your applications. It must be different from the project where you installed the {SMProductShortName} control plane.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project <your-project>
----

. To add your projects as members, modify the following example YAML. You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource. In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the {SMProductShortName} control plane project.

  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  members:
    # a list of projects joined into the service mesh
    - your-project-name
    - another-project-name
----

. Run the following command to upload and create the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource in the `istio-system` namespace.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n istio-system -f servicemeshmemberroll-default.yaml
----

. Run the following command to verify the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` was created successfully.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get smmr -n istio-system default
----
+
The installation has finished successfully when the `STATUS` column is `Configured`.
