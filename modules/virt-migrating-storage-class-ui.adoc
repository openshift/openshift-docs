[id="virt-migrating-storage-class-ui_{context}"]
= Migrating VM disks to a different storage class by using the web console

You can migrate one or more disks attached to a virtual machine (VM) to a different storage class by using the {product-title} web console. When performing this action on a running VM, the operation of the VM is not interrupted and the data on the migrated disks remains accessible.

[NOTE]
====
With the {VirtProductName} Operator, you can only start storage class migration for one VM at the time and the VM must be running. If you need to migrate more VMs at once or migrate a mix of running and stopped VMs, consider using the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/migration_toolkit_for_containers/{mtc-version}/html/migration_toolkit_for_containers/index[{mtc-first}].

{mtc-full} is not part of {VirtProductName} and requires separate installation.

:FeatureName: Storage class migration
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

.Prerequisites

* You must have a data volume or a persistent volume claim (PVC) available for storage class migration.
* The cluster must have a node available for live migration. As part of the storage class migration, the VM is live migrated to a different node.
* The VM must be running.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines* in the web console.
. Click the Options menu {kebab} beside the virtual machine and select *Migration* -> *Storage*.
+
You can also access this option from the *VirtualMachine details* page by selecting *Actions* -> *Migration* -> *Storage*.
. On the *Migration details* page, choose whether to migrate the entire VM storage or selected volumes only. If you click *Selected volumes*, select any disks that you intend to migrate. Click *Next* to proceed.
. From the list of available options on the *Destination StorageClass* page, select the storage class to migrate to. Click *Next* to proceed.
. On the *Review* page, review the list of affected disks and the target storage class. To start the migration, click *Migrate VirtualMachine storage*.
. Stay on the *Migrate VirtualMachine storage* page to watch the progress and wait for the confirmation that the migration completed successfully.

.Verification

. From the *VirtualMachine details* page, navigate to *Configuration* -> *Storage*.
. Verify that all disks have the expected storage class listed in the *Storage class* column.
