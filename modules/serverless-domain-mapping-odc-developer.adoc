You can use the *Developer* perspective of the {product-title} web console to map a `DomainMapping` custom resource (CR) to a Knative service.

.Prerequisites

* You are in the *Developer* perspective.
* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster. This must be completed by a cluster administrator.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* You have created a Knative service and control a custom domain that you want to map to that service.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the *Topology* page.

. Right-click on the service that you want to map to a domain, and select the *Edit* option that contains the service name. For example, if the service is named `example-service`, select the *Edit example-service* option.

. In the *Advanced options* section, click *Show advanced Routing options*.
.. If the domain mapping CR that you want to map to the service already exists, you can select it from the *Domain mapping* drop-down.
.. If you want to create a new domain mapping CR, type the domain name into the box, and select the *Create* option. For example, if you type in `example.com`, the *Create* option is *Create "example.com"*.

. Click *Save* to save the changes to your service.

.Verification

. Navigate to the *Topology* page.

. Click on the service that you have created.

. In the *Resources* tab of the service information window, you can see the domain you have mapped to the service listed under *Domain mappings*.
