= Forwarding logs using ConfigMaps
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

You can configure cluster logging to send logs to destinations outside of your {product-title} cluster instead of the default Elasticsearch log store using a ConfigMap:

* *Sending logs using the Fluentd forward protocol.* You can create a ConfigMap to use the Fluentd *forward* protocol to securely send logs to an external logging aggregator that accepts the Fluent *forward* protocol.
* *Sending logs using syslog.* You can create a ConfigMap to use the syslog protocol to send logs to an external syslog (RFC 3164) server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These methods for forwarding logs are deprecated in {product-title} and will be removed in a future release. For the fully-supported log forwarding solution, use the Log Forwarding API.
