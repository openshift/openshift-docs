= Using the ApiServerSource with the YAML method

This guide describes the steps required to create, manage, and delete an ApiServerSource using YAML files.

.Prerequisites

* You will need to have a Knative Serving and Eventing installation.
* You will need to have created the `default` broker in the same namespace as the one defined in the ApiServerSource YAML file.

.Procedure

. Create a service account, role, and role binding for the ApiServerSource.
+
You can do this by creating a file named `authentication.yaml` and copying the following sample code into it:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: events-sa
  namespace: default <1>

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: event-watcher
  namespace: default <1>
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
    resources:
      - events
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: k8s-ra-event-watcher
  namespace: default <1>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: event-watcher
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: events-sa
    namespace: default <1>
----
+
<1> Change this namespace to the namespace that you have selected for installing ApiServerSource.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to re-use an existing service account with the appropriate permissions, you must modify the `authentication.yaml` for that service account.
====
+
After you have created the `authentication.yaml` file, apply it by entering the following command:
+
----
$ oc apply --filename authentication.yaml
----

. Create an ApiServerSource event source.
+
You can do this by creating a file named `k8s-events.yaml` and copying the following sample code into it:
+
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ApiServerSource
metadata:
  name: testevents
spec:
  serviceAccountName: events-sa
  mode: Resource
  resources:
    - apiVersion: v1
      kind: Event
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1beta1
      kind: Broker
      name: default
----
+
After you have created the `k8s-events.yaml` file, apply it by entering the following command:
+
----
$ oc apply --filename k8s-events.yaml
----

. To check that the ApiServerSource is set up correctly, create a Knative service that dumps incoming messages to its log.
+
Copy the following sample YAML into a file named `service.yaml`:
+
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
  namespace: default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:v0.13.2
----
+
After you have created the `service.yaml` file, apply it by entering the following command:
+
----
$ oc apply --filename service.yaml
----

. Create a trigger from the `default` broker to filter events to the service created in the previous step.
+
You can create the trigger by creating a file named `trigger.yaml` and copying the following sample code into it:
+
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: event-display-trigger
  namespace: default
spec:
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
----
+
After you have created the `trigger.yaml` file, apply it by entering the following command:
+
----
$ oc apply --filename trigger.yaml
----

. Create events by launching a pod in the default namespace. You can do this by entering the following command:
+
----
$ oc create deployment hello-node --image=quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display
----

. Check that the controller is mapped correctly by entering the following command and inspecting the output:
+
----
$ oc get apiserversource.sources.knative.dev testevents -o yaml
----
+
The output should be similar to:
+
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ApiServerSource
metadata:
  annotations:
  creationTimestamp: "2020-04-07T17:24:54Z"
  generation: 1
  name: testevents
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "62868"
  selfLink: /apis/sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/apiserversources/testevents2
  uid: 1603d863-bb06-4d1c-b371-f580b4db99fa
spec:
  mode: Resource
  resources:
  - apiVersion: v1
    controller: false
    controllerSelector:
      apiVersion: ""
      kind: ""
      name: ""
      uid: ""
    kind: Event
    labelSelector: {}
  serviceAccountName: events-sa
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1beta1
      kind: Broker
      name: default
----

.Verification steps

You can verify that the Kubernetes events were sent into the Knative eventing system by looking at the message dumper function logs.

You can view the message dumper function logs by entering the following commands:
----
$ oc get pods
$ oc logs $(oc get pod -o name | grep event-display) -c user-container
----

The logs should contain lines similar to the following:
----
☁️  cloudevents.Event
Validation: valid
Context Attributes,
  specversion: 1.0
  type: dev.knative.apiserver.resource.update
  datacontenttype: application/json
  ...
Data,
  {
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "involvedObject": {
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "fieldPath": "spec.containers{hello-node}",
      "kind": "Pod",
      "name": "hello-node",
      "namespace": "default",
       .....
    },
    "kind": "Event",
    "message": "Started container",
    "metadata": {
      "name": "hello-node.159d7608e3a3572c",
      "namespace": "default",
      ....
    },
    "reason": "Started",
    ...
  }

== Deleting the ApiServerSource

You can delete the ApiServerSource, trigger, service, service account, cluster role, and cluster binding created in this guide by entering the following `oc` commands:
----
$ oc delete --filename trigger.yaml
$ oc delete --filename service.yaml
$ oc delete --filename k8s-events.yaml
$ oc delete --filename authentication.yaml
