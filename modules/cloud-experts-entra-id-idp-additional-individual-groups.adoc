= Granting additional permissions to individual groups

[role="_abstract"]
If you opted to enable group claims, the cluster OAuth provider automatically creates or updates the user's group memberships by using the group ID. The cluster OAuth provider does not automatically create `RoleBindings` and `ClusterRoleBindings` for the groups that are created; you are responsible for creating those bindings by using your own processes.

To grant an automatically generated group access to the `cluster-admin` role, you must create a `ClusterRoleBinding` to the group ID.

.Procedure
* Create the `ClusterRoleBinding` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-group --clusterrole=cluster-admin --group=<GROUP_ID>
----
+
--
where:

`<GROUP-ID>`:: Provide the Entra ID group ID that you want to have cluster admin permissions.
--
+
Now, any user in the specified group automatically receives `cluster-admin` access.
