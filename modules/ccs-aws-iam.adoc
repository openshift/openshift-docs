[id="aws-policy-iam-policies_{context}"]
== IAM policies

[NOTE]
====
IAM policies are subject to modification as the capabilities of {product-title} change.
====

* The `AdministratorAccess` policy is used by the administration role. This policy provides Red Hat the access necessary to administer the {product-title} cluster in the customer-provided AWS account.

* If enabled, the `BillingReadOnlyAccess` role provides read-only access to view billing and usage information for the account.
+
Billing and usage access is only granted if the root account in the AWS Organization has it enabled. This is an optional step the customer must perform to enable read-only billing and usage access and does not impact the creation of this profile and the role that uses it. If this role is not enabled, users will not see billing and usage information. See this tutorial on link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_billing.html#tutorial-billing-step1[how to enable access to billing data].
