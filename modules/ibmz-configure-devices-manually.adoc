= Configuring additional devices manually

Tasks in this section describe how to manually configure additional devices in an {ibm-z-name} or {ibm-linuxone-name} environment. This configuration method is persistent over node restarts but not {product-title} native and you need to redo the steps if you replace the node.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.
* The device must be available to the node.
* In a z/VM environment, the device must be attached to the z/VM guest.

.Procedure

. Connect to the node via SSH by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh <user>@<node_ip_address>
----
+
You can also start a debug session to the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----

. To enable the devices with the `chzdev` command, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo chzdev -e 0.0.8000
  sudo chzdev -e 1000-1002
  sude chzdev -e 4444
  sudo chzdev -e 0.0.8000:0x500507680d760026:0x00bc000000000000
