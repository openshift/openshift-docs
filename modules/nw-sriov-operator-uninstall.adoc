= Uninstalling the SR-IOV Network Operator

[role="_abstract"]
You can remove the SR-IOV Network Operator from your cluster by uninstalling the Operator. This ensures that the Operator and its associated resources are deleted when you no longer need to manage SR-IOV network devices.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have the SR-IOV Network Operator installed.

.Procedure

. Delete all SR-IOV custom resources (CRs):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete sriovnetwork -n openshift-sriov-network-operator --all
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete sriovnetworknodepolicy -n openshift-sriov-network-operator --all
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete sriovibnetwork -n openshift-sriov-network-operator --all
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete sriovoperatorconfigs -n openshift-sriov-network-operator --all
----

. Follow the instructions in the "Deleting Operators from a cluster" section to remove the SR-IOV Network Operator from your cluster.

. Delete the SR-IOV custom resource definitions that remain in the cluster after the SR-IOV Network Operator is uninstalled:
