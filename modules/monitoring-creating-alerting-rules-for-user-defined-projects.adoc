= Creating alerting rules for user-defined projects

You can create alerting rules for user-defined projects. Those alerting rules will trigger alerts based on the values of the chosen metrics.

[NOTE]
====
* When you create an alerting rule, a project label is enforced on it even if a rule with the same name exists in another project.

* To help users understand the impact and cause of the alert, ensure that your alerting rule contains an alert message and severity value.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You are logged in as a user that has the `monitoring-rules-edit` cluster role for the project where you want to create an alerting rule.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for alerting rules. In this example, it is called `example-app-alerting-rule.yaml`.

. Add an alerting rule configuration to the YAML file.
The following example creates a new alerting rule named `example-alert`. The alerting rule fires an alert when the `version` metric exposed by the sample service becomes `0`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: example-alert
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  groups:
  - name: example
    rules:
    - alert: VersionAlert # <1>
      expr: version{job="prometheus-example-app"} == 0 # <2>
      labels:
        severity: warning # <3>
      annotations:
        message: This is an example alert. # <4>
----
<1> The name of the alerting rule you want to create.
<2> The PromQL query expression that defines the new rule.
<3> The severity assigned to the alert.
<4> The message associated with the alert.

. Apply the configuration file to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-app-alerting-rule.yaml
