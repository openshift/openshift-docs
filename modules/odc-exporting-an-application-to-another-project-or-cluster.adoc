= Exporting an application to another project or cluster

As a developer, you can export your application in the ZIP file format. Based on your needs, import the exported application to another project in the same cluster or a different cluster by using the *Import YAML* option in the *+Add* view. Exporting your application helps you to reuse your application resources and saves your time.

.Prerequisites

[NOTE]
====
The *Export application* option is disabled in the *Topology* view even after installing the gitops-primer operator.

* You have created an application in the *Topology* view to enable *Export application*.

.Procedure

. Click *OK* in the *Export Application* dialog box. A notification opens to confirm that the export of resources from your project has started.

. Optional steps that you might need to perform in the following scenarios:
+
* If you have started exporting an incorrect application, click  *Export application* -> *Cancel Export*.
* If your export is already in progress and you want to start a fresh export, click  *Export application* -> *Restart Export*.
