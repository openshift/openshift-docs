[id="zero-trust-manager-pause-reconciliation_{context}"]
= Pausing Operator reconciliation

[role="_abstract"]
Pause reconciliation of the operands by enabling `create-only` mode. This setting prevents the Operator from automatically reverting your manual changes to the desired state. You can enable this mode by updating the Operator's subscription object.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When `create-only` mode is disabled, the Operator overwrites the resources if any conflicts exist.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {zero-trust-full} on your machine.

* You have installed the SPIRE Servers, Agents, SPIFFE Container Storage Interface (CSI), and an OpenID Connect (OIDC) Discovery Provider and are in running status.

.Procedure

* To pause reconciling the operands resources managed by the Operator, add the environment variable `CREATE_ONLY_MODE`: `true` in the subscription object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n $OPERATOR_NAMESPACE patch subscription openshift-zero-trust-workload-identity-manager --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"config":{"env":[{"name":"CREATE_ONLY_MODE","value":"true"}]}}}'
----

.Verification
* Check the status of the `SpireServer` resource to confirm that the `create-only` mode is active. The `status` must be `true` and the `reason` must be `CreateOnlyModeEnabled`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get SpireServer cluster -o yaml
----

The following is an example that confirms that the 'create-only' mode is active.
[source,yaml]
----
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-12-23T11:36:58Z"
    message: All components are ready
    reason: Ready
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-12-23T11:36:58Z"
    message: All operand CRs are ready
    reason: Ready
    status: "True"
    type: OperandsAvailable
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-12-23T11:36:58Z"
    message: create-only mode enabled
    reason: CreateOnlyModeEnabled
    status: "True"
    type: CreateOnlyMode
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Operator updates the upgradeable condition to `false` in the `operatorCondition` resource. You might not be able to upgrade the Operator when in `create-only` mode.
