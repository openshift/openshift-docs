pods are spread across a network topology when {product-title} pods are deployed in multiple availability zones.

Pod topology spread constraints are suitable for controlling pod scheduling within hierarchical topologies in which nodes are spread across different infrastructure levels, such as regions and zones within those regions.
Additionally, by being able to schedule pods in different zones, you can improve network latency in certain scenarios.
