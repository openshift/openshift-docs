= Pod-to-pod communication

Pod-to-pod communication is the ability of pods to communicate with each other within the cluster. This is crucial for the functioning of microservices and distributed applications. 

Each pod in a cluster is assigned a unique IP address that they use to communicate directly with other pods. Pod-to-pod communication is useful for intra-cluster communication where pods need to exchange data or perform tasks collaboratively. For example, Pod A can send requests directly to Pod B using Pod B's IP address. Pods can communicate over a flat network without Network Address Translation (NAT). This allows for seamless communication between pods across different nodes.
