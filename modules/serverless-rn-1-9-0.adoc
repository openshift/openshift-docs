== Known issues

* After deleting the `KnativeEventing` custom resource, the `v0.15.0-upgrade-xr55x` and `storage-version-migration-eventing-99c7q` pods remain on the cluster and show a `Completed` status. You can delete the namespace where the `KnativeEventing` custom resource was installed to completely remove these pods.
