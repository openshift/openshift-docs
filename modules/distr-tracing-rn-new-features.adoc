== New features and enhancements {DTProductName} 2.5

This release of {DTProductName} addresses Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and bug fixes.

This release introduces support for ingesting OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) to the {JaegerName} Operator. The Operator now automatically enables the OTLP ports:

* Port 4317 is used for OTLP gRPC protocol.
* Port 4318 is used for OTLP HTTP protocol.

This release also adds support for collecting Kubernetes resource attributes to the {OTELName} Operator.

== New features and enhancements {DTProductName} 2.4

This release of {DTProductName} addresses Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and bug fixes.

This release also adds support for auto-provisioning certificates using the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator.

* Self-provisioning, which means using the {JaegerName} Operator to call the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator during installation. Self provisioning is fully supported with this release.
* Creating the Elasticsearch instance and certificates first and then configuring the {JaegerShortName} to use the certificate is a Technology Preview for this release.

[NOTE]
====
When upgrading to {DTProductName} 2.4, the Operator recreates the Elasticsearch instance, which might take five to ten minutes. Distributed tracing will be down and unavailable for that period.

This release marks the rebranding of Red Hat OpenShift Jaeger to {DTProductName}. This release consists of the following changes, additions, and improvements:

* Updates {JaegerName} Operator to Jaeger 1.28. Going forward, {DTProductName} will only support the `stable` Operator channel. Channels for individual releases are no longer supported.

* Introduces a new {OTELName} Operator based on OpenTelemetry 0.33. Note that this Operator is a Technology Preview feature.

* Adds support for OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) to the Query service.

* Introduces a new distributed tracing icon that appears in the OpenShift OperatorHub.

* Includes rolling updates to the documentation to support the name change and new features.

This release also addresses Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and bug fixes.
