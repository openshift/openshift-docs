= Cluster SVCAT Controller Manager Operator

[discrete]
== Purpose

The Cluster SVCAT Controller Manager Operator installs and maintains a singleton
instance of the OpenShift Service Catalog on a cluster. Service Catalog is
comprised of an aggregated API server and a controller manager; this Operator
only deals with the Controller Manager portion of Service Catalog. See the
link:https://github.com/openshift/cluster-svcat-apiserver-operator[cluster-svcat-apiserver-operator]
for the Operator responsible for the API Server component of Service Catalog.
