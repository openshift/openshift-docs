[id="updating-control-plane-only-update_{context}"]
= Performing a Control Plane Only update

The following procedure pauses all non-`master` machine config pools and performs updates from {product-title} <4.y> to <4.y+1> to <4.y+2>, then unpauses the machine config pools.
Following this procedure reduces the total update duration and the number of times worker nodes are restarted.

.Prerequisites

* Review the release notes for {product-title} <4.y+1> and <4.y+2>.
* Review the release notes and product lifecycles for any layered products and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operators. Some products and OLM Operators might require updates either before or during a Control Plane Only update.
* Ensure that you are familiar with version-specific prerequisites, such as the removal of deprecated APIs, that are required before updating from {product-title} <4.y+1> to <4.y+2>.
* If your cluster uses in-tree vSphere volumes, update vSphere to version 7.0u3L+ or 8.0u2+.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not update vSphere to 7.0u3L+ or 8.0u2+ before initiating an {product-title} update, known issues might occur with your cluster after the update.
