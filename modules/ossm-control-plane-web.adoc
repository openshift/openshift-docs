= Deploying the control plane from the web console

You can deploy a basic `ServiceMeshControlPlane` by using the web console.  In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the control plane project.

.Prerequisites

* The {ProductName} Operator must be installed.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Create a project named `istio-system`.
+
.. Navigate to *Home* -> *Projects*.
+
.. Click *Create Project*.
+
.. In the *Name* field, enter `istio-system`. The `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource must be installed in a project that is separate from your microservices and Operators.
+
These steps use `istio-system` as an example, but you can deploy your control plane in any project as long as it is separate from the project that contains your services.
+
.. Click *Create*.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the {ProductName} Operator, then click *Istio Service Mesh Control Plane*.

. On the *Istio Service Mesh Control Plane* tab, click *Create ServiceMeshControlPlane*.

. On the *Create ServiceMeshControlPlane* page, accept the default control plane version to take advantage of the features available in the most current version of the product. The version of the control plane determines the features available regardless of the version of the Operator.
+
You can configure `ServiceMeshControlPlane` settings later. For more information, see Configuring {ProductName}.
+
.. Click *Create*. The Operator creates pods, services, and {ProductShortName} control plane components based on your configuration parameters.

. To verify the control plane installed correctly, click the *Istio Service Mesh Control Plane* tab.
+
.. Click the name of the new control plane.
+
.. Click the *Resources* tab to see the {ProductName} control plane resources the Operator created and configured.
