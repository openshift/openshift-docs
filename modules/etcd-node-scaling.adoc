= Node scaling for etcd

In general, clusters must have 3 control plane nodes. However, if your cluster is installed on a bare metal platform, you can scale a cluster up to 5 nodes as a post-installation task. For example, to scale from 3 to 4 nodes after installation, you can add a host and install it as a control plane node. Then, the etcd Operator scales accordingly to account for the additional node.

Scaling to 4-node or 5-node clusters is available only on bare metal platforms.

For more information about how to scale from 3 to 4 nodes by using the Assisted Installer, see "Adding hosts with the API" and "Installing a primary control plane node on a healthy cluster".

The following table shows failure tolerance for clusters of different sizes:
