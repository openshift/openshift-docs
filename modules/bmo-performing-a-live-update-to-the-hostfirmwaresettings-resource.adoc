= Performing a live update to the HostFirmwareSettings resource

[role="_abstract"]
You can perform a live update to the `HostFirmareSettings` resource after it has begun running workloads. Live updates do not trigger deprovisioning and reprovisioning the host.

[WARNING]
====
Performing a live update to the `HostFirmareSettings` resource can be a destructive and destabilizing action. Perform these updates only after careful consideration.

Before you apply a live update in a production cluster, validate the update in a development or test cluster. Ensure that these updates comply with your organization's test policies before you apply them to a production cluster.

If a cluster has fewer than three compute nodes, use caution. Firmware updates in such clusters can result in the cluster entering a degraded state.

Do not interrupt firmware updates. If the update stops responding, engage the support of your hardware vendor.
====

.Prerequisites

* The `HostUpdatePolicy` resource must the have `firmwareSettings` parameter set to `onReboot`.

.Procedure

. Update the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch hostfirmwaresettings <hostname> --type merge -p \
    '{"spec": {"settings": {"<name>": "<value>"}}}'
----
+
where:

`<hostname>`:: Specifies the name of the host.
`<name>`:: Specifies the name of the setting.
`<value>`:: Specifies the value of the setting. You can set multiple name-value pairs.

+
[NOTE]
====
Get the `FirmwareSchema` resource to determine which settings the hardware supports and what settings and values you can update. You cannot update read-only values and you cannot update the `FirmwareSchema` resource. You can also use the `oc edit <hostname> hostfirmwaresettings -n openshift-machine-api` command to update the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource.
====

. Cordon and drain the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc drain <node_name> --force
----
+
For `<node_name>`, specify the name of the node.

. Power off the host for a period of 5 minutes by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch bmh <hostname> --type merge -p '{"spec": {"online": false}}'
----
+
This step ensures that daemonsets or controllers can mark any infrastructure pods that might be running on the host as offline, while the remaining hosts handle incoming requests.

. After 5 minutes, power on the host by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch bmh <hostname> --type merge -p '{"spec": {"online": true}}'
----
+
The servicing operation commences and the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) sets the `operationalStatus` parameter of the `BareMetalHost` to `servicing`. The BMO updates the `operationalStatus` parameter to `OK` after updating the resource. If an error occurs, the BMO updates the `operationalStatus` parameter to `error` and retries the operation.

. Once Ironic completes the update and the host powers up, uncordon the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc uncordon <node_name>
----
