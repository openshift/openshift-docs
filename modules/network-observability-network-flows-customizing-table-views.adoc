= Customizing the network traffic table

[role="_abstract"]
You can modify the flow table to isolate specific metadata or visualize traffic trends over time.

.Prerequisites
* You have `cluster-admin` permissions.
* The Network Observability Operator is installed.

.Procedure
. Navigate to *Observe* -> *Network Traffic* in the {product-title} web console.
. Click the *Network Traffic* tab.
. Click the *Manage columns* icon and select the metadata fields you want to display:
.. For SDN-managed workloads, ensure that *Infrastructure* and *Src/Dst Subnet* are selected.
.. For performance analysis, add the *RTT* and *TCP Flags* columns.
. Click *Show Graph* to display time-series graphs above the table.
. Review the bidirectional flows. The console uses a "chips" layout to group request and response pairs into a single row to clarify communication patterns.

.Verification
* Confirm the table displays the selected columns.
* Verify that the graph updates dynamically as you apply filters.
