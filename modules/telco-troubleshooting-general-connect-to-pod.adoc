= Connecting to a pod

You can directly connect to a currently running pod with the `oc rsh` command, which provides you with a shell on that pod.

[WARNING]
====
In pods that run a low-latency application, latency issues can occur when you run the `oc rsh` command.
Use the `oc rsh` command only if you cannot connect to the node by using the `oc debug` command.
