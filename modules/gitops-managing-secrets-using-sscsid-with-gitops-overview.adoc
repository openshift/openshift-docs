= Overview of managing secrets using Secrets Store CSI driver with {gitops-shortname}

Some applications need sensitive information, such as passwords and usernames which must be concealed as good security practice. If sensitive information is exposed because role-based access control (RBAC) is not configured properly on your cluster, anyone with API or etcd access can retrieve or modify a secret. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Anyone who is authorized to create a pod in a namespace can use that RBAC to read any secret in that namespace. With the SSCSI Driver Operator, you can use an external secrets store to store and provide sensitive information to pods securely.
