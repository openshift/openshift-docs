= Overview of managing secrets using Secrets Store CSI driver with {gitops-shortname}

[role="_abstract"]
Some applications need sensitive information, such as passwords and usernames which must be concealed as good security practice. If sensitive information is exposed because role-based access control (RBAC) is not configured properly on your cluster, anyone with API or etcd access can retrieve or modify a secret. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Anyone who is authorized to create a pod in a namespace can use that RBAC to read any secret in that namespace. With the SSCSI Driver Operator, you can use an external secrets store to store and provide sensitive information to pods securely.
====

[WARNING]
====
Avoid modifying the `argocd-secret` secret that {gitops-shortname} creates, using external secret management solutions such as the External Secrets Operator or Vault plugins. The `openshift-gitops-operator` manages this secret as part of its core functionality. If you modify this secret externally, it can cause reconciliation conflicts, unpredictable behavior, or disruption of Argo CD instances and {gitops-shortname} workflows. To maintain consistency and reliability, allow the {gitops-shortname} Operator to exclusively manage the `argocd-secret` secret.

== Benefits
Integrating the SSCSI driver with the {gitops-shortname} Operator provides the following benefits:

* Enhance the security and efficiency of your {gitops-shortname} workflows
* Facilitate the secure attachment of secrets into deployment pods as a volume
* Ensure that sensitive information is accessed securely and efficiently
