= {pipelines-shortname} on Single Node OpenShift (SNO)

You can run {pipelines-shortname} on a single-node cluster, making it suitable for small-scale deployments, testing, and development. All components and workloads share the same machine, simplifying setup and management.

.Minimum requirements
For a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster on `libvirt` UPI, the minimum hardware requirements are:

* 12 vCPUs
* 64 GB RAM
* 240 GB disk space

You must ensure your cluster meets these requirements before deploying {pipelines-shortname}.

.Supported components
All {pipelines-shortname} components are fully supported on SNO.

.Limitations
There are no specific limitations for {pipelines-shortname} on SNO beyond the following inherent constraints of a single-node cluster:

* Scalability: Limited by node resources, for example by CPU or memory.
* Fault Tolerance: No redundancy. If the node fails, all workloads stop.
* Concurrency: Limited parallelism due to resource constraints.
