= Scaling clusters that use Kuryr by using Octavia

:FeatureName: Kuryr
include::snippets/deprecated-feature.adoc[]

If your cluster uses Kuryr, associate the API floating IP address of your cluster with the pre-existing Octavia load balancer.

.Prerequisites

* Your {product-title} cluster uses Kuryr.

* Octavia is available on your {rh-openstack-first} deployment.

.Procedure

. Optional: From a command line, to reuse the cluster API floating IP address, unset it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack floating ip unset $API_FIP
----

. Add either the unset `API_FIP` or a new address to the created load balancer VIP:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack floating ip set --port $(openstack loadbalancer show -c <vip_port_id> -f value ${OCP_CLUSTER}-kuryr-api-loadbalancer) $API_FIP
----

Your cluster now uses Octavia for load balancing.

[NOTE]
====
If Kuryr uses the Octavia Amphora driver, all traffic is routed through a single Amphora virtual machine (VM).

You can repeat this procedure to create additional load balancers, which can alleviate the bottleneck.
