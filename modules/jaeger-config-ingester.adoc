= Jaeger Ingester configuration options

Ingester is a service that reads from a Kafka topic and writes to another storage backend (Elasticsearch).  If you are using the `allInOne` or `production` deployment strategies, you do not need to configure the Ingester service.

.Jaeger parameters passed to the Ingester
[options="header"]
[cols="l, a, a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Values
|spec:
  ingester:
    options: {}
|Configuration options that define the Ingester service.
|

|options:
  deadlockInterval:
|Specifies the interval (in seconds or minutes) that the Ingester should wait for a message before terminating.
The deadlock interval is disabled by default (set to 0), to avoid the Ingester being terminated when no messages arrive while the system is being initialized.
|Minutes and seconds, for example, `1m0s`.  Default value is `0`.

|options:
  kafka:
    consumer:
      topic:
|The `topic` parameter identifies the Kafka configuration used by the collector to produce the messages, and the ingester to consume the messages.
|Label for the consumer. For example, `jaeger-spans`.

|kafka:
  consumer:
    brokers:
|Identifies the Kafka configuration used by the Ingester to consume the messages.
|Label for the broker, for example, `my-cluster-kafka-brokers.kafka:9092`.

|ingester:
  deadlockInterval:
| Specifies the interval (in seconds or minutes) that the Ingester should wait for a message before terminating.
The deadlock interval is disabled by default (set to 0), to avoid the Ingester being terminated when no messages arrive while the system is being initialized.
|Minutes and seconds, for example, `1m0s`.  Default value is `0`.

|log-level:
|Logging level for the Ingester.
|Possible values: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `fatal`, `panic`.

|maxReplicas:
|Specifies the maximum number of replicas to create when autoscaling the Ingester.
|Integer, for example, `100`.

== Configuring Ingester for autoscaling

[NOTE]
====
Autoscaling is only supported for Jaeger 1.20 or later.
====

You can configure the Ingester to autoscale; the Ingester will scale up or down based on the CPU and/or memory consumption.  Configuring the Ingester to autoscale can help you ensure your Jaeger environment scales up during times of increased load, and scales down when less resources are needed, saving on costs. You configure autoscaling by setting the `autoscale` parameter to `true` and specifying a value for `.spec.ingester.maxReplicas` along with a reasonable value for the resources that you expect the Ingester's pod to consume. If you do not set a value for `.spec.ingester.maxReplicas` the Operator will set it to `100`.

By default, when there is no value provided for `.spec.ingester.replicas`, the Jaeger Operator creates  a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) configuration for the Ingester.  For more information about HPA, refer to the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[Kubernetes documentation].

The following is an example autoscaling configuration, setting the Ingester’s limits as well as the maximum number of replicas:
