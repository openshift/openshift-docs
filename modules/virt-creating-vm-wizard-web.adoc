= Running the virtual machine wizard to create a virtual machine

The web console features an interactive wizard that guides you through *General*, *Networking*, *Storage*, *Advanced*, and *Review* steps to simplify the process of creating virtual machines. All required fields are marked by a `*`. When the required fields are completed, you can review and create your virtual machine.

Network interface cards (NICs) and storage disks can be created and attached to virtual machines after they have been created.

.*Bootable Disk*

If either `URL` or `Container` are selected as the *Source* in the *General* step, a `rootdisk` disk is created and attached to the virtual machine as the *Bootable Disk*. You can modify the `rootdisk` but you cannot remove it.

A *Bootable Disk* is not required for virtual machines provisioned from a *PXE* source if there are no disks attached to the virtual machine. If one or more disks are attached to the virtual machine, you must select one as the *Bootable Disk*.

.Prerequisites

* When you create your virtual machine using the wizard, your virtual machine's storage medium must support Read-Write-Many (RWX) PVCs.

.Procedure

. Click *Workloads* -> *Virtualization* from the side menu.
. Click the *Virtual Machines* tab.
. Click *Create Virtual Machine* and select *New with Wizard*.
. Fill in all required fields in the *General* step. Selecting a *Template* automatically fills in these fields.
. Click *Next* to progress to the *Networking* step. A `nic0` NIC is attached by default.
.. Optional: Click *Add Network Interface* to create additional NICs.
.. Optional: You can remove any or all NICs by clicking the Options menu {kebab} and selecting *Delete*. A virtual machine does not need a NIC attached to be created. NICs can be created after the virtual machine has been created.
. Click *Next* to progress to the *Storage* screen.
.. Optional: Click *Add Disk* to create additional disks. These disks can be removed by clicking the Options menu {kebab} and selecting *Delete*.
.. Optional: Click the Options menu {kebab} to edit the disk and save your changes.
. Click *Review and Create*. The *Results* screen displays the JSON configuration file for the virtual machine.

The virtual machine is listed in the *Virtual Machines* tab.
