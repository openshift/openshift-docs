= Running the virtual machine wizard to create a virtual machine

The web console features a wizard that guides you through the process of selecting a virtual machine template and creating a virtual machine. Red Hat virtual machine templates are preconfigured with an operating system image, default settings for the operating system, flavor (CPU and memory), and workload type (server). When templates are configured with a boot source, they are labeled with a customized label text or the default label text *Available boot source*. These templates are then ready to be used for creating virtual machines.

You can select a template from the list of preconfigured templates, review the settings, and create a virtual machine in the *Create virtual machine from template* wizard. If you choose to customize your virtual machine, the wizard guides you through the *General*, *Networking*, *Storage*, *Advanced*, and *Review* steps. All required fields displayed by the wizard are marked by a ++*++.

Create network interface controllers (NICs) and storage disks later and attach them to virtual machines.

.Procedure

. Click *Workloads* -> *Virtualization* from the side menu.

. From the *Virtual Machines* tab or the *Templates* tab, click *Create* and select *Virtual Machine with Wizard*.

. Select a template that is configured with a boot source.

. Click *Next* to go to the *Review and create* step.

. Clear the *Start this virtual machine after creation* checkbox if you do not want to start the virtual machine now.

. Click *Create virtual machine* and exit the wizard or continue with the wizard to customize the virtual machine.

.  Click *Customize virtual machine* to go to the *General* step.

.. Optional: Edit the *Name* field to specify a custom name for the virtual machine.

.. Optional: In the *Description* field, add a description.

. Click *Next* to go to the *Networking* step. A `nic0` NIC is attached by default.

.. Optional: Click *Add Network Interface* to create additional NICs.

.. Optional: You can remove any or all NICs by clicking the Options menu {kebab} and selecting *Delete*. A virtual machine does not need a NIC attached to be created. You can create NICs after the virtual machine has been created.

. Click *Next* to go to the *Storage* step.

.. Optional: Click *Add Disk* to create additional disks. These disks can be removed by clicking the Options menu {kebab} and selecting *Delete*.

.. Optional: Click the Options menu {kebab} to edit the disk and save your changes.

. Click *Next* to go to the *Advanced* step and choose one of the following options:

.. If you selected a Linux template to create the VM, review the details for *Cloud-init* and configure SSH access.

[NOTE]
====
Statically inject an SSH key by using the custom script in cloud-init or in the wizard. This allows you to securely and remotely manage virtual machines and manage and transfer information. This step is strongly recommended to secure your VM.Â 
====

.. If you selected a Windows template to create the VM, use the *SysPrep* section to upload answer files in XML format for automated Windows setup.

. Click *Next* to go to the *Review* step and review the settings for the virtual machine.

. Click *Create Virtual Machine*.

. Click *See virtual machine details* to view the *Overview* for this virtual machine.
+
The virtual machine is listed in the *Virtual Machines* tab.
