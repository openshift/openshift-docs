= Adding cluster ID labels to metrics

If you manage multiple {product-title} clusters and use the remote write feature to send metrics data from these clusters to an external storage location, you can add cluster ID labels to identify the metrics data coming from different clusters. You can then query these labels to identify the source cluster for a metric and distinguish that data from similar metrics data sent by other clusters.

This way, if you manage many clusters for multiple customers and send metrics data to a single centralized storage system, you can use cluster ID labels to query metrics for a particular cluster or customer.

Creating and using cluster ID labels involves three general steps:

* Configuring the write relabel settings for remote write storage.

* Adding cluster ID labels to the metrics.

* Querying these labels to identify the source cluster or customer for a metric.
