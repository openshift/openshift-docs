= Installing the OpenStack Manila CSI driver

The OpenStack Manila Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver is a custom resource (CR) that enables you to create and mount OpenStack Manila shares. It also supports creating snapshots, and recovering shares from snapshots.

The driver is not installed in {product-title} by default, and must be installed after the Manila CSI Driver Operator has been installed.

.Prerequisites

* The Manila CSI Driver Operator has been installed.
* Access to the {product-title} web console or command-line interface (CLI).

.UI procedure

To install the Manila CSI driver from the web console, complete the following steps:

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Locate the *Manila CSI Driver Operator* from the list and click on the Operator link.

. Create the driver:
.. From the *Details* tab, click *Create Instance*.

.. Optional: Select *YAML view* to make modifications, such as adding notations, to the ManilaDriver object template.

.. Click *Create* to finalize.

.CLI procedure

To install the Manila CSI driver from the CLI, complete the following steps:

. Create an object YAML file, such as `maniladriver.yaml`, to define the ManilaDriver:
+
.Example maniladriver
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: csi.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: ManilaDriver
  metadata:
    name: cluster <1>
----
<1> Renaming the cluster and specifying a certain namespace are not supported functions.

. Create the ManilaDriver CR object in your {product-title} cluster by specifying the file you created in the previous step:
+
----
$ oc create -f maniladriver.yaml
----

When the Operator installation is finished, the Manila CSI driver is deployed on {product-title} for dynamic provisioning of RWX persistent volumes on {rh-openstack-first}.

.Verification
. Verify that the ManilaDriver CR was created successfully by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get all -n openshift-manila-csi-driver
----
