= Options for additional ports for node pools

You can use the `--openstack-node-additional-port` flag to attach additional ports to nodes in a hosted cluster on OpenStack. The flag takes a list of comma-separated parameters. Parameters can be used multiple times to attach multiple additional ports to the nodes.

The parameters are:
