= Changes in {VirtProductName} behavior on a single node cluster

You can use {VirtProductName} with single node clusters, also known as Single Node OpenShift (SNO). These clusters are not configured for high-availability operation, which results in significant changes to {VirtProductName} behavior.

* {VirtProductName} components have only one replica, and pod disruption budgets do not apply.
* Live migration is not supported.
* Due to differences in storage behavior, some virtual machine templates are incompatible with SNO. To ensure compatibility, do not set the `evictionStrategy` field for any templates or virtual machines that use data volumes or storage profiles.
