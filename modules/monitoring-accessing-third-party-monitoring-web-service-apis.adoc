= Accessing third-party monitoring web service APIs

[role="_abstract"]
You can directly access third-party web service APIs from the command line for the following monitoring stack components: Prometheus, Alertmanager, Thanos Ruler, and Thanos Querier. 

The following example commands show how to query the service API receivers for Alertmanager.
This example requires that the associated user account be bound against the `monitoring-alertmanager-edit` role in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace and that the account has the privilege to view the route.
This access only supports using a Bearer Token for authentication.

----
$ oc login -u <username> -p <password>

[source,terminal]
----
$ host=$(oc -n openshift-monitoring get route alertmanager-main -ojsonpath={.spec.host})
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ token=$(oc whoami -t)
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -k "https://$host/api/v2/receivers"

[NOTE]
====
To access Thanos Ruler and Thanos Querier service APIs, the requesting account must have `get` permission on the namespaces resource, which can be done by granting the `cluster-monitoring-view` cluster role to the account.
