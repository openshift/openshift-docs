= NodeAgent CPU for large usage

Increasing `NodeAgent` CPU shows a significant impact on improving backup and restore times.


It is not recommended to use Kopia without limits in production environments on nodes running production workloads due to Kopiaâ€™s aggressive consumption of resources.

However running Kopia with limits that are too low results in CPU limiting and slow-performing backups and restore situations.

The testing undertaken, observed that running with around 20 cores limit, and 32 Gi memory limit covered most of our largest cases effectively.

Testing detected no CPU limiting or memory saturation with these resource specifications.
