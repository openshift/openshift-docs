= NodeAgent CPU for large usage

Testing shows that increasing `NodeAgent` CPU can significantly improve backup and restore times when using {oadp-first}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not recommended to use Kopia without limits in production environments on nodes running production workloads due to Kopiaâ€™s aggressive consumption of resources. However, running Kopia with limits that are too low results in CPU limiting and slow backups and restore situations. Testing showed that running Kopia with 20 cores and 32 Gi memory supported backup and restore operations of over 100 GB of data, multiple namespaces, or over 2000 pods in a single namespace.
====

Testing detected no CPU limiting or memory saturation with these resource specifications.

You can set these limits in Ceph MDS pods by following the procedure in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.14/html/troubleshooting_openshift_data_foundation/changing-resources-for-the-openshift-data-foundation-components_rhodf#changing_the_cpu_and_memory_resources_on_the_rook_ceph_pods[Changing the CPU and memory resources on the rook-ceph pods].

You need to add the following lines to the storage cluster Custom Resource (CR) to set the limits:

[source,yaml]
