= Backup and restore for large usage

Such as `500/1500/3000 GB` PV usage, multiple namespaces, or many pods within a single namespace (2000 pods+):

Customers seeking optimal performance for backup and restore actions involving large datasets should make the following adjustments to the DPA:

. `Velero`

.. CPU request changed to 200m, max limit to 2

... Mem request changed to 256Mi, max limit to 2048Mi

. `NodeAgent`

.. CPU request changed to 2, max limit to 20

... Mem request changed to 16Gi , max limit to 32Gi

+
Increasing `NodeAgent` CPU shows a significant impact on improving backup and restore times.


It is not recommended to use Kopia without limits in production environments on nodes running production workloads due to Kopiaâ€™s aggressive consumption of resources.

However running Kopia with limits that are too low results in CPU limiting and slow-performing backups and restore situations.

The testing undertaken, observed that running with around 20 cores limit, and 32 Gi memory limit covered most of our largest cases effectively.

Testing detected no CPU limiting or memory saturation with these resource specifications.
