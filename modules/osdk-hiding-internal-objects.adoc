= Hiding internal objects

It is common practice for Operators to use Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
internally to accomplish a task. These objects are not meant for users to
manipulate and can be confusing to users of the Operator. For example, a
database Operator might have a Replication CRD that is created whenever a user
creates a Database object with `replication: true`.

If any CRDs are not meant for manipulation by users, they can be hidden in the
user interface using the `operators.operatorframework.io/internal-objects`
annotation in the Operator's ClusterServiceVersion (CSV):

.Internal object annotation
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterServiceVersion
metadata:
  name: my-operator-v1.2.3
  annotations:
    operators.operatorframework.io/internal-objects: '["my.internal.crd1.io","my.internal.crd2.io"]' <1>
...
----
<1> Set any internal CRDs as an array of strings.

Before marking one of your CRDs as internal, make sure that any debugging
information or configuration that might be required to manage the application is
reflected on the CR's status or `spec` block, if applicable to your Operator.
