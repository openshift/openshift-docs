= Hiding internal objects

It is common practice for Operators to use custom resource definitions (CRDs)
internally to accomplish a task. These objects are not meant for users to
manipulate and can be confusing to users of the Operator. For example, a
database Operator might have a Replication CRD that is created whenever a user
creates a Database object with `replication: true`.

As an Operator author, you can hide any CRDs in the user interface that are not
meant for user manipulation by adding the
`operators.operatorframework.io/internal-objects` annotation to the
ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) of your Operator.

.Procedure

. Before marking one of your CRDs as internal, ensure that any debugging
information or configuration that might be required to manage the application is
reflected on the status or `spec` block of your CR, if applicable to your
Operator.

. Add the `operators.operatorframework.io/internal-objects` annotation to the CSV
of your Operator to specify any internal objects to hide in the user interface:
