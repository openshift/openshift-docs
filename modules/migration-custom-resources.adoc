= Understanding the migration custom resources

The CAM tool creates the following custom resources (CRs) for migration:

image:darkcircle-3.png[20,20] link:https://github.com/fusor/mig-controller/blob/master/pkg/apis/migration/v1alpha1/migplan_types.go[MigPlan] (configuration, CAM cluster): Migration plan

The MigPlan CR describes the source and target clusters, repository, and namespace(s) being migrated. It is associated with 0, 1, or many MigMigration CRs.

[NOTE]
====
Deleting a MigPlan CR deletes the associated MigMigration CRs.

A MigMigration CR is created every time you stage or migrate data. Each MigMigration CR is associated with a MigPlan CR.

image:darkcircle-7.png[20,20] link:https://github.com/heptio/velero/blob/master/pkg/apis/velero/v1/backup.go[Backup] (action, source cluster): When you run a migration plan, the MigMigration CR creates two Velero backup CRs on each source cluster:

* Backup CR #1 for Kubernetes objects
* Backup CR #2 for PV data

image:darkcircle-8.png[20,20] link:https://github.com/heptio/velero/blob/master/pkg/apis/velero/v1/restore.go[Restore] (action, target cluster): When you run a migration plan, the MigMigration CR creates two Velero restore CRs on the target cluster:

* Restore CR #1 (using Backup CR #2) for PV data
* Restore CR #2 (using Backup CR #1) for Kubernetes objects
