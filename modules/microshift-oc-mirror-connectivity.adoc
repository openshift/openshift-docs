= Connectivity considerations when populating a mirror registry

When you populate your registry, you can use one of following connectivity scenarios:

Connected mirroring::
If you have a host that can access both the internet and your mirror registry, but not your cluster node, you can directly mirror the content from that machine.

Disconnected mirroring::
If you do not have a host that can access both the internet and your mirror registry, you must mirror the images to a file system and then bring that host or removable media into your disconnected environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A container registry must be reachable by every machine in the cluster that you provision. Installing, updating, and other operations, such as relocating workloads, fail if the registry is unreachable.
====

To avoid problems caused by an unreachable registry, use the following standard practices:

* Run mirror registries in a highly available way.
* Ensure that the mirror registry at least matches the production availability of your clusters.
