== {ProductName} 2.0.0 Technology Preview

This release includes the addition of the distributed tracing data collection, which you install using the OpenTelemetry Operator.

{ProductName} data collection is based on the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. The Collector can be used to receive traces in either the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to the OpenShift distributed tracing platform. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time.

The OpenTelemetry collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
