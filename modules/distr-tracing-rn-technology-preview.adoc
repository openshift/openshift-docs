== {DTProductName} 2.0.0 Technology Preview

This release includes the addition of the {OPELName}, which you install using the {OTELName} Operator.  {OTELName}  is based on the  link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] APIs and instrumentation.

{OTELName} includes the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. The Collector can be used to receive traces in either the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to {DTProductName}. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time.

The OpenTelemetry Collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
