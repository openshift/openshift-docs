Provide the following info for each issue if possible:
Description - Describe the new functionality available to the customer. For enhancements, try to describe as specifically as possible where the customer will see changes. Avoid the word “supports” as in [product] now supports [feature] to avoid customer confusion with full support. Say, for example, “available as a Technology Preview.”
Package - A brief description of what the customer has to install or enable to use the Technology Preview feature. (e.g., available in quickstart.zip on customer portal, JDF website, container on registry, enable option, etc.)

[IMPORTANT]
====
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.

== {DTProductName} 2.4.0 Technology Preview

This release also adds support for auto-provisioning certificates using the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator.

* Self-provisioning, which means using the {JaegerName} Operator to call the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator during installation. Self provisioning is fully supported with this release.
* Creating the Elasticsearch instance and certificates first and then configuring the {JaegerShortName} to use the certificate is a Technology Preview for this release.

== {DTProductName} 2.2.0 Technology Preview

Unsupported OpenTelemetry Collector components included in the 2.1 release have been removed.

== {DTProductName} 2.1.0 Technology Preview

This release introduces a breaking change to how to configure certificates in the OpenTelemetry custom resource file. In the new version, the `ca_file` moves under `tls` in the custom resource, as shown in the following examples.

.CA file configuration for OpenTelemetry version 0.33

== {DTProductName} 2.0.0 Technology Preview

This release includes the addition of the {OTELName}, which you install using the {OTELName} Operator. {OTELName} is based on the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] APIs and instrumentation.

{OTELName} includes the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. The Collector can be used to receive traces in either the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to {DTProductName}. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time.

The OpenTelemetry Collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
