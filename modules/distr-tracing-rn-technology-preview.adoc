Provide the following info for each issue if possible:
Description - Describe the new functionality available to the customer. For enhancements, try to describe as specifically as possible where the customer will see changes. Avoid the word “supports” as in [product] now supports [feature] to avoid customer confusion with full support. Say, for example, “available as a Technology Preview.”

== {DTProductName} 2.0.0 Technology Preview

This release includes the addition of the {OTELName}, which you install using the {OTELName} Operator. {OTELName} is based on the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] APIs and instrumentation.

{OTELName} includes the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. The Collector can be used to receive traces in either the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to {DTProductName}. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time.

The OpenTelemetry Collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
