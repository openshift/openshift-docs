Provide the following info for each issue if possible:
Description - Describe the new functionality available to the customer. For enhancements, try to describe as specifically as possible where the customer will see changes. Avoid the word “supports” as in [product] now supports [feature] to avoid customer confusion with full support. Say, for example, “available as a Technology Preview.”
Package - A brief description of what the customer has to install or enable to use the Technology Preview feature. (e.g., available in quickstart.zip on customer portal, JDF website, container on registry, enable option, etc.)

[IMPORTANT]
====
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

== {DTProductName} 2.8.0 Technology Preview

This release introduces support for {TempoName} as a Technology Preview feature for {DTProductName}.
The feature uses version 0.1.0 of {TempoName} and version 2.0.1 of the upstream {TempoShortName} components.

You can use {TempoName} to replace Jaeger so that you can use S3-compatible storage instead of ElasticSearch.
Most users who use {TempoName} instead of Jaeger will not notice any difference in functionality because {TempoShortName} supports the same ingestion and query protocols as Jaeger and uses the same user interface.

If you enable this Technology Preview feature, note the following limitations of the current implementation:

* {TempoName} currently does not support disconnected installations. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3145[TRACING-3145])

* When you use the Jaeger user interface (UI) with {TempoName}, the Jaeger UI lists only services that have sent traces within the last 15 minutes.
For services that have not sent traces within the last 15 minutes, those traces are still stored even though they are not visible in the Jaeger UI. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3139[TRACING-3139])

Expanded support for the Tempo Operator is planned for future releases of {DTProductName}.
Possible additional features might include support for TLS authentication, multitenancy, and multiple clusters.
For more information about the Tempo Operator, see link:https://tempo-operator.netlify.app[the Tempo community documentation].

== {DTProductName} 2.4.0 Technology Preview

This release also adds support for auto-provisioning certificates using the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator.

* Self-provisioning, which means using the {JaegerName} Operator to call the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator during installation. Self provisioning is fully supported with this release.
* Creating the Elasticsearch instance and certificates first and then configuring the {JaegerShortName} to use the certificate is a Technology Preview for this release.

== {DTProductName} 2.2.0 Technology Preview

Unsupported OpenTelemetry Collector components included in the 2.1 release have been removed.

== {DTProductName} 2.1.0 Technology Preview

This release introduces a breaking change to how to configure certificates in the OpenTelemetry custom resource file. In the new version, the `ca_file` moves under `tls` in the custom resource, as shown in the following examples.

.CA file configuration for OpenTelemetry version 0.33

== {DTProductName} 2.0.0 Technology Preview

This release includes the addition of the {OTELName}, which you install using the {OTELName} Operator. {OTELName} is based on the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] APIs and instrumentation.

{OTELName} includes the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. The Collector can be used to receive traces in either the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to {DTProductName}. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time.

The OpenTelemetry Collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
