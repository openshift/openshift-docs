[id="virt-attaching-vm-to-secondary-udn_{context}"]                                  
= Attaching a virtual machine to secondary user-defined networks by using the CLI

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to multiple secondary cluster-scoped user-defined networks (CUDNs) by configuring the interface binding.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure
. Edit the `VirtualMachine` manifest to add the CUDN interface details, as in the following example:
+
.Example `VirtualMachine` manifest
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: example-vm
  namespace: my-namespace # <1>
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          interfaces:
            - name: secondary_localnet # <2>
              bridge: {}
        machine:
          type: ""
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 2048M               
      networks:
      - name: secondary_localnet # <3>
        multus:
          networkName: <localnet_cudn_name> # <4>
# ...
----
<1> The namespace in which the VM is located. This value must match a namespace that is associated with the secondary CUDN.
<2> The name of the secondary user-defined network interface.
<3> The name of the network. This must match the value of the `spec.template.spec.domain.devices.interfaces.name` field.
<4> The name of the localnet `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` object that you previously created.

. Apply the `VirtualMachine` manifest by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml

+
where:

<filename>:: Specifies the name of your `VirtualMachine` manifest YAML file.
