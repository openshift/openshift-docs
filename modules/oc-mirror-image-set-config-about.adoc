= About the Image Set Configuration

An `ImageSetConfiguration` (ISC) file is a collection of container images for mirroring. The ISC specifies the images, their versions, and any additional configuration needed for mirroring. ISCs provide a structured way to manage image mirroring tasks. They also allow users to define, organize, and execute mirroring operations within their {product-title} environment.

To create the `ImageSetConfiguration` file for a specific release, use one of these following methods:

* Set `minVersion` at the channel level to your target deployment version.
* Set `minVersion` to the latest version in the default channel and keep it unchanged.
* Set the `maxVersion` to limit versions being mirrored.
* Use the same version for both `minVersion` and `maxVersion` to mirror only one version.

When you run the `oc-mirror` plugin v1 with the `ImageSetConfiguration` file, it evaluates the latest release of the `stable-<latest_version>` channel.

When using local storage and including all {product-title} versions with the shortest update path, use the following methods:

* Set `maxVersion` to a valid version that exists in the channel you are setting it on, or include a different channel that has this version.
* If `minVersion` and `maxVersion` are not the same, the default behavior is to mirror the shortest valid upgrade path between them.
