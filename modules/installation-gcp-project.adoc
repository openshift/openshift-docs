[IMPORTANT]
====
Your GCP project must use the Premium Network Service Tier if you are using installer-provisioned infrastructure. The Standard Network Service Tier is not supported for clusters installed using the installation program. The installation program configures internal load balancing for the `api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` URL; the Premium Tier is required for internal load balancing.
