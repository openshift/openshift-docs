= Identifying Dockerfile lines in images that introduced components with CVEs

[role="_abstract"]
You can identify specific Dockerfile lines in an image that introduced components with CVEs. 

.Procedure

To view a problematic line:

. Navigate to the {product-title-short} portal and click *Vulnerability Management* from the navigation menu.
. Select an image from either the *Top Riskiest Images* widget or click the *Images* button at the top of the Dashboard and select an image.
. In the *Image* details view, under *Image Findings*, CVEs are listed in the *Observed CVEs*, *Deferred CVEs*, and *False positive CVEs* tabs.
. Locate the CVE you want to examine further. In the *Affected Components* column, click on the *<number> Components* link to view a list of components affected by the CVE. You can perform the following actions in this window:
* Select the expand icon next to a specific component to view the Dockerfile line in the image that introduced the CVE. To address the CVE, you need to change this line in the Dockerfile; for example, you can upgrade the component. 
* Click the name of the component to go to the *Component Summary* page and view more information about the component.
