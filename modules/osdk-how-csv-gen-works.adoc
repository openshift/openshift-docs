= How CSV generation works

An Operator project's `deploy/` directory is the standard location for all
manifests required to deploy an Operator. The Operator SDK can use data from
manifests in `deploy/` to write a CSV. The following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk generate csv --csv-version <version>
----

writes a CSV YAML file to the `deploy/olm-catalog/` directory by default.

Exactly three types of manifests are required to generate a CSV:

- `operator.yaml`
- `*_{crd,cr}.yaml`
- RBAC role files, for example `role.yaml`

Operator authors may have different versioning requirements for these files and
can configure which specific files are included in the
`deploy/olm-catalog/csv-config.yaml` file.

== Workflow

Depending on whether an existing CSV is detected, and assuming all configuration
defaults are used, the `generate csv` subcommand either:

- Creates a new CSV, with the same location and naming convention as exists
currently, using available data in YAML manifests and source files.

.. The update mechanism checks for an existing CSV in `deploy/`. When one is not
found, it creates a ClusterServiceVersion object, referred to here as a _cache_,
and populates fields easily derived from Operator metadata, such as Kubernetes
API `ObjectMeta`.

.. The update mechanism searches `deploy/` for manifests that contain data a CSV
uses, such as a Deployment resource, and sets the appropriate CSV fields in the
cache with this data.

.. After the search completes, every cache field populated is written back to a
CSV YAML file.

or:

- Updates an existing CSV at the currently pre-defined location, using available
data in YAML manifests and source files.

.. The update mechanism checks for an existing CSV in `deploy/`. When one is
found, the CSV YAML file contents are marshaled into a ClusterServiceVersion
cache.

.. The update mechanism searches `deploy/` for manifests that contain data a CSV
uses, such as a Deployment resource, and sets the appropriate CSV fields in the
cache with this data.

.. After the search completes, every cache field populated is written back to a
CSV YAML file.

[NOTE]
====
Individual YAML fields are overwritten and not the entire file, as descriptions
and other non-generated parts of a CSV should be preserved.
