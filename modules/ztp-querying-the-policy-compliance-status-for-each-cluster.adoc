= Querying the policy compliance status for each cluster

After you have created the validator inform policies for your clusters and pushed them to the
the zero touch provisioning (ZTP) Git repository, you can check the status of each cluster for policy compliance.

.Procedure

. To query the status of the spoke clusters, use either the {rh-rhacm-first} web console or the CLI:
+
* To query status from the {rh-rhacm} web console, perform the following actions:
+
.. Click *Governance* -> *Find policies*.
.. Search for *du-validator-policy*.
.. Click into the policy.

* To query status using the CLI, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies du-validator-policy -n <namespace_for_common> -o jsonpath={'.status.status'} | jq
----
+
When all of the policies including the validator inform policy applied to
the cluster become compliant, ZTP installation and configuration for this cluster is complete.

. To query the cluster violation/compliant status from the ACM web console, click
*Governance* -> *Cluster violations*.

. Check the validator policy compliant status for a cluster using the following commands:
+
--
.. Export the cluster name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTER=<cluster_name>
----

.. Get the policy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies -n $CLUSTER | grep <validator_policy_name>
----
--
+
Alternatively, you can use the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies -n <namespace-for-group> <validatorPolicyName> -o jsonpath="{.status.status[?(@.clustername=='$CLUSTER')]}" | jq
----
+
After the `*-validator-du-policy` {rh-rhacm} policy becomes compliant for the cluster, the
validator policy is unbound for this cluster and the `ztp-done` label is added to the cluster.
This acts as a persistent indicator that the whole ZTP pipeline has completed for the cluster.
