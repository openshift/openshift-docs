= Using SR-IOV and the Node Tuning Operator to achieve a DPDK line rate
You can use the Node Tuning Operator to configure isolated CPUs, hugepages, and a topology scheduler.
You can then use the Node Tuning Operator with Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) to achieve a specific Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) line rate.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have installed the SR-IOV Network Operator.
* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have deployed a standalone Node Tuning Operator.

[NOTE]
====
In previous versions of {product-title}, the Performance Addon Operator was used to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for OpenShift applications. In {product-title} 4.11 and later, this functionality is part of the Node Tuning Operator.
====

.Procedure
. Create a `PerformanceProfile` object based on the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
  name: performance
spec:
  globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing: true
  cpu:
    isolated: 21-51,73-103 <1>
    reserved: 0-20,52-72 <2>
  hugepages:
    defaultHugepagesSize: 1G <3>
    pages:
      - count: 32
        size: 1G
  net:
    userLevelNetworking: true
  numa:
    topologyPolicy: "single-numa-node"
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-cnf: ""
----
<1> If hyperthreading is enabled on the system, allocate the relevant symbolic links to the `isolated` and `reserved` CPU groups. If the system contains multiple non-uniform memory access nodes (NUMAs), allocate CPUs from both NUMAs to both groups. You can also use the Performance Profile Creator for this task. For more information, see _Creating a performance profile_.
<2> You can also specify a list of devices that will have their queues set to the reserved CPU count. For more information, see _Reducing NIC queues using the Node Tuning Operator_.
<3> Allocate the number and size of hugepages needed. You can specify the NUMA configuration for the hugepages. By default, the system allocates an even number to every NUMA node on the system. If needed, you can request the use of a realtime kernel for the nodes. See _Provisioning a worker with real-time capabilities_ for more information.
. Save the `yaml` file as `mlx-dpdk-perfprofile-policy.yaml`.
. Apply the performance profile using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f mlx-dpdk-perfprofile-policy.yaml
