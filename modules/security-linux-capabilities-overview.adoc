= Linux capabilities

Linux capabilities define the actions a process can perform on the host system. By default, pods are granted several capabilities unless security measures are applied. These default capabilities are as follows:

* `CHOWN`
* `DAC_OVERRIDE`
* `FSETID`
* `FOWNER`
* `SETGID`
* `SETUID`
* `SETPCAP`
* `NET_BIND_SERVICE`
* `KILL`

You can modify which capabilities that a pod can receive by configuring Security Context Constraints (SCCs).

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must not assign the following capabilities to a pod:

* `SYS_ADMIN`: A powerful capability that grants elevated privileges. Allowing this capability can break security boundaries and pose a significant security risk.
* `NET_ADMIN`: Allows control over networking, like SR-IOV ports, but can be replaced with alternative solutions in modern setups.

For more information about Linux capabilities, see the link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html[Linux capabilities] man page.
