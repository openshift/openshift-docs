The following bugs are fixed with this release:

* Before this update, if NetworkManager was restarted or crashed on a node with a `br-ex` interface managed by NMState, the node lost network connectivity. With this release, a fallback check in the dispatcher script was added to detect NMState-managed `br-ex` interfaces by checking for the `br-ex-br` bridge ID when the standard `br-ex` bridge ID is not found. As a result, nodes with this interface type do not lose network connectivity when NetworkManager restarts or crashes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-62168[OCPBUGS-62168])

* Before this update, during the mirror operation, `oc-mirror` inadvertently set the executable program flag on some synchronized files that did not contain executable program code or scripts, potentially causing unexpected execution. With this release, unintended executable program flags have been removed from the synchronized files. As a result, correct file permissions are set, preventing unintended execution of synchronized files. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-64683[OCPBUGS-64683])

* Before this update, when directly navigating to a page created by a web console dynamic plugin, the web console might redirect to a different URL. With this release, the URL redirect has been removed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-64834[OCPBUGS-64834])

* Before this update, the `ccoctl` utility did not support pagination when retrieving `CloudFront` distributions. As a result, if the distribution to be deleted was not included in the first batch of results, the `CloudFront` distribution and its associated origin access identity could not be deleted successfully during the `ccoctl` {aws-first} delete operation. With this release, pagination support is added to the `ccoctl` utility when fetching `CloudFront` distributions, ensuring that the distribution can be located and deleted properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65478[OCPBUGS-65478])

* Before this update, a race condition in the Redfish Power interface caused power operations to fail during simultaneous access. As a consequence, users were unable to manage power states reliably. With this release, the race condition in the Redfish Power interface has been resolved, ensuring successful power operations. As a result, users can now manage power states reliably. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65572[OCPBUGS-65572])

* Before this update, it was impossible to schedule a `must-gather` pod to a specific worker node when the `--node-name` argument was used as the pod's node affinity accepted only control plane nodes. With this release, the `must-gather` logic is updated to avoid setting node affinity when the `--node-name` argument is set. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65594[OCPBUGS-65594])
