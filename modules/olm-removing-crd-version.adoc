= Deprecating or removing a CRD version

OLM does not allow a serving version of a CRD to be removed right away. Instead,
a deprecated version of the CRD must be first disabled by setting the `served`
field in the CRD to `false`. Then, the non-serving version can be removed on the
subsequent CRD upgrade.

.Procedure

To deprecate and remove a specific version of a CRD:

. Mark the deprecated version as non-serving to indicate this version is no longer
in use and may be removed in a subsequent upgrade. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    served: false <1>
    storage: true
----
<1> Set to `false`.

. Switch the `storage` version to a serving version if the version to be
deprecated is currently the `storage` version. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    served: false
    storage: false <1>
  - name: v1beta1
    served: true
    storage: true <1>
----
<1> Update the `storage` fields accordingly.
+
[NOTE]
====
In order to remove a specific version that is or was the `storage` version from
a CRD, that version must be removed from the `storedVersion` in the CRD's
status. OLM will attempt to do this for you if it detects a stored version no
longer exists in the new CRD.
====

. Upgrade the CRD with the above changes.

. In subsequent upgrade cycles, the non-serving version can be removed completely
from the CRD. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
versions:
  - name: v1beta1
    served: true
    storage: true
----

. Ensure the referencing version of the CRD in your CSVâ€™s `owned` section is
updated accordingly if that version is removed from the CRD.
