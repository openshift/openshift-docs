= Catalog Operator

The Catalog Operator is responsible for resolving and installing CSVs and the
required resources they specify. It is also responsible for watching
CatalogSources for updates to packages in channels and upgrading them,
automatically if desired, to the latest available versions.

To track a package in a channel, you can create a Subscription resource
configuring the desired package, channel, and the CatalogSource you want to pull
updates from. When updates are found, an appropriate InstallPlan is written into
the namespace on behalf of the user.

The Catalog Operator uses the following workflow:

. Connect to each CatalogSource in the cluster.
. Watch for unresolved InstallPlans created by a user, and if found:
.. Find the CSV matching the name requested and add the CSV as a resolved resource.
.. For each managed or required CRD, add the CRD as a resolved resource.
.. For each required CRD, find the CSV that manages it.
. Watch for resolved InstallPlans and create all of the discovered resources for it, if approved by a user or automatically.
. Watch for CatalogSources and Subscriptions and create InstallPlans based on them.
