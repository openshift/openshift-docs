= Catalog Operator

[role="_abstract"]
The Catalog Operator resolves, installs, and updates cluster service versions (CSVs) from catalog sources. To configure subscriptions and control update approvals effectively, you must understand the Operator workflow.

To track a package in a channel, create a `Subscription` object. Specify the package, channel, and `CatalogSource` object you want. When the Catalog Operator finds updates, it creates an `InstallPlan` object in your namespace.

The Catalog Operator uses the following workflow:

. Connects to each catalog source in the cluster.
. Watches for unresolved install plans created by a user. If the Catalog Operator finds an unresolved install plan, it performs the following actions:
.. Finds the CSV that matches the requested name and adds the CSV as a resolved resource.
.. Adds each Custom Resource Definition (CRD) that is managed or required by the CSV as a resolved resource.
.. Finds the CSV that manages each required CRD.
. Watches for resolved install plans. If a user or automatic process approves the plan, the Operator creates all discovered resources for that plan.
. Watches for catalog sources and subscriptions and creates install plans based on them.
