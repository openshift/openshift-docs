|Name |Parameter |Description

ifdef::vmtemplate[]
|Template
|
|Template from which to create the virtual machine. Selecting a template will automatically complete other fields.
endif::[]

|Name
|
|The name can contain lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), and hyphens (`-`), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, periods (`.`), or special characters.

ifdef::vmtemplate[]
|Template provider
|
|The name of the user who is creating the template for the cluster or any meaningful name that identifies this template.
endif::[]

ifdef::vmtemplate[]
.2+|Template support
|No additional support
|This template does not have additional support in the cluster.

|Support by template provider
|This template is supported by the template provider.
endif::[]

|Description
|
|Optional description field.

|Operating System
|
ifdef::virtualmachine[]
|The operating system that is selected for the virtual machine in the template. You cannot edit this field when creating a virtual machine from a template.
endif::[]
ifdef::vmtemplate[]
|The operating system that is selected for the virtual machine. Selecting an operating system automatically selects the default *Flavor* and *Workload Type* for that operating system.
endif::[]

.4+|Boot Source
|Import via URL (creates PVC)
|Import content from an image available from an *HTTP* or *S3* endpoint. Example: Obtaining a URL link from the web page with the operating system image.

|Clone existing PVC (creates PVC)
|Select an existent persistent volume claim available on the cluster and clone it.

|Import via Registry (creates PVC)
|Provision virtual machine from a bootable operating system container located in a registry accessible from the cluster. Example: `_kubevirt/cirros-registry-disk-demo_`.

|PXE (network boot - adds network interface)
|Boot an operating system from a server on the network. Requires a PXE bootable network attachment definition.

|Persistent Volume Claim project
|
|Project name that you want to use for cloning the PVC.

|Persistent Volume Claim name
|
|PVC name that should apply to this virtual machine template if you are cloning an existing PVC.

|Mount this as a CD-ROM boot source
|
|A CD-ROM requires an additional disk for installing the operating system. Select the checkbox to add a disk and customize it later.

|Flavor
|Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Custom
|Presets the amount of CPU and memory in a virtual machine template with predefined values that are allocated to the virtual machine, depending on the operating system associated with that template.

If you choose a default template, you can override the `cpus` and `memsize` values in the template using custom values to create a custom template. Alternatively, you can create a custom template by modifying the `cpus` and `memsize` values in the *Details* tab on the *Workloads* -> *Virtualization* page.

.3+a|Workload Type

[NOTE]
====
If you choose the incorrect *Workload Type*, there could be performance or resource utilization issues (such as a slow UI).
====

|Desktop
|A virtual machine configuration for use on a desktop. Ideal for consumption on a small scale. Recommended for use with the web console.
Use this template class or the Server template class to prioritize VM density over `guaranteed` VM performance.

|Server
|Balances performance and it is compatible with a wide range of server workloads. Use this template class or the Desktop template class to prioritize VM density over `guaranteed` VM performance.

|High-Performance (requires CPU Manager)
|A virtual machine configuration that is optimized for high-performance workloads. Use this template class to prioritize `guaranteed` VM performance over VM density.

ifdef::virtualmachine[]
|Start this virtual machine after creation.
|
|This checkbox is selected by default and the virtual machine starts running after creation. Clear the checkbox if you do not want the virtual machine to start when it is created.
