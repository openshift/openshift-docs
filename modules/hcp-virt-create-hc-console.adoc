====
* If you want to use predefined values to automatically populate fields in the console, you can create a {VirtProductName} credential. For more information, see _Creating a credential for an on-premises environment_.

* On the *Cluster details* page, the pull secret is your {product-title} pull secret that you use to access {product-title} resources. If you selected a {VirtProductName} credential, the pull secret is automatically populated.

. Review your entries and click **Create**.

The **Hosted cluster** view is displayed.

. Monitor the deployment of the hosted cluster in the **Hosted cluster** view. If you do not see information about the hosted cluster, ensure that **All Clusters** is selected, and click the cluster name.

. Wait until the control plane components are ready. This process can take a few minutes.

. To view the node pool status, scroll to the **NodePool** section. The process to install the nodes takes about 10 minutes. You can also click **Nodes** to confirm whether the nodes joined the hosted cluster.
