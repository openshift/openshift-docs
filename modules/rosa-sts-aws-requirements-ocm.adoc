= Requirements for using {cluster-manager}

The following configuration details are required only if you use {cluster-manager-url} to manage your clusters. If you use the CLI tools exclusively, then you can disregard these requirements.

To use {cluster-manager}, you must link the roles in your Red{nbsp}Hat user organization and your Red{nbsp}Hat account to your AWS account. This linking concept is also known as account association.
