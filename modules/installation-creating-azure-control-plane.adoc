= Creating the control plane machines in Azure

You must create the control plane machines in Microsoft Azure for your cluster
to use. One way to create these machines is to modify the provided Azure
Resource Manager (ARM) template.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not use the provided ARM template to create your control plane
machines, you must review the provided information and manually create the
infrastructure. If your cluster does not initialize correctly, you might have to
contact Red Hat support with your installation logs.

.Prerequisites

* Configure an Azure account.
* Generate the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* Create and configure a VNet and associated subnets in Azure.
* Create and configure networking and load balancers in Azure.
* Create control plane and compute roles.
* Create the bootstrap machine.

.Procedure

. Copy the template from the *ARM template for control plane machines*
section of this topic and save it as `05_masters.json` in your cluster's installation directory.
This template describes the control plane machines that your cluster requires.

. Export the following variable needed by the control plane machine deployment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export MASTER_IGNITION=`cat <installation_directory>/master.ign | base64 | tr -d '\n'`
----

. Create the deployment by using the `az` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az deployment group create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
  --template-file "<installation_directory>/05_masters.json" \
  --parameters masterIgnition="${MASTER_IGNITION}" \ <1>
  --parameters sshKeyData="${SSH_KEY}" \ <2>
  --parameters privateDNSZoneName="${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN}" \ <3>
  --parameters baseName="${INFRA_ID}"<4>
----
<1> The Ignition content for the master nodes.
<2> The SSH RSA public key file as a string.
<3> The name of the private DNS zone to which the master nodes are attached.
<4> The base name to be used in resource names; this is usually the cluster's infrastructure ID.
