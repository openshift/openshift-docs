= Limitations to configure the size of the devices used in {lvms}

The limitations to configure the size of the devices that you can use to provision storage using {lvms} are as follows:

* The total storage size that you can provision is limited by the size of the underlying Logical Volume Manager (LVM) thin pool and the over-provisioning factor.
* The size of the logical volume depends on the size of the Physical Extent (PE) and the Logical Extent (LE).
** You can define the size of PE and LE during the physical and logical device creation.
** The default PE and LE size is 4 MB.
** If the size of the PE is increased, the maximum size of the LVM is determined by the kernel limits and your disk space.
ifdef::microshift[]
** The size limit for {op-system-base-full} 9 using the default PE and LE size is 8 EB.
** The following are the minimum storage sizes that you can request for each file system type:
*** `block`: 8 MiB
*** `xfs`: 300 MiB
*** `ext4`: 32 MiB

[cols="1,1", width="100%", options="header"]
|====

|Parameter
|Value

|Chunk size
|This value is based on the configuration in the `lvm.conf` file. By default, this value is set to 128 KiB.

|Maximum volume size
|Equal to the maximum volume size of the underlying {op-system} system.

|Minimum volume size
|Equal to the minimum volume size of the underlying {op-system} system.
