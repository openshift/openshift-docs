[id="nw-dual-stack-convert-back-single-stack_{context}"]
= Converting to a single-stack cluster network

As a cluster administrator, you can convert your dual-stack cluster network to a single-stack cluster network. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you originally converted your IPv4 single-stack cluster network to a dual-stack cluster, you can convert only back to the IPv4 single-stack cluster and not an IPv6 single-stack cluster network. The same restriction applies for converting back to an IPv6 single-stack cluster network. 
====

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* The cluster nodes have IPv6 addresses.
* You have enabled dual-stack networking.

.Procedure

. Edit the `networks.config.openshift.io` custom resource (CR) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit networks.config.openshift.io
----

. Remove the IPv4 or IPv6 configuration that you added to the `cidr` and the `hostPrefix` parameters from completing the "Converting to a dual-stack cluster network " procedure steps.
