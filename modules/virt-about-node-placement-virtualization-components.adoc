= About node placement for virtualization components

You might want to customize where {VirtProductName} deploys its components to ensure that:

* Virtual machines only deploy on nodes that are intended for virtualization workloads.
* Operators only deploy on infrastructure nodes.
* Certain nodes are unaffected by {VirtProductName}. For example, you have workloads unrelated to virtualization running on your cluster, and you want those workloads to be isolated from {VirtProductName}.

You can specify node placement rules for the {VirtProductName} Operators that Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) deploys by editing the OLM `Subscription` object.

To specify node placement rules for components that the {VirtProductName} Operators deploy, edit the HyperConverged Cluster custom resource (CR).

== About node placement rules

`nodeSelector`:: Allows pods to be scheduled on nodes that are labeled with the key-value pair or pairs that you specify in this field. The node must have labels that exactly match all listed pairs.
`affinity`:: Enables you to use more expressive syntax to set rules that match nodes with pods. Affinity also allows for more nuance in how the rules are applied. For example, you can specify that a rule is a preference, rather than a hard requirement, so that pods are still scheduled if the rule is not satisfied.
`tolerations`:: Allows pods to be scheduled on nodes that have matching taints. If a taint is applied to a node, that node only accepts pods that tolerate the taint.

[id="node-placement-olm-subscription-object_{context}"]
== Node placement in the OLM Subscription object

To specify the nodes where OLM deploys the {VirtProductName} Operators, edit the `Subscription` object during {VirtProductName} installation. You can include node placement rules in the `spec.config` field, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: hco-operatorhub
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  startingCSV: kubevirt-hyperconverged-operator.v{HCOVersion}
  channel: "stable"
  config: <1>
----
<1> The `config` field supports `nodeSelector` and `tolerations`, but it does not support `affinity`.

[id="node-placement-hco-cluster-cr_{context}"]
== Node placement in the HyperConverged Cluster CR

To specify the nodes where {VirtProductName} deploys its components, you can include the `nodePlacement` object in the HyperConverged Cluster custom resource (CR) file that you create during {VirtProductName} installation. You can include `nodePlacement` under the `spec.infra` and `spec.workloads` fields, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  BareMetalPlatform: true
  infra:
    nodePlacement: <1>
  workloads:
    nodePlacement:
----
<1> The `nodePlacement` field supports `nodeSelector`, `affinity`, and `tolerations` fields.
