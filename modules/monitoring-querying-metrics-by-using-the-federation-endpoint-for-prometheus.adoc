= Querying metrics by using the federation endpoint for Prometheus

You can use the federation endpoint to scrape platform and user-defined metrics from a network location outside the cluster.
To do so, access the Prometheus `/federate` endpoint for the cluster via an {product-title} route.

[WARNING]
====
A delay in retrieving metrics data occurs when you use federation.
This delay can affect the accuracy and timeliness of the scraped metrics.

Using the federation endpoint can also degrade the performance and scalability of your cluster, especially if you use the federation endpoint to retrieve large amounts of metrics data.
To avoid these issues, follow these recommendations:

* Do not try to retrieve all metrics data via the federation endpoint.
Query it only when you want to retrieve a limited, aggregated data set.
For example, retrieving fewer than 1,000 samples for each request helps minimize the risk of performance degradation.

* Avoid querying the federation endpoint frequently.
Limit queries to a maximum of one every 30 seconds.

If you need to forward large amounts of data outside the cluster, use remote write instead. For more information, see the _Configuring remote write storage_ section.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have obtained the host URL for the {product-title} route.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-monitoring-view` cluster role or have obtained a bearer token with `get` permission on the `namespaces` resource.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can only use bearer token authentication to access the federation endpoint.
====

.Procedure

. Retrieve the bearer token:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ token=`oc whoami -t`
----

. Query metrics from the `/federate` route.
The following example queries `up` metrics:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -G -s -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
    'https://<federation_host>/federate' \ <1>
    --data-urlencode 'match[]=up'
----
+
<1> For <federation_host>, substitute the host URL for the federation route.
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
