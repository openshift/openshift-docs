= Customizing the Jenkins image through source-to-image

To customize the official {product-title} Jenkins image, you can use the image as a source-to-image (S2I) builder.

You can use S2I to copy your custom Jenkins jobs definitions, add additional plug-ins, or replace the provided `config.xml` file with your own, custom, configuration.

To include your modifications in the Jenkins image, you must have a Git repository with the following directory structure:

`plugins`::
This directory contains those binary Jenkins plug-ins you want to copy into Jenkins.

`plugins.txt`::
This file lists the plug-ins you want to install using the following syntax:

----
pluginId:pluginVersion
----

`configuration/jobs`::
This directory contains the Jenkins job definitions.

`configuration/config.xml`::
This file contains your custom Jenkins configuration.

The contents of the `configuration/` directory is copied to the `/var/lib/jenkins/` directory, so you can also include additional files, such as `credentials.xml`, there.

<1> The `source` parameter defines the source Git repository with the layout described above.
<2> The `strategy` parameter defines the original Jenkins image to use as a source image for the build.
<3> The `output` parameter defines the resulting, customized Jenkins image that you can use in deployment configurations instead of the official Jenkins image.
