= Viewing network events
:FeatureName: OVN-Kubernetes networking events tracking
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

You can edit the `FlowCollector` to view information about network traffic events, such as network flows that are dropped or allowed by the following resources:

* `NetworkPolicy`
* `AdminNetworkPolicy`
* `BaselineNetworkPolicy`
* `EgressFirewall`
* `UserDefinedNetwork` isolation
* Multicast ACLs 

.Prerequisites
* You must have `OVNObservability` enabled by setting the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set in the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR) named `cluster`. For more information, see "Enabling feature sets using the CLI" and "Checking OVN-Kubernetes network traffic with OVS sampling using the CLI". 
* You have created at least one of the following network APIs: `NetworkPolicy`, `AdminNetworkPolicy`, `BaselineNetworkPolicy`, `UserDefinedNetwork` isolation, multicast, or `EgressFirewall`.

.Procedure
. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. In the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster*, and then select the *YAML* tab.
. Configure the `FlowCollector` CR to enable viewing `NetworkEvents`, for example:

----
<1> Optional: The `sampling` parameter is set to a value of 1 so that all network events are captured. If sampling `1` is too resource heavy, set sampling to something more appropriate for your needs. 
<2> The `privileged` parameter is set to `true` because the `OVN observability` library needs to access local Open vSwitch (OVS) socket and OpenShift Virtual Network (OVN) databases.

.Verification
. Navigate to the *Network Traffic* view and select the *Traffic flows* table. 
. You should see the new column, *Network Events*, where you can view information about impacts of one of the following network APIs you have enabled: `NetworkPolicy`, `AdminNetworkPolicy`, `BaselineNetworkPolicy`, `UserDefinedNetwork` isolation, multicast, or egress firewalls. 

An example of the kind of events you could see in this column is as follows:
