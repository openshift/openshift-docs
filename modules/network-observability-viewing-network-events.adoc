= Viewing network events
You can view network events, such as network flows that are dropped or allowed by a network policy, by editing the `FlowCollector` to the specifications in the following YAML example.

.Prerequisites
* Must have the `OVNObservability` specified in the `FeatureGate` custom resource. For more information, see "Enabling features using feature gates" in the "Additional resources" of this section.

.Procedure
. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. In the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster*, and then select the *YAML* tab.
. Configure the `FlowCollector` custom resource to enable viewing `NetworkEvents`, for example:
