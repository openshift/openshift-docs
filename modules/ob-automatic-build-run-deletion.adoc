To automatically delete a build run, you can add the following retention parameters in the `build` or `buildrun` specification:

* `buildrun` TTL parameters: Ensures that build runs only exist for a defined duration of time after completion.
** `buildrun.spec.retention.ttlAfterFailed`: The build run is deleted if the specified time has passed and the build run has failed.
** `buildrun.spec.retention.ttlAfterSucceeded`: The build run is deleted if the specified time has passed and the build run has succeeded.
* `build` TTL parameters: Ensures that build runs for a build only exist for a defined duration of time after completion.
** `build.spec.retention.ttlAfterFailed`: The build run is deleted if the specified time has passed and the build run has failed for the build.
** `build.spec.retention.ttlAfterSucceeded`: The build run is deleted if the specified time has passed and the build run has succeeded for the build.
* `build` limit parameters: Ensures that only a limited number of succeeded or failed build runs can exist for a build.
** `build.spec.retention.succeededLimit`: Defines the number of succeeded build runs that can exist for the build.
** `build.spec.retention.failedLimit`: Defines the number of failed build runs that can exist for the build.
