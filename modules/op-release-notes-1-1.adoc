= Release notes for {pipelines-title} Technology Preview 1.1

[id="new-features-1-1_{context}"]
== New features
{pipelines-title} Technology Preview (TP) 1.1 is now available on {product-title} {product-version}. {pipelines-title} TP 1.1 is updated to support:

* Tekton Pipelines 0.14.3
* Tekton `tkn` CLI 0.11.0
* Tekton Triggers 0.6.1
* ClusterTasks based on Tekton Catalog 0.14

In addition to the fixes and stability improvements, here is a highlight of what's new in OpenShift Pipelines 1.1.

=== Pipelines

* Workspaces can now be used instead of PipelineResources. It is recommended that you use Workspaces in OpenShift Pipelines, as PipelineResources are difficult to debug, limited in scope, and make Tasks less reusable. For more details on Workspaces, see Understanding OpenShift Pipelines.
* Workspace support for VolumeClaimTemplates has been added:
** The VolumeClaimTemplate for a PipelineRun and TaskRun can now be added as a volume source for Workspaces. The tekton-controller then creates a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) using the template that is seen as a PVC for all TaskRuns in the Pipeline. Thus you do not need to define the PVC configuration every time it binds a workspace that spans multiple tasks.
** Support to find the name of the PersistentVolumeClaim when a VolumeClaimTemplate is used as a volume source is now available using variable substitution.
* Support for improving audits:
** The `PipelineRun.Status` field now contains the status of every TaskRun in the Pipeline and the Pipeline specification used to instantiate a PipelineRun to monitor the progress of the PipelineRun.
** Pipeline results have been added to the pipeline specification and `PipelineRun` status.
** The `TaskRun.Status` field now contains the exact Task specification used to instantiate the `TaskRun`.
* Support to apply the default parameter to Conditions.
* A TaskRun created by referencing a ClusterTask now adds the `tekton.dev/clusterTask` label instead of the `tekton.dev/task` label.
* The `kubeconfigwriter` now adds the `ClientKeyData` and the `ClientCertificateData` configurations in the Resource structure to enable replacement of the pipeline resource type cluster with the kubeconfig-creator Task.
* The names of the `feature-flags` and the `config-defaults` ConfigMaps are now customizable.
* Support for HostNetwork in the PodTemplate used by TaskRun is now available.
* An Affinity Assistant is now available to support node affinity in TaskRuns that share workspace volume. By default, this is disabled on OpenShift Pipelines.
* The PodTemplate has been updated to specify `imagePullSecrets` to identify secrets that the container runtime should use to authorize container image pulls when starting a pod.
* Support for emitting warning events from the TaskRun controller if the controller fails to update the TaskRun.
* Standard or recommended k8s labels have been added to all resources to identify resources belonging to an application or component.
* The Entrypoint process is now notified for signals and these signals are then propagated using a dedicated PID Group of the Entrypoint process.
* The PodTemplate can now be set on a Task level at runtime using `TaskRunSpecs`.
* Support for emitting Kubernetes events:
** The controller now emits events for additional TaskRun lifecycle events - `taskrun started` and `taskrun running`.
** The PipelineRun controller now emits an event every time a Pipeline starts.
* In addition to the default Kubernetes events, support for CloudEvents for TaskRuns is now available. The controller can be configured to send any TaskRun events, such as create, started, and failed, as cloud events.
* Support for using the `$context.<task|taskRun|pipeline|pipelineRun>.name` variable to reference the appropriate name when in PipelineRuns and TaskRuns.
* Validation for PipelineRun parameters is now available to ensure that all the parameters required by the Pipeline are provided by the PipelineRun. This also allows PipelineRuns to provide extra parameters in addition to the required parameters.
* You can now specify Tasks within a Pipeline that will always execute before the pipeline exits, either after finishing all tasks successfully or after a Task in the Pipeline failed, using the `finally` field in the Pipeline YAML file.
* The `git-clone` ClusterTask is now available.


=== Pipelines CLI

* Support for embedded Trigger binding is now available to the `tkn evenlistener describe` command.
* Support to recommend subcommands and make suggestions if an incorrect subcommand is used.
* The `tkn task describe` command now auto selects the task if only one task is present in the Pipeline.
* You can now start a Task using default parameter values by specifying the `--use-param-defaults` flag in the `tkn task start` command.
* You can now specify a volumeClaimTemplate for PipelineRuns or TaskRuns using the `--workspace` option with the  `tkn pipeline start` or  `tkn task start` commands.
* The `tkn pipelinerun logs` command now displays logs for the final tasks listed in the `finally` section.
* Interactive mode support has now been provided to the `tkn task start` command and the `describe` subcommand for the following tkn resources:  `pipeline`, `pipelinerun`, `task`, `taskrun`, `clustertask`, and `pipelineresource`.
* The `tkn version` command now displays the version of the Triggers installed in the cluster.
* The `tkn pipeline describe` command now displays parameter values and timeouts specified for Tasks used in the Pipeline.
* Support added for the `--last` option for the `tkn pipelinerun describe` and the `tkn taskrun describe` commands to describe the most recent PipelineRun or TaskRun, respectively.
* The `tkn pipeline describe` command now displays the conditions applicable to the Tasks in the Pipeline.
* You can now use the `--no-headers` and `--all-namespaces` flags with the `tkn resource list` command.


=== Triggers
* The following Common Expression Language (CEL) functions are now available:
** `parseURL`  to parse and extract portions of a URL
** `parseJSON` to parse JSON value types embedded in a string in the `payload` field of the `deployment` webhook
* A new interceptor for webhooks from Bitbucket has been added.
* EventListeners now display the `Address URL` and the `Available status` as additional fields when listed with the `kubectl get` command.
* TriggerTemplate params now use the `$(tt.params.<paramName>)` syntax instead of `$(params.<paramName>)` to reduce the confusion between TriggerTemplate and ResourceTemplates params.
* You can now add `tolerations` in the EventListener CRD to ensure that EventListeners are deployed with the same configuration even if all nodes are tainted due to security or management issues.
* You can now add a Readiness Probe for EventListener Deployment at `URL/live`.
* Support for embedding TriggerBinding specifications in EventListener Triggers.
* Trigger resources are now annotated with the recommended `app.kubernetes.io` labels.


[id="deprecated-features-1-1_{context}"]
== Deprecated features
The following items are deprecated in this release:

* The `--namespace` or `-n` flags for all cluster-wide commands, including the `clustertask` and `clustertriggerbinding` commands, are deprecated. It will be removed in a future release.
* The `name` field in `triggers.bindings` within an EventListener has been deprecated in favor of the `ref` field and will be removed in a future release.
* Variable interpolation in TriggerTemplates using `$(params)` has been deprecated in favor of using `$(tt.params)` to reduce confusion with the Pipeline variable interpolation syntax. The `$(params.<paramName>)` syntax will be removed in a future release.
* The `tekton.dev/task` label is deprecated on ClusterTasks.
* The `TaskRun.Status.ResourceResults.ResourceRef` field is deprecated and will be removed.
* The `tkn pipeline create`, `tkn task create`, and `tkn resource create -f` subcommands have been removed.
* Namespace validation has been removed from `tkn` commands.
* The default timeout of `1h` and the  `-t` flag for the `tkn ct start` command have been removed.
* The `s2i` ClusterTask has been deprecated.


[id="known-issues-1-1_{context}"]
== Known issues
* Conditions do not support Workspaces.
* The `--workspace` option and the interactive mode is not supported for the `tkn clustertask start` command.
* Support of backward compatibility for `$(params.<paramName>)` forces you to use TriggerTemplates with pipeline specific params as the Triggers webhook is unable to differentiate Trigger params from pipelines params.
* Pipeline metrics report incorrect values when you run a  promQL query for `tekton_taskrun_count`  and `tekton_taskrun_duration_seconds_count`.
* PipelineRuns and TaskRuns continue to be in the `Running` and `Running(Pending)` states respectively even when a non existing PVC name is given to a Workspace.

[id="fixed-issues-1-1_{context}"]
== Fixed issues
* Previously, the `tkn task delete <name> --trs` command would delete both the Task and ClusterTask if the name of the Task and ClusterTask were the same. With this fix, the command deletes only the TaskRuns that are created by the Task `<name>`.
* Previously the  `tkn pr delete -p <name> --keep 2` command would disregard the `-p` flag when used with the `--keep` flag and would delete all the PipelineRuns except the latest two. With this fix, the command deletes only the PipelineRuns that are created by the Pipeline `<name>`, except for the latest two.
* The `tkn triggertemplate describe` output now displays ResourceTemplates in a table format instead of YAML format.
* Previously the `buildah` ClusterTask failed when a new user was added to a container. With this fix, the issue has been resolved.
