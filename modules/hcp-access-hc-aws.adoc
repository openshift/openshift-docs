= Accessing a hosted cluster on {aws-short}

You can access the hosted cluster by getting the `kubeconfig` file and the `kubeadmin` credentials directly from resources.

You must be familiar with the access secrets for hosted clusters. The hosted cluster namespace contains hosted cluster resources, and the hosted control plane namespace is where the hosted control plane runs. The secret name formats are as follows:

* `kubeconfig` secret: `<hosted-cluster-namespace>-<name>-admin-kubeconfig`. For example, `clusters-hypershift-demo-admin-kubeconfig`.
* `kubeadmin` password secret: `<hosted-cluster-namespace>-<name>-kubeadmin-password`. For example, `clusters-hypershift-demo-kubeadmin-password`.

.Procedure

* The `kubeconfig` secret contains a Base64-encoded `kubeconfig` field, which you can decode and save into a file to use with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig <hosted_cluster_name>.kubeconfig get nodes
----
+
The `kubeadmin` password secret is also Base64-encoded. You can decode it and use the password to log in to the API server or console of the hosted cluster.
