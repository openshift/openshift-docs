= Creating a kmod image

Kernel Module Management (KMM) works with purpose-built kmod images, which are standard OCI images that contain `.ko` files.
The location of the `.ko` files must match the following pattern: `<prefix>/lib/modules/[kernel-version]/`.

Keep the following in mind when working with the `.ko` files:

* In most cases, `<prefix>` should be equal to `/opt`. This is the `Module` CRD's default value.
* `kernel-version` must not be empty and must be equal to the kernel version the kernel modules were built for.
