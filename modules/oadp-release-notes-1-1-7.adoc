== Resolved issues

The following highlighted issues are resolved in OADP 1.1.7:

.Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack)

In previous releases of OADP 1.1, the HTTP/2 protocol was susceptible to a denial of service attack because request cancellation could reset multiple streams quickly. The server had to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection. This resulted in a denial of service due to server resource consumption.
