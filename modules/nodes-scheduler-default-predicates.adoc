= Understanding the scheduler predicates

Predicates are rules that filter out unqualified nodes.

There are several predicates provided by default in {product-title}. Some of
these predicates can be customized by providing certain parameters. Multiple
predicates can be combined to provide additional filtering of nodes.

[id="static-predicates_{context}"]
== Static Predicates
These predicates do not take any configuration parameters or inputs from the
user. These are specified in the scheduler configuration using their exact
name.

[id="default-predicates_{context}"]
=== Default Predicates

The default scheduler policy includes the following predicates:

The `NoVolumeZoneConflict` predicate checks that the volumes a pod requests
are available in the zone.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "NoVolumeZoneConflict"}
----

The `MaxEBSVolumeCount` predicate checks the maximum number of volumes that can be attached to an AWS instance.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "MaxEBSVolumeCount"}
----

The `MaxAzureDiskVolumeCount` predicate checks the maximum number of Azure Disk Volumes.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "MaxAzureDiskVolumeCount"}
----

The `PodToleratesNodeTaints` predicate checks if a pod can tolerate the node taints.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "PodToleratesNodeTaints"}
----

The `CheckNodeUnschedulable` predicate checks if a pod can be scheduled on a node with `Unschedulable` spec.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "CheckNodeUnschedulable"}
----

The `CheckVolumeBinding` predicate evaluates if a pod can fit based on the volumes, it requests, for both bound and unbound PVCs.

* For PVCs that are bound, the predicate checks that the corresponding PV's node affinity is satisfied by the given node.
* For PVCs that are unbound, the predicate searched for available PVs that can satisfy the PVC requirements and that
the PV node affinity is satisfied by the given node.

The predicate returns true if all bound PVCs have compatible PVs with the node, and if all unbound PVCs can be matched with an available and node-compatible PV.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "CheckVolumeBinding"}
----

// The `CheckVolumeBinding` predicate must be enabled in non-default schedulers.

The `NoDiskConflict` predicate checks if the volume requested by a pod is available.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "NoDiskConflict"}
----

The `MaxGCEPDVolumeCount` predicate checks the maximum number of Google Compute Engine (GCE) Persistent Disks (PD).

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "MaxGCEPDVolumeCount"}
----

The `MaxCSIVolumeCountPred` predicate determines how many Container Storage Interface (CSI) volumes should be attached to a node and whether that number exceeds a configured limit.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "MaxCSIVolumeCountPred"}
----

The `MatchInterPodAffinity` predicate checks if the pod affinity/anti-affinity rules permit the pod.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "MatchInterPodAffinity"}
----

[id="other-predicates_{context}"]
=== Other Static Predicates

{product-title} also supports the following predicates:

[NOTE]
====
The `CheckNode-*` predicates cannot be used if the Taint Nodes By Condition feature is enabled.
The Taint Nodes By Condition feature is enabled by default.
====

The `CheckNodeCondition` predicate checks if a pod can be scheduled on a node reporting *out of disk*, *network unavailable*, or *not ready* conditions.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "CheckNodeCondition"}
----

The `CheckNodeLabelPresence` predicate checks if all of the specified labels exist on a node, regardless of their value.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "CheckNodeLabelPresence"}
----

The `checkServiceAffinity` predicate checks that ServiceAffinity labels are homogeneous for pods that are scheduled on a node.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "checkServiceAffinity"}
----

The `PodToleratesNodeNoExecuteTaints` predicate checks if a pod tolerations can tolerate a node `NoExecute` taints.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "PodToleratesNodeNoExecuteTaints"}
----

[id="admin-guide-scheduler-general-predicates_{context}"]
== General Predicates

The following general predicates check whether non-critical predicates and essential predicates pass. Non-critical predicates are the predicates
that only non-critical pods must pass and essential predicates are the predicates that all pods must pass.

_The default scheduler policy includes the general predicates._

[discrete]
=== Non-critical general predicates

The `PodFitsResources` predicate determines a fit based on resource availability
(CPU, memory, GPU, and so forth). The
nodes can declare their resource capacities and then pods can specify what
resources they require. Fit is based on requested, rather than used
resources.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "PodFitsResources"}
----

[discrete]
==== Essential general predicates

The `PodFitsHostPorts` predicate determines if a node has free ports for the requested pod ports (absence
of port conflicts).

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "PodFitsHostPorts"}
----

The `HostName` predicate determines fit based on the presence of the Host parameter
and a string match with the name of the host.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "HostName"}
----

The `MatchNodeSelector` predicate determines fit based on node selector (nodeSelector) queries
defined in the pod.

[source,yaml]
----
{"name" : "MatchNodeSelector"}
----

[id="configurable-predicates_{context}"]
== Configurable Predicates

// per sjenning Nope

You can configure these predicates in the scheduler policy Configmap
in the `openshift-config` project, to add labels to affect
how the predicate functions.

Since these are configurable, multiple predicates
of the same type (but different configuration parameters) can be combined as
long as their user-defined names are different.

For information on using these priorities, see Modifying Scheduler Policy.

*ServiceAffinity* places pods on nodes based on the service running on that pod.
Placing pods of the same service on the same or co-located nodes can lead to higher efficiency.

This predicate attempts to place pods with specific labels
in its node selector on nodes that have the same label.

If the pod does not specify the labels in its
node selector, then the first pod is placed on any node based on availability
and all subsequent pods of the service are scheduled on nodes that have the
same label values as that node.

"predicates":[
      {
         "name":"<name>", <1>
         "argument":{
            "serviceAffinity":{
               "labels":[
                  "<label>" <2>
               ]
            }
         }
      }
   ],
----
<1> Specify a name for the predicate.
<2> Specify a label to match.

For example:

[source,json]
----
        "name":"ZoneAffinity",
        "argument":{
            "serviceAffinity":{
                "labels":[
                    "rack"
                ]
            }
        }
----

For example. if the first pod of a service had a node selector `rack` was scheduled to a node with label `region=rack`,
all the other subsequent pods belonging to the same service will be scheduled on nodes
with the same `region=rack` label.

Multiple-level labels are also supported. Users can also specify all pods for a service to
be scheduled on nodes within the same region and within the same zone (under the region).

The `labelsPresence` parameter checks whether a particular node has a specific label. The labels create node _groups_ that the
`LabelPreference` priority uses. Matching by label can be useful, for example, where nodes have their physical location or status defined by labels.

   ],
----
<1> Specify a name for the predicate.
<2> Specify a label to match.
<3> Specify whether the labels are required, either `true` or `false`.
+
* For `presence:false`, if any of the requested labels are present in the node labels,
the pod cannot be scheduled. If the labels are not present, the pod can be scheduled.
+
* For `presence:true`, if all of the requested labels are present in the node labels,
the pod can be scheduled. If all of the labels are not present, the pod is not scheduled.

For example:
