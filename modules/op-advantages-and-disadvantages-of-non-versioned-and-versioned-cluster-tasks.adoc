= Advantages and disadvantages of non-versioned and versioned cluster tasks

Before adopting non-versioned or versioned cluster tasks as a standard in production environments, cluster administrators might consider their advantages and disadvantages.

.Advantages and disadvantages of non-versioned and versioned cluster tasks
[options="header"]
|===

| Cluster task | Advantages | Disadvantages

| Non-versioned cluster task (NVCT)
a|
* If you prefer deploying pipelines with the latest updates and bug fixes, use the NVCT.
* Upgrading the Operator upgrades the non-versioned cluster tasks, which consume fewer resources than multiple versioned cluster tasks.
a| If you deploy pipelines that use NVCT, they might break after an Operator upgrade if the automatically upgraded cluster tasks are not backward-compatible.

| Versioned cluster task (VCT)
a|
* If you prefer stable pipelines in production, use the VCT.
* The earlier version is retained on the cluster even after the later version of a cluster task is installed. You can continue using the earlier cluster tasks.
a|
* If you continue using an earlier version of a cluster task, you might miss the latest features and critical security updates.
* The earlier versions of cluster tasks that are not operational consume cluster resources.
* * After it is upgraded, the Operator cannot manage the earlier VCT. You can delete the earlier VCT manually by using the `oc delete clustertask` command, but you cannot restore it.
