= AWS SNS with IntegrationSink

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Notification Service (SNS) Kamelet enables you to deliver CloudEvents from Knative Eventing to an SNS topic. This integration is useful when you need broad distribution like email, SMS, HTTP subscribers, SQS queues, Lambda functions, etc. via SNS subscriptions.

To configure an `IntegrationSink` API resource for AWS SNS, reference a Kubernetes Secret with valid AWS credentials, specify the SNS topic Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and region, and configure the event source that will produce the CloudEvents.
