= Sample multi-architecture node workload deployments

Before you schedule workloads on a cluster with compute nodes of different architectures, consider the following use cases:

Using node affinity to schedule workloads on a node:: You can allow a workload to be scheduled on only a set of nodes with architectures supported by its images, you can set the `spec.affinity.nodeAffinity` field in your pod's template specification.
+

                values: <1>
                - amd64
                - arm64
----
<1> Specify the supported architectures. Valid values include `amd64`,`arm64`, or both values.

Tainting every node for a specific architecture:: You can taint a node to avoid workloads that are not compatible with its architecture to be scheduled on that node. In the case where your cluster is using a `MachineSet` object, you can add parameters to the `.spec.template.spec.taints` field to avoid workloads being scheduled on nodes with non-supported architectures.

* Before you can taint a node, you must scale down the `MachineSet` object or remove available machines. You can scale down the machine set by using one of following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=0 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
For more information on scaling machine sets, see "Modifying a compute machine set".

        key: multi-arch.openshift.io/arch
        value: arm64

You can also set a taint on a specific node by running the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> multi-arch.openshift.io/arch=arm64:NoSchedule
----

Creating a default toleration:: You can annotate a namespace so all of the workloads get the same default toleration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate namespace my-namespace \
  'scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultTolerations'='[{"operator": "Exists", "effect": "NoSchedule", "key": "multi-arch.openshift.io/arch"}]'
----

Tolerating architecture taints in workloads:: On a node with a defined taint, workloads will not be scheduled on that node. However, you can allow them to be scheduled by setting a toleration in the pod's specification.
+
.Example deployment with a toleration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: # ...
spec:
  # ...
  template:
    # ...
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "multi-arch.openshift.io/arch"
        value: "arm64"
        operator: "Equal"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
----
+
This example deployment can also be allowed on nodes with the `multi-arch.openshift.io/arch=arm64` taint specified.

Using node affinity with taints and tolerations:: When a scheduler computes the set of nodes to schedule a pod, tolerations can broaden the set while node affinity restricts the set. If you set a taint to the nodes of a specific architecture, the following example toleration is required for scheduling pods.
