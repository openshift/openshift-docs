[id="ocp-running-rsync-root-or-non-root_{context}"]
= Running Rsync as either root or non-root

{OCP} environments have the `PodSecurityAdmission` controller enabled by default. This controller requires cluster administrators to enforce Pod Security Standards by means of namespace labels. All workloads in the cluster are expected to run one of the following Pod Security Standard levels: `Privileged`, `Baseline` or `Restricted`. Every cluster has its own default policy set.

To guarantee successful data transfer in all environments, {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) 1.7.5 introduced changes in Rsync pods, including running Rsync pods as non-root user by default. This ensures that data transfer is possible even for workloads that do not necessarily require higher privileges. This change was made because it is best to run workloads with the lowest level of privileges possible.

[id="manually-overriding-default-nonroot-operation_{context}"]
== Manually overriding default non-root operation for data transfer

Although running Rsync pods as non-root user works in most cases, data transfer might fail when you run workloads as root user on the source side. {mtc-short} provides two ways to manually override default non-root operation for data transfer:

* Configure all migrations to run an Rsync pod as root on the destination cluster for all migrations.
* Run an Rsync pod as root on the destination cluster per migration.

In both cases, you must set the following labels on the source side of any namespaces that are running workloads with higher privileges before migration: `enforce`, `audit`, and `warn.`
