= Upgrading to {SMProductName} 2.1

To upgrade {SMProductName}, you must update the version field of the {SMProductName} `ServiceMeshControlPlane` v2 resource. Then, once it's configured and applied, restart the application pods to update each sidecar proxy and its configuration.

.Prerequisites

* You are running {product-title} 4.6 or later.
* You have the {SMProductName} version 2.1.x operator. If the *automatic* upgrade path is enabled, the operator automatically downloads the latest information. However, there are steps you must take to use the features in {SMProductName} version 2.1.
* You must upgrade from {SMProductName} 2.0 to 2.1. You cannot upgrade `ServiceMeshControlPlane` from 1.1 to 2.1 directly.

.Procedure

. Switch to the project that contains your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the control plane project.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project istio-system
----

. Check your v2 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource configuration to verify it is valid.
+
.. Run the following command to view your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource as a v2 resource.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get smcp -o yaml
----
+
[TIP]
====
Back up your control plane configuration.
====

. Update the `.spec.version` field from v2.0 to v2.1, and apply the configuration.
+
If you see the following message, update the existing `Mixer` type to `Istiod` type in the existing Control Plane spec before you update the `.spec.version` field:
+
[source,text]
----
An error occurred
admission webhook smcp.validation.maistra.io denied the request: [support for policy.type "Mixer" and policy.Mixer options have been removed in v2.1, please use another alternative, support for telemetry.type "Mixer" and telemetry.Mixer options have been removed in v2.1, please use another alternative]”
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
spec:
  policy:
    type: Istiod
  telemetry:
    type: Istiod
  version: v2.1
----
+
Alternatively, instead of using the command line, you can use the web console to edit the control plane. In the {product-title} web console, click *Project* and select the project name you just entered.
+
.. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
.. Find your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` instance.
.. Select *YAML view* and update text of the YAML file, as shown in the previous example.
.. Click *Save*.
