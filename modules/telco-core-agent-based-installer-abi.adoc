= Agent-based installer

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
You can install telco core clusters with the Agent-based installer (ABI) on bare-metal servers without requiring additional servers or virtual machines for managing the installation.
ABI supports installations in disconnected environments.
With ABI, you install clusters by using declarative custom resources (CRs).

[NOTE]
====
Agent-based installer is an optional component. The recommended installation method is by using {rh-rhacm-title} or {mce}.
====

Limits and requirements::
* You need to have a disconnected mirror registry with all required content mirrored to do Agent-based installs in a disconnected environment.

Engineering considerations::
* Networking configuration should be applied as `NMState` custom resources (CRs) during cluster installation.
