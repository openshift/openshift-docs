[id="openshift-adp-controller-manager-seg-fault_{context}"]
== OpenShift ADP Controller segmentation fault

If you configure a DPA with both `cloudstorage` and `restic` enabled, the `openshift-adp-controller-manager` pod crashes and restarts indefinitely until the pod fails with a crash loop segmentation fault.

You can have either `velero` or `cloudstorage` defined, because they are mutually exclusive fields.

* If you have both `velero` and  `cloudstorage` defined, the `openshift-adp-controller-manager` fails.
* If you have neither `velero` nor `cloudstorage` defined, the `openshift-adp-controller-manager` fails.

For more information about this issue, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1054[OADP-1054].

[id="openshift-adp-controller-manager-seg-fault-workaround_{context}"]
== OpenShift ADP Controller segmentation fault workaround

You must define either `velero` or `cloudstorage` when you configure a DPA. If you define both APIs in your DPA, the `openshift-adp-controller-manager` pod fails with a crash loop segmentation fault.
