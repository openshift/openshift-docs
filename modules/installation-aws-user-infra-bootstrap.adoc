[id="installation-aws-user-infra-bootstrap_{context}"]
= Initializing the bootstrap node on AWS with user-provisioned infrastructure

After you create all of the required infrastructure in Amazon Web Services (AWS),
you can install the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Configure an AWS account.
* Generate the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* Create and configure a VPC and associated subnets in AWS.
* Create and configure DNS, load balancers, and listeners in AWS.
* Create control plane and compute roles.
* Create the bootstrap machine.
* Create the control plane machines.
* If you plan to manually manage the worker machines, create the worker machines.

.Procedure

. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the
following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install wait-for bootstrap-complete --dir=<installation_directory> \ <1>
    --log-level=info <2>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.
<2> To view different installation details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or
`error` instead of `info`.
+
If the command exits without a `FATAL` warning, your production control plane
has initialized.
