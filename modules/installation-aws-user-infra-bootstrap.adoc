= Initializing the bootstrap sequence on AWS with user-provisioned infrastructure

After you create all of the required infrastructure in Amazon Web Services (AWS),
you can start the bootstrap sequence that initializes the {product-title} control plane.

.Prerequisites

* You configured an AWS account.
* You added your AWS keys and region to your local AWS profile by running `aws configure`.
* You generated the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* You created and configured a VPC and associated subnets in AWS.
* You created and configured DNS, load balancers, and listeners in AWS.
* You created the security groups and roles required for your cluster in AWS.
* You created the bootstrap machine.
* You created the control plane machines.
* You created the worker nodes.

.Procedure

. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and start the bootstrap process that initializes the {product-title} control plane:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install wait-for bootstrap-complete --dir=<installation_directory> \ <1>
    --log-level=info <2>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.
<2> To view different installation details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or
`error` instead of `info`.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
INFO Waiting up to 20m0s for the Kubernetes API at https://api.mycluster.example.com:6443... 
INFO API v1.19.0+9f84db3 up                       
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for bootstrapping to complete... 
INFO It is now safe to remove the bootstrap resources 
INFO Time elapsed: 1s 
----
+
If the command exits without a `FATAL` warning, your {product-title} control plane
has initialized. 
+
[NOTE]
====
After the control plane initializes, it sets up the compute nodes and installs additional services in the form of Operators.
