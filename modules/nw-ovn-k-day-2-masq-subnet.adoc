= Configuring the OVN-Kubernetes masquerade subnet as a post-installation operation

You can change the masquerade subnet used by OVN-Kubernetes as a post-installation operation to avoid conflicts with any existing subnets that are already in use in your environment.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* Change your cluster's masquerade subnet:
+
** For dualstack clusters using IPv6, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch networks.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"defaultNetwork":{"ovnKubernetesConfig":{"gatewayConfig":{"ipv4":{"internalMasqueradeSubnet": "<ipv4_masquerade_subnet>"},"ipv6":{"internalMasqueradeSubnet": "<ipv6_masquerade_subnet>"}}}}}}'
----
+
where:
+
`ipv4_masquerade_subnet`:: Specifies an IP address to be used as the IPv4 masquerade subnet. This range cannot overlap with any other subnets used by {product-title} or on the host itself. In versions of {product-title} earlier than 4.17, the default value for IPv4 was `169.254.169.0/29`, and clusters that were upgraded to version 4.17 maintain this value. For new clusters starting from version 4.17, the default value is `169.254.0.0/17`. 
+
`ipv6_masquerade_subnet`:: Specifies an IP address to be used as the IPv6 masquerade subnet. This range cannot overlap with any other subnets used by {product-title} or on the host itself. The default value for IPv6 is `fd69::/125`.
