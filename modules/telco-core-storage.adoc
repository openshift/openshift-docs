= Storage

Cloud native storage services can be provided by multiple solutions including {rh-storage} from Red Hat or third parties.

[id="telco-core-rh-storage_{context}"]
== {rh-storage}

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
{rh-storage-first} is a software-defined storage service for containers.
For {rds-caps} clusters, storage support is provided by {rh-storage} storage services running externally to the application workload cluster.

Limits and requirements::
* In an IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking environment, {rh-storage} uses IPv4 addressing. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.13/html-single/4.13_release_notes/index#support_openshift_dual_stack_with_odf_using_ipv4[Support OpenShift dual stack with {rh-storage} using IPv4].

Engineering considerations::
* {rh-storage} network traffic should be isolated from other traffic on a dedicated network, for example, by using VLAN isolation.

* Other storage solutions can be used to provide persistent storage for core clusters.

[NOTE]
====
The configuration and integration of these solutions is outside the scope of the {rds} RDS. Integration of the storage solution into the core cluster must include correct sizing and performance analysis to ensure the storage meets overall performance and resource utilization requirements.
