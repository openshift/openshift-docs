= Storage

Overview::
Cloud native storage services can be provided by multiple solutions including {rh-storage} from Red Hat or third parties.
+
{rh-storage} is a Ceph based software-defined storage solution for containers. It provides block storage, file system storage, and on-premises object storage, which can be dynamically provisioned for both persistent and non-persistent data requirements. {rds-caps} applications require persistent storage.
+
[NOTE]
====
All storage data may not be encrypted in flight. To reduce risk, isolate the storage network from other cluster networks. The storage network must not be reachable, or routable, from other cluster networks. Only nodes directly attached to the storage network should be allowed to gain access to it.

== {rh-storage}

New in this release::

* No reference design updates in this release

Description::

{rh-storage-first} is a software-defined storage service for containers.
For {rds-caps} clusters, storage support is provided by {rh-storage} storage services running externally to the application workload cluster. {rh-storage} supports separation of storage traffic using secondary CNI networks.

Limits and requirements::
* In an IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking environment, {rh-storage} uses IPv4 addressing. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.13/html-single/4.13_release_notes/index#support_openshift_dual_stack_with_odf_using_ipv4[Support OpenShift dual stack with {rh-storage} using IPv4].


Engineering considerations::
* {rh-storage} network traffic should be isolated from other traffic on a dedicated network, for example, by using VLAN isolation.

== Other Storage

Other storage solutions can be used to provide persistent storage for core clusters. The configuration and integration of these solutions is outside the scope of the {rds} RDS. Integration of the storage solution into the core cluster must include correct sizing and performance analysis to ensure the storage meets overall performance and resource utilization requirements.
