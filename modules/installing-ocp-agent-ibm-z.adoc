= Manually adding {ibm-z-title} agents

After creating the PXE assets, you can add {ibm-z-name} agents.
Only use this procedure for {ibm-z-name} clusters.

Depending on your {ibm-z-name} environment, you can choose from the following options:

* Adding {ibm-z-name} agents with z/VM
* Adding {ibm-z-name} agents with {op-system-base} KVM
* Adding {ibm-z-name} agents with Logical Partition (LPAR)

[NOTE]
====
Currently, ISO boot support on {ibm-z-name} (`s390x``) is available only for {op-system-base-full} KVM, which provides the flexibility to choose either PXE or ISO-based installation. For installations with z/VM and Logical Partition (LPAR), only PXE boot is supported.
