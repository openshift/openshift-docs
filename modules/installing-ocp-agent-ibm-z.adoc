= Manually adding {ibm-z-title} agents

After creating the PXE assets, you can add {ibm-z-name} agents.

[NOTE]
====
Currently ISO boot is not supported on {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architecture. Therefore, manually adding {ibm-z-name} agents is required for Agent-based installations on {ibm-z-name}.
====

Depending on your {ibm-z-name} environment, you can choose from the following options:

* Adding {ibm-z-name} agents with z/VM
* Adding {ibm-z-name} agents with {op-system-base} KVM
