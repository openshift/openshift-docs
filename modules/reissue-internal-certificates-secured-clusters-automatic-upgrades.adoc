= Reissuing internal certificates for secured clusters by using automatic upgrades

Secured clusters contain the Collector, Sensor, Admission Control, and local Scanner components.
You can reissue internal certificates for these components by using automatic upgrades.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Automatic upgrades are only applicable to static manifest-based deployments by using the `roxctl` CLI. 

For more information, see "Install Central using the roxctl CLI".
====

.Prerequisites

* You have enabled automatic upgrades for all the clusters.
* You have `write` permission for the `Administration` resource.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, click *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
. Select a cluster to view its details.
. From the cluster details panel, select the link to *Apply credentials by using an automatic upgrade*.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you apply an automatic upgrade, {rh-rhacs-first} creates new credentials in the selected cluster. However, you continue to see a notification. The notification disappears when each {product-title-short} service uses the new credentials after the service restarts.
