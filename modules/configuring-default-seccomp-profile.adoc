[id="verifying-default-seccomp-profile_{context}"]
= Verifying the default seccomp profile applied to a pod

{product-title} ships with a default seccomp profile that is referenced as `runtime/default`. In {product-version}, newly created pods have the Security Context Constraint (SCC) set to `restricted-v2` and the default seccomp profile applies to the pod.

.Procedure

. You can verify the Security Context Constraint (SCC) and the default seccomp profile set on a pod by running the following commands:

.. Verify what pods are running in the namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n <namespace>
----
+
For example, to verify what pods are running in the `workshop` namespace run the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n workshop
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----

<1> The `restricted-v2` SCC is added by default if your workload does not have access to a different SCC.
<2> Newly created pods in {product-version} will have the seccomp profile configured to `runtime/default` as mandated by the SCC.

[id="upgraded_cluster_{context}"]
== Upgraded cluster

In clusters upgraded to {product-version} all authenticated users have access to the `restricted` and `restricted-v2` SCC.

A workload admitted by the SCC `restricted` for example, on a {product-title} v4.10 cluster when upgraded may get admitted by `restricted-v2`. This is because `restricted-v2` is the more restrictive SCC between `restricted` and `restricted-v2`.
[NOTE]
====
The workload must be able to run with `retricted-v2`.
====

Conversely with a workload that requires `privilegeEscalation: true` this workload will continue to have the `restricted` SCC available for any authenticated user. This is because `restricted-v2` does not allow `privilegeEscalation`.

[id="newly_installed_{context}"]
== Newly installed cluster

For newly installed {product-title} 4.11 or later clusters, the `restricted-v2` replaces the `restricted` SCC as an SCC that is available to be used by any authenticated user. A workload with `privilegeEscalation: true`, is not admitted into the cluster since `restricted-v2` is the only SCC available for authenticated users by default.

The feature `privilegeEscalation` is allowed by `restricted` but not by `restricted-v2`. More features are denied by `restricted-v2` than were allowed by `restricted` SCC.

A workload with `privilegeEscalation: true` may be admitted into a newly installed {product-title} 4.11 or later cluster. To give access to the `restricted` SCC to the ServiceAccount running the workload (or any other SCC that can admit this workload) using a RoleBinding run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <workload-namespace> adm policy add-scc-to-user <scc-name> -z <serviceaccount_name>
----

In {product-title} {product-version} the ability to add the pod annotations `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: runtime/default` and `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/<container_name>: runtime/default` is deprecated.
