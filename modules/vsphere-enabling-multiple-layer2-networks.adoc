= Enabling a multiple layer 2 network for your cluster

You can configure your cluster to use a multiple layer 2 network configuration so that data transfer among nodes can span across multiple networks.

.Prerequisites
* You configured network connectivity among machines so that cluster components can communicate with each other.

.Procedure
* If you installed your cluster with installer-provisioned infrastructure, you must ensure that all control plane nodes share a common layer 2 network. Additionally, ensure compute nodes that are configured for Ingress pod scheduling share a common layer 2 network.

** If you need compute nodes to span multiple layer 2 networks, you can create infrastructure nodes that can host Ingress pods.
** If you need to provision workloads across additional layer 2 networks, you can create compute machine sets on vSphere and then move these workloads to your target layer 2 networks.

* If you installed your cluster on infrastructure that you provided, which is defined as a user-provisioned infrastructure, complete the following actions to meet your needs:
** Configure your API load balancer and network so that the load balancer can reach the API and Machine Config Server on the control plane nodes.
** Configure your Ingress load balancer and network so that the load balancer can reach the Ingress pods on the compute or infrastructure nodes.
