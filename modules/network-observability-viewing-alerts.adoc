= Viewing health information

You can access metrics about health and resource usage of the Network Observability Operator from the *Dashboards* page in the web console. A health alert banner that directs you to the dashboard can appear on the *Network Traffic* and *Home* pages in the event that an alert is triggered. Alerts are generated in the following cases:

* The `NetObservLokiError` alert occurs if the `flowlogs-pipeline` workload is dropping flows because of Loki errors, such as if the Loki ingestion rate limit has been reached.
* The `NetObservNoFlows` alert occurs if no flows are ingested for a certain amount of time.

.Prerequisites

* You have the Network Observability Operator installed.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role or with view permissions for all projects.

.Procedure

. From the *Administrator* perspective in the web console, navigate to *Observe* â†’ *Dashboards*.
. From the *Dashboards* dropdown, select *Netobserv/Health*.
Metrics about the health of the Operator are displayed on the page.
