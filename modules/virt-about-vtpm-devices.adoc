= About vTPM devices

A virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device functions like a
physical Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware chip.
You can use a vTPM device with any operating system, but Windows 11 requires
the presence of a TPM chip to install or boot. A vTPM device allows VMs created
from a Windows 11 image to function without a physical TPM chip.

A vTPM device also protects virtual machines by storing secrets without physical hardware. {VirtProductName} supports persisting vTPM device state by using Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for VMs. You must specify the storage class to be used by the PVC by setting the `vmStateStorageClass` attribute in the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR):

[source,yaml]
----
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
spec:
  vmStateStorageClass: <storage_class_name>

# ...
----

If you do not enable vTPM, then the VM does not recognize a TPM device, even if
the node has one.
