= About the oc-mirror plugin for creating a mirror registry

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the oc-mirror {oc-first} plugin with {microshift-short} to filter and prune Operator catalogs. You can also use Operators in disconnected settings or embedded in {op-system-ostree-first} images.

You can then mirror the filtered catalog contents to a mirror registry or use the container images in disconnected or offline deployments with {op-system-ostree}.

[NOTE]
====
{microshift-short} uses the generally available version, v1, of the oc-mirror plugin. Do not use the following procedures with the Technical Preview versio, v2, of oc-mirror plugin.
====

You can mirror the container images required by the desired Operators locally or to a container mirror registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/[Docker v2-2], such as {quay}. The procedure to mirror content from Red Hat-hosted registries connected to the internet to a disconnected image registry is the same, independent of the registry you choose. After you mirror the contents of your catalog, configure each cluster to retrieve this content from your mirror registry.
