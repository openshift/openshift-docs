= About the oc-mirror plugin for creating a mirror registry

You can use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin with {microshift-short} to filter and prune Operator catalogs. You can then mirror the filtered catalog contents to a mirror registry or use the container images in disconnected or offline deployments with {op-system-ostree}.

[NOTE]
====
{microshift-short} uses the generally available version (1) of the oc-mirror plugin. Do not use the following procedures with the Technical Preview version (2) of oc-mirror plugin.
====

You can mirror the container images required by the desired Operators locally or to a container mirror registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/[Docker v2-2], such as Red Hat Quay. The procedure to mirror content from Red Hat-hosted registries connected to the internet to a disconnected image registry is the same, independent of the registry you choose. After you mirror the contents of your catalog, configure each cluster to retrieve this content from your mirror registry.

[id="microshift-populate-mirror-registry-connectivity_{context}"]
== Connectivity considerations when populating a mirror registry

When you populate your registry, you can use one of following connectivity scenarios:

Connected mirroring::
If you have a host that can access both the internet and your mirror registry, but not your cluster node, you can directly mirror the content from that machine.

Disconnected mirroring::
If you do not have a host that can access both the internet and your mirror registry, you must mirror the images to a file system and then bring that host or removable media into your disconnected environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A container registry must be reachable by every machine in the clusters that you provision. Installing, updating, and other operations, such as relocating workloads, might fail if the registry is unreachable.
====

To avoid problems caused by an unreachable registry, use the following standard practices:

* Run mirror registries in a highly available way.
* Ensure that the mirror registry at least matches the production availability of your clusters.
