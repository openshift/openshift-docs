= OVN-Kubernetes limitations

The OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) cluster network provider has the following limitations:

* The `sessionAffinityConfig.clientIP.timeoutSeconds` service has no effect in an OpenShift OVN environment, but does in an OpenShift SDN environment. This incompatibility can make it difficult for users to migrate from OpenShift SDN to OVN.

// The foll limitation is also recorded in the installation section.
* For clusters configured for dual-stack networking, both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic must use the same network interface as the default gateway.
If this requirement is not met, pods on the host in the `ovnkube-node` daemon set enter the `CrashLoopBackOff` state.
If you display a pod with a command such as `oc get pod -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes -l app=ovnkube-node -o yaml`, the `status` field contains more than one message about the default gateway, as shown in the following output:

The only resolution is to reconfigure the host networking so that both IP families use the same network interface for the default gateway.

* For clusters configured for dual-stack networking, both the IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables must contain the default gateway.
