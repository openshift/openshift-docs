= OVN-Kubernetes IPv6 and dual-stack limitations

The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin has the following limitations:

// The foll limitation is also recorded in the installation section.
* For clusters configured for dual-stack networking, both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic must use the same network interface as the default gateway.
If this requirement is not met, pods on the host in the `ovnkube-node` daemon set enter the `CrashLoopBackOff` state.
If you display a pod with a command such as `oc get pod -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes -l app=ovnkube-node -o yaml`, the `status` field contains more than one message about the default gateway, as shown in the following output:

[source,terminal]

The only resolution is to reconfigure the host networking so that both IP families use the same network interface for the default gateway.

* For clusters configured for dual-stack networking, both the IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables must contain the default gateway.
