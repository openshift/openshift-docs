= OVN-Kubernetes limitations

The OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) cluster network provider has the following limitations:

* OVN-Kubernetes does not support setting the external traffic policy or internal traffic policy for a Kubernetes service to `local`.
The default value, `cluster`, is supported for both parameters.
This limitation can affect you when you add a service of type `LoadBalancer`, `NodePort`, or add a service with an external IP.

// The foll limitation is also recorded in the installation section.
* For clusters configured for dual-stack networking, both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic must use the same network interface as the default gateway.
If this requirement is not met, pods on the host in the `ovnkube-node` daemon set enter the `CrashLoopBackOff` state.
If you display a pod with a command like `oc get pod -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes -l app=ovnkube-node -o yaml`, the `status` field contains more than one message about the default gateway, as shown in the following output:

The only resolution is to reconfigure the host networking so that both IP families use the same network interface for the default gateway.
