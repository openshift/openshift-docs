= Using a PingSource with YAML

The following sections describe how to create, verify and remove a basic PingSource using YAML files.

.Prerequisites

* You have Knative Serving and Eventing installed.

[NOTE]
====
The following procedure requires you to create YAML files.

If you change the names of the YAML files from those used in the examples, you must ensure that you also update the corresponding CLI commands.
====

.Procedure

. To verify that the PingSource is working, create a simple Knative
service that dumps incoming messages to the service's logs.
.. Copy the example YAML into a file named `service.yaml`:
+

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:latest
----

.. Create the service:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply --filename service.yaml
----

. For each set of ping events that you want to request, create a PingSource in the same namespace as the event consumer.
.. Copy the example YAML into a file named `ping-source.yaml`:
+

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha2
kind: PingSource
metadata:
  name: test-ping-source
spec:
  schedule: "*/2 * * * *"
  jsonData: '{"message": "Hello world!"}'
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
----

.. Create the PingSource:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply --filename ping-source.yaml
----

. Check that the controller is mapped correctly by entering the following command:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pingsource.sources.knative.dev test-ping-source -oyaml
----

+
.Example output
+

[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha2
kind: PingSource

spec:
  jsonData: '{ value: "hello" }'
  schedule: '*/2 * * * *'
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
      namespace: default
----

.Verfication steps

You can verify that the Kubernetes events were sent to the Knative event sink by looking at the sink pod's logs.

By default, Knative services terminate their pods if no traffic is received within a 60 second period.
The example shown in this guide creates a PingSource that sends a message every 2 minutes, so each message should be observed in a newly created pod.

. Watch for new pods created:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ watch oc get pods
----

. Cancel watching the pods using Ctrl+C, then look at the logs of the created pod:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs $(oc get pod -o name | grep event-display) -c user-container
----

+
.Example output

== Remove the PingSource

. Delete the service by entering the following command:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete --filename service.yaml
----

. Delete the PingSource by entering the following command:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete --filename ping-source.yaml
