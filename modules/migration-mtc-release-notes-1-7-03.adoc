== Resolved issues

This release has the following major resolved issues:

.Correct DNS validation for destination namespace
In previous releases, the MigPlan could not  be validated if the destination namespace started with a non-alphabetic character. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102231[*BZ#2102231*])

.Deselecting all PVCs from UI still results in an attempted PVC transfer
In previous releases, while doing a full migration, unselecting the persistent volume claims (PVCs) would not skip selecting the PVCs and still try to migrate them. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2106073[*BZ#2106073*])

.Incorrect DNS validation for destination namespace
In previous releases, MigPlan could not be validated because the destination namespace started with a non-alphabetic character. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102231[*BZ#2102231*])
