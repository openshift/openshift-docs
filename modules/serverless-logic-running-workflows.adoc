= Running a workflow locally

You can use the `run` command with `kn workflow` to build and run your {ServerlessLogicProductName} workflow project in your current directory.


.Prerequisites

* You have installed Podman on your local machine.
* You have installed the {ServerlessLogicProductName} `kn-workflow` CLI plugin.
* You have created an {ServerlessLogicProductName} workflow project.

.Procedure

. From the directory where you created your {ServerlessLogicProductName} project, move to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd ./<your-project-name>
----

. Run the following command to build and run your {ServerlessLogicProductName} workflow project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn workflow run
----
+
When the project is ready, the Development UI automatically opens in your browser at `localhost:8080/q/dev-ui` and you will find the *Serverless Workflow Tools* tile available. Alternatively, you can access the tool directly using `http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui/org.apache.kie.sonataflow.sonataflow-quarkus-devui/workflows`.

[NOTE]
====
You can execute a workflow locally using a container that runs on your machine. Stop the container with Ctrl+C.
