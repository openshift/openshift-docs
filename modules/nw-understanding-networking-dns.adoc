= The Domain Name System (DNS)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to translate human-friendly domain names, such as www.example.com, into IP addresses that identify computers on a network. DNS plays a crucial role in service discovery and name resolution.

{product-title} provides a built-in DNS to ensure that services can be reached by their DNS names. This helps maintain stable communication even if the underlying IP addresses change. When you start a pod, environment variables for service names, IP addresses, and ports are created automatically to enable the pod to communicate with other services.
