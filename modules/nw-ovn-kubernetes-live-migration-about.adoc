= Limited live migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin overview

The limited live migration method is the process in which the OpenShift SDN network plugin and its network configurations, connections, and associated resources, are migrated to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin without service interruption. It is available for {product-title}, {product-dedicated}, {product-rosa}, and Azure Red Hat OpenShift deployment types. It is not available for HyperShift deployment types. This migration method is valuable for deployment types that require constant service availability and offers the following benefits:

* Continuous service availability
* Minimized downtime
* Automatic node rebooting
* Seamless transition from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin

Although a rollback procedure is provided, the limited live migration is intended to be a one-way process.

== Considerations for limited live migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin

Before using the limited live migration method to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, cluster administrators should consider the following information:

* The limited live migration procedure is unsupported for clusters with OpenShift SDN multitenant mode enabled. 

* Egress router pods block the limited live migration process. They must be removed before beginning the limited live migration process.

* During the limited live migration, multicast, egress IP addresses, and egress firewalls are temporarily disabled. They can be migrated from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes after the limited live migration process has finished.

* The migration is intended to be a one-way process. However, for users that want to rollback to OpenShift-SDN, migration from OpenShift-SDN to OVN-Kubernetes must have succeeded. Users can follow the same procedure below to migrate to the OpenShift SDN network plugin from the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.

* The limited live migration is not supported on HyperShift clusters.

* OpenShift SDN does not support IPsec. After the migration, cluster administrators can enable IPsec.

* OpenShift SDN does not support IPv6. After the migration, cluster administrators can enable dual-stack.

* The cluster MTU is the MTU value for pod interfaces. It is always less than your hardware MTU to account for the cluster network overlay overhead. The overhead is 100 bytes for OVN-Kubernetes and 50 bytes for OpenShift SDN.
+
During the limited live migration, both OVN-Kubernetes and OpenShift SDN run in parallel. OVN-Kubernetes manages the cluster network of some nodes, while OpenShift SDN manages the cluster network of others. To ensure that cross-CNI traffic remains functional, the Cluster Network Operator updates the routable MTU to ensure that both CNIs share the same overlay MTU. As a result, after the migration has completed, the cluster MTU is 50 bytes less.

* Some parameters of OVN-Kubernetes cannot be changed after installation. The following parameters can be set only before starting the limited live migration:

** `InternalTransitSwitchSubnet`
** `internalJoinSubnet`

* OVN-Kubernetes reserves the `100.64.0.0/16` and `100.88.0.0/16` IP address ranges. If OpenShift SDN has been configured to use either of these IP address ranges, you must patch them to use a different IP address range before starting the limited live migration.

** `100.64.0.0/16`. This IP address range is used for the `internalJoinSubnet` parameter of OVN-Kubernetes by default. If this IP address range is already in use, enter the following command to update it to a different range, for example, `100.63.0.0/16`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' -p='{"spec":{"defaultNetwork":{"ovnKubernetesConfig":{"ipv4":{"internalJoinSubnet": "100.63.0.0/16"}}}}}'
----
** `100.88.0.0/16`. This IP address range is used for the `internalTransSwitchSubnet` parameter of OVN-Kubernetes by default. If this IP address range is already in use, enter the following command to update it to a different range, for example, `100.99.0.0/16`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' -p='{"spec":{"defaultNetwork":{"ovnKubernetesConfig":{"ipv4":{"internalTransitSwitchSubnet": "100.99.0.0/16"}}}}}'
----

* In most cases, the limited live migration is independent of the secondary interfaces of pods created by the Multus CNI plugin. However, if these secondary interfaces were set up on the default network interface controller (NIC) of the host, for example, using MACVLAN, IPVLAN, SR-IOV, or bridge interfaces with the default NIC as the control node, OVN-Kubernetes might encounter malfunctions. Users should remove such configurations before proceeding with the limited live migration.

* When there are multiple NICs inside of the host, and the default route is not on the interface that has the Kubernetes NodeIP, you must use the offline migration instead.

* All `DaemonSet` objects in the `openshift-sdn` namespace, which are not managed by the Cluster Network Operator (CNO), must be removed before initiating the limited live migration. These unmanaged daemon sets can cause the migration status to remain incomplete if not properly handled.
