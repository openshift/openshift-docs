[id="distributed-tracing-architecture_{context}"]
= {DTProductName} architecture

{DTProductName} is made up of several components that work together to collect, store, and display tracing data.

* *Client* (Jaeger client, Tracer, Reporter, instrumented application, client libraries)- The {JaegerShortName} clients are language-specific implementations of the OpenTracing API. They can be used to instrument applications for distributed tracing either manually or with a variety of existing open source frameworks, such as Camel (Fuse), Spring Boot (RHOAR), MicroProfile (RHOAR/Thorntail), Wildfly (EAP), and many more, that are already integrated with OpenTracing.

* *Agent* (Jaeger agent, Server Queue, Processor Workers) - The {JaegerShortName} agent is a network daemon that listens for spans sent over User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which it batches and sends to the Collector. The agent is meant to be placed on the same host as the instrumented application. This is typically accomplished by having a sidecar in container environments such as Kubernetes.

* *Collector* (Jaeger Collector, Queue, Workers) - Similar to the agent, the Collector receives spans and places them in an internal queue for processing. This allows the Collector to return immediately to the client/agent instead of waiting for the span to make its way to the storage.

* *Storage* (Data Store) - Collectors require a persistent storage backend. {JaegerName} has a pluggable mechanism for span storage. Note that for this release, the only supported storage is Elasticsearch.

* *Query* (Query Service) - Query is a service that retrieves traces from storage.

* *Ingester* (Ingester Service) - {DTProductName} can use Apache Kafka as a buffer between the Collector and the actual Elasticsearch backing storage. Ingester is a service that reads data from Kafka and writes to the Elasticsearch storage backend.

* *Jaeger Console* – With the {JaegerName} user interface, you can visualize your distributed tracing data. On the Search page, you can find traces and explore details of the spans that make up an individual trace.
