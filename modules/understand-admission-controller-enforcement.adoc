= Understanding admission controller enforcement

If you intend to use admission controller enforcement, consider the following:

* *API latency*: Using admission controller enforcement increases Kubernetes or {ocp} API latency because it involves additional API validation requests.
Many standard Kubernetes libraries, such as fabric8, have short Kubernetes or {ocp} API timeouts by default.
Also, consider API timeouts in any custom automation you might be using. If a request does time out due to latency issues, the admission controller will _fail open_, or allow the request to reach the API server.
* *Image scanning*: You can choose whether the admission controller scans images while reviewing requests by setting the *Contact Image Scanners* option in the cluster configuration panel.
** If you enable this setting, {product-title} contacts the image scanners if the scan or image signature verification results are not already available, which adds considerable latency.
** If you disable this setting, the enforcement decision only considers image scan criteria if cached scan and signature verification results are available.
* You can use admission controller enforcement for:
** Options in the pod `securityContext`.
** Deployment configurations.
** Image components and vulnerabilities.
* You cannot use admission controller enforcement for:
** Any runtime behavior, such as processes.
** Any policies based on port exposure.
* The admission controller might fail if there are connectivity issues between the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server and {product-title-short} Sensor.
To resolve this issue, delete the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` object as described in the disabling admission controller enforcement section.

* If you have deploy-time enforcement enabled for a policy and you enable the admission controller, {product-title-short} attempts to block deployments that violate the policy.
If a noncompliant deployment is not rejected by the admission controller, for example, in case of a timeout, {product-title-short} still applies other deploy-time enforcement mechanisms, such as scaling to zero replicas.
