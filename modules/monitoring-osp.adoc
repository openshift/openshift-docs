= Monitoring with {osp}

Monitoring with {osp} is enabled by default. No configuration is required for this default behavior.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have previously configured monitoring with the Prometheus Operator, consider removing your custom `ServiceMonitor` resources. {product-title-short} ships with a pre-configured `ServiceMonitor` for {osp} monitoring. Multiple `ServiceMonitors` might result in duplicated scraping.
====

Monitoring with {osp} is not supported by Scanner. If you want to monitor Scanner, you must first disable the default {osp} monitoring. Then, configure custom Prometheus monitoring.

For more information on disabling {osp} monitoring, see "Disabling {osp} monitoring for Central services by using the {product-title-short} Operator" or "Disabling {osp} monitoring for Central services by using Helm". For more information on configuring Prometheus, see "Monitoring with custom Prometheus".
