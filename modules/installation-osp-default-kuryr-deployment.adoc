= Resource guidelines for installing {product-title} on OpenStack with Kuryr

When using Kuryr SDN, the Pods, Services, namespaces, and network policies are
using resources from the {rh-openstack} quota; this increases the minimum
requirements. Kuryr also has some additional requirements on top of what a
default install requires.

Use the following quota to satisfy a default cluster's minimum requirements:

.Recommended resources for a default {product-title} cluster on {rh-openstack} with Kuryr

[options="header"]
|================================
|Resource              | Value
|Floating IP addresses | 3 - plus the expected number of Services of LoadBalancer type
|Ports                 | 1500 - 1 needed per Pod
|Routers               | 1
|Subnets               | 250 - 1 needed per Namespace/Project
|Networks              | 250 - 1 needed per Namespace/Project
|RAM                   | 112 GB
|vCPUs                 | 28
|Volume storage        | 175 GB
|Instances             | 7
|Security groups       | 250 - 1 needed per Service and per NetworkPolicy
|Security group rules  | 1000
|Swift containers      | 2
|Swift objects         | 1
|Swift available space | 10 MB or more
|================================

A cluster might function with fewer than recommended resources, but its
performance is not guaranteed.

Take the following notes into consideration when setting resources:

* The number of ports required is actually larger than the number of Pods. Kuryr
uses ports pools to have pre-created ports ready to be used by Pods and speed up
the Pods booting time.

* Each NetworkPolicy is mapped into an {rh-openstack} security group, and
depending on the NetworkPolicy spec, one or more rules are added to the
security group.

* Each Service is mapped into an {rh-openstack} load balancer. Each load balancer
has a security group with the user project; therefore, it must be taken into
account when estimating the number of security groups required for the quota.

* Swift space requirements vary depending on the size of the bootstrap Ignition
file and image registry.

* Although the quota does not account for load balancer VM resources, they must be
considered when deciding the OpenStack deployment size.

An {product-title} deployment comprises control plane machines, compute
machines, and a bootstrap machine.

To enable Kuryr SDN, your environment must meet the following requirements:

* Run OpenStack 13+.
* Have Overcloud with Octavia.
* Use Neutron Trunk ports extension.
* Use `openvswitch` firewall driver if ML2/OVS Neutron driver is used instead
of `ovs-hybrid`.
