= Resource guidelines for installing {product-title} on OpenStack with Kuryr

When using Kuryr SDN, the Pods, Services, namespaces, and network policies are
using resources from the {rh-openstack} quota; this increases the minimum
requirements. Kuryr also has some additional requirements on top of what a
default install requires.

Use the following quota to satisfy a default cluster's minimum requirements:

[options="header"]
|==============================================================================================
|Resource                | Value
|Floating IP addresses   | 3 - plus the expected number of Services of LoadBalancer type
|Ports                   | 1500 - 1 needed per Pod
|Routers                 | 1
|Subnets                 | 250 - 1 needed per Namespace/Project
|Networks                | 250 - 1 needed per Namespace/Project
|RAM                     | 112 GB
|vCPUs                   | 28
|Volume storage          | 275 GB
|Instances               | 7
|Security groups         | 250 - 1 needed per Service and per NetworkPolicy
|Security group rules    | 1000
|Load balancers          | 100 - 1 needed per Service
|Load balancer listeners | 500 - 1 needed per Service-exposed port
|Load balancer pools     | 500 - 1 needed per Service-exposed port

A cluster might function with fewer than recommended resources, but its performance is not guaranteed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) is available and operated by a user account with the `swiftoperator` role, it is used as the default backend for the {product-title} image registry. In this case, the volume storage requirement is 175 GB. Swift space requirements vary depending on the size of the image registry.

A cluster might function with fewer than recommended resources, but its
performance is not guaranteed.

Take the following notes into consideration when setting resources:

* The number of ports required is actually larger than the number of Pods. Kuryr
uses ports pools to have pre-created ports ready to be used by Pods and speed up
the Pods booting time.

* Each NetworkPolicy is mapped into an {rh-openstack} security group, and
depending on the NetworkPolicy spec, one or more rules are added to the
security group.

* Each Service is mapped into an {rh-openstack} load balancer. Each load balancer
has a security group with the user project; therefore, it must be taken into
account when estimating the number of security groups required for the quota.

* Swift space requirements vary depending on the size of the bootstrap Ignition
file and image registry.

* The quota does not account for load balancer resources (such as VM
resources), but you must consider these resources when you decide the
{rh-openstack} deployment's size. The default installation will have more than
50 load balancers; the clusters must be able to accommodate them.


An {product-title} deployment comprises control plane machines, compute
machines, and a bootstrap machine.

To enable Kuryr SDN, your environment must meet the following requirements:

* Run OpenStack 13+.
* Have Overcloud with Octavia.
* Use Neutron Trunk ports extension.
* Use `openvswitch` firewall driver if ML2/OVS Neutron driver is used instead
of `ovs-hybrid`.
