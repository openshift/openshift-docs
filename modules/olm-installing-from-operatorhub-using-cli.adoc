[id="olm-installing-operator-from-operatorhub-using-cli_{context}"]
= Installing from OperatorHub by using the CLI

Instead of using the {product-title} web console, you can install an Operator from OperatorHub by using the CLI. Use the `oc` command to create or update a `Subscription` object.

For `SingleNamespace` install mode, you must also ensure an appropriate Operator group exists in the related namespace. An Operator group, defined by an `OperatorGroup` object, selects target namespaces in which to generate required RBAC access for all Operators in the same namespace as the Operator group.

[TIP]
====
In most cases, the web console method of this procedure is preferred because it automates tasks in the background, such as handling the creation of `OperatorGroup` and `Subscription` objects automatically when choosing `SingleNamespace` mode.
====

.Prerequisites

ifndef::olm-user[]
- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
`cluster-admin` permissions.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
the `dedicated-admin` role.
endif::[]
endif::[]

ifdef::olm-user[]
- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with Operator installation permissions.
endif::[]

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

[TIP]
====
You can print an Operator's version and channel information in YAML format by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get packagemanifests <operator_name> -n <catalog_namespace> -o yaml
----
====

** If more than one catalog is installed in a namespace, run the following command to look up the available versions and channels of an Operator from a specific catalog:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get packagemanifest \
   --selector=catalog=<catalogsource_name> \
   --field-selector metadata.name=<operator_name> \
   -n <catalog_namespace> -o yaml
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not specify the Operator's catalog, running the `oc get packagemanifest` and `oc describe packagemanifest` commands might return a package from an unexpected catalog if the following conditions are met:

* Multiple catalogs are installed in the same namespace.
* The catalogs contain the same Operators or Operators with the same name.
====

. If the Operator you intend to install supports the `AllNamespaces` install mode, and you choose to use this mode, skip this step, because the `openshift-operators` namespace already has an appropriate Operator group in place by default, called `global-operators`.
+
If the Operator you intend to install supports the `SingleNamespace` install mode, and you choose to use this mode, you must ensure an appropriate Operator group exists in the related namespace. If one does not exist, you can create create one by following these steps:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only have one Operator group per namespace. For more information, see "Operator groups".
====

.. Create an `OperatorGroup` object YAML file, for example `operatorgroup.yaml`, for `SingleNamespace` install mode:
+

----
<1> For `SingleNamespace` install mode, use the same `<namespace>` value for both the `metadata.namespace` and `spec.targetNamespaces` fields.

.. Create the `OperatorGroup` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f operatorgroup.yaml
----

. Create a `Subscription` object to subscribe a namespace to an Operator:

.. Create a YAML file for the `Subscription` object, for example `subscription.yaml`:
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to subscribe to a specific version of an Operator, set the `startingCSV` field to the desired version and set the `installPlanApproval` field to `Manual` to prevent the Operator from automatically upgrading if a later version exists in the catalog. For details, see the following "Example `Subscription` object with a specific starting Operator version".

.. For clusters on cloud providers with token authentication enabled, such as {aws-first} {sts-first}, {entra-first}, or {gcp-wid-first}, configure your `Subscription` object by following these steps:

`<service_account_email>`:: The `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` value is a {gcp-short} service account email that is impersonated during Operator operation, for example:
+
[source,text]
----
<service_account_name>@<project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
----
====
--

.. Create the `Subscription` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f subscription.yaml
----

. If you set the `installPlanApproval` field to `Manual`, manually approve the pending install plan to complete the Operator installation. For more information, see "Manually approving a pending Operator update".

At this point, OLM is now aware of the selected Operator. A cluster service version (CSV) for the Operator should appear in the target namespace, and APIs provided by the Operator should be available for creation.

.Verification

. Check the status of the `Subscription` object for your installed Operator by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe subscription <subscription_name> -n <namespace>
----

. If you created an Operator group for `SingleNamespace` install mode, check the status of the `OperatorGroup` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe operatorgroup <operatorgroup_name> -n <namespace>
