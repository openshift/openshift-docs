= Creating a route for Ingress Controller sharding

A route allows you to host your application at a URL. In this case, the hostname is not set and the route uses a subdomain instead. When you specify a subdomain, you automatically use the domain of the Ingress Controller that exposes the route. For situations where a route is exposed by multiple Ingress Controllers, the route is hosted at multiple URLs.

The following procedure describes how to create a route for Ingress Controller sharding, using the `hello-openshift` application as an example.

Ingress Controller sharding is useful when balancing incoming traffic load among a set of Ingress Controllers and when isolating traffic to a specific Ingress Controller. For example, company A goes to one Ingress Controller and company B to another.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in as a project administrator.
* You have a web application that exposes a port and an HTTP or TLS endpoint listening for traffic on the port.
* You have configured the Ingress Controller for sharding.

.Procedure

. Create a project called `hello-openshift` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project hello-openshift
----

. Create a pod in the project by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/hello-openshift/hello-pod.json
----

. Create a service called `hello-openshift` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose pod/hello-openshift
----

. Create a route definition called `hello-openshift-route.yaml`:
+
.YAML definition of the created route for sharding:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  labels:
    type: sharded <1>
  name: hello-openshift-edge
  namespace: hello-openshift
spec:
  subdomain: hello-openshift <2>
  tls:
    termination: edge
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: hello-openshift
----
<1> Both the label key and its corresponding label value must match the ones specified in the Ingress Controller. In this example, the Ingress Controller has the label key and value `type: sharded`.
<2> The route will be exposed using the value of the `subdomain` field. When you specify the `subdomain` field, you must leave the hostname unset. If you specify both the `host` and `subdomain` fields, then the route will use the value of the `host` field, and ignore the `subdomain` field.

. Use `hello-openshift-route.yaml` to create a route to the `hello-openshift` application by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n hello-openshift create -f hello-openshift-route.yaml
----

.Verification
* Get the status of the route with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n hello-openshift get routes/hello-openshift-edge -o yaml
----
+
The resulting `Route` resource should look similar to the following:
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  labels:
    type: sharded
  name: hello-openshift-edge
  namespace: hello-openshift
spec:
  subdomain: hello-openshift
  tls:
    termination: edge
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: hello-openshift
status:
  ingress:
  - host: hello-openshift.<apps-sharded.basedomain.example.net> <1>
    routerCanonicalHostname: router-sharded.<apps-sharded.basedomain.example.net> <2>
    routerName: sharded <3>
----
<1> The hostname the Ingress Controller, or router, uses to expose the route. The value of the `host` field is automatically determined by the Ingress Controller, and uses its domain. In this example, the domain of the Ingress Controller is `<apps-sharded.basedomain.example.net>`.
<2> The hostname of the Ingress Controller.
<3> The name of the Ingress Controller. In this example, the Ingress Controller has the name `sharded`.
