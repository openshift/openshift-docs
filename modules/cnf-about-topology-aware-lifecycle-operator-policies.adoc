= About managed policies used with Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator

TALO uses {rh-rhacm} policies for cluster updates.

You can deploy managed policies with TALO that meet the following requirements:

* The policy is for an Operator subscription or platform update.
* The `remediationAction` of the policy is in `inform` mode.

For more information about managed policies, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html-single/governance/index#policy-overview[Policy Overview] in the {rh-rhacm} documentation.

TALO supports the use of both user-defined custom resources (CR) and the `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resource definition (CRD). 

For more information about the `PolicyGenTempalte` CRD, see The PolicyGenTemplate section in Deploying distributed units at scale in a disconnected environment.
