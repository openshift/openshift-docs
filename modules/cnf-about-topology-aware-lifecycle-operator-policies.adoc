= About managed policies used with Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator

TALO uses {rh-rhacm} policies for cluster updates.

TALO can be used to manage the rollout of any policy CR where the `remediationAction` is set to `inform`. For policies that update an Operator subscription with manual approval, TALO provides additional functionality that approves the installation of the updated Operator.

For more information about managed policies, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html-single/governance/index#policy-overview[Policy Overview] in the {rh-rhacm} documentation.

TALO can be used to manage the rollout of any `inform` policy CR regardless of how that CR was created. Supported use cases include manual user creation of policy CRs or those created with automated tool generating policies from the `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resource definition (CRD).

For more information about the `PolicyGenTempalte` CRD, see The PolicyGenTemplate section in Deploying distributed units at scale in a disconnected environment.
