= Prerequisites for OpenStack

Before you create a hosted cluster on {rh-openstack-first}, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

* You have administrative access to a management {product-title} cluster version 4.17 or greater. This cluster can run on bare metal, {rh-openstack}, or a supported public cloud.
* The HyperShift Operator is installed on the management cluster as specified in "Preparing to deploy hosted control planes".
* The management cluster is configured with OVN-Kubernetes as the default pod network CNI.
* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) and hosted control planes CLI, `hcp` are installed.
* A load-balancer backend, for example, Octavia, is installed on the management OCP cluster. The load balancer is required for the `kube-api` service to be created for each hosted cluster.
** When ingress is configured with an Octavia load balance, the {rh-openstack} Octavia service is running in the cloud that hosts the guest cluster.
* A valid link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/platform-agnostic/user-provisioned[pull secret] file is present for the `quay.io/openshift-release-dev` repository.
* The default external network for the management cluster is reachable from the guest cluster. The `kube-apiserver` load-balancer type service is created on this network.
* If you use a pre-defined floating IP address for ingress, you created a DNS record that points to it for the following wildcard domain: `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, where:
** `<cluster_name>` is the name of the management cluster.
** `<base_domain>` is the parent DNS domain under which your clusterâ€™s applications live.
