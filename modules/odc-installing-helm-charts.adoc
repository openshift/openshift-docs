. In the *Install Helm Chart* page:
.. Enter a unique name for the release in the *Release Name* field.
.. Optionally, in the YAML editor, modify the YAML file.
. Click *Install* to create a Helm release. You will be redirected to the *Topology* view where the release is displayed. If the Helm chart has release notes, the chart is pre-selected and the right panel displays the release notes for that release.

If required, you can now use the *Actions* button on the side panel or right-click the Helm release to upgrade, rollback, or uninstall the Helm release.
