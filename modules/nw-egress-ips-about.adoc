= Egress IP address architectural design and implementation

The {product-title} egress IP address functionality allows you to ensure that the traffic from one or more pods in one or more namespaces has a consistent source IP address for services outside the cluster network.

For example, you might have a pod that periodically queries a database that is hosted on a server outside of your cluster. To enforce access requirements for the server, a packet filtering device is configured to allow traffic only from specific IP addresses.
To ensure that you can reliably allow access to the server from only that specific pod, you can configure a specific egress IP address for the pod that makes the requests to the server.

An egress IP address is implemented as an additional IP address on the primary network interface of a node and must be in the same subnet as the primary IP address of the node. The additional IP address must not be assigned to any other node in the cluster.

== Assignment of egress IPs to pods

To assign one or more egress IPs to a namespace or specific pods in a namespace, the following conditions must be satisfied:

- At least one node in your cluster must have the `k8s.ovn.org/egress-assignable: ""` label.
- An `EgressIP` object exists that defines one or more egress IP addresses to use as the source IP address for traffic leaving the cluster from pods in a namespace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you create `EgressIP` objects prior to labeling any nodes in your cluster for egress IP assignment, {product-title} might assign every egress IP address to the first node with the `k8s.ovn.org/egress-assignable: ""` label.

To ensure that egress IP addresses are widely distributed across nodes in the cluster, always apply the label to the nodes you intent to host the egress IP addresses before creating any `EgressIP` objects.
====

[id="nw-egress-ips-node-assignment_{context}"]
== Assignment of egress IPs to nodes

When creating an `EgressIP` object, the following conditions apply to nodes that are labeled with the `k8s.ovn.org/egress-assignable: ""` label:

- An egress IP address is never assigned to more than one node at a time.
- An egress IP address is equally balanced between available nodes that can host the egress IP address.
- If the `spec.EgressIPs` array in an `EgressIP` object specifies more than one IP address, the following conditions apply:
* No node will ever host more than one of the specified IP addresses.
* Traffic is balanced roughly equally between the specified IP addresses for a given namespace.
- If a node becomes unavailable, any egress IP addresses assigned to it are automatically reassigned, subject to the previously described conditions.

When a pod matches the selector for multiple `EgressIP` objects, there is no guarantee which of the egress IP addresses that are specified in the `EgressIP` objects is assigned as the egress IP address for the pod.

== Architectural diagram of an egress IP address configuration

The following diagram depicts an egress IP address configuration. The diagram describes four pods in two different namespaces running on three nodes in a cluster. The nodes are assigned IP addresses from the `192.168.126.0/18` CIDR block on the host network.

// Source: https://github.com/redhataccess/documentation-svg-assets/blob/master/for-web/121_OpenShift/121_OpenShift_engress_IP_Topology_1020.svg
image::nw-egress-ips-diagram.svg[Architectural diagram for the egress IP feature.]

Both Node 1 and Node 3 are labeled with `k8s.ovn.org/egress-assignable: ""` and thus available for the assignment of egress IP addresses.

The dashed lines in the diagram depict the traffic flow from pod1, pod2, and pod3 traveling through the pod network to egress the cluster from Node 1 and Node 3. When an external service receives traffic from any of the pods selected by the example `EgressIP` object, the source IP address is either `192.168.126.10` or `192.168.126.102`. The traffic is balanced roughly equally between these two nodes.

The following resources from the diagram are illustrated in detail:

`Namespace` objects::
+
--
The namespaces are defined in the following manifest:

.Namespace objects
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: namespace1
  labels:
    env: prod
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: namespace2
  labels:
    env: prod
----
--

`EgressIP` object::
+
--
The following `EgressIP` object describes a configuration that selects all pods in any namespace with the `env` label set to `prod`. The egress IP addresses for the selected pods are `192.168.126.10` and `192.168.126.102`.

.`EgressIP` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: EgressIP
metadata:
  name: egressips-prod
spec:
  egressIPs:
  - 192.168.126.10
  - 192.168.126.102
  namespaceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      env: prod

  assignments:
  - node: node1
    egressIP: 192.168.126.10
  - node: node3
    egressIP: 192.168.126.102
----

For the configuration in the previous example, {product-title} assigns both egress IP addresses to the available nodes. The `status` field reflects whether and where the egress IP addresses are assigned.

= Egress IP address assignment for project egress traffic

By configuring an egress IP address for a project, all outgoing external connections from the specified project will share the same, fixed source IP address.
External resources can recognize traffic from a particular project based on the egress IP address.
An egress IP address assigned to a project is different from the egress router, which is used to send traffic to specific destinations.

Egress IP addresses are implemented as additional IP addresses on the primary network interface of the node and must be in the same subnet as the node's primary IP address.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Egress IP addresses must not be configured in any Linux network configuration files, such as `ifcfg-eth0`.

Allowing additional IP addresses on the primary network interface might require extra configuration when using some cloud or VM solutions.
====

You can assign egress IP addresses to namespaces by setting the `egressIPs` parameter of the `NetNamespace` object. After an egress IP is associated with a project, OpenShift SDN allows you to assign egress IPs to hosts in two ways:

* In the _automatically assigned_ approach, an egress IP address range is assigned to a node.
* In the _manually assigned_ approach, a list of one or more egress IP address is assigned to a node.

Namespaces that request an egress IP address are matched with nodes that can host those egress IP addresses, and then the egress IP addresses are assigned to those nodes.
If the `egressIPs` parameter is set on a `NetNamespace` object, but no node hosts that egress IP address, then egress traffic from the namespace will be dropped.

High availability of nodes is automatic.
If a node that hosts an egress IP address is unreachable and there are nodes that are able to host that egress IP address, then the egress IP address will move to a new node.
When the unreachable node comes back online, the egress IP address automatically moves to balance egress IP addresses across nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following limitations apply when using egress IP addresses with the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider:

- You cannot use manually assigned and automatically assigned egress IP addresses on the same nodes.
- If you manually assign egress IP addresses from an IP address range, you must not make that range available for automatic IP assignment.
- You cannot share egress IP addresses across multiple namespaces using the OpenShift SDN egress IP address implementation.
ifeval::["{product-version}" >= "4.6"]
If you need to share IP addresses across namespaces, the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider egress IP address implementation allows you to span IP addresses across multiple namespaces.
endif::[]
====

[NOTE]
====
If you use OpenShift SDN in multitenant mode, you cannot use egress IP addresses with any namespace that is joined to another namespace by the projects that are associated with them.
For example, if `project1` and `project2` are joined by running the `oc adm pod-network join-projects --to=project1 project2` command, neither project can use an egress IP address. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1645577[BZ#1645577].

[id="considerations-automatic-egress-ips"]
== Considerations when using automatically assigned egress IP addresses

When using the automatic assignment approach for egress IP addresses the following considerations apply:

- You set the `egressCIDRs` parameter of each node's `HostSubnet` resource to indicate the range of egress IP addresses that can be hosted by a node.
{product-title} sets the `egressIPs` parameter of the `HostSubnet` resource based on the IP address range you specify.
ifeval::[{product-version} < 4.8]
- Only a single egress IP address per namespace is supported when using the automatic assignment mode.
endif::[]

If the node hosting the namespace's egress IP address is unreachable, {product-title} will reassign the egress IP address to another node with a compatible egress IP address range.
The automatic assignment approach works best for clusters installed in environments with flexibility in associating additional IP addresses with nodes.

[id="considerations-manual-egress-ips"]
== Considerations when using manually assigned egress IP addresses

This approach is recommended for clusters installed in public cloud environments, where there can be limitations on associating additional IP addresses with nodes.

When using the manual assignment approach for egress IP addresses the following considerations apply:

- You set the `egressIPs` parameter of each node's `HostSubnet` resource to indicate the IP addresses that can be hosted by a node.
- Multiple egress IP addresses per namespace are supported.

If a namespace has multiple egress IP addresses and those addresses are hosted on multiple nodes, the following additional considerations apply:

- If a pod is on a node that is hosting an egress IP address, that pod always uses the egress IP address on the node.
- If a pod is not on a node that is hosting an egress IP address, that pod uses an egress IP address at random.
