= Egress IP address assignment for project egress traffic

By configuring an egress IP address for a project, all outgoing external connections from the specified project will share the same, fixed source IP address.
External resources can recognize traffic from a particular project based on the egress IP address.
An egress IP address assigned to a project is different from the egress router, which is used to send traffic to specific destinations.

Egress IP addresses are implemented as additional IP addresses on the primary network interface of the node and must be in the same subnet as the node's primary IP address.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Egress IP addresses must not be configured in any Linux network configuration files, such as `ifcfg-eth0`.

Allowing additional IP addresses on the primary network interface might require extra configuration when using some cloud or VM solutions.
====

You can assign egress IP addresses to namespaces by setting the `egressIPs` parameter of the `NetNamespace` resource. After an egress IP is associated with a project, OpenShift SDN allows you to assign egress IPs to hosts in two ways:

* In the _automatically assigned_ approach, an egress IP address range is assigned to a node.
* In the _manually assigned_ approach, a list of one or more egress IP address is assigned to a node.

Namespaces that request an egress IP address are matched with nodes that can host those egress IP addresses, and then the egress IP addresses are assigned to those nodes.
If the `egressIPs` parameter is set on a `NetNamespace` resource, but no node hosts that egress IP address, then egress traffic from the namespace will be dropped.

High availability of nodes is automatic.
If a node that hosts an egress IP address is unreachable and there are nodes that are able to host that egress IP address, then the egress IP address will move to a new node.
When the unreachable node comes back online, the egress IP address automatically moves to balance egress IP addresses across nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot use manually assigned and automatically assigned egress IP addresses on the same nodes.
If you manually assign egress IP addresses from an IP address range, you must not make that range available for automatic IP assignment.

== Considerations when using automatically assigned egress IP addresses

When using the automatic assignment approach for egress IP addresses the following considerations apply:

- You set the `egressCIDRs` parameter of each node's `HostSubnet` resource to indicate the range of egress IP addresses that can be hosted by a node.
{product-title} sets the `egressIPs` parameter of the `HostSubnet` resource based on the IP address range you specify.
- Only a single egress IP address per namespace is supported when using the automatic assignment mode.

If the node hosting the namespace's egress IP address is unreachable, {product-title} will reassign the egress IP address to another node with a compatible egress IP address range.
The automatic assignment approach works best for clusters installed in environments with flexibility in associating additional IP addresses with nodes.

[id="considerations-manual-egress-ips"]
== Considerations when using manually assigned egress IP addresses

When using the manual assignment approach for egress IP addresses the following considerations apply:

- You set the `egressIPs` parameter of each node's `HostSubnet` resource to indicate the IP addresses that can be hosted by a node.
- Multiple egress IP addresses per namespace are supported.

When a namespace has multiple egress IP addresses, if the node hosting the first egress IP address is unreachable, {product-title} will automatically switch to using the next available egress IP address until the first egress IP address is reachable again.

This approach is recommended for clusters installed in public cloud environments, where there can be limitations on associating additional IP addresses with nodes.
