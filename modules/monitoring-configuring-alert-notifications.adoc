= Configuring alert notifications

[role="_abstract"]
In {ocp} {product-version}, you can view firing alerts in the Alerting UI. You can configure Alertmanager to send notifications about default platform alerts by configuring alert receivers.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Alertmanager does not send notifications by default. It is strongly recommended to configure Alertmanager to receive notifications by configuring alert receivers through the web console or through the `alertmanager-main` secret.
