= Performing an image-based upgrade on managed clusters at scale in several steps

For use cases when you need better control of when the upgrade interrupts your service, you can upgrade a set of your managed clusters by using the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR with adding actions after the previous step is complete.
After evaluating the results of the previous steps, you can move to the next upgrade stage or troubleshoot any failed steps throughout the procedure.

include::snippets/ibu-supported-action-combinations.adoc[]

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have created policies and `ConfigMap` objects for resources used in the image-based upgrade.
* You have installed the {lcao} and OADP Operators on all managed clusters through the hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file on the hub cluster that contains the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR:

$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml

$ oc get ibgu -o yaml

# ...
----

The previous output of an example plan starts with the `Prep` stage only and you add actions to the plan based on the results of the previous step.
{cgu-operator} adds a label to the clusters to mark if the upgrade succeeded or failed.
For example, the `lcm.openshift.io/ibgu-prep-failed` is applied to clusters that failed the `Prep` stage.

After investigating the failure, you can add the `AbortOnFailure` step to your upgrade plan.
It moves the clusters labeled with `lcm.openshift.io/ibgu-<action>-failed` back to the `Idle` stage.
Any resources that are related to the upgrade on the selected clusters are deleted.

. Optional: Add the `AbortOnFailure` action to your existing `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR by running the following command:

[source,terminal]

$ oc patch ibgu <filename> --type=json -p \
'[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/plan/-", "value": {"actions": ["AbortOnFailure"], "rolloutStrategy": {"maxConcurrency": 5, "timeout": 10}}}]'
----

.. Continue monitoring the status updates by running the following command:

----
$ oc get ibgu -o yaml
