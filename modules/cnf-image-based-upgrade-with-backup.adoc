= Moving to the Upgrade stage of the image-based upgrade with {lcao}

After you generate the seed image and complete the `Prep` stage, you can upgrade the target cluster.
During the upgrade process, the {oadp-short} Operator creates a backup of the artifacts specified in the {oadp-short} custom resources (CRs), then the {lcao} upgrades the cluster.

If the upgrade fails or stops, an automatic rollback is initiated.
If you have an issue after the upgrade, you can initiate a manual rollback.
For more information about manual rollback, see "Moving to the Rollback stage of the image-based upgrade with {lcao}".

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the `Prep` stage.

.Procedure

. To move to the `Upgrade` stage, change the value of the `stage` field to `Upgrade` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Upgrade"}}' --type=merge
----

. Check the status of the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ibu -o yaml
----

.Example output
[source,yaml]

----

The {oadp-short} Operator creates a backup of the data specified in the {oadp-short} `Backup` and `Restore` CRs and the target cluster reboots.
--

. Monitor the status of the CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ibu -o yaml
----

. If you are satisfied with the upgrade, finalize the changes by patching the value of the `stage` field to `Idle` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Idle"}}' --type=merge
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot roll back the changes once you move to the `Idle` stage after an upgrade.
====

The {lcao} deletes all resources created during the upgrade process.
--

. You can remove the {oadp-short} Operator and its configuration files after a successful upgrade. For more information, see "Deleting Operators from a cluster".
