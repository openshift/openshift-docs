[id="ztp-image-based-upgrading-with-backup_{context}"]
= Moving to the Upgrade stage of the image-based upgrade with {lcao}

Once you generated the seed image and completed the `Prep` stage, you can upgrade the target cluster.
During the upgrade process, the OADP Operator creates a backup of the artifacts specified in the OADP CRs, then the {lcao} upgrades the cluster.

If the upgrade fails or stops, an automatic rollback is initiated.
If you have an issue after the upgrade, you can initiate a manual rollback.
For more information about manual rollback, see "(Optional) Initiating a rollback with {lcao}".

.Prerequisites

* Complete the `Prep` stage.

.Procedure

. When you are ready, move to the upgrade stage by changing the value of the `stage` field to `Upgrade` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR.

. The OADP Operator creates a backup of the data specified in the OADP `Backup` and `Restore` CRs.

. The target cluster reboots.

. Monitor the status of the CR:

. The cluster reboots.

. Once you are satisfied with the upgrade, commit to the changes by changing the value of the `stage` field to `Idle` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR:

$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Idle"}}' --type=merge

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot roll back the changes once you move to the `Idle` stage after an upgrade.
====

The {lcao} deletes all resources created during the upgrade process.
