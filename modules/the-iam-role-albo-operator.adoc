= The IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Operator

[role="_abstract"]
To install the {aws-first} Load Balancer Operator on a cluster by using {sts-short}, configure an additional Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. This role enables the Operator to interact with subnets and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), allowing the Operator to generate the `CredentialsRequest` object required for bootstrapping.

You can create the IAM role by using the following options:

* Using the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) and a predefined `CredentialsRequest` object.
* Using the {aws-short} CLI and predefined {aws-short} manifests.

Use the {aws-short} CLI if your environment does not support the `ccoctl` command.
