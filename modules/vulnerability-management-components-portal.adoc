= Viewing vulnerability management data in the RHACS portal

[role="_abstract"]

Beginning with release 4.7, {product-title-short} has reorganized data for vulnerabilities it discovers and separated vulnerability data by category, such as vulnerabilities in user workloads and nodes, and platform vulnerabilities.

In the *Vulnerability Management* menu, the *Results* page provides vulnerability data. You can view vulnerability data by category by clicking the tabs at the top of the page. The tabs include the following categories:

User workloads:: This tab provides information about vulnerabilities that affect workloads and images in your system that you have deployed. Because these workloads are deployed and managed by you, they are called _user workloads_.

Platform:: This tab provides information about vulnerabilities that {product-title-short} identifies as related to the _platform_, for example, vulnerabilities in workloads and images that the OpenShift platform and layered services deploy. {product-title-short} uses a regular expression pattern to examine the namespaces of workloads and identify workloads that belong to platform components. For example, currently, {product-title-short} identifies vulnerabilities in the following namespaces as belonging to the platform:
* {ocp}: Namespace starts with `openshift-` or `kube-`
* Layered products:
** Namespace starts with rhacs-operator
** Namespace starts with open-cluster-management
** Namespace is `stackrox`, `multicluster-engine`, `aap`, or `hive`
* Third-party partners: Namespace is `nvidia-gpu-operator`

Nodes:: This tab provides a view of vulnerabilities across nodes, including user-managed and platform workloads and images.

More views:: This menu provides access to additional ways to view vulnerability information, including the following views:

* All vulnerable images
* Inactive images
* Images without CVEs
* Kubernetes components
