= Customizing the network flow table view

[role="_abstract"]
Customize the Network Observability flow table to focus on the network metrics most relevant to your environment.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions or network observability view permissions.
* You have installed the Network Observability Operator and configured a `FlowCollector` resource.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Observe* -> *Network Traffic* in the {product-title} web console.
. Select the *Network Traffic* tab.
. Click the *Manage columns* button to open the column configuration menu.
. Select the checkboxes for the columns you want to display.

[NOTE]
====
If you are monitoring OpenShift Virtual Machines, ensure the *IP* and *Infrastructure* columns are enabled to view SDN-managed addresses.
====
. Click *Save*.
. Optional: In the *Filter* bar, enter a query expression to narrow the results. For example, to exclude internal health check traffic, use a "not" operator with the specific service IP.

.Verification

* The flow table updates to display only the selected columns.
* The results in the table reflect the filters applied in the *Filter* bar.
