= Creating a Kafka channel by using YAML

You can create a Knative Eventing channel that is backed by Kafka topics. To do this, you must create a `KafkaChannel` object. The following procedure explains how you can create a `KafkaChannel` object by using YAML files and the `oc` CLI.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Eventing, and the `KnativeKafka` custom resource are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

.Procedure

. Create a `KafkaChannel` object as a YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: KafkaChannel
metadata:
  name: example-channel
  namespace: default
spec:
  numPartitions: 3
  replicationFactor: 1
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Only the `v1beta1` version of the API for `KafkaChannel` objects on {ServerlessProductName} is supported. Do not use the `v1alpha1` version of this API, as this version is now deprecated.
====

. Apply the `KafkaChannel` YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----
