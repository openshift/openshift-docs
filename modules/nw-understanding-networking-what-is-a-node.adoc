= What is a node?

Nodes are the physical or virtual machines that run containerized applications. Nodes host the pods and provide resources, such as memory and storage for running the applications. Nodes enable communication between pods. Each pod is assigned an IP address. Pods within the same node can communicate with each other using these IP addresses. Nodes facilitate service discovery by allowing pods to discover and communicate with services within the cluster. Nodes help distribute network traffic among pods to ensure efficient load balancing and high availability of applications. Nodes provide a bridge between the internal cluster network and external networks to allowing external clients to access services running on the cluster.
