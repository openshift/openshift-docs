[id="fixed-issues-1-12-0_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* In previous versions, if you used a ping source with OpenShift Serverless, after you uninstalled and deleted all other Knative Eventing components, the `pingsource-jobrunner` deployment was not deleted. This issue is now fixed, and the `pingsource-jobrunner` deployment has been renamed to `pingsource-mt-adapter`.
* In previous versions, deleting a sink before you delete the `SinkBinding` resource connected to it caused the resource deletion to hang. This issue is now fixed.

[id="known-issues-1-12-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

* Using the `eventing.knative.dev/scope: namespace` annotation for the `KafkaChannel` objects is not supported.
