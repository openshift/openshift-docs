[id="nw-egress-router-dns-mode_{context}"]
= Deploying an egress router pod in DNS proxy mode

In _DNS proxy mode_, an egress router pod acts as a DNS proxy for TCP-based services from its own IP address to one or more destination IP addresses.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create an egress router pod.

. Create a service for the egress router pod:

.. Create a file named `egress-router-service.yaml` that contains the following YAML. Set `spec.ports` to the list of ports that you defined previously for the `EGRESS_DNS_PROXY_DESTINATION` environment variable.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-dns-svc
spec:
  ports:
    ...
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    name: egress-dns-proxy
----
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-dns-svc
spec:
  ports:
  - name: con1
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  - name: con2
    protocol: TCP
    port: 100
    targetPort: 100
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    name: egress-dns-proxy
----

.. To create the service, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f egress-router-service.yaml
----
+
Pods can now connect to this service. The connections are proxied to the corresponding ports on the external server, using the reserved egress IP address.
