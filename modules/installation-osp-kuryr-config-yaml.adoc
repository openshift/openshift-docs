= Sample customized `install-config.yaml` file for OpenStack with Kuryr

To deploy with Kuryr SDN instead of the default OpenShift SDN, you must
modify the `install-config.yaml` file to include `Kuryr` as the desired
`networking.networkType` and proceed with the default OpenShift SDN installation steps.
This sample `install-config.yaml` demonstrates all of the possible
{rh-openstack-first} customization options.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This sample file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your
`install-config.yaml` file by using the installation program.

[NOTE]
====
Both `trunkSupport` and `octaviaSupport` are automatically discovered by the
installer, so there is no need to set them. But if your environment does not
meet both requirements, Kuryr SDN will not properly work. Trunks are needed
to connect the Pods to the OpenStack network and Octavia is required to create the
OpenShift Services.
