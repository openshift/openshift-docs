= Sample customized `install-config.yaml` file for {rh-openstack} with Kuryr

To deploy with Kuryr SDN instead of the default OVN-Kubernetes network plug-in, you must modify the `install-config.yaml` file to include `Kuryr` as the desired `networking.networkType`.
This sample `install-config.yaml` demonstrates all of the possible
{rh-openstack-first} customization options.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This sample file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your
`install-config.yaml` file by using the installation program.

----
<1> The Amphora Octavia driver creates two ports per load balancer. As a
result, the service subnet that the installer creates is twice the size of the
CIDR that is specified as the value of the `serviceNetwork` property. The larger range is
required to prevent IP address conflicts.
<2> The cluster network plug-in to install. The supported values are `Kuryr`, `OVNKubernetes`, and `OpenShiftSDN`. The default value is `OVNKubernetes`.
<3> Both `trunkSupport` and `octaviaSupport` are automatically discovered by the
installer, so there is no need to set them. But if your environment does not
meet both requirements, Kuryr SDN will not properly work. Trunks are needed
to connect the pods to the {rh-openstack} network and Octavia is required to create the
{product-title} services.
