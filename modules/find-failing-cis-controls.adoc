= Finding failing CIS controls

[role="_abstract"]
Similar to the *Policy Violations* sunburst chart in the *Configuration Management* view, the *CIS Kubernetes v1.5* widget provides information about failing Center for Information Security (CIS) controls.

Each level of the chart is represented by one ring or circle.

* The innermost circle represents the percentage of failing controls.
* The next ring represents the control categories.
* The outermost ring represents individual controls in a particular category.

.Procedure

. To view details about failing controls, hover over the sunburst chart.
. To view detailed information about failing controls, select *_n_ Controls Failing*, where _n_ is a number.
The *Controls* view displays a list of failing controls filtered based on the compliance state.
. Select a row to view more details, including control descriptions and nodes where the controls are failing.
. The *Control Findings* section in the information panel lists nodes where the controls are failing.
Select a row to view more details, including Kubernetes labels, annotations, and other metadata.

You can use the detailed information to focus on a subset of nodes, industry standards, or failing controls. You can also assess, check, and report on the compliance status of your containerized infrastructure.
