= Granting access to an individual user

This procedure explains how to grant access to an individual user.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. Alternatively, you are logged in as a user with the ability to grant permissions.

* You have deployed the {ols-long} service.

* You have access to the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

* Run the following command at the command line:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user \
lightspeed-operator-query-access <user_name>
----
+
Alternatively, you can use a YAML file when granting access to an individual user by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user lightspeed-operator-query-access <user_name> -o yaml --dry-run
----
+
The terminal returns the following output:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: lightspeed-operator-query-access
roleRef:

  name: <user_name>
