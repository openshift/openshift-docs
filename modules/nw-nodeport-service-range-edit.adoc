= Expanding the node port range

You can expand the node port range for your cluster. After you install your {product-title} cluster, you cannot shrink the node port range on either side of the currently configured range.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat has not performed testing outside the default port range of `30000-32768`. For ranges outside the default port range, ensure that you test to verify that expanding your node port range does not impact your cluster. If you expanded the range and a port allocation issue occurs, create a new cluster and set the required range for it.
====

.Prerequisites

* Installed the {oc-first}.
* Logged in to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You ensured that your cluster infrastructure allows access to the ports that exist in the extended range. For example, if you expand the node port range to `30000-32900`, your firewall or packet filtering configuration must allow the inclusive port range of `30000-32900`.

.Procedure

* To expand the range for the `serviceNodePortRange` parameter in the `network.config.openshift.io` object that your cluster uses to manage traffic for pods, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch network.config.openshift.io cluster --type=merge -p \
  '{
    "spec":
      { "serviceNodePortRange": "<port_range>" }
  }'
----
+
--
where:

`<port_range>`:: specifies your expanded range, such as `30000-32900`.
--
+
[TIP]
====
You can also apply the following YAML to update the node port range:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  serviceNodePortRange: "<port_range>"
# ...
----
====
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
network.config.openshift.io/cluster patched
----

.Verification

* To confirm that the updated configuration is active, enter the following command. The update can take several minutes to apply.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmaps -n openshift-kube-apiserver config \
  -o jsonpath="{.data['config\.yaml']}" | \
  grep -Eo '"service-node-port-range":["[[:digit:]]+-[[:digit:]]+"]'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
"service-node-port-range":["30000-32900"]
