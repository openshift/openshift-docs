Use the image builder tool to compose customized {op-system-ostree-first} images optimized for edge deployments.

include::snippets/microshift-rhel10-bootc-not-osbuild.adoc[leveloffset=1]

You can run a {microshift-short} node with your applications on a {op-system-ostree} virtual machine for development and testing first, then use your whole solution in edge production environments.

Use the following {op-system-base} documentation to understand the full details of using {op-system-ostree}:

* To build an {op-system-ostree-first} {op-system-version} image for a given CPU architecture, you need a {op-system-base} {op-system-version} build host of the same CPU architecture that meets the image builder system requirements. See the following link for more information:
