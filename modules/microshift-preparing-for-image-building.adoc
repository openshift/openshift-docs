= Preparing for image building

Use the image builder tool to compose customized {op-system-ostree-first} images optimized for edge deployments. You can run a {microshift-short} cluster with your applications on a {op-system-ostree} virtual machine for development and testing first, then use your whole solution in edge production environments.

Use the following {op-system-base} documentation to understand the full details of using {op-system-ostree}:

* To build an {op-system-ostree-first} {op-system-version} image for a given CPU architecture, you need a {op-system-base} {op-system-version} build host of the same CPU architecture that meets the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/composing_installing_and_managing_rhel_for_edge_images/setting-up-image-builder_composing-installing-managing-rhel-for-edge-images#edge-image-builder-system-requirements_setting-up-image-builder[Image builder system requirements].
