= Enabling imagestreams with Kubernetes resources

When using imagestreams with Kubernetes resources, you can only reference imagestreams that reside in the
same project as the resource. The imagestream reference must consist of a single
segment value, for example `ruby:2.5`, where `ruby` is the name of an
imagestream that has a tag named `2.5` and resides in the same project as the
resource making the reference.

[NOTE]
====
This feature can not be used in the `default` namespace, nor in any `openshift-`
or `kube-` namespace.
====

There are two ways to enable this:

* Enabling imagestream resolution on a specific resource. This allows only this
  resource to use the imagestream name in the image field.
* Enabling imagestream resolution on an imagestream. This allows all
  resources pointing to this imagestream to use it in the image field.

.Procedure

. Use `oc set image-lookup` to enable imagestream resolution on a specific resource or imagestream resolution on an imagestream. For example,
the following command allows all resources to reference the imagestream named
`mysql`:
+
----
$ oc set image-lookup mysql
----
+
This sets the `Imagestream.spec.lookupPolicy.local` field to true.
+
.Imagestream with image lookup enabled
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/display-name: mysql
  name: mysql
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  lookupPolicy:
    local: true
----
+
When enabled, the behavior is enabled for all tags within the imagestream.

. Then you can query the imagestreams and see if the option is set:
+
----
$ oc set image-lookup imagestream --list
----

////
. You can also enable image lookup on a specific resource. This
command allows the Kubernetes deployment named `mysql` to use imagestreams:
+
----
$ oc set image-lookup deploy/mysql
----
+
This sets the `alpha.image.policy.openshift.io/resolve-names` annotation
on the deployment.
+
.Deployment with image lookup enabled
+
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        alpha.image.policy.openshift.io/resolve-names: '*'
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: mysql:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: mysql
----
////

. To disable image lookup, pass `--enabled=false`:
+
----
$ oc set image-lookup deploy/mysql --enabled=false
