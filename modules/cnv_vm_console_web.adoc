= Virtual machine console sessions

You can connect to the VNC and serial consoles of a running virtual machine from the *Consoles* tab in the *Virtual Machine Details* screen of the web console.

There are two consoles available: the graphical *VNC Console* and the *Serial Console*. The *VNC Console* opens by default whenever you navigate to the *Consoles* tab. You can switch between the consoles using the xref:cnv-vm-vnc-console-web[*VNC Console*]|xref:cnv-vm-serial-console-web[*Serial Console*] drop-down list.

Console sessions remain active in the background unless they are disconnected. When the *Disconnect before switching* checkbox is active and you switch consoles, the current console session is disconnected and a new session with the selected console connects to the virtual machine. This ensures only one console session is open at a time.  

.Options for the *VNC Console*
The *Send Key* button lists key combinations to send to the virtual machine. 

.Options for the *Serial Console*
Use the *Disconnect* button to manually disconnect the *Serial Console* session from the virtual machine. +
Use the *Reconnect* button to manually open a *Serial Console* session to the virtual machine.
