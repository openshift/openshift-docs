= Resizing a persistent volume

// Set attributes to distinguish between cluster monitoring example (core platform monitoring - CPM) and user workload monitoring (UWM) examples

// tag::CPM[]
:configmap-name: cluster-monitoring-config
:namespace-name: openshift-monitoring
:component: prometheusK8s
// end::CPM[]
// tag::UWM[]
:configmap-name: user-workload-monitoring-config
:namespace-name: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
:component: thanosRuler
// end::UWM[]

// tag::CPM[]
You can resize a persistent volume (PV) for monitoring components, such as Prometheus or Alertmanager. 
// end::CPM[]
// tag::UWM[]
You can resize a persistent volume (PV) for the instances of Prometheus, Thanos Ruler, and Alertmanager.
// end::UWM[]
You need to manually expand a persistent volume claim (PVC), and then update the config map in which the component is configured.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only expand the size of the PVC. Shrinking the storage size is not possible.
====

.Prerequisites
// tag::CPM[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have configured at least one PVC for core {product-title} monitoring components.
// end::CPM[]
// tag::UWM[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have configured at least one PVC for components that monitor user-defined projects.
// end::UWM[]
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Manually expand a PVC with the updated storage request. For more information, see "Expanding persistent volume claims (PVCs) with a file system" in _Expanding persistent volumes_.

. Edit the `{configmap-name}` config map in the `{namespace-name}` project:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc -n {namespace-name} edit configmap {configmap-name}
----

. Add a new storage size for the PVC configuration for the component under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: # <1>
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: <amount_of_storage> # <2>
----
<1> The component for which you want to change the storage size.
<2> Specify the new size for the storage volume. It must be greater than the previous value.
+
The following example sets the new PVC request to 
// tag::CPM[]
100 gigabytes for the Prometheus instance:
// end::CPM[]
// tag::UWM[]
20 gigabytes for Thanos Ruler:
// end::UWM[]
+
.Example storage configuration for `{component}`
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          resources:
            requests:
# tag::CPM[]
              storage: 100Gi
# end::CPM[]
# tag::UWM[]
              storage: 20Gi
# end::UWM[]
----
// tag::UWM[]
+
[NOTE]
====
Storage requirements for the `thanosRuler` component depend on the number of rules that are evaluated and how many samples each rule generates.
====
// end::UWM[]

. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are automatically redeployed.
+
[WARNING]
====
When you update the config map with a new storage size, the affected `StatefulSet` object is recreated, resulting in a temporary service outage.
====

// Unset the source code block attributes just to be safe.
