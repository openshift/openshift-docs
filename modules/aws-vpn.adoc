= Configuring an AWS VPN


You can configure an {AWS} {product-title} cluster to use a customer’s on-site hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) device. By default, instances that you launch into an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) cannot communicate with your own (remote) network. You can enable access to your remote network from your VPC by creating an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection, and configuring routing to pass traffic through the connection.

[NOTE]
====
AWS VPN does not currently provide a managed option to apply NAT to VPN traffic. See the link:https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/configure-nat-for-vpn-traffic/[AWS Knowledge Center] for more details.

Routing all traffic, for example `0.0.0.0/0`, through a private connection is not supported. This requires deleting the internet gateway, which disables SRE management traffic.

.Prerequisites

* Hardware VPN gateway device model and software version, for example Cisco ASA running version 8.3. See the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/adminguide/Introduction.html#DevicesTested[AWS documentation] to confirm whether your gateway device is supported by AWS.
* Public, static IP address for the VPN gateway device.
* BGP or static routing: if BGP, the ASN is required. If static routing, you must
configure at least one static route.
* Optional: IP and port/protocol of a reachable service to test the VPN connection.
