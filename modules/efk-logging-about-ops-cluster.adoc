= About the infra cluster in {product-title}

You can configure Fluentd to split logs between the main Elasticsearch cluster and another
cluster reserved for operations logs, based on the `openshift_logging_use_ops` setting in your inventory file.

The operations logs are defined as node system logs and the projects *default*, *openshift**, and *kube**. 

Therefore, a separate Elasticsearch cluster, a separate Kibana, and a separate Curator are
deployed to index, access, and manage operations logs. These deployments are set
apart with names that include `-ops`.

[NOTE]
====
The logs for the *default*, *openshift*, and *openshift-infra* projects are
automatically aggregated and grouped into the *.operations* item in the Kibana
interface.

The project where you have deployed cluster logging (*logging*, as documented
here) is _not_ aggregated into *.operations* and is found under its ID.
