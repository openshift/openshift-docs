== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.13.1 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.13.1-421 provides a new feature and a bug fix for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The following advisory is available for the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2024:4837[RHBA-2024:4837].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler (KEDA).

New features and enhancements::

Note the new features and enhancements in this release:

* Support for custom certificates with the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 
+
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator can now use custom service CA certificates to connect securely to TLS-enabled metrics sources, such as an external Kafka cluster or an external Prometheus service. By default, the Operator uses automatically-generated service certificates to connect to on-cluster services only. There is a new field in the `KedaController` object that allows you to load custom server CA certificates for connecting to external services by using config maps. 
+
For more information, see xref:../../../nodes/cma/nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom.adoc#nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-ca_nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom[Custom CA certificates for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler].

Bug fixes::

* Previously, the `custom-metrics-autoscaler` and `custom-metrics-autoscaler-adapter` images were missing time zone information. As a consequence, scaled objects with `cron` triggers failed to work because the controllers were unable to find time zone information. With this fix, the image builds are updated to include time zone information. As a result, scaled objects containing `cron` triggers now function properly. Scaled objects containing `cron` triggers are currently not supported for the custom metrics autoscaler. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34018[OCPBUGS-34018])
