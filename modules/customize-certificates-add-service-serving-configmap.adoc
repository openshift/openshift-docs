= Add the service CA bundle to a config map

A Pod can access the service CA certificate by mounting a `ConfigMap` object that
is annotated with `service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true`.
Once annotated, the cluster automatically injects the service CA
certificate into the `service-ca.crt` key on the config map. Access to
this CA certificate allows TLS clients to verify connections to
services using service serving certificates.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After adding this annotation to a config map all existing data in it is
deleted. It is recommended to use a separate config map to contain the
`service-ca.crt`, instead of using the same config map that stores your
pod configuration.
====

.Procedure

. Annotate the config map with `service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate configmap <config_map_name> \//<1>
     service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true
----
<1> Replace `<config_map_name>` with the name of the config map to annotate.
+
[NOTE]
====
Explicitly referencing the `service-ca.crt` key in a volume mount will prevent a pod from starting until the config map has been injected with the CA bundle. This behavior can be overridden by setting the `optional` field to `true` for the volume's serving certificate configuration.
====
+
For example, use the following command to annotate the config map `test1`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate configmap test1 service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true
----

. View the config map to ensure that the service CA bundle has been injected:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap <config_map_name> -o yaml
----
+
The CA bundle is displayed as the value of the `service-ca.crt` key in the YAML output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  service-ca.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
