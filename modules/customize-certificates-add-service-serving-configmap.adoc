= Add the service CA bundle to a ConfigMap

A Pod can access the service CA certificate by mounting a ConfigMap that
is annotated with `service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true`.
Once annotated, the cluster automatically injects the service CA
certificate into the `service-ca.crt` key on the ConfigMap. Access to
this CA certificate allows TLS clients to verify connections to
services using service serving certificates.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After adding this annotation to a ConfigMap all existing data in it is
deleted. It is recommended to use a separate ConfigMap to contain the
`service-ca.crt`, instead of using the same ConfigMap that stores your
Pod's configuration.
====

.Procedure

. Annotate the ConfigMap with `service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true`:
+
----
$ oc annotate configmap <configmap-name> \//<1>
     service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true
----
<1> Replace `<configmap-name>` with the name of the ConfigMap to annotate.
+
[NOTE]
====
Explicitly referencing the `service-ca.crt` key in a volumeMount will prevent a Pod from starting until the ConfigMap has been injected with the CA bundle. This behavior can be overridden by setting the `optional` field to `true` for the volume's serving certificate configuration.
====
+
For example, use the following command to annotate the ConfigMap `foo`:
+
----
$ oc annotate configmap foo service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true
----

. View the ConfigMap to ensure that the service CA bundle has been injected:
+
----
$ oc get configmap <configmap-name> -o yaml
----
+
The CA bundle is displayed as the value of the `service-ca.crt` key in the YAML output:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  service-ca.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
----
