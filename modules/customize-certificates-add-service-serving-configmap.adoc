= Add the service CA bundle to a config map

A pod can access the service Certificate Authority (CA) certificate by mounting a `ConfigMap` object that has the `service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true` annotation. After annotating the config map, the cluster automatically injects the service CA certificate into the `service-ca.crt` key on the config map. Access to this CA certificate allows TLS clients to verify connections to services by using service serving certificates.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After adding this annotation to a config map, the OpenShift Service CA Operator deletes all the data in the config map. Consider using a separate config map to contain the `service-ca.crt`, instead of using the same config map that stores your pod configuration.
====

.Procedure

. Annotate the config map with the `service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true` annotation by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate configmap <config_map_name> \//<1>
     service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true
----
<1> Replace `<config_map_name>` with the name of the config map to annotate.
+
[NOTE]
====
Explicitly referencing the `service-ca.crt` key in a volume mount prevents a pod from starting until the config map has been injected with the CA bundle. You can override this behavior by setting the `optional` parameter to `true` in the serving certificate configuration of the volume.
====

. View the config map to ensure that the service CA bundle has been injected:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap <config_map_name> -o yaml
----
+
The CA bundle is displayed as the value of the `service-ca.crt` key in the YAML output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  service-ca.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
----

. Mount the config map as a volume to each container that exists in a pod by configuring your `Deployment` object.

----
<1> Specify the name of the config map that you annotated in an earlier step of the procedure.
<2> `ca-bundle.crt` is required as the ConfigMap key.
<3> `tls-ca-bundle.pem` is required as the ConfigMap path.
