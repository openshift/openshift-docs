= About virtual machine console sessions

You can connect to the VNC and serial consoles of a running virtual machine from
the *Console* tab on the *Virtual Machine Details* page of the web console.

The *VNC Console* opens by default when you navigate to
the *Console* tab. You can open a connection to the serial console by clicking
the *VNC Console* drop-down list and selecting *Serial Console*.

Console sessions remain active in the background unless they are disconnected. To ensure that only one console session is open at a time, click the *Disconnect before switching* check box before switching consoles.

You can open the active console session in a detached window by clicking the *Open Console in New Window* button or by clicking *Actions* -> *Open Console*.

.Options for the *VNC Console*
* Send key combinations to the virtual machine by clicking *Send Key*.

.Options for the *Serial Console*
* Manually disconnect the *Serial Console* session from the virtual machine by clicking *Disconnect*.
* Manually open a *Serial Console* session to the virtual machine by clicking *Reconnect*.
