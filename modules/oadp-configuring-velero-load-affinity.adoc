= Configuring Velero load affinity

[role="_abstract"]
With each {oadp-short} deployment, there is one Velero pod and its main purpose is to schedule Velero workloads. To schedule the Velero pod, you can use the `velero.podConfig.nodeSelector` and the `velero.loadAffinity` objects in the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) custom resource (CR) spec.

Use the `podConfig.nodeSelector` object to assign the Velero pod to specific nodes. You can also configure the `velero.loadAffinity` object for pod-level affinity and anti-affinity. 

The OpenShift scheduler applies the rules and performs the scheduling of the Velero pod deployment.


.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* You have configured the DPA CR.

.Procedure

* Configure the `velero.podConfig.nodeSelector` and the `velero.loadAffinity` objects in the DPA spec as shown in the following examples:
** `velero.podConfig.nodeSelector` object configuration:
