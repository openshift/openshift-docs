= About Operator update process

The {SMProduct} Operator will upgrade automatically to the latest available version based on the selected channel when the *approval strategy* field is set to `Automatic` (default). If the *approval strategy* field is set to `Manual`, {olm-first} will generate an update request, which a cluster administrator must approve to update the Operator to the latest version.

The Operator update process does not automatically update the {istio} control plane unless the `{istio}` resource version is set to an alias (for example, `vX.Y-latest`) and the `updateStrategy` is set to `InPlace`. This triggers a control plane update when a new version is available in the Operator. By default, the Operator will not update the {istio} control plane unless the `{istio}` resource is updated with a new version.
