= Viewing and enabling admission controller enforcement on an existing cluster

[role="_abstract"]
You can view whether admission controller enforcement was enabled on a cluster or change the enforcement behavior after installation.

.Procedure

. For a cluster that was installed by using the Operator, in the `SecuredCluster` custom resource (CR), edit the `admissionControl.enforcement` parameter to `Enabled`.
. For a cluster that was installed by using Helm, in the `values-public.yaml` file, set the `admissionControl.enforce` value to `false` and run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
helm upgrade -n stackrox \
  stackrox-secured-cluster-services rhacs/secured-cluster-services \
  --reuse-values \
  -f /config/yaml/values-public.yaml \
  -f /config/yaml/values-private.yaml
----
. For clusters installed by another method, you can use the {product-title-short} portal to edit the enforcement option. You cannot edit Operator- or Helm-managed clusters by using the portal. Follow these steps:
.. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*. 
.. Select an existing cluster from the list. 
.. In the *Dynamic configuration* section, in the *Admission controller enforcement behavior* field, select *Enforce policies*. The admission controller enforces policies that are configured for enforcement by rejecting the workload admission or update attempt.
.. Select *Next*.
.. Select *Finish*. {product-title-short} automatically synchronizes the admission controller and applies the changes.

.Verification
* The `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` Kubernetes resource contains information about enforcement configuration behavior. The configuration settings are available in the admission controller logs.
