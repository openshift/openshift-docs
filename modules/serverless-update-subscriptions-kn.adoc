[source,terminal]

$ kn subscription update <subscription_name> \
  --sink <sink_prefix>:<sink_name> \ <1>
  --sink-dead-letter <sink_prefix>:<sink_name> <2>
----
<1> `--sink` specifies the updated target destination to which the event should be delivered. You can specify the type of the sink by using one of the following prefixes:
`ksvc`:: A Knative service.
`channel`:: A channel that should be used as destination. Only default channel types can be referenced here.
`broker`:: An Eventing broker.
<2> Optional: `--sink-dead-letter` is an optional flag that can be used to specify a sink which events should be sent to in cases where events fail to be delivered. For more information, see the {ServerlessProductName} _Event delivery_ documentation.
