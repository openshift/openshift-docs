= Configuring performance mode using {policy-gen-cr} CRs

Follow this example to set performance mode by updating the `workloadHints` fields in the generated `PerformanceProfile` CR for the reference configuration, based on the `{policy-gen-cr}` CR in the `{policy-prefix}group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml`.

Performance mode provides low latency at a relatively high power consumption.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured the BIOS with performance related settings by following the guidance in "Configuring host firmware for low latency and high performance".

.Procedure

. Update the `{policy-gen-cr}` entry for `PerformanceProfile` in the `{policy-prefix}group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` reference file in `{argocd-folder}/` as follows to set performance mode.
