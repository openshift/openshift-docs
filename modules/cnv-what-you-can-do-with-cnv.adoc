= What you can do with container-native virtualization

{CNVProductNameStart} is an add-on to {product-title} that allows you to run and manage
 virtual machine workloads alongside container workloads.

{CNVProductNameStart} adds new objects into your {product-title} cluster via Kubernetes
custom resources to enable virtualization tasks. These tasks include:

* Creating and managing Linux and Windows virtual machines
* Connecting to virtual machines through a variety of consoles and CLI tools
* Importing and cloning existing virtual machines
* Managing network interface controllers and storage disks attached to virtual machines
* Live migrating virtual machines between nodes

An enhanced web console provides a graphical portal to manage these virtualized
resources alongside the {product-title} cluster containers and infrastructure.
