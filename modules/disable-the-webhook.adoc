= Disabling the webhook

[role="_abstract"]

You can disable admission controller enforcement from the *Clusters* view in the {product-title-short} portal.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable the admission controller by turning off the webhook, you must redeploy the Sensor bundle.
====

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
. Select an existing cluster from the list.
. Turn off the *Enable Admission Controller Webhook to listen on exec and port-forward events* toggle in the *Static Configuration* section.
. Select *Next* to continue with Sensor setup.
. Click *Download YAML file and keys*.
. From a system that has access to the monitored cluster, extract and run the `sensor` script:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ unzip -d sensor sensor-<cluster_name>.zip
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./sensor/sensor.sh
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you get a warning that you do not have the required permissions to deploy the sensor, follow the on-screen instructions, or contact your cluster administrator for help.
====
After the sensor is deployed, it contacts Central and provides cluster information.
. Return to the {product-title-short} portal and check if the deployment is successful.
If it is successful, a green checkmark appears under section #2.
If you do not see a green checkmark, use the following command to check for problems:
* On {ocp}:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -n stackrox -w
----
* On Kubernetes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl get pod -n stackrox -w
----
. Select *Finish*.

[NOTE]
====
When you disable the admission controller, {product-title-short} does not delete the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` parameter.
However, instead of checking requests for violations, it accepts all `AdmissionReview` requests.

To remove the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` object, run the following command in the secured cluster:

* On {ocp}:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete ValidatingWebhookConfiguration/stackrox
----
* On Kubernetes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl delete ValidatingWebhookConfiguration/stackrox
----
