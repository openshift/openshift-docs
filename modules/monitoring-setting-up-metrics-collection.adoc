= Setting up metrics collection

To use the metrics exposed by your service, you need to configure OpenShift Monitoring to scrape metrics from the `/metrics` endpoint. You can do this using a ServiceMonitor, a custom resource definition (CRD) that specifies how a service should be monitored, or a PodMonitor, a CRD that specifies how a pod should be monitored. The former requires a Service object, while the latter does not, allowing Prometheus to directly scrape metrics from the metrics endpoint exposed by a Pod.

This procedure shows how to create a ServiceMonitor for the service.

.Prerequisites

* Log in as a cluster administrator or a user with the `monitor-crd-edit` role.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for the ServiceMonitor configuration. In this example, the file is called `example-app-service-monitor.yaml`.

. Fill the file with the configuration for creating the ServiceMonitor:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    k8s-app: prometheus-example-monitor
  name: prometheus-example-monitor
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  endpoints:
  - interval: 30s
    port: web
    scheme: http
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus-example-app
----
+
This configuration makes OpenShift Monitoring scrape the metrics exposed by the sample service deployed in "Deploying a sample service", which includes the single `version` metric.

. Apply the configuration file to the cluster:
+
----
$ oc apply -f example-app-service-monitor.yaml
----
+
It will take some time to deploy the ServiceMonitor.

. You can check that the ServiceMonitor is running:
+
----
$ oc -n ns1 get servicemonitor
NAME                         AGE
prometheus-example-monitor   81m
----
