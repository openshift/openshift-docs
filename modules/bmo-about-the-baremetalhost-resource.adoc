= About the BareMetalHost resource

Metal^3^ introduces the concept of the `BareMetalHost` resource, which defines a physical host and its properties. The `BareMetalHost` resource contains two sections:

. The `BareMetalHost` spec
. The `BareMetalHost` status

== The BareMetalHost spec

The `spec` section of the `BareMetalHost` resource defines the desired state of the host.

|Parameters |Description

| `automatedCleaningMode`
| An interface to enable or disable automated cleaning during provisioning and de-provisioning. When set to `disabled`, it skips automated cleaning. When set to `metadata`, automated cleaning is enabled. The default setting is `metadata`.

a|
----
bmc:
  address:
  credentialsName:
  disableCertificateVerification:
----
a| The `bmc` configuration setting contains the connection information for the baseboard management controller (BMC) on the host. The fields are:

* `address`: The URL for communicating with the host's BMC controller.

* `credentialsName`: A reference to a secret containing the username and password for the BMC.

* `disableCertificateVerification`: A boolean to skip certificate validation when set to `true`.

| `bootMACAddress`
| The MAC address of the NIC used for provisioning the host.

| `bootMode`
| The boot mode of the host. It defaults to `UEFI`, but it can also be set to `legacy` for BIOS boot, or `UEFISecureBoot`.

| `consumerRef`
| A reference to another resource that is using the host. It could be empty if another resource is not currently using the host. For example, a `Machine` resource might use the host when the `machine-api` is using the host.

| `description`
| A human-provided string to help identify the host.

| `externallyProvisioned`
a| A boolean indicating whether the host provisioning and deprovisioning are managed externally. When set:

* Power status can still be managed using the online field.
* Hardware inventory will be monitored, but no provisioning or deprovisioning operations are performed on the host.

| `firmware`
a| Contains information about the BIOS configuration of bare metal hosts. Currently, `firmware` is only supported by iRMC, iDRAC, iLO4 and iLO5 BMCs. The sub fields are:

** `simultaneousMultithreadingEnabled`: Allows a single physical processor core to appear as several logical processors. Valid settings are `true` or `false`.
** `sriovEnabled`: SR-IOV support enables a hypervisor to create virtual instances of a PCI-express device, potentially increasing performance. Valid settings are `true` or `false`.
** `virtualizationEnabled`: Supports the virtualization of platform hardware. Valid settings are `true` or `false`.

a|
----
image:
  url:
  checksum:
  checksumType:
  format:
----
a| The `image` configuration setting holds the details for the image to be deployed on the host. Ironic requires the image fields. However, when the `externallyProvisioned` configuration setting is set to `true` and the external management does not require power control, the fields can be empty. The setting supports the following fields:

* `url`: The URL of an image to deploy to the host.
* `checksum`: The actual checksum or a URL to a file containing the checksum for the image at `image.url`.
* `checksumType`: You can specify checksum algorithms. Currently `image.checksumType` only supports `md5`, `sha256`, and `sha512`. The default checksum type is `md5`.
* `format`: This is the disk format of the image. It can be one of `raw`, `qcow2`, `vdi`, `vmdk`, `live-iso` or be left unset. Setting it to `raw` enables raw image streaming in the Ironic agent for that image. Setting it to `live-iso` enables iso images to live boot without deploying to disk, and it ignores the `checksum` fields.

| `networkData`
| A reference to the secret containing the network configuration data and its namespace, so that it can be attached to the host before the host boots to set up the network.

| `online`
| A boolean indicating whether the host should be powered on (`true`) or off (`false`). Changing this value will trigger a change in the power state of the physical host.

----
raid:
  hardwareRAIDVolumes:
  softwareRAIDVolumes:
----
a|  (Optional) Contains the information about the RAID configuration for bare metal hosts. If not specified, it retains the current configuration.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} {product-version} supports hardware RAID for BMCs, including:

* Fujitsu iRMC with support for RAID levels 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10 
* Dell iDRAC using the Redfish API with firmware version 6.10.30.20 or later and RAID levels 0, 1, and 5

{product-title} {product-version} does not support software RAID.
====

See the following configuration settings:

* `hardwareRAIDVolumes`: Contains the list of logical drives for hardware RAID, and defines the desired volume configuration in the hardware RAID. If you do not specify `rootDeviceHints`, the first volume is the root volume. The sub-fields are:

** `level`: The RAID level for the logical drive. The following levels are supported: `0`,`1`,`2`,`5`,`6`,`1+0`,`5+0`,`6+0`.
** `name`: The name of the volume as a string. It should be unique within the server. If not specified, the volume name will be auto-generated.
** `numberOfPhysicalDisks`: The number of physical drives as an integer to use for the logical drove. Defaults to the minimum number of disk drives required for the particular RAID level.
** `physicalDisks`: The list of names of physical disk drives as a string. This is an optional field. If specified, the controller field must be specified too.
** `controller`: (Optional) The name of the RAID controller as a string to use in the hardware RAID volume.
** `rotational`: If set to `true`, it will only select rotational disk drives. If set to `false`, it will only select solid-state and NVMe drives. If not set, it selects any drive types, which is the default behavior.
** `sizeGibibytes`: The size of the logical drive as an integer to create in GiB. If unspecified or set to `0`, it will use the maximum capacity of physical drive for the logical drive.

* `softwareRAIDVolumes`: {product-title} {product-version} does not support software RAID. The following information is for reference only. This configuration contains the list of logical disks for software RAID. If you do not specify `rootDeviceHints`, the first volume is the root volume. If you set `HardwareRAIDVolumes`, this item will be invalid. Software RAIDs will always be deleted. The number of created software RAID devices must be `1` or `2`. If there is only one software RAID device, it must be `RAID-1`. If there are two RAID devices, the first device must be `RAID-1`, while the RAID level for the second device can be `0`, `1`, or `1+0`. The first RAID device will be the deployment device. Therefore, enforcing `RAID-1` reduces the risk of a non-booting node in case of a device failure. The `softwareRAIDVolume` field defines the desired configuration of the volume in the software RAID. The sub-fields are:

** `level`: The RAID level for the logical drive. The following levels are supported: `0`,`1`,`1+0`.
** `physicalDisks`: A list of device hints. The number of items should be greater than or equal to `2`.
** `sizeGibibytes`: The size of the logical disk drive as an integer to be created in GiB. If unspecified or set to `0`, it will use the maximum capacity of physical drive for logical drive.

You can set the `hardwareRAIDVolume` as an empty slice to clear the hardware RAID configuration. For example:

----
spec:
   raid:
     hardwareRAIDVolume: []
----

If you receive an error message indicating that the driver does not support RAID, set the `raid`, `hardwareRAIDVolumes` or `softwareRAIDVolumes` to nil. You might need to ensure the host has a RAID controller.

----
a| The `rootDeviceHints` parameter enables provisioning of the {op-system} image to a particular device. It examines the devices in the order it discovers them, and compares the discovered values with the hint values. It uses the first discovered device that matches the hint value. The configuration can combine multiple hints, but a device must match all hints to get selected. The fields are:

* `deviceName`: A string containing a Linux device name like `/dev/vda`. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

* `hctl`: A string containing a SCSI bus address like `0:0:0:0`. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

* `model`: A string containing a vendor-specific device identifier. The hint can be a substring of the actual value.

* `vendor`: A string containing the name of the vendor or manufacturer of the device. The hint can be a sub-string of the actual value.

* `serialNumber`: A string containing the device serial number. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

* `minSizeGigabytes`: An integer representing the minimum size of the device in gigabytes.

* `wwn`: A string containing the unique storage identifier. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

* `wwnWithExtension`: A string containing the unique storage identifier with the vendor extension appended. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

* `wwnVendorExtension`: A string containing the unique vendor storage identifier. The hint must match the actual value exactly.

* `rotational`: A boolean indicating whether the device should be a rotating disk (true) or not (false).
