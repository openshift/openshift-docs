= Cluster tuning

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
For a full list of components that you can disable using the cluster capabilities feature, see "Cluster capabilities".

Limits and requirements::
* Cluster capabilities are not available for installer-provisioned installation methods.

The following table lists the required platform tuning configurations:

|Description

|Remove optional cluster capabilities
a|Reduce the {product-title} footprint by disabling optional cluster Operators on {sno} clusters only.

* Remove all optional Operators except the Node Tuning Operator, Operator Lifecycle Manager, and the Ingress Operator.

|Configure cluster monitoring
a|Configure the monitoring stack for reduced footprint by doing the following:

* Disable the local `alertmanager` and `telemeter` components.

* If you use {rh-rhacm} observability, the CR must be augmented with appropriate `additionalAlertManagerConfigs` CRs to forward alerts to the hub cluster.

* {rh-rhacm} observability combines its default data values with the monitoring configuration `ConfigMap` CR provided as part of the cluster tuning reference CRs.
This merge results in the policy becoming non-compliant. 
To ensure that the provided configuration is not overwritten or merged with {rh-rhacm} data values, you can disable the {rh-rhacm} management of this `ConfigMap` CR . 
This keeps the policy compliant. For more information, see the Observability section of Telco hub reference design specifications.

* Reduce the `Prometheus` retention period to 24h.

[NOTE]
====
The {rh-rhacm} hub cluster aggregates managed cluster metrics.

|Disable networking diagnostics
|Disable networking diagnostics for {sno} because they are not required.

|Configure a single OperatorHub catalog source
|Configure the cluster to use a single catalog source that contains only the Operators required for a RAN DU deployment.
Each catalog source increases the CPU use on the cluster.
Using a single `CatalogSource` fits within the platform CPU budget.

|Disable the Console Operator
|If the cluster was deployed with the console disabled, the `Console` CR (`ConsoleOperatorDisable.yaml`) is not needed.
If the cluster was deployed with the console enabled, you must apply the `Console` CR.

Engineering considerations::
* As of {product-title} 4.19, cgroup v1 is no longer supported and has been removed. 
All workloads must now be compatible with cgroup v2. For more information, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/rhel-9-changes-context-red-hat-openshift-workloads[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 changes in the context of Red Hat OpenShift workloads].
