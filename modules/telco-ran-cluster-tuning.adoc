= Cluster tuning

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
See "Cluster capabilities" for a full list of optional components that you can enable or disable before installation.

Limits and requirements::
* Cluster capabilities are not available for installer-provisioned installation methods.

* You must apply all platform tuning configurations.
The following table lists the required platform tuning configurations:

|Feature
|Description

|Remove optional cluster capabilities
a|Reduce the {product-title} footprint by disabling optional cluster Operators on {sno} clusters only.

* Remove all optional Operators except the Marketplace and Node Tuning Operators.

|Configure cluster monitoring
a|Configure the monitoring stack for reduced footprint by doing the following:

* Disable the local `alertmanager` and `telemeter` components.

* If you use {rh-rhacm} observability, the CR must be augmented with appropriate `additionalAlertManagerConfigs` CRs to forward alerts to the hub cluster.

* Reduce the `Prometheus` retention period to 24h.
+
[NOTE]
====
The {rh-rhacm} hub cluster aggregates managed cluster metrics.
====

|Disable networking diagnostics
|Disable networking diagnostics for {sno} because they are not required.

|Configure a single OperatorHub catalog source
|Configure the cluster to use a single catalog source that contains only the Operators required for a RAN DU deployment.
Each catalog source increases the CPU use on the cluster.
Using a single `CatalogSource` fits within the platform CPU budget.

|Disable the Console Operator
|If the cluster was deployed with the console disabled, the `Console` CR (`ConsoleOperatorDisable.yaml`) is not needed.
If the cluster was deployed with the console enabled, you must apply the `Console` CR.
|====

Engineering considerations::
* In {product-title} 4.16 and later, clusters do not automatically revert to cgroups v1 when a `PerformanceProfile` CR is applied.
If workloads running on the cluster require cgroups v1, you need to configure the cluster to use cgroups v1.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you need to configure cgroups v1, make the configuration as part of the initial cluster deployment.
