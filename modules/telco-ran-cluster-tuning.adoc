= Cluster tuning

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
The cluster capabilities feature includes a `MachineAPI` component which, when excluded, disables the following Operators and their resources in the cluster:

* `openshift/cluster-autoscaler-operator`

* `openshift/cluster-control-plane-machine-set-operator`

* `openshift/machine-api-operator`

[NOTE]
====
Use cluster capabilities to remove the Image Registry Operator.
====

Limits and requirements::
* Cluster capabilities are not available for installer-provisioned installation methods.

* You must apply all platform tuning configurations.
The following table lists the required platform tuning configurations:

|Description

|Remove optional cluster capabilities
a|Reduce the {product-title} footprint by disabling optional cluster Operators on {sno} clusters only.

* Remove all optional Operators except the Marketplace and Node Tuning Operators.

|Configure cluster monitoring
a|Configure the monitoring stack for reduced footprint by doing the following:

* Disable the local `alertmanager` and `telemeter` components.

* If you use {rh-rhacm} observability, the CR must be augmented with appropriate `additionalAlertManagerConfigs` CRs to forward alerts to the hub cluster.

* Reduce the `Prometheus` retention period to 24h.
+
[NOTE]
====
The {rh-rhacm} hub cluster aggregates managed cluster metrics.
====

|Disable networking diagnostics
|Disable networking diagnostics for {sno} because they are not required.

|Configure a single OperatorHub catalog source
|Configure the cluster to use a single catalog source that contains only the Operators required for a RAN DU deployment.
Each catalog source increases the CPU use on the cluster.
Using a single `CatalogSource` fits within the platform CPU budget.
