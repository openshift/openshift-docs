= Cluster tuning

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
See the section _Cluster capabilities_ section for a full list of optional components that you enable or disable before installation.

Limits and requirements::
* Cluster capabilities are not available for installer-provisioned installation methods.

* You must apply all platform tuning configurations.
The following table lists the required platform tuning configurations:

|Description

|Remove optional cluster capabilities
a|Reduce the {product-title} footprint by disabling optional cluster Operators on {sno} clusters only.

* Remove all optional Operators except the Marketplace and Node Tuning Operators.

|Configure cluster monitoring
a|Configure the monitoring stack for reduced footprint by doing the following:

* Disable the local `alertmanager` and `telemeter` components.

* If you use {rh-rhacm} observability, the CR must be augmented with appropriate `additionalAlertManagerConfigs` CRs to forward alerts to the hub cluster.

* Reduce the `Prometheus` retention period to 24h.
+
[NOTE]
====
The {rh-rhacm} hub cluster aggregates managed cluster metrics.
====

|Disable networking diagnostics
|Disable networking diagnostics for {sno} because they are not required.

|Configure a single OperatorHub catalog source
|Configure the cluster to use a single catalog source that contains only the Operators required for a RAN DU deployment.
Each catalog source increases the CPU use on the cluster.
Using a single `CatalogSource` fits within the platform CPU budget.
|====

Engineering considerations::

* In this release, {product-title} deployments use Control Groups version 2 (cgroup v2) by default. As a consequence, performance profiles in a cluster use cgroups v2 for the underlying resource management layer. If workloads running on the cluster require cgroups v1, you can configure nodes to use cgroups v1. You can make this configuration as part of the initial cluster deployment.
