= About 802.1Q-in-802.1Q support

In traditional VLAN setups, frames typically contain a single VLAN tag, such as VLAN-100, as well as other metadata such as Quality of Service (QoS) bits and protocol information. QinQ introduces a second VLAN tag, where the service provider designates the outer tag for their use, offering them flexibility, while the inner tag remains dedicated to the customer's VLAN.

QinQ facilitates the creation of nested VLANs by using double VLAN tagging, enabling finer segmentation and isolation of traffic within a network environment. This approach is particularly valuable in service provider networks where you need to deliver VLAN-based services to multiple customers over a common infrastructure, while ensuring separation and isolation of traffic.

When two VLAN tags are present in a packet, the outer VLAN tag can be either 802.1Q or 802.1ad. The inner VLAN tag must always be 802.1Q.

The {product-title} SR-IOV solution already supports setting the VLAN protocol on the `SriovNetwork` custom resource (CR). The virtual function (VF) can use this protocol to set the VLAN tag, also known as the outer tag. Pods can then use the VLAN CNI plugin to configure the inner tag.
