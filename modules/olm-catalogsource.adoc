= CatalogSource

A CatalogSource represents a store of metadata that OLM can query to discover and install Operators and their dependencies. The spec of a CatalogSource indicates how to construct a pod or how to communicate with a service that serves the Operator Registry gRPC API.

There are three primary `sourceTypes` for a CatalogSource:

* `grpc` with an `image` reference: OLM pulls the image and runs the pod, which is expected to serve a compliant API.
* `grpc` with an `address` field: OLM attempts to contact the gRPC API at the given address. This should not be used in most cases.
* `internal` or `configmap`: OLM parses the ConfigMap data and runs a pod that can serve the gRPC API over it.

.Example CatalogSource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
 name: operatorhubio-catalog
 namespace: olm
spec:
 sourceType: grpc
 image: quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog:latest <1>
 priority: -400
 displayName: Community Operators
 publisher: OperatorHub.io
 updateStrategy:
  registryPoll: <2>
    interval: 30m
----
<1> Specify catalog image.
<2> Automatically check for new versions at a given interval to keep up to date.

This example defines a CatalogSource for OperatorHub.io content. The name of
the CatalogSource is used as input to a Subscription, which instructs OLM where
to look to find a requested Operator:
