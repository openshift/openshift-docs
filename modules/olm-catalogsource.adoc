= CatalogSource

A CatalogSource represents a store of metadata that OLM can query to discover
and install Operators and their dependencies. The spec of a CatalogSource
indicates how to construct a Pod or how to communicate with a service that
serves the Operator Registry gRPC API.

There are three primary `sourceTypes` for a CatalogSource:

* `grpc` with an `image` reference: OLM pulls the image and runs the Pod, which is expected to serve a compliant API.
* `grpc` with an `address` field: OLM attempts to contact the gRPC API at the given address. This should not be used in most cases.
* `internal` or `configmap`: OLM parses the ConfigMap data and runs a Pod that can serve the gRPC API over it.

This example defines a CatalogSource for OperatorHub.io content. The name of
the CatalogSource is used as input to a Subscription, which instructs OLM where
to look to find a requested Operator:
