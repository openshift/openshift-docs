= About Istio High Availability

Running the {istio} control plane in High Availability (HA) mode prevents single points of failure, and ensures continuous mesh operation even if an `istiod` pod fails. By using HA, if one `istiod` pod becomes unavailable, another one continues to manage and configure the {istio} data plane, preventing service outages or disruptions. HA provides scalability by distributing the control plane workload, enables graceful upgrades, supports disaster recovery operations, and protects against zone-wide mesh outages.

There are two ways for a system administrator to configure HA for the {istio} deployment:

* Defining a static replica count: This approach involves setting a fixed number of `istiod` pods, providing a consistent level of redundancy.

* Using autoscaling: This approach dynamically adjusts the number of `istiod` pods based on resource utilization or custom metrics, providing more efficient resource consumption for fluctuating workloads.
