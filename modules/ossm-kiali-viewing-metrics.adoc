= Viewing metrics in the Kiali console

You can view inbound and outbound metrics for your applications, workloads, and services in the Kiali console.  The Detail pages include the following tabs:

* inbound Application metrics
* outbound Application metrics
* inbound Workload metrics
* outbound Workload metrics
* inbound Service metrics

These tabs display predefined metrics dashboards, tailored to the relevant application, workload or service level. The application and workload detail views show request and response metrics such as volume, duration, size, or TCP traffic. The service detail view shows request and response metrics for inbound traffic only.

Kiali lets you customize the charts by choosing the charted dimensions. Kiali can also present metrics reported by either source or destination proxy metrics. And for troubleshooting, Kiali can overlay trace spans on the metrics.
