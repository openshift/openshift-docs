= Installing the PTP Operator using the web console

As a cluster administrator, you can install the PTP Operator using the web console.

[NOTE]
====
You have to create the namespace and operator group as mentioned
in the previous section.
====

.Procedure

. Install the PTP Operator using the {product-title} web console:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose  *PTP Operator* from the list of available Operators, and then click *Install*.

.. On the *Install Operator* page, under *A specific namespace on the cluster* select *openshift-ptp*. Then, click *Install*.

. Optional: Verify that the PTP Operator installed successfully:

.. Switch to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *PTP Operator* is listed in the *openshift-ptp* project with a *Status* of *InstallSucceeded*.
+
[NOTE]
====
During installation an Operator might display a *Failed* status.
If the installation later succeeds with an *InstallSucceeded* message, you can ignore the *Failed* message.
====

+
If the operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:

+
* Go to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page and inspect
the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors
under *Status*.
* Go to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page and check the logs for pods in the
`openshift-ptp` project.
