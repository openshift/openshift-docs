= Creating a basic authentication secret

As an administrator, you can create a basic authentication secret, which allows you to store the credentials needed for basic authentication. When using this secret type, the `data` parameter of the `Secret` object must contain the following keys encoded in the base64 format:

* `username`: the user name for authentication
* `password`: the password or token for authentication

[NOTE]
====
You can use the `stringData` parameter to use clear text content.
====

The Kubernetes API verifies that the required keys are set for the secret.

Alernatively, you can create an opaque secret to pass the credentials. However, using a basic authentication secret helps you better define the purpose of the secret and sets a convention for what key names to expect.

.Procedure

. Create a `Secret` object in a YAML file on a control plane node:
+
.Example `secret` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-basic-auth
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth <1>
data:
data: <2>
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: dDBwLVNlY3JldA==
----
<1> Specifies a basic authentication secret.
<2> Specifies the basic authentication values to use.

. Use the following command to create the `Secret` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
----

. To use the secret in a pod:

.. Update the pod's service account to reference the secret, as shown in the "Understanding how to create secrets" section.

.. Create the pod, which consumes the secret as an environment variable or as a file (using a `secret` volume), as shown in the "Understanding how to create secrets" section.
