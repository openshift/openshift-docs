= Scheduling

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
* The scheduler is a cluster-wide component responsible for selecting the right node for a given workload. It is a core part of the platform and does not require any specific configuration in the common deployment scenarios. However, there are few specific use cases described in the following section.
NUMA-aware scheduling can be enabled through the NUMA Resources Operator.
For more information, see "Scheduling NUMA-aware workloads".

Limits and requirements::
* The default scheduler does not understand the NUMA locality of workloads. It only knows about the sum of all free resources on a worker node. This might cause workloads to be rejected when scheduled to a node with the topology manager policy set to `single-numa-node` or `restricted`.
** For example, consider a pod requesting 6 CPUs and being scheduled to an empty node that has 4 CPUs per NUMA node. The total allocatable capacity of the node is 8 CPUs and the scheduler will place the pod there. The node local admission will fail, however, as there are only 4 CPUs available in each of the NUMA nodes.
** All clusters with multi-NUMA nodes are required to use the NUMA Resources Operator. Use the `machineConfigPoolSelector` field in the `KubeletConfig` CR to select all nodes where NUMA aligned scheduling is needed.
* All machine config pools must have consistent hardware configuration for example all nodes are expected to have the same NUMA zone count.

Engineering considerations::
* Pods might require annotations for correct scheduling and isolation. For more information on annotations, see "CPU partitioning and performance tuning".

* You can configure SR-IOV virtual function NUMA affinity to be ignored during scheduling by using the `excludeTopology` field in `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` CR.
