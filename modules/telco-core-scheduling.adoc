New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
* The scheduler is a cluster-wide component responsible for selecting the right node for a given workload. It is a core part of the platform and does not require any specific configuration in the common deployment scenarios. However, there are few specific use cases described in the following section.
NUMA-aware scheduling can be enabled through the NUMA Resources Operator.
For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/scalability_and_performance/cnf-numa-aware-scheduling.html[Scheduling NUMA-aware workloads].

Limits and requirements::
* The default scheduler does not understand the NUMA locality of workloads. It only knows about the sum of all free resources on a worker node. This might cause workloads to be rejected when scheduled to a node with https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/scalability_and_performance/using-cpu-manager.html#topology_manager_policies_using-cpu-manager-and-topology_manager[Topology manager policy] set to `single-numa-node` or `restricted`.
** For example, consider a pod requesting 6 CPUs and being scheduled to an empty node that has 4 CPUs per NUMA node. The total allocatable capacity of the node is 8 CPUs and the scheduler will place the pod there. The node local admission will fail, however, as there are only 4 CPUs available in each of the NUMA nodes.
** All clusters with multi-NUMA nodes are required to use the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/scalability_and_performance/cnf-numa-aware-scheduling.html#installing-the-numa-resources-operator_numa-aware[NUMA Resources Operator]. The `machineConfigPoolSelector` of the NUMA Resources Operator must select all nodes where NUMA aligned scheduling is needed.
* All machine config pools must have consistent hardware configuration for example all nodes are expected to have the same NUMA zone count.

Engineering considerations::
* Pods might require annotations for correct scheduling and isolation. For more information on annotations, see xref:../../telco_ref_design_specs/core/telco-core-ref-design-components.adoc#telco-core-cpu-partitioning-performance-tune_core-ref-design-components[CPU partitioning and performance tuning].

* You can configure SR-IOV virtual function NUMA affinity to be ignored during scheduling by using the `excludeTopology` field in `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` CR.
