Description::
+
--
The scheduler is a cluster-wide component responsible for selecting the correct node for a given workload.
It is a core part of the platform and does not require any specific configuration in the common deployment scenarios.
However, a few specific use cases are described in the following section.

NUMA-aware scheduling can be enabled through the NUMA Resources Operator.
For more information, see "Scheduling NUMA-aware workloads".
--

Limits and requirements::
* The default scheduler does not understand the NUMA locality of workloads.
It only knows about the sum of all free resources on a worker node.
This might cause workloads to be rejected when scheduled to a node with the topology manager policy set to `single-numa-node` or `restricted`.
For more information, see "Topology Manager policies".
** For example, consider a pod requesting 6 CPUs that is scheduled to an empty node that has 4 CPUs per NUMA node.
The total allocatable capacity of the node is 8 CPUs. The scheduler places the pod on the empty node.
The node local admission fails, as there are only 4 CPUs available in each of the NUMA nodes.
* All clusters with multi-NUMA nodes are required to use the NUMA Resources Operator.
See "Installing the NUMA Resources Operator" for more information.
Use the `machineConfigPoolSelector` field in the `KubeletConfig` CR to select all nodes where NUMA aligned scheduling is required.
* All machine config pools must have consistent hardware configuration.
For example, all nodes are expected to have the same NUMA zone count.

Engineering considerations::
* Pods might require annotations for correct scheduling and isolation.
For more information about annotations, see "CPU partitioning and performance tuning".
* You can configure SR-IOV virtual function NUMA affinity to be ignored during scheduling by using the `excludeTopology` field in `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` CR.
