== Fixed issues

* Before this update, when you used the Kiali operator 2.17 or later with {SMProductName} 2.6 and enabled the Kiali add-on in the Service Mesh control plane (SMCP) configuration, the Kiali config map always set the `cluster_wide_access` value to `true`. As a consequence, Kiali maintained cluster-wide permissions even if you selected a restricted mode in the SMCP. With this release, the operator correctly sets the `cluster_wide_access` value based on the mode specified in the SMCP. As a result, Kiali permissions now correctly match your service mesh configuration.
