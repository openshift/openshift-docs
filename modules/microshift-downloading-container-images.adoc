= Downloading container images

After you have located the container list and completed the mirroring prerequisites, download the container images to a host with internet access.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged into a host with access to the internet.
* You have ensured that the `.pull-secret-mirror.json` file and `microshift-containers` directory contents are available locally.

.Procedure

. Install the `skopeo` tool used for copying the container images by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y skopeo
----

. Set the environment variable that points to the pull secret file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ PULL_SECRET_FILE=~/.pull-secret-mirror.json
----

. Set the environment variable that points to the list of container images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ IMAGE_LIST_FILE=~/microshift-container-refs.txt
----

. Set the environment variable that points to the destination directory for storing the downloaded data:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ IMAGE_LOCAL_DIR=~/microshift-containers
----

. Run the following script to download the container images to the `${IMAGE_LOCAL_DIR}` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
while read -r src_img ; do
   # Remove the source registry prefix
   dst_img=$(echo "${src_img}" | cut -d '/' -f 2-)

   # Run the image download command
   echo "Downloading '${src_img}' to '${IMAGE_LOCAL_DIR}'"
   mkdir -p "${IMAGE_LOCAL_DIR}/${dst_img}"
   skopeo copy --all --quiet \
      --preserve-digests \
      --authfile "${PULL_SECRET_FILE}" \
      docker://"${src_img}" dir://"${IMAGE_LOCAL_DIR}/${dst_img}"

done < "${IMAGE_LIST_FILE}"
----

. Transfer the image set to the target environment, such as air-gapped site. Then you can upload the image set into the mirror registry.
