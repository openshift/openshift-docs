The following issues are identified with {ols-official} 1.0:

* For {ocp-product-title} 4.17 and later, the {ols-short} icon disappears when you click *Create Namespace* or *Create Project* from one of the following locations in the {ocp-product-title} web console:
+
--
** *Administration -> Namespaces* 
** *Home -> Projects -> Create Project*
** The *Project* drop-down menu located at the top of most pages
--
+
Workaround: Refresh the web browser and the {ols-short} icon appears. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1815[OLS-1815].

* Changing the value of the `quota` parameter in the `spec.ols.quotaHandlersConfig.limitersConfig` specification of the `OLSConfig` custom resource file does not take effect until the currently defined quota period expires.
+
Workaround: Delete the {ols-short} Operator. Ensure that any operand pods that the {ols-short} Operator manages, and the Persistent Volume Claim `lightspeed-postgres-pvc` associated with the `postgres` pod are also deleted. Then, install the {ols-short} Operator again. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1826[OLS-1826]

* After restarting the `postgres` pod, the {ols-short} service pod fails to connect to the `postgres` pod.
+
Workaround: Restart the {ols-short} service pod so that the service pod connects to the `postgres` pod. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1815[OLS-1835].
