[id="olm-overriding-operator-pod-affinity_{context}"]
= Overriding an Operator's pod affinity and anti-affinity configuration

In Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), you can override or define your own pod affinity and pod anti-affinity constraints for an Operator using the `Subscription` object. 

Affinity is a property of pods that controls the nodes on which they prefer to be scheduled. Anti-affinity is a property of pods that prevents a pod from being scheduled on a node.
