= Setting up the installation machine


To run the binary `openshift-install` installation program and Ansible scripts, set up the {rh-virtualization} Manager or an {op-system-base-full} computer with network access to the {rh-virtualization} environment and the REST API on the {rh-virtualization} Manager/oVirt Engine.

// The following steps include creating an `ASSETS_DIR` environment variable, which the installation program uses to create a directory of asset files. Later, the installation process reuses this variable to locate these asset files.

.Procedure

. Update or install Python3 and Ansible. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf update python3 ansible
----

. link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.4/html/python_sdk_guide/chap-overview#Installing_the_Software_Development_Kit[Install the `python3-ovirt-engine-sdk4` package] to get the Python Software Development Kit.

. Install the `ovirt.image-template` Ansible role. On {rh-virtualization} Manager and other {op-system-base-full} machines, this role is distributed as the `ovirt-ansible-image-template` package. For example, enter:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf install ovirt-ansible-image-template
----

. Install the `ovirt.vm-infra` Ansible role. On {rh-virtualization} Manager and other {op-system-base} machines, this role is distributed as the `ovirt-ansible-vm-infra` package.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf install ovirt-ansible-vm-infra
----

. Create an environment variable and assign an absolute or relative path to it. For example, enter:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ASSETS_DIR=./wrk
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The installation program uses this variable to create a directory where it saves important installation-related files. Later, the installation process reuses this variable to locate those asset files. Avoid deleting this assets directory: It is required for uninstalling the cluster.
