= About node selectors

You can use node selectors on pods and labels on nodes to control where the pod is scheduled. With node selectors, {product-title} schedules the pods on nodes that contain matching labels.

You can use a node selector to place specific pods on specific nodes, cluster-wide node selectors to place new pods on specific nodes anywhere in the cluster, and project node selectors to place new pods in a project on specific nodes.

For example, as a cluster administrator, you can create an infrastructure where application developers can deploy pods only onto the nodes closest to their geographical location by including a node selector in every pod they create. In this example, the cluster consists of five data centers spread across two regions. In the U.S., label the nodes as `us-east`, `us-central`, or `us-west`. In the Asia-Pacific region (APAC), label the nodes as `apac-east` or `apac-west`. The developers can add a node selector to the pods they create to ensure the pods get scheduled on those nodes.

A pod is not scheduled if the `Pod` object contains a node selector, but no node has a matching label.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using node selectors and node affinity in the same pod configuration, the following rules control pod placement onto nodes:

* If you configure both `nodeSelector` and `nodeAffinity`, both conditions must be satisfied for the pod to be scheduled onto a candidate node.

* If you specify multiple `nodeSelectorTerms` associated with `nodeAffinity` types, then the pod can be scheduled onto a node if one of the `nodeSelectorTerms` is satisfied.

* If you specify multiple `matchExpressions` associated with `nodeSelectorTerms`, then the pod can be scheduled onto a node only if all `matchExpressions` are satisfied.

Node selectors on specific pods and nodes::
+
You can control which node a specific pod is scheduled on by using node selectors and labels.
+
To use node selectors and labels, first label the node to avoid pods being descheduled, then add the node selector to the pod.
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot add a node selector directly to an existing scheduled pod. You must label the object that controls the pod, such as deployment config.

For example, the following `Node` object has the `region: east` label:

Default cluster-wide node selectors::
+
With default cluster-wide node selectors, when you create a pod in that cluster, {product-title} adds the default node selectors to the pod and schedules
the pod on nodes with matching labels.

For example, the following `Scheduler` object has the default cluster-wide `region=east` and `type=user-node` node selectors:

If the project where you create the pod has a project node selector, that selector takes preference over a cluster-wide node selector. Your pod is not created or scheduled if the pod does not have the project node selector.

Project node selectors::

With project node selectors, when you create a pod in this project, {product-title} adds the node selectors to the pod and schedules the pods on a node with matching labels. If there is a cluster-wide default node selector, a project node selector takes preference.
