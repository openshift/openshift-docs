= Understanding node selectors

Using _node selectors_, you can ensure that pods are only placed onto nodes with specific labels. As a cluster administrator, you can
use the Pod Node Constraints admission controller to set a policy that prevents users without the *pods/binding* permission 
from using node selectors to schedule pods.

The `nodeSelectorLabelBlacklist` admission controller field gives you control over the labels that certain roles can specify in a pod configuration's
`nodeSelector` field. Users, service accounts, and groups that have the
*pods/binding* permission role can specify any node selector. Those without the
*pods/binding* permission are prohibited from setting a `nodeSelector` for any
label that appears in `nodeSelectorLabelBlacklist`.

For example, an {product-title} cluster might consist of five data
centers spread across two regions. In the U.S., *us-east*, *us-central*, and
*us-west*; and in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC), *apac-east* and *apac-west*.
Each node in each geographical region is labeled accordingly. For example,
`region: us-east`.

As a cluster administrator, you can create an infrastructure where application
developers should be deploying pods only onto the nodes closest to their
geographical location. You can create a node selector, grouping the U.S. data centers into `superregion: us` and the APAC
data centers into `superregion: apac`.

To maintain an even loading of resources per data center, you can add the
desired `region` to the `nodeSelectorLabelBlacklist` section of a master
configuration. Then, whenever a developer located in the U.S. creates a pod, it
is deployed onto a node in one of the regions with the `superregion: us` label.
If the developer tries to target a specific region for their pod (for example,
`region: us-east`), they receive an error. If they try again, without the
node selector on their pod, it can still be deployed onto the region they tried
to target, because `superregion: us` is set as the project-level node selector,
and nodes labeled `region: us-east` are also labeled `superregion: us`.
