= Accessing the Perspectives


You can access the *Administrator* and *Developer* perspective from the web console as follows:

.Prerequisites
To access a perspective, ensure that you have logged in to the web console. Your default perspective is automatically determined by the permission of the users. The *Administrator* perspective is selected for users with access to all projects, while the *Developer* perspective is selected for users with limited access to their own projects

.Additional Resources
See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/web_console/adding-user-preferences.html[Adding User Preferences] for more information on changing perspectives.


.Procedure

. Use the perspective switcher to switch to the *Administrator* or *Developer* perspective.

. Select an existing project from the *Project* drop-down list. You can also create a new project from this dropdown.

[NOTE]
====
You can use the perspective switcher only as `cluster-admin`.
