= Jaeger overview

Jaeger lets service owners instrument their services to get insights into what their architecture is doing.
Jaeger is an open source distributed tracing platform that you can use for monitoring, network profiling, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern, cloud-native, microservices-based applications.
Jaeger is based on the vendor-neutral OpenTracing APIs and instrumentation.

Using Jaeger lets you perform the following functions:

* Monitor distributed transactions

* Optimize performance and latency

* Perform root cause analysis
