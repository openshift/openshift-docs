= Jaeger overview

As a service owner, you can use Jaeger to instrument your services to gather insights into your service architecture.
Jaeger is an open source distributed tracing platform that you can use for monitoring, network profiling, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern, cloud-native, microservices-based applications.

Using Jaeger lets you perform the following functions:

* Monitor distributed transactions

* Optimize performance and latency

* Perform root cause analysis

Jaeger is based on the vendor-neutral link:https://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing] APIs and instrumentation.
