== Bug fixes

*  Previously, users could define `localhost` as a valid host name for all of their hosts. As a result, host names were not unique, and {ai-full} could not install the cluster. With this release, users cannot complete the cluster installation if any of the hosts are named `localhost`. An error appears and users must rename the hosts.
//(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-8088[MGMT-8088])

* Previously, in the *OpenShift Web Console troubleshooting* window, the *Optional* field remained blank when undefined instead of displaying an IP address. With this release, the *Optional* field was removed.
//(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-9283[MGMT-9283])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on vSphere, the {ai-full} created machines and `MachineSet` objects for every virtual machine. With this release, {ai-full} no longer creates machines or `MachineSet` objects for user-provisioned VMs.
//(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-9559[MGMT-9559])

* Previously, if Operators failed to install during an installation with {ai-full}, users received an error message and were directed to reset the cluster installation. With this release, if Operators fail to install, the cluster is automatically degraded.

* Previously, after installing an Operator using {ai-full}, the Operator appeared as *available* in the cluster *Status* area in the *Installation progress* page. However, users had to check the Operator avilability in the {product-title} web console. With this release, the Operator appears as *installed* in the *Status* area.
