This release of {SMProductName} is included with the {SMProductName} Operator 3.1.1 and is supported on {ocp-product-title} 4.16 and later. This release addresses enhancements, fixed issues, and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

[id="ossm-enhancements-3-1-1_{context}"]
== Enhancements

* This enhancement updates {istio} to version 1.26.3.

* This enhancement updates Kiali operator to version 2.11.2.

[id="ossm-bug-fixes-3-1-1_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Before this update, enabling `NetworkPolicy` field globally in the `{istio}` custom resource (CR) failed to create the corresponding `NetworkPolicy` resource due to incorrect resource handling. This issue prevented users from applying network policies when {istio} was enabled globally. With this update, `NetworkPolicy` resource creation is enabled upon `{istio}` CR update, allowing end users to consistently apply network policy rules in {istio}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-10595[OSSM-10595])

* Before this update, creating a `PodDisruptionBudget` for a single `istiod` pod with a `minAvailable` value of `1` caused an upgrade to fail, preventing node restart during upgrade. As a consequence, the upgrade was unsuccessful. With this update, the {istio} Operator disables the default `podDisruptionBudget` for the single `istiod` pod in the {istio} 1.24.3 configuration. As a result, the node can now restart during an upgrade without being prevented by the single `istiod` pod. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-9392[OSSM-9392])
