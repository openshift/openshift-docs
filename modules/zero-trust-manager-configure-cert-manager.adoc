= Configuring the cert-manager plugin

The cert-manager plugin for the SPIRE server is designed to automate the management of the SPIRE server intermediate signing certificates by integrating with cert-manager. The cert-manager plugin enables the SPIRE server to dynamically request and receive intermediate signing certificates from cert-manager.

.Prerequisites

* Access to a Kubernetes cluster where the SPIRE server runs.

* cert-manager must be installed and running within the Kubernetes cluster. For more information about installing cert-manager, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html-single/security_and_compliance/index#cert-manager-operator-install[Installing the cert-manager Operator for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift].

* A pre-configured cert-manager `Issuer` capable of signing intermediate Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.
