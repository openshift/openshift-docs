= Creating DNS records in a different AWS account by using a shared VPC

[role="_abstract"]
To create DNS records in a different AWS account, configure the ExternalDNS Operator to use a shared Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Your organization can then use a single Route 53 instance for name resolution across multiple accounts and projects.

.Prerequisites

* You have created two Amazon AWS accounts: one with a VPC and a Route 53 private hosted zone configured (Account A), and another for installing a cluster (Account B).
* You have created an IAM Policy and IAM Role with the appropriate permissions in Account A for Account B to create DNS records in the Route 53 hosted zone of Account A.
* You have installed a cluster in Account B into the existing VPC for Account A.
* You have installed the ExternalDNS Operator in the cluster in Account B.

.Procedure

. Get the Role ARN of the IAM Role that you created to allow Account B to access Account A's Route 53 hosted zone by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws --profile account-a iam get-role --role-name user-rol1 | head -1
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
ROLE	arn:aws:iam::1234567890123:role/user-rol1	2023-09-14T17:21:54+00:00	3600	/	AROA3SGB2ZRKRT5NISNJN	user-rol1
----

. Locate the private hosted zone to use with Account A's credentials by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws --profile account-a route53 list-hosted-zones | grep testextdnsoperator.apacshift.support
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
HOSTEDZONES	terraform	/hostedzone/Z02355203TNN1XXXX1J6O	testextdnsoperator.apacshift.support. 5
----

. Create the `ExternalDNS` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: externaldns.olm.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalDNS

    openshiftRouteOptions:

EOF

where:
+
`arn`:: Specifies the Role ARN to have DNS records created in Account A.

. Check the records created for {product-title} routes by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws --profile account-a route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z02355203TNN1XXXX1J6O --query "ResourceRecordSets[?Type == 'CNAME']" | grep console-openshift-console
