[id="virt-importing-vm-wizard_{context}"]
= Importing a virtual machine with the VM Import wizard

You can import a single virtual machine with the VM Import wizard.

ifdef::virt-importing-vmware-vm[]
You can also import a VM template. If you import a VM template, {VirtProductName} creates a virtual machine based on the template.

.Prerequisites

* You must have admin user privileges.
* The VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) image must be in an image registry that is accessible to your {VirtProductName} environment.
* The VDDK image must be added to the `spec.vddkInitImage` field of the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).
* The VM must be powered off.
* Virtual disks must be connected to IDE or SCSI controllers. If virtual disks are connected to a SATA controller, you can change them to IDE controllers and then migrate the VM.
* The {VirtProductName} local and shared persistent storage classes must support VM import.
* The {VirtProductName} storage must be large enough to accommodate the virtual disk.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you are using Ceph RBD block-mode volumes, the storage must be large enough to accommodate the virtual disk. If the disk is too large for the available storage, the import process fails and the PV that is used to copy the virtual disk is not released. You will not be able to import another virtual machine or to clean up the storage because there are insufficient resources to support object deletion. To resolve this situation, you must add more object storage devices to the storage back end.
====

* The {VirtProductName} egress network policy must allow the following traffic:
+
[cols="1,1,1" options="header"]
|===
|Destination |Protocol |Port
|VMware ESXi hosts |TCP |443
|VMware ESXi hosts |TCP |902
|VMware vCenter |TCP |5840
|===

.Procedure

. In the web console, click *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines*.
. Click *Create Virtual Machine* and select *Import with Wizard*.
ifdef::virt-importing-vmware-vm[]
. Select *VMware* from the *Provider* list.
. Select *Connect to New Instance* or a saved vCenter instance.

* If you select *Connect to New Instance*, enter the *vCenter hostname*, *Username*, and *Password*.
* If you select a saved vCenter instance, the wizard connects to the vCenter instance using the saved credentials.

. Click *Check and Save* and wait for the connection to complete.
+
[NOTE]
====
The connection details are stored in a secret. If you add a provider with an incorrect host name, user name, or password, click *Workloads* -> *Secrets* and delete the provider secret.
====

. Select a virtual machine or a template.
endif::[]
ifdef::virt-importing-rhv-vm[]
. Select *Red Hat Virtualization (RHV)* from the *Provider* list.
. Select *Connect to New Instance* or a saved RHV instance.

* If you select *Connect to New Instance*, fill in the following fields:

** *API URL*: For example, `\https://<RHV_Manager_FQDN>/ovirt-engine/api`
** *CA certificate*: Click *Browse* to upload the RHV Manager CA certificate or paste the CA certificate into the field.
+
View the CA certificate by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openssl s_client -connect <RHV_Manager_FQDN>:443 -showcerts < /dev/null
----
+
The CA certificate is the second certificate in the output.

** *Username*: RHV Manager user name, for example, `ocpadmin@internal`
** *Password*: RHV Manager password

* If you select a saved RHV instance, the wizard connects to the RHV instance using the saved credentials.

. Click *Check and Save* and wait for the connection to complete.
+
[NOTE]
====
The connection details are stored in a secret. If you add a provider with an incorrect URL, user name, or password, click *Workloads* -> *Secrets* and delete the provider secret.

. Select a cluster and a virtual machine.
