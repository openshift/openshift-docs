* This enhancement updates Kiali control plane resource to version 2.4.11.

[id="ossm-fixed-issues-3-2-1_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the `ZTunnel` custom resource definition (CRD) version was not updated in the 3.2.0 release, resulting in a `v1alpha1` CRD being deployed. As a consequence, users may encounter compatibility issues with existing `v1alpha1` `ZTunnel` CRD instances in the 3.2.0 release. With this release, the `ZTunnel` CRD has been updated to `v1`. As a result, end users can now use the updated `ZTunnel` CRD `v1`, ensuring compatibility and avoiding confusion in deployments.
