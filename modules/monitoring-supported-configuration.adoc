= Supported configuration

The supported way of configuring {product-title} Monitoring is by configuring it using the options described in the "Configuring cluster monitoring" section. Beyond those explicit configuration options, it is possible to inject additional configuration into the stack. However, this is unsupported, as configuration paradigms might change across Prometheus releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled. *Do not use unsupported configuration.*

Explicitly unsupported cases include:

* *Creating additional `ServiceMonitor` objects in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.* This extends the targets the cluster monitoring Prometheus instance scrapes, which can cause collisions and load differences that cannot be accounted for. This makes the Prometheus setup can be unstable.
* *Creating additional `ConfigMap` objects.* This causes the cluster monitoring Prometheus instance to include additional alerting and recording rules. This behavior is known to cause a breaking behavior, as Prometheus 2.0 ships with a new rule file syntax.
* *Modifying resources of the stack.* The Prometheus Monitoring Stack ensures its resources are always in the state it expects them to be. If they are modified, the stack will reset them.
* *Using resources of the stack for your purposes.* The resources created by the Prometheus Cluster Monitoring stack are not meant to be used by any other resources, as there are no guarantees about their backward compatibility.
