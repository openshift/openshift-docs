= Supported configuration

The supported way of configuring {product-title} Monitoring is by configuring it using the options described in the Configuring OpenShift cluster monitoring section. Beyond those explicit configuration options, it is possible to inject additional configuration into the stack. However, this is unsupported, as configuration paradigms might change across Prometheus releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled.

Explicitly unsupported cases include:

* Creating additional `ServiceMonitor` objects in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace, thereby extending the targets the cluster monitoring Prometheus instance scrapes. This can cause collisions and load differences that cannot be accounted for, therefore the Prometheus setup can be unstable.
* Creating additional `ConfigMap` objects that cause the cluster monitoring Prometheus instance to include additional alerting and recording rules. This behavior is known to cause a breaking behavior if applied, as Prometheus 2.0 will ship with a new rule file syntax.
