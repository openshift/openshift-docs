= Configuring delivery destinations and scheduling

[role="_abstract"]
Configuring destinations and delivery schedules for vulnerability reports is optional, unless on the previous page, you selected the option to include CVEs that were discovered since the last scheduled report. If you selected that option, configuring destinations and delivery schedules for vulnerability reports is required.

.Procedure
. To configure destinations for delivery, in the *Configure delivery destinations* section, you can add a delivery destination and set up a schedule for reporting.
. To email reports, you must configure at least one email notifier. Select an existing notifier or create a new email notifier to send your report by email. For more information about creating an email notifier, see "Configuring the email plugin" in the "Additional resources" section.
+
When you select a notifier, the email addresses configured in the notifier as *Default recipients* appear in the *Distribution list* field. You can add additional email addresses that are separated by a comma.
. A default email template is automatically applied. To edit this default template, perform the following steps:
.. Click the edit icon and enter a customized subject and email body in the *Edit* tab.
.. Click the *Preview* tab to see your proposed template.
.. Click *Apply* to save your changes to the template.
