= Common practices for networking services

In {product-title}, services create a single IP address for clients to use, even if multiple pods are providing that service. This abstraction enables seamless scaling, fault tolerance, and rolling upgrades without affecting clients.

Network security policies manage traffic within the cluster. Network controls empower namespace administrators to define ingress and egress rules for their pods. By using network administration policies, cluster administrators can establish namespace policies, override namespace policies, or set default policies when none are defined.

Egress firewall configurations control outbound traffic from pods. These configuration settings ensure that only authorized communication occurs. The ingress node firewall protects nodes by controlling incoming traffic. Additionally, the Universal Data Network manages data traffic across the cluster.
