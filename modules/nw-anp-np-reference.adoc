= Key differences between AdminNetworkPolicy and NetworkPolicy custom resources

The following table explains key differences between the cluster scoped `AdminNetworkPolicy` API and the namespace scoped `NetworkPolicy` API.

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Policy elements | AdminNetworkPolicy | NetworkPolicy

|Applicable user
|Cluster administrator or equivalent
|Namespace owners

|Scope
|Cluster
|Namespaced

|Drop traffic
|Supported with an explicit `Deny` action set as a rule.
|Supported via implicit `Deny` isolation at policy creation time.

|Delegate traffic
|Supported with an `Pass` action set as a rule.
|Not applicable

|Allow traffic
|Supported with an explicit `Allow` action set as a rule.
|The default action for all rules is to allow.

|Rule precedence within the policy
|Depends on the order in which they appear within an ANP. The higher the rule's position the higher the precedence.
|Rules are additive

|Policy precedence
|Among ANPs the `priority` field sets the order for evaluation. The lower the priority number higher the policy precedence.
|There is no policy ordering between policies.

|Feature precedence
|Evaluated first via tier 1 ACL and BANP is evaluated last via tier 3 ACL.
|Enforced after ANP and before BANP, they are evaluated in tier 2 of the ACL.

|Matching pod selection
|Can apply different rules across namespaces.
|Can apply different rules across pods in single namespace.

|Cluster egress traffic
|Supported via `nodes` and `networks` peers
|Supported through `ipBlock` field along with accepted CIDR syntax.

|Cluster ingress traffic
|Not supported
|Not supported

|Fully qualified domain names (FQDN) peer support
|Not supported
|Not supported

|Namespace selectors
|Supports advanced selection of Namespaces with the use of `namespaces.matchLabels` field
|Supports label based namespace selection with the use of `namespaceSelector` field
