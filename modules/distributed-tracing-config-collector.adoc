= Jaeger Collector configuration options

The Jaeger Collector is the component responsible for receiving the spans that were captured by the tracer and writing them to a persistent storage (Elasticsearch) when using the `production` strategy, or to AMQ Streams when using the `streaming` strategy.

The collectors are stateless and thus many instances of Jaeger Collector can be run in parallel. Collectors require almost no configuration, except for the location of the Elasticsearch cluster.
