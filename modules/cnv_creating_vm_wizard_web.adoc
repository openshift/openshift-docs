== Creating a virtual machine with the interactive wizard

The web console features an interactive wizard that guides you through xref:cnv-vm-wizard-fields-web[*Basic Settings*], xref:cnv-networking-wizard-fields-web[*Networking*], and xref:cnv-storage-wizard-fields-web[*Storage*] screens to simplify the process of creating virtual machines. All required fields are marked by an asterisk (`*`). The wizard prevents you from moving to the next screen until the required fields have been completed.

NICs and storage disks can be created and attached to virtual machines after they have been created.

.*Bootable Disk*

If either `URL` or `Container` are selected as the *Provision Source* in the xref:cnv-vm-wizard-fields-web[*Basic Settings*] screen, a `rootdisk` disk is created and attached to the virtual machine as the *Bootable Disk*. You can modify the `rootdisk` but you cannot remove it.

A *Bootable Disk* is not required for virtual machines provisioned from a *PXE* source if there are no disks attached to the virtual machine. If one or more disks are attached to the virtual machine, you must select one as the *Bootable Disk*.

.Procedure

. Click *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines* from the side menu.
. Click *Create Virtual Machine* and select *Create with Wizard*.
. Fill in all required xref:cnv-vm-wizard-fields-web[*Basic Settings*]. Selecting a *Template* automatically fills in these fields.
. Click *Next* to progress to the xref:cnv-networking-wizard-fields-web[*Networking*] screen. A `nic0` NIC is attached by default.
.. (Optional) Click *Create NIC* to create additional NICs.
.. (Optional) You can remove any or all NICs by clicking the &#8942; button and selecting *Remove NIC*. A virtual machine does not need a NIC attached to be created. NICs can be xref:cnv-vm-create-nic-web[created] after the virtual machine has been created.
. Click *Next* to progress to the xref:cnv-storage-wizard-fields-web[*Storage*] screen.
.. (Optional) Click *Create Disk* to create additional disks. These disks can be removed by clicking the &#8942; button and selecting *Remove Disk*.
.. (Optional) Click on a disk to modify available fields. Click the &#10003; button to save the update.
.. (Optional) Click *Attach Disk* to choose an available disk from the *Select Storage* drop-down list.
. Click *Create Virtual Machine >*. The *Results* screen displays the JSON configuration file for the virtual machine.

The virtual machine is listed in *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines*.
