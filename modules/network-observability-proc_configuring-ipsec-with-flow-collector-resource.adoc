= Configuring IPsec with the FlowCollector custom resource

In {product-title}, IPsec is disabled by default. You can enable IPsec by following the instructions in "Configuring IPsec encryption".

.Prerequisite

.Verification

When IPsec is enabled:

* A new dashboard showing the percent of encrypted traffic is generated.
