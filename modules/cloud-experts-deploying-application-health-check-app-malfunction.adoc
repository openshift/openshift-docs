.Verification

After the previous step, the application stops responding with a `200 HTTP code`. After 3 consecutive failures, Kubernetes will stop the pod and restart it. From the web console, switch back to the pod events page and you will see that the liveness probe failed and the pod restarted.

The following image shows an example of what you should see on your pod events page.

*B.* Kubernetes stops the pod.
*C.* Kubernetes restarts the pod.
