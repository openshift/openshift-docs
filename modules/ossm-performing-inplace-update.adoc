= Performing InPlace update
:context: ossm-performing-inplace-update

When updating {istio} using the `InPlace` strategy, you can only increment by one minor version at a time. If you want to update by more than one minor version, then you must increment the version and restart the workloads after each update. This ensures that the sidecar version is compatible with the control plane version. After all the workloads are restarted the update process is complete.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to {product-title} as `cluster-admin`.
* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator, and deployed {istio}.

.Procedure

. Change the version in the {istio} resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Istio
spec:
  version: 1.20.2
  updateStrategy: 
    type: InPlace
----
+
The {SMProductShortName} Operator deploys a new version of the control plane that replaces the old version of the control plane. The sidecars automatically reconnect to the new control plane.

. Confirm that the new version of the control plane is running and ready by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get istio <control-plane-name>
----

. Restart the application workloads so that the new version of the sidecar gets injected by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout restart <deployment-name>
----
