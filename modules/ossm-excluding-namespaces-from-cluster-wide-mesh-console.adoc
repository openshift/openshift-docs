= Including and excluding namespaces from a cluster-wide mesh by using the web console
 
By default, the {SMProductName} Operator uses discovery selectors to identify the namespaces that make up the mesh. Namespaces that do not contain the label defined in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource are not matched by the discovery selector and are excluded from the mesh.  
 
.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator.
* You have deployed a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.
* You are logged in as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you are logged in as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the {SMProductName} Operator.

. Click *Istio Service Mesh Control Plane*.

. Click the name of the control plane.

. Click *YAML*.

. Modify the YAML file so that the `spec.discoverySelectors` field of the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource includes the discovery selector. The following example uses `istio-discovery: enabled`:

<1> Ensures that the mesh discovers namespaces that contain the label `istio-discovery: enabled`. The mesh does not discover namespaces that do not contain the label.
<2> Ensures that the mesh does not discover namespaces `bookinfo` and `httpbin`.

. Save the file.
