== Purpose

ifdef::cluster-caps[]

The Marketplace Operator provides the features for the `marketplace` capability.

endif::cluster-caps[]

The Marketplace Operator simplifies the process for bringing off-cluster Operators to your cluster by using a set of default Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) catalogs on the cluster. When the Marketplace Operator is installed, it creates the `openshift-marketplace` namespace. OLM ensures catalog sources installed in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace are available for all namespaces on the cluster.

ifdef::cluster-caps[]
If you disable the `marketplace` capability, the Marketplace Operator does not create the `openshift-marketplace` namespace. Catalog sources can still be configured and managed on the cluster manually, but OLM depends on the `openshift-marketplace` namespace in order to make catalogs available to all namespaces on the cluster. Users with elevated permissions to create namespaces prefixed with `openshift-`, such as system or cluster administrators, can manually create the `openshift-marketplace` namespace.

If you enable the `marketplace` capability, you can enable and disable individual catalogs by configuring the Marketplace Operator.
