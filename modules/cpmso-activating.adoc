= Activating the control plane machine set custom resource

To use the Control Plane Machine Set Operator, you must ensure that a `ControlPlaneMachineSet` custom resource (CR) with the correct settings for your cluster exists. On a cluster with a generated CR, you must verify that the configuration in the CR is correct for your cluster and activate it.

[NOTE]
====
For more information about the parameters in the CR, see "Control Plane Machine Set Operator configuration".
====

.Procedure

. View the configuration of the CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --namespace openshift-machine-api edit controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io cluster
----

. Change the values of any fields that are incorrect for your cluster configuration.

. When the configuration is correct, activate the CR by setting the `.spec.state` field to `Active` and saving your changes.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To activate the CR, you must change the `.spec.state` field to `Active` in the same `oc edit` session that you use to update the CR configuration. If the CR is saved with the state left as `Inactive`, the control plane machine set generator resets the CR to its original settings.
