= About Red Hat Insights Advisor for {product-title}

You can use the Insights advisor service to assess and monitor the health of your {product-title} clusters. Whether you are concerned about individual clusters, or with your whole infrastructure, it is important to be aware of the exposure of your cluster infrastructure to issues that can affect service availability, fault tolerance, performance, or security.

If the cluster has the Deployment Validation Operator (DVO) installed the recommendations also highlight workloads whose configuration might lead to cluster health issues.

The results of the Insights analysis are available in the Insights advisor service on {hybrid-console}. In the {hybrid-console}, you can perform the following actions:


* View clusters and workloads affected by specific recommendations.
* Use robust filtering capabilities to refine your results to those recommendations.
* Learn more about individual recommendations, details about the risks they present, and get resolutions tailored to your individual clusters.
* Share results with other stakeholders.
