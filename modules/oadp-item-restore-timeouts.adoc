= Implementing item operation timeout - restore

[role="_abstract"]
The `ItemOperationTimeout` setting specifies the time that is used to wait for `RestoreItemAction` operations. The default value is `1h`.

Use the restore `ItemOperationTimeout` for the following scenarios:

* Only with Data Mover 1.2.x.
* For Data Mover uploads and downloads to or from the `BackupStorageLocation`. If the restore action is not completed when the timeout is reached, it will be marked as failed. If Data Mover operations are failing due to timeout issues, because of large storage volume sizes, then this timeout setting may need to be increased.

.Procedure

* Edit the values in the `Restore.spec.itemOperationTimeout` block of the `Restore` CR manifest, as shown in the following example:
