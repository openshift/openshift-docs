= Configuring {product-title}

[role="_abstract"]
Create a new integration in {product-title} by using the webhook URL.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Scroll down to the *Notifier Integrations* section and select *PagerDuty*.
. Click icon:plus[] *New Integration*.
. Enter a name for *Integration Name*.
. Enter the webhook URL in the *Endpoint* field.
. If your webhook receiver uses an untrusted certificate, enter a CA certificate in the *CA Cert* field; otherwise leave it blank.
+
[NOTE]
====
The server certificate used by the webhook receiver must be valid for the endpoint DNS name.
You can turn on the *Skip TLS Verify* toggle to ignore this validation.
Red Hat does not recommend turning off TLS verification.
====
. Optional: Turn on the *Enable Audit Logging* toggle, to receive alerts about all the changes made in {product-title}.
//See link:/docs/integrate-with-other-tools/enable-audit-logging/[Audit Logging] for more information.
+
[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends using separate webhooks for alerts and audit logs to handle these messages differently.
====
. To authenticate with the webhook receiver, enter details for one of the following:
** *Username* and *Password* for basic HTTP authentication
** Custom *Header*, for example: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
. Use *Extra fields* to include additional key-value pairs in the JSON object that {product-title} sends.
For example, if your webhook receiver accepts objects from multiple sources, you can add `"source": "rhacs"` as an extra field and then filter on this value to identify all alerts from {product-title}.
. Select icon:check[] *Test* to send a test message to verify that the integration with your generic webhook is working.
. Select icon:save[] *Create* to create the configuration.
