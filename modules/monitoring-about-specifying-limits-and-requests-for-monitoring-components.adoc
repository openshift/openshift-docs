= About specifying limits and requests for monitoring components

You can configure resource limits and request settings for core platform monitoring components and for the components that monitor user-defined projects, including the following components:

* Alertmanager (for core platform monitoring and for user-defined projects)
* kube-state-metrics
* monitoring-plugin
* node-exporter
* openshift-state-metrics
* Prometheus (for core platform monitoring and for user-defined projects)
* Prometheus Adapter
* Prometheus Operator and its admission webhook service
* Telemeter Client
* Thanos Querier
* Thanos Ruler

By defining resource limits, you limit a container's resource usage, which prevents the container from exceeding the specified maximum values for CPU and memory resources.

By defining resource requests, you specify that a container can be scheduled only on a node that has enough CPU and memory resources available to match the requested resources.
