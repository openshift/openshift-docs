= Specifying how a service is monitored

[role="_abstract"]
To use the metrics exposed by your service, you must configure {product-title} monitoring to scrape metrics from the `/metrics` endpoint. You can do this using a `ServiceMonitor` custom resource definition (CRD) that specifies how a service should be monitored, or a `PodMonitor` CRD that specifies how a pod should be monitored. The former requires a `Service` object, while the latter does not, allowing Prometheus to directly scrape metrics from the metrics endpoint exposed by a pod.

This procedure shows you how to create a `ServiceMonitor` resource for a service in a user-defined project.

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role or the `monitoring-edit` cluster role.
* You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role or the `monitoring-edit` role.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* For this example, you have deployed the `prometheus-example-app` sample service in the `ns1` project.

[NOTE]
====
The `prometheus-example-app` sample service does not support TLS authentication.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for the `ServiceMonitor` resource configuration. In this example, the file is called `example-app-service-monitor.yaml`.

. Add the following `ServiceMonitor` resource configuration details:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    k8s-app: prometheus-example-monitor
  name: prometheus-example-monitor
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  endpoints:
  - interval: 30s
    port: web
    scheme: http
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus-example-app
----
+
This defines a `ServiceMonitor` resource that scrapes the metrics exposed by the `prometheus-example-app` sample service, which includes the `version` metric.
+
[NOTE]
====
A `ServiceMonitor` resource in a user-defined namespace can only discover services in the same namespace. That is, the `namespaceSelector` field of the `ServiceMonitor` resource is always ignored.
====

. Apply the configuration to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-app-service-monitor.yaml
----
+
It takes some time to deploy the `ServiceMonitor` resource.

. You can check that the `ServiceMonitor` resource is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n ns1 get servicemonitor
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                         AGE
prometheus-example-monitor   81m
