[id="virt-accessing-vmi-yaml-ssh_{context}"]
= Accessing a virtual machine instance with a YAML file for SSH

You can use SSH to access a virtual machine (VM) after you expose port 22 on it from its YAML file.

The YAML file forwards a virtual machine instance (VMI) port to a node
port and creates a service for enabled access. The following example creates
the `fedora-vm-ssh` service that forwards traffic from a specific port of cluster nodes to port 22 of the `<fedora-vm>` virtual
machine.

.Prerequisites
* You must be in the same project as the VMI.
* The VMI you want to access must be connected
to the default pod network by using the `masquerade` binding method.
* The VMI you want to access must be running.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure
. Edit the `Service` YAML to configure the settings necessary to create and expose the `Service` object:

+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: fedora-vm-ssh <1>
spec:
  selector:
    <vm_label_key> <vm_label_value> <2>
type: NodePort <3>
ports:
-port:22
...
----
<1> Specify the name of the service you are creating and exposing.
<2> In the `spec` section of the `Service` Yaml, add the values for the `selector`. These values must be identical to the values specified for the key and value in the `spec.template.metadata.labels` section of the YAML file.
<3> Add `22` for `NodePort` to expose the service on SSH port `22`.

. Save the `Service` YAML to store the service configuration for SSH connections.

. Check the service to find out which port the service acquired:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get svc
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME            TYPE       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
fedora-vm-ssh   NodePort   127.0.0.1      <none>        22:32551/TCP   6s
----
+
In this example, the service acquired the `32551` port.

. Log in to the VMI via SSH. Use the `ipAddress` of any of the cluster
nodes and the port that you found in the previous step:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh username@<node_IP_address> -p 32551
