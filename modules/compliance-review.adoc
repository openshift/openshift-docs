= Reviewing a remediation

Review both the `ComplianceRemediation` object and the `ComplianceCheckResult` object that owns the remediation. The `ComplianceCheckResult` object contains human-readable descriptions of what the check does and the hardening trying to prevent, as well as other `metadata` like the severity and the associated security controls. The `ComplianceRemediation` object represents a way to fix the problem described in the `ComplianceCheckResult`. After first scan, check for remediations with the state `MissingDependencies`.

Below is an example of a check and a remediation called `sysctl-net-ipv4-conf-all-accept-redirects`. This example is redacted to only show `spec` and `status` and omits `metadata`:

[source,yaml]

  apply: false

  outdated: {}

  applicationState: NotApplied
----

The remediation payload is stored in the `spec.current` attribute. The payload can be any Kubernetes object, but because this remediation was produced by a node scan, the remediation payload in the above example is a `MachineConfig` object. For Platform scans, the remediation payload is often a different kind of an object (for example, a `ConfigMap` or `Secret` object), but typically applying that remediation is up to the administrator, because otherwise the Compliance Operator would have required a very broad set of permissions to manipulate any generic Kubernetes object. An example of remediating a Platform check is provided later in the text.

To see exactly what the remediation does when applied, the `MachineConfig` object contents use the Ignition objects for the configuration. Refer to the link:https://coreos.github.io/ignition/specs/[Ignition specification] for further information about the format. In our example, `the spec.config.storage.files[0].path` attribute specifies the file that is being create by this remediation (`/etc/sysctl.d/75-sysctl_net_ipv4_conf_all_accept_redirects.conf`) and the `spec.config.storage.files[0].contents.source` attribute specifies the contents of that file.

The contents of the files are URL-encoded.
