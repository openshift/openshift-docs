= Creating {op-system-first} machines using an ISO image

Before you install a user provisioned infrastructure (UPI) cluster on bare
metal, you must create {op-system} machines for it to use. You can use an
ISO image to create the machines.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* Have access to an HTTP server that you can access from your computer and that
the machines that you create can access.

.Procedure

////
This will work for GA.
. Obtain the {op-system} images from the
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads[Product Downloads] page on the Red
Hat customer portal.
////

. Upload the control plane, compute, and bootstrap Ignition config files that the
installation program created to your HTTP server. Note the URLs of these files.

. Obtain the {op-system} ISO image:
+
----
$ curl -J -L -O https://releases-art-rhcos.svc.ci.openshift.org/art/storage/releases/ootpa/410.8.20190412.1/rhcos-410.8.20190412.1-installer.iso
----

. Use the ISO to install to start the {op-system} installation. Use one of the following
installation options:
** Burn the ISO image to a disk and boot it directly.
** Use ISO redirection via a LOM interface.

. After the instance boots, press the `TAB` or `E` key to edit the kernel command line.
. Add the parameters to the kernel command line:
+
----
coreos.inst=yes
coreos.inst.install_dev=sda <1>
coreos.inst.image_url=https://releases-art-rhcos.svc.ci.openshift.org/art/storage/releases/ootpa/410.8.20190412.1/rhcos-410.8.20190412.1-<ext> <2>
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://example.com/config.ign <3>
----
<1> Specify the block device of the system to install to.
<2> Specify the URL of the image. Replace `<ext>` with the extension that
corresponds to your required file type, either `metal-bios.raw` or `metal-uefi.raw`.
<3> Specify the URL of the Ignition config file for this machine type.

. Press Enter to complete the installation. After {op-system} installs, the system
reboots. After the system reboots, it applies the Ignition config file that you
specified.

. Continue to create the machines for your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create the boostrap and control plane machines at this time. To simplify
machine management after installation, also create some compute machines.
