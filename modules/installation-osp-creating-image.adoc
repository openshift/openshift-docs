= Creating the {op-system-first} image

The {product-title} installer requires that a {op-system-first} image be present in the OpenStack cluster. Retrieve the latest {op-system} image, then upload it using the OpenStack CLI.

.Procedure
//Links not valid--release images aren't posted yet. 
. Download the latest {op-system} image from the https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[Product Downloads] page of the Red Hat customer portal or the https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.2/[{op-system} image mirror page].

. From the image you downloaded, create an image named `rhcos` to your cluster by using the OpenStack CLI:
+
[source,sh]
----
$ openstack image create --container-format=bare --disk-format=qcow2 --file rhcos-${RHCOSVERSION}-openstack.qcow2 rhcos
----

[CAUTION]
If the installer finds multiple images with the same name, it will choose one of them at random. To avoid this behavior, create unique names for resources in OpenStack. 

[NOTE]
Depending on your OpenStack environment, the image can be in either `qcow2` or `raw` formats. If your environment requires the `raw` format, substitute `raw` for `qcow2` in the preceding example. For more information about image formats, see https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/image-formats.html[Disk and container formats for images].

After you upload the image to OpenStack, it's available to the installer.
