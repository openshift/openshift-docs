= Deploying the default {ProductName} strategy from the web console

The custom resource definition (CRD) defines the configuration used when you deploy an instance of {ProductName}. The default CR for Jaeger is named `jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory` and it is configured with minimal resources to ensure that you can successfully install it on a default {product-title} installation. You can use this default configuration to create a Jaeger instance that uses the `AllInOne` deployment strategy, or you can define your own custom resource file.

[NOTE]
====
In-memory storage is not persistent, which means that if the Jaeger pod shuts down, restarts, or is replaced, that your trace data will be lost.  For persistent storage, you must use the `production` or `streaming` strategies, which use Elasticsearch as the default storage.
====


.Prerequisites

* The {ProductName} operator must be installed.
* Review the instructions for how to customize the Jaeger installation.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

[NOTE]
====
Jaeger streaming is currently unsupported on IBM Z.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Create a new project, for example `jaeger-system`.

.. Navigate to *Home* -> *Projects*.

.. Click *Create Project*.

.. Enter `jaeger-system` in the *Name* field.

.. Click *Create*.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. If necessary, select `jaeger-system` from the Project menu.  You may have to wait a few moments for the Operators to be copied to the new project.

. Click the {ProductName} Operator. On the *Overview* tab, under *Provided APIs*, the Operator provides a single link.

. Under *Jaeger* click *Create Instance*.

. On the *Create Jaeger* page, to install using the defaults, click *Create* to create the Jaeger instance.

. On the *Jaegers* page, click the name of the Jaeger instance, for example, `jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory`.

. On the *Jaeger Details* page, click the *Resources* tab.  Wait until the Pod has a status of "Running" before continuing.

== Deploying default Jaeger from the CLI

Follow this procedure to create an instance of Jaeger from the command line.

.Prerequisites

* An installed, verified {ProductName} Operator.
* Access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) that matches your {product-title} version.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login https://{HOSTNAME}:8443
----

. Create a new project named `jaeger-system`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project jaeger-system
----

. Create a custom resource file named `jaeger.yaml` that contains the following text:
+
.Example jaeger-all-in-one.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory
----

. Run the following command to deploy Jaeger:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n jaeger-system -f jaeger.yaml
----

. Run the following command to watch the progress of the pods during the installation process:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n jaeger-system -w
----
+
Once the installation process has completed, you should see output similar to the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory-cdff7897b-qhfdx   2/2     Running   0          24s
