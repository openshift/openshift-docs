= Creating a MachineSet

In addition to the ones created by the installation program, you can create
your own MachineSets to dynamically manage the machine compute resources for
specific workloads of your choice.

.Prerequisites

* Deploy an {product-title} cluster.
* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`
* Log in to `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. Create a new YAML file that contains the MachineSet Custom Resource sample,
as shown, and is named `<file_name>.yaml`.
+
Ensure that you set the `<clusterID>` and `<role>` parameter values.

.. If you are not sure about which value to set for an specific field, you can
check an existing MachineSet from your cluster.

When the new MachineSet is available, the `DESIRED` and `CURRENT` values match.
If the MachineSet is not available, wait a few minutes and run the command again.

. After the new MachineSet is available, check status of the machine and the
node that it references:
+
----
$ oc describe machine <name> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc describe machine agl030519-vplxk-infra-us-east-1a -n openshift-machine-api

----

. View the new node and confirm that the new node has the label that you
specified:
+
----
$ oc get node <node_name> --show-labels
----
+
Review the command output and confirm that `node-role.kubernetes.io/<your_label>`
is in the `LABELS` list.

[NOTE]
====
Any change to a MachineSet is not applied to existing machines owned by the MachineSet.
For example, labels edited or added to an existing MachineSet are not propagated to existing machines and Nodes
associated with the MachineSet.
====

.Next steps
If you need MachineSets in other availability zones, repeat this
process to create more MachineSets.
