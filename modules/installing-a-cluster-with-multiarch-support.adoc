= Installing a cluster with multi-architecture support

You can install a cluster with the support for configuring multi-architecture compute machines.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {oc-first}.
* You have the {product-title} installation program.
* You downloaded the pull secret for your cluster.

.Procedure

. Check that the `openshift-install` binary is using the `multi` payload by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install version
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
./openshift-install 4.17.0
built from commit abc123etc
release image quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:abc123wxyzetc
release architecture multi
default architecture amd64
----
+
The output must contain `release architecture multi` to indicate that the `openshift-install` binary is using the `multi` payload.

. Update the `install-config.yaml` file to configure the architecture for the nodes.
