[id="verifying-cluster-install-oci-agent-based_{context}"]
= Verifying that your Agent-based cluster installation runs on {oci}

Verify that your cluster was installed and is running effectively on {oci-first}.

.Prerequisites

* You created all the required {oci} resources and services. See the "Creating OCI infrastructure resources and services" section.
* You created `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` configuration files. See the "Creating configuration files for installing a cluster on OCI" section.
* You uploaded the agent ISO image to Oracle’s default Object Storage bucket, and you created a compute instance on {oci}. For more information, see "Running a cluster on OCI".

.Procedure

After you deploy the compute instance on a self-managed node in your {product-title} cluster, you can monitor the cluster’s status by choosing one of the following options:

* From the {product-title} CLI, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install agent wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
----
+
Check the status of the `rendezvous` host node that runs the bootstrap node.  After the host reboots, the host forms part of the cluster.
+
* Use the `kubeconfig` API to check the status of various {product-title} components. For the  `KUBECONFIG` environment variable, set the relative path of the cluster’s `kubeconfig` configuration file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  export KUBECONFIG=~/auth/kubeconfig
----
+
Check the status of each of the cluster’s self-managed nodes. CCM applies a label to each node to designate the node as running in a cluster on {oci}.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -A

Check the status of each of the cluster’s Operators, with the CCM Operator status being a good indicator that your cluster is running.
