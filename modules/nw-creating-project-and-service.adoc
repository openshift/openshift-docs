= Creating a project and service

If the project and service that you want to expose does not exist, create the project and then create the service.

If the project and service already exists, skip to the procedure on exposing the service to create a route.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {oc-first} and log in as a cluster administrator.

.Procedure

. Create a new project for your service by running the `oc new-project` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project <project_name>
----

. Use the `oc new-app` command to create your service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app nodejs:12~https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex.git
----

. To verify that the service was created, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get svc -n <project_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
