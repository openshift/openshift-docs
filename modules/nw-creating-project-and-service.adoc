= Creating a project and service

If the project and service that you want to expose do not exist, first create
the project, then the service.

If the project and service already exist, skip to the procedure on exposing the
service to create a route.

.Prerequisites

* Install the `oc` CLI and log in as a cluster administrator.

.Procedure

. Create a new project for your service by running the `oc new-project` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project myproject
----

. Use the `oc new-app` command to create your service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app nodejs:12~https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex.git
----

. To verify that the service was created, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get svc -n myproject
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
nodejs-ex   ClusterIP   172.30.197.157   <none>        8080/TCP   70s
----
+
By default, the new service does not have an external IP address.
