[id="ztp-workload-partitioning-sno_{context}"]
= Workload partitioning in {sno} with {ztp}

Workload partitioning configures {product-title} services, cluster management workloads, and infrastructure pods to run on a reserved number of host CPUs.

To configure workload partitioning with {ztp-first}, you specify cluster management CPU resources with the `cpuset` field of the `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) and the `reserved` field of the group `PolicyGenTemplate` CR.
The {ztp} pipeline uses these values to populate the required fields in the workload partitioning `MachineConfig` CR (`cpuset`) and the `PerformanceProfile` CR (`reserved`) that configure the {sno} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
For maximum performance, ensure that the `reserved` and `isolated` CPU sets do not share CPU cores across NUMA zones.
====

* The workload partitioning `MachineConfig` CR pins the {product-title} infrastructure pods to a defined `cpuset` configuration.
* The `PerformanceProfile` CR pins the systemd services to the reserved CPUs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The value for the `reserved` field specified in the `PerformanceProfile` CR must match the `cpuset` field in the workload partitioning `MachineConfig` CR.
