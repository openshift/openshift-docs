[id="ztp-workload-partitioning-sno_{context}"]
= Workload partitioning in {sno} with {ztp}

Workload partitioning configures {product-title} services, cluster management workloads, and infrastructure pods to run on a reserved number of host CPUs.

To configure workload partitioning with {ztp-first}, you configure a `cpuPartitioningMode` field in the `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) that you use to install the cluster and you apply a `PerformanceProfile` CR that configures the `isolated` and `reserved` CPUs on the host.

Configuring the `SiteConfig` CR enables workload partitioning at cluster installation time and applying the `PerformanceProfile` CR configures the specific allocation of CPUs to reserved and isolated sets.
Both of these steps happen at different points during cluster provisioning.

[NOTE]
====
Configuring workload partitioning by using the `cpuPartitioningMode` field in the `SiteConfig` CR is a Tech Preview feature in {product-title} 4.13.

Alternatively, you can specify cluster management CPU resources with the `cpuset` field of the `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) and the `reserved` field of the group `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` CR.
The {ztp} pipeline uses these values to populate the required fields in the workload partitioning `MachineConfig` CR (`cpuset`) and the `PerformanceProfile` CR (`reserved`) that configure the {sno} cluster.
This method is a General Availability feature in {product-title} 4.14.
====

The workload partitioning configuration pins the {product-title} infrastructure pods to the `reserved` CPU set.
Platform services such as systemd, CRI-O, and kubelet run on the `reserved` CPU set.
The `isolated` CPU sets are exclusively allocated to your container workloads.
Isolating CPUs ensures that the workload has guaranteed access to the specified CPUs without contention from other applications running on the same node.
All CPUs that are not isolated should be reserved.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that `reserved` and `isolated` CPU sets do not overlap with each other.
