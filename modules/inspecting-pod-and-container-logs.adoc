= Inspecting pod and container logs

You can inspect pod and container logs for warnings and error messages related to explicit pod failures. Depending on policy and exit code, pod and container logs remain available after pods have been terminated.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Your API service is still functional.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Query logs for a specific pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs <pod_name>
----

. Query logs for a specific container within a pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs <pod_name> -c <container_name>
----
+
Logs retrieved using the preceding `oc logs` commands are composed of messages sent to stdout within pods or containers.

. Inspect logs contained in `/var/log/` within a pod.
.. List log files and subdirectories contained in `/var/log` within a pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec <pod_name> ls -alh /var/log
----
+
.. Query a specific log file contained in `/var/log` within a pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec <pod_name> cat /var/log/<path_to_log>
----
.. List log files and subdirectories contained in `/var/log` within a specific container:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec <pod_name> -c <container_name> ls /var/log
----
+
