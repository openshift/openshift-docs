[id="installation-using-azure-managed-identities_{context}"]
= Using {azure-short} managed identities

The installation program requires an {azure-short} identity to complete the installation. You can use either a system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity.

If you are unable to use a managed identity, you can use a service principal.

.Procedure

. If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, enable it on the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
. If you are using a user-assigned managed identity:
.. Assign it to the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
.. Record its client ID. You require this value when installing the cluster.
+

. Verify that the required permissions are assigned to the managed identity.
