= Using Azure managed identities

The installation program requires an Azure identity to complete the installation. You can use either a system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity.

If you are unable to use a managed identity, you can use a service principal.

.Procedure

. If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, enable it on the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
. If you are using a user-assigned managed identity:
.. Assign it to the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
.. Record its client ID. You require this value when installing the cluster.
+
For more information about viewing the details of a user-assigned managed identity, see the Microsoft Azure documentation for link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-azp#list-user-assigned-managed-identities[listing user-assigned managed identities].
. Verify that the required permissions are assigned to the managed identity.
