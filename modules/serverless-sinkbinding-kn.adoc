= Using SinkBinding with the Knative CLI (`kn`)

This guide describes the steps required to create, manage, and delete a SinkBinding instance using `kn` commands.

.Prerequisites

* You have Knative Serving and Eventing installed.
* You have the `kn` CLI installed.

[NOTE]
====
The following procedure requires you to create YAML files.

If you change the names of the YAML files from those used in the examples, you must ensure that you also update the corresponding CLI commands.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before developers can use a SinkBinding, cluster administrators must label the namespace that will be configured in the SinkBinding with `bindings.knative.dev/include:"true"`:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label namespace <namespace> bindings.knative.dev/include=true
----
====

.Procedure

. To check that SinkBinding is set up correctly, create a Knative event display service, or event sink, that dumps incoming messages to its log:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service create event-display --image quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:latest
----

. Create a SinkBinding that directs events to the service:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn source binding create bind-heartbeat --subject Job:batch/v1:app=heartbeat-cron --sink ksvc:event-display
----

. Create a CronJob.
.. Create a file named `heartbeats-cronjob.yaml` and copy the following sample code into it:
+

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: heartbeat-cron
spec:
spec:
  # Run every minute
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: heartbeat-cron
        bindings.knative.dev/include: "true"
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          restartPolicy: Never
          containers:
            - name: single-heartbeat
              image: quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-heartbeats:latest
              args:
                - --period=1
              env:
                - name: ONE_SHOT
                  value: "true"
                - name: POD_NAME
                  valueFrom:
                    fieldRef:
                      fieldPath: metadata.name
                - name: POD_NAMESPACE
                  valueFrom:
                    fieldRef:
                      fieldPath: metadata.namespace
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To use SinkBinding, you must manually add a `bindings.knative.dev/include=true` label to your Knative resources.

For example, to add this label to a CronJob instance, add the following lines to the Job resource YAML definition:

[source,yaml]
----
  jobTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: heartbeat-cron
        bindings.knative.dev/include: "true"
----

====

+
.. After you have created the `heartbeats-cronjob.yaml` file, apply it by entering:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f heartbeats-cronjob.yaml
----

. Check that the controller is mapped correctly by entering the following command and inspecting the output:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn source binding describe bind-heartbeat
----

+
.Example output
+

[source,terminal]
----
Name:         bind-heartbeat
Namespace:    demo-2
Annotations:  sources.knative.dev/creator=minikube-user, sources.knative.dev/lastModifier=minikub ...
Age:          2m
Subject:
  Resource:   job (batch/v1)
  Selector:
    app:      heartbeat-cron
Sink:
  Name:       event-display
  Resource:   Service (serving.knative.dev/v1)

Conditions:
  OK TYPE     AGE REASON
  ++ Ready     2m
----

.Verification steps

You can verify that the Kubernetes events were sent to the Knative event sink by looking at the message dumper function logs.

* View the message dumper function logs by entering the following commands:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs $(oc get pod -o name | grep event-display) -c user-container
----

+
.Example output
