= Creating a sink binding by using the Knative CLI

You can use the `kn source binding create` command to create a sink binding by using the Knative (`kn`) CLI. Using the Knative CLI to create event sources provides a more streamlined and intuitive user interface than modifying YAML files directly.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Serving and Knative Eventing are installed on the cluster.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* Install the Knative (`kn`) CLI.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

[NOTE]
====
The following procedure requires you to create YAML files.

If you change the names of the YAML files from those used in the examples, you must ensure that you also update the corresponding CLI commands.
====

.Procedure

. To check that sink binding is set up correctly, create a Knative event display service, or event sink, that dumps incoming messages to its log:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service create event-display --image quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:latest
----

. Create a sink binding instance that directs events to the service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn source binding create bind-heartbeat --subject Job:batch/v1:app=heartbeat-cron --sink ksvc:event-display
----

. Create a `CronJob` object.

.. Create a cron job YAML file:
+
.Example cron job YAML file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: heartbeat-cron
spec:
  # Run every minute
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: heartbeat-cron
        bindings.knative.dev/include: "true"
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          restartPolicy: Never
          containers:
            - name: single-heartbeat
              image: quay.io/openshift-knative/heartbeats:latest
              args:
                - --period=1
              env:
                - name: ONE_SHOT
                  value: "true"
                - name: POD_NAME
                  valueFrom:
                    fieldRef:
                      fieldPath: metadata.name
                - name: POD_NAMESPACE
                  valueFrom:
                    fieldRef:
                      fieldPath: metadata.namespace

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use sink binding, you must manually add a `bindings.knative.dev/include=true` label to your Knative CRs.

For example, to add this label to a `CronJob` CR, add the following lines to the `Job` CR YAML definition:

[source,yaml]
----
  jobTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: heartbeat-cron
        bindings.knative.dev/include: "true"
----

====
+
.. Create the cron job:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

. Check that the controller is mapped correctly by entering the following command and inspecting the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn source binding describe bind-heartbeat
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Name:         bind-heartbeat
Namespace:    demo-2

  Resource:   Service (serving.knative.dev/v1)

Conditions:

  ++ Ready     2m

.Verification

You can verify that the Kubernetes events were sent to the Knative event sink by looking at the message dumper function logs.

* View the message dumper function logs by entering the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs $(oc get pod -o name | grep event-display) -c user-container
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
