.Procedure

* Check your subnets provided in the `platform.aws.subnets` parameter during installation. The subnets must be a part of the same machine Network CIDR ranges that you specify.
** For a standard cluster, specify a public and a private subnet for each availability zone.
** For a private cluster, specify a private subnet for each availability zone.

For more information about AWS VPC and subnet requirements and optional parameters, see the _VPC_ section in the _AWS prerequisites for ROSA_ guide.
