= Configuring hosts

After booting the hosts with the discovery ISO, the hosts will appear in the table at the bottom of the page. You can configure the hostname, role, and installation disk for each host.

.Procedure

. Select a host.

. From the *Actions* list, select *Change hostname*. You must ensure each host has a valid and unique hostname. If necessary, enter a new name for the host and click *Change*.

. For multi-host clusters, in the *Role* column next to the host name, you can click on the menu to change the role of the host.
+
If you do not select a role, the {ai-full} will assign the role automatically. The minimum hardware requirements for control plane nodes exceed that of worker nodes. If you assign a role to a host, ensure that you assign the control plane role to hosts that meet the minimum hardware requirements.

. To the left of the checkbox next to a host name, click to expand the host details. If you have multiple disk drives, you can select a different disk drive to act as the installation disk.

. Repeat this procedure for each host.

Once all cluster hosts appear with a status of *Ready*, proceed to the next step.
