= Deployment specifications for MetalLB

When you start an instance of MetalLB using the `MetalLB` custom resource, you can configure deployment specifications in the `MetalLB` custom resource to manage how the `controller` or `speaker` pods deploy and run in your cluster. Use these deployment specifications to manage the following tasks:

* Select nodes for MetalLB pod deployment.
* Manage scheduling by using pod priority and pod affinity.
* Assign CPU limits for MetalLB pods.
* Assign a container RuntimeClass for MetalLB pods.
* Assign metadata for MetalLB pods.
