= Rolling back an image-based upgrade on managed clusters at scale

Roll back the changes on a set of managed clusters if you encounter unresolvable issues after a successful upgrade.
You need to create a separate `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR and define the set of managed clusters that you want to roll back.

include::snippets/ibu-supported-action-combinations.adoc[]

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a separate YAML file on the hub cluster that contains the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lcm.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageBasedGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: <filename>
  namespace: default
spec:
  clusterLabelSelectors:
  - matchExpressions:
    - key: name
      operator: In
      values:
      - spoke4
  ibuSpec:
    seedImageRef:
      image: quay.io/seed/image:4.17.0-rc.1
      version: 4.17.0-rc.1
      pullSecretRef:
        name: "<seed_pull_secret>"
  extraManifests:
    - name: example-extra-manifests
      namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent
  oadpContent:
    - name: oadp-cm
      namespace: openshift-adp
  plan:
  - actions: ["Rollback", "FinalizeRollback"]
    rolloutStrategy:
      maxConcurrency: 200
      timeout: 2400
----

. Apply the created file by running the following command on the hub cluster:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----

All managed clusters that match the defined labels are moved back to the `Rollback` and then the `Idle` stages to finalize the rollback. 
--

.Verification

* Monitor the status updates by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ibgu -o yaml
----

.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
status:
  clusters:
  - completedActions:
    - action: Rollback
    - action: FinalizeRollback
    name: spoke4
# ...
