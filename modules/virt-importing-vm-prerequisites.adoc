= Prerequisites for importing a virtual machine

Importing a virtual machine from Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) into {VirtProductName} has the following prerequisites:

* You must have admin user privileges.
* Storage:
** The {VirtProductName} local and shared persistent storage classes must support VM import.
** If you are using Ceph RBD block-mode volumes, the storage must be large enough to accommodate the virtual disk. If the disk is too large for the available storage, the import process fails and the PV that is used to copy the virtual disk is not released.

* Networks:
** The RHV and {VirtProductName} networks must either have the same name or be mapped to each other.
** The RHV VM network interface must be `e1000`, `rtl8139`, or `virtio`.

* VM disks:
** The disk interface must be `sata`, `virtio_scsi`, or `virtio`.
** The disk must not be configured as a direct LUN.
** The disk status must not be `illegal` or `locked`.
** The storage type must be `image`.
** SCSI reservation must be disabled.
** `ScsiGenericIO` must be disabled.

* VM configuration:
** If the VM uses GPU resources, the nodes providing the GPUs must be configured.
** The VM must not be configured for vGPU resources.
** The VM must not have snapshots with disks in an `illegal` state.
** The VM must not have been created with {product-title} and subsequently added to RHV.
** The VM must not be configured for USB devices.
** The watchdog model must not be `diag288`.
