= Prerequisites for importing a virtual machine

ifdef::virt-importing-rhv-vm[]
Importing a virtual machine from Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) into {VirtProductName} has the following prerequisites.

== Red Hat Virtualization prerequisites

The Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) environment has the following prerequisites for VM import:

* Network:

** The VM network must be mapped to a single network in the {product-title} environment. The networks must either have the same name or be mapped to each other.
** The network interface must be `e1000`, `rtl8139`, or `virtio`.

* Disk:

** The disk interface must be `sata`, `virtio_scsi`, or `virtio`.
** The disk must not be configured as a direct LUN.
** The disk status must not be `illegal` or `locked`.
** The storage type must be `image`.
** SCSI reservation must be disabled.
** `ScsiGenericIO` must be disabled.

* Configuration:

** If the VM uses GPU resources, the nodes providing the GPUs must be configured.
** The VM must not be configured for vGPU resources.
** The BIOS type must be `Q35 Chipset with Legacy BIOS`.
** The custom emulated machine must be `Q35`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Virtual machines created with RHV 4.4 emulate the Intel Q35 chipset by default. However, you must update older virtual machines in the RHV 4.4 cluster.
====

** The VM must not have snapshots with disks in an `illegal` state.
** The VM must not have been created with {product-title} and subsequently added to RHV.
** The VM must not be configured for USB devices.
** The watchdog model must not be `diag288`.

== {VirtProductName} prerequisites

The {VirtProductName} environment has the following prerequisites for VM import:

ifdef::virt-importing-vmware-vm[]
Importing a VMware VM into {VirtProductName} has the following prerequisites:

* You must have access to an image registry.
* You must create a VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) image, push it to an image registry, and add it to the `v2v-vmware` ConfigMap.
* You must power off the VMware virtual machine before you import it.
* The VM name must not contain a forward slash (`/`).
* You must have sufficient storage space for the imported disk.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you try to import a virtual machine with a disk that is larger than the available storage space, the operation cannot complete. You will not be able to import another virtual machine or to clean up the storage because there are insufficient resources to support object deletion. To resolve this situation, you must add more object storage devices to the storage backend.
====

* Virtual disks must be connected to an IDE or SCSI controller. If a disk is connected to a SATA controller, you can change it to an IDE controller and then migrate the VM.
* The {VirtProductName} egress network policy must allow the following traffic:

|Destination |Protocol |Port
|VMware ESXi hosts |TCP |443
|VMware ESXi hosts |TCP |902
|VMware vCenter |TCP |5840
|===
endif::[]
* You must be an admin user.
* The local and shared persistent storage must support VM import.
