= Troubleshooting a Kubernetes cryptic error when viewing the Kibana console

When attempting to visit the Kibana console, you may receive a browser
error instead:

----
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"The request is missing a required parameter,
 includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed."}
----

This can be caused by a mismatch between the OAuth2 client and server. The
return address for the client must be in a whitelist so the server can securely
redirect back after logging in.

Fix this issue by replacing the OAuthClient entry. 

.Procedure

To replace the OAuthClient entry:

. Run the following command to delete the current OAuthClient: 
+
----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
----

If the problem persists, check that you are accessing Kibana at a URL listed in
the OAuth client. This issue can be caused by accessing the URL at a forwarded
port, such as 1443 instead of the standard 443 HTTPS port. You can adjust the
server whitelist by editing the OAuth client:

----
$ oc edit oauthclient/kibana-proxy
----
