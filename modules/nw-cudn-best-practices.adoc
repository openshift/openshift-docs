= Best practices for ClusterUserDefinedNetwork CRs

Before setting up a `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource (CR), users should consider the following information:

* A `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR is intended for use by cluster administrators and should not be used by non-administrators. If used incorrectly, it might result in security issues with your deployment, cause disruptions, or break the cluster network. 

* `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CRs should not select the `default` namespace. This can result in no isolation and, as a result, could introduce security risks to the cluster.

* `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CRs should not select `openshift-*` namespaces.

* {product-title} administrators should be aware that all namespaces of a cluster are selected when one of the following conditions are met:

** The `matchLabels` selector is left empty.
** The `matchExpressions` selector is left empty.
** The `namespaceSelector` is initialized, but does not specify `matchExpressions` or `matchLabel`. For example: `namespaceSelector: {}`.

* For primary networks, the namespace used for the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR must include the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label. This label cannot be updated, and can only be added when the namespace is created. The following conditions apply with the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` namespace label:

** If the namespace is missing the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label and a pod is created, the pod attaches itself to the default network.

** If the namespace is missing the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label and a primary `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR is created that matches the namespace, an error is reported and the network is not created.

** If the namespace is missing the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label and a primary `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR already exists, a pod in the namespace is created and attached to the default network.

** If the namespace _has_ the label, and a primary `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR does not exist, a pod in the namespace is not created until the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR is created.
