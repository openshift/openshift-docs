= Best practices for ClusterUserDefinedNetwork CRs

Before setting up a `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource (CR), users should consider the following information:

* A `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR is intended for use by cluster administrators and should not be used by non-administrators. If used incorrectly, it might result in security issues with your deployment, cause disruptions, or break the cluster network.

* `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CRs should not select the `default` namespace. This can result in no isolation and, as a result, could introduce security risks to the cluster.

* `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CRs should not select `openshift-*` namespaces.

* {product-title} administrators should be aware that all namespaces of a cluster are selected when one of the following conditions are met:

** The `matchLabels` selector is left empty.
** The `matchExpressions` selector is left empty.
** The `namespaceSelector` is initialized, but does not specify `matchExpressions` or `matchLabel`. For example: `namespaceSelector: {}`.

* For primary networks, the namespace used for the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR must include the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label. This label cannot be updated, and can only be added when the namespace is created. The following conditions apply with the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` namespace label:

** If the namespace is missing the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label and a pod is created, the pod attaches itself to the default network.

** If the namespace is missing the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label and a primary `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR is created that matches the namespace, an error is reported and the network is not created.

** If the namespace is missing the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label and a primary `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR already exists, a pod in the namespace is created and attached to the default network.

** If the namespace _has_ the label, and a primary `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR does not exist, a pod in the namespace is not created until the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR is created.

* When using the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR to create `localnet` topology, the following are best practices for administrators:

** You must make sure that the `spec.network.physicalNetworkName` parameter matches the parameter that you configured in the Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge mapping when you create your CUDN CR. This ensures that you are bridging to the intended segment of your physical network. If you intend to deploy multiple CUDN CR using the same bridge mapping, you must ensure that the same `physicalNetworkName` parameter is used.

** Avoid overlapping subnets between your physical network and your other network interfaces. Overlapping network subnets can cause routing conflicts and network instability. To prevent conflicts when using the `spec.network.localnet.subnets` parameter, you might use the `spec.network.localnet.excludeSubnets` parameter.

** When you configure a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN), you must ensure that both your underlying physical infrastructure (switches, routers, and so on) and your nodes are properly configured to accept VLAN IDs (VIDs). This means that you configure the physical network interface, for example `eth1`, as an access port for the VLAN, for example `20`, that you are connecting to through the physical switch. In addition, you must verify that an OVS bridge mapping, for example `eth1`, exists on your nodes to ensure that the physical interface is properly connected with OVN-Kubernetes.
