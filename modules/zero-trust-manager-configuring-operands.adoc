= Configuring container resources for {zero-trust-full} operands

You can configure the CPU and memory resources for {zero-trust-full} operands to ensure efficient pod scheduling and resource management.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the {zero-trust-full}.

.Procedure

. Patch the `SpireServer` Custom Resource (CR) to set the CPU and memory requests and limits:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch SpireServer cluster --type=merge -p="
spec:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 256Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 200m
      memory: 128Mi
"
----

.Verification
. Verify that the resources were applied by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get statefulset spire-server -n zero-trust-workload-identity-manager -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[*].resources}"
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=server -n zero-trust-workload-identity-manager -o yaml
