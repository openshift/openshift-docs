[id="installation-vsphere-zones-prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites for multiple failure domains

* All failure domains share a common layer 3 network
* You created tag categories `openshift-region` and `openshift-zone` in vCenter.
* Datacenters and compute clusters have tags representing the name of their associated region and/or zone. 

For example, if `datacenter-1` represents `region-a` and `compute-cluster-1` represents `zone-1`, then a tag of category `openshift-region` with a value of `region-a` is applied to `datacenter-1`.  Addtionally, a tag of category `openshift-zone` with a value of `zone-1` is applied to `compute-cluster-1`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If tags are not applied prior to installation, nodes may not be labeled with the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` and `topology.kubernetes.io/region` labels by the cloud provider.

The API and ingress VIPs require that failure domains share a common Layer 3 network.
