= Migrating from Tekton Hub to Artifact Hub

Tekton Hub previously provided a hosted catalog of prebuilt Tekton resources, including Tasks and Pipelines. This service is deprecated in favor of _Artifact Hub_, a centralized catalog for Tekton resources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The hub resolver now defaults to the `artifact` type.
* Tekton Hub (`type: tekton`) requires additional configuration to continue functioning.
