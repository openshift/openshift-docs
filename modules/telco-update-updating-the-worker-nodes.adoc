= Updating the worker nodes

You upgrade the worker nodes after you have updated the control plane by unpausing the relevant `mcp` groups you created.
Unpausing the `mcp` group starts the upgrade process for the worker nodes in that group.
Each of the worker nodes in the cluster reboot to upgrade to the new EUS, y-stream or z-stream version as required.

In the case of Control Plane Only upgrades note that when a worker node is updated it will only require one reboot and will jump <y+2>-release versions. This is a feature that was added to decrease the amount of time that it takes to upgrade large bare-metal clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is a potential holding point.
You can have a cluster version that is fully supported to run in production with the control plane that is updated to a new EUS release while the worker nodes are at a <y-2>-release. This allows large clusters to upgrade in steps across several maintenance windows.
====

. You can check how many nodes are managed in an `mcp` group.
Run the following command to get the list of `mcp` groups:

[NOTE]
====
You decide how many `mcp` groups to upgrade at a time.
This depends on how many CNF pods can be taken down at a time and how your pod disruption budget and anti-affinity settings are configured.

[NOTE]
====
Each `MachineConfigPool` can be unpaused independently. Therefore, if a maintenance window runs out of time other MCPs do not need to be unpaused immediately. The cluster is supported to run with some worker nodes still at <y-2>-release version.

. Unpause the required `mcp` group to begin the upgrade:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch mcp/mcp-1 --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"paused":false}}'
