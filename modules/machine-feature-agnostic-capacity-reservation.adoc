= Capacity Reservation configuration options

{product-title} version {product-version} and later supports
ifdef::azure[on-demand Capacity Reservation with Capacity Reservation groups on {azure-full} clusters.]
ifdef::aws[Capacity Reservations on {aws-full} clusters, including On-Demand Capacity Reservations and Capacity Blocks for ML.]

You can deploy machines on any available resources that match the parameters of a capacity request that you define.
These parameters specify the 
ifdef::azure[VM size,]
ifdef::aws[instance type,]
region, and number of instances that you want to reserve.
If your 
ifdef::azure[{azure-short} subscription quota]
ifdef::aws[Capacity Reservation]
can accommodate the capacity request, the deployment succeeds.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot change an existing Capacity Reservation configuration for a machine set. 
To use a different Capacity Reservation group, you must replace the machine set and the machines that the previous machine set deployed.
