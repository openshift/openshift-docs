= Configuring custom Prometheus metrics by using the {product-title-short} portal

You can configure custom Prometheus metrics for {rh-rhacs-first} by using the {product-title-short} portal.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, click *Platform Configuration* -> *System Configuration*.
. Click *Edit*.
. Scroll down to the *Prometheus metrics configuration* section, and do any of the following tasks:
* To enable metrics gathering:
.. Enter a positive integer for the gathering period in minutes. You can adjust the number by using the up and down arrows in the spin button.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Use a larger value to reduce how often Central gathers metrics, as the process is resource intensive.
====
.. Select one or more predefined metrics from the list of metrics.
* To disable metrics gathering, enter `0`.
. Click *Save*.

.Verification

* To verify that the predefined metric that you enabled is being exposed by Central, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl "$ROX_API_ENDPOINT/metrics" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ROX_API_TOKEN" \
  -s | grep <metric_name> | head
----
+
where:
+
--
`<metric_name>`:: Specifies the predefined metric that you enabled. For example, `rox_central_image_vuln_deployment_severity`.
+
The `grep` command filters the output for the predefined metric.
+
The `head` command limits the output to the first few matching lines for readability.
--
+
The output shows the predefined metric aggregated by cluster, namespace, and severity, indicating the number of vulnerabilities for each combination.
