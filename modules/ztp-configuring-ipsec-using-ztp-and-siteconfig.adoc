= Configuring IPsec encryption for {sno} clusters using {ztp} and ClusterInstance resources

You can enable IPsec encryption in managed {sno} clusters that you install using {ztp} and {rh-rhacm-first}.
You can encrypt traffic between the managed cluster and IPsec endpoints external to the managed cluster. All network traffic between nodes on the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network is encrypted with IPsec in Transport mode.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can also configure IPsec encryption for {sno} clusters with an additional worker node by following this procedure. It is recommended to use the `MachineConfig` custom resource (CR) to configure IPsec encryption for {sno} clusters and {sno} clusters with an additional worker node because of their low resource availability. 
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have installed the SiteConfig Operator in the hub cluster.

* You have configured {rh-rhacm} and the hub cluster for generating the required installation and policy custom resources (CRs) for managed clusters.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the Argo CD application.

* You have installed the `butane` utility version 0.20.0 or later.

* You have a PKCS#12 certificate for the IPsec endpoint and a CA cert in PEM format.

.Procedure

. Extract the latest version of the `ztp-site-generate` container source and merge it with your repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.

. Configure `optional-extra-manifest/ipsec/ipsec-endpoint-config.yaml` with the required values that configure IPsec in the cluster. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
interfaces:
- name: hosta_conn
  type: ipsec
  libreswan:
    left: '%defaultroute'
    leftid: '%fromcert'
    leftmodecfgclient: false
    leftcert: left_server <1>
    leftrsasigkey: '%cert'
    right: <external_host> <2>
    rightid: '%fromcert'
    rightrsasigkey: '%cert'
    rightsubnet: <external_address> <3>
    ikev2: insist <4>
    type: tunnel
----
<1> The value of this field must match with the name of the certificate used on the remote system.
<2> Replace `<external_host>` with the external host IP address or DNS hostname.
<3> Replace `<external_address>` with the IP subnet of the external host on the other side of the IPsec tunnel.
<4> Use the IKEv2 VPN encryption protocol only. Do not use IKEv1, which is deprecated.

. Add the following certificates to the `optional-extra-manifest/ipsec` folder:

** `left_server.p12`: The certificate bundle for the IPsec endpoints

** `ca.pem`: The certificate authority that you signed your certificates with
+
The certificate files are required for the Network Security Services (NSS) database on each host. These files are imported as part of the Butane configuration in later steps.

. Open a shell prompt at the `optional-extra-manifest/ipsec` folder of the Git repository where you maintain your custom site configuration data.

. Run the `optional-extra-manifest/ipsec/build.sh` script to generate the required Butane and `MachineConfig` CRs files.
+
If the PKCS#12 certificate is protected with a password, set the `-W` argument.
+

----
<1> The `ipsec/build.sh` script generates the Butane and endpoint configuration CRs.
<2> You provide `ca.pem` and `left_server.p12` certificate files that are relevant to your network.

. Create an `ipsec-manifests/` folder in the repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
Add the `enable-ipsec.yaml` and `99-ipsec-*` YAML files to the directory.
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
site-configs/
  ├── hub-1/
  │   └── clusterinstance-site1-sno-du.yaml
  ├── ipsec-manifests/
  │   ├── enable-ipsec.yaml
  │   ├── 99-ipsec-worker-endpoint-config.yaml
  │   └── 99-ipsec-master-endpoint-config.yaml
  └── kustomization.yaml
----

. Create a `kustomization.yaml` file that uses `configMapGenerator` to package your IPsec manifests into a `ConfigMap`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - hub-1/clusterinstance-site1-sno-du.yaml
configMapGenerator:
  - name: ipsec-manifests-cm
    namespace: site1-sno-du <1>
    files:
      - ipsec-manifests/enable-ipsec.yaml
      - ipsec-manifests/99-ipsec-master-endpoint-config.yaml
      - ipsec-manifests/99-ipsec-worker-endpoint-config.yaml
generatorOptions:
  disableNameSuffixHash: true <2>
----
<1> The namespace must match the `ClusterInstance` namespace.
<2> Disables the hash suffix so the `ConfigMap` name is predictable.

. In your `ClusterInstance` CR, reference the `ConfigMap` in the `extraManifestsRefs` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: siteconfig.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterInstance
metadata:
  name: "site1-sno-du"
  namespace: "site1-sno-du"
spec:
  clusterName: "site1-sno-du"
  networkType: "OVNKubernetes"
  extraManifestsRefs:
    - name: ipsec-manifests-cm <1>
# ...
----
<1> Reference to the `ConfigMap` containing the IPsec manifests.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you have other extra manifests, you can either include them in the same `ConfigMap` or create multiple `ConfigMap` resources and reference each of those in the `extraManifestsRefs` field.
====

. Commit the `ClusterInstance` CR, IPsec manifest files, and `kustomization.yaml` changes in your Git repository and push the changes to provision the managed cluster and configure IPsec encryption.
+
The Argo CD pipeline detects the changes and begins the managed cluster deployment.
+
During cluster provisioning, the SiteConfig Operator applies the CRs contained in the referenced `ConfigMap` resources as extra manifests.
