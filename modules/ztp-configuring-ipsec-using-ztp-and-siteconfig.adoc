= Configuring IPsec encryption for {sno} clusters using {ztp} and SiteConfig resources

You can enable IPsec encryption in managed {sno} clusters that you install using {ztp} and {rh-rhacm-first}.
You can encrypt traffic between the managed cluster and IPsec endpoints external to the managed cluster. All network traffic between nodes on the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network is encrypted with IPsec in Transport mode.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can also configure IPsec encryption for {sno} clusters with an additional worker node by following this procedure. It is recommended to use the `MachineConfig` custom resource (CR) to configure IPsec encryption for {sno} clusters and {sno} clusters with an additional worker node because of their low resource availability. 
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have configured {rh-rhacm} and the hub cluster for generating the required installation and policy custom resources (CRs) for managed clusters.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the Argo CD application.

* You have installed the `butane` utility version 0.20.0 or later.

* You have a PKCS#12 certificate for the IPsec endpoint and a CA cert in PEM format.

.Procedure

. Extract the latest version of the `ztp-site-generate` container source and merge it with your repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.

. Configure `optional-extra-manifest/ipsec/ipsec-endpoint-config.yaml` with the required values that configure IPsec in the cluster. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
interfaces:
- name: hosta_conn
  type: ipsec
  libreswan:
    left: '%defaultroute'
    leftid: '%fromcert'
    leftmodecfgclient: false
    leftcert: left_server <1>
    leftrsasigkey: '%cert'
    right: <external_host> <2>
    rightid: '%fromcert'
    rightrsasigkey: '%cert'
    rightsubnet: <external_address> <3>
    ikev2: insist <4>
    type: tunnel
----
<1> The value of this field must match with the name of the certificate used on the remote system.
<2> Replace `<external_host>` with the external host IP address or DNS hostname.
<3> Replace `<external_address>` with the IP subnet of the external host on the other side of the IPsec tunnel.
<4> Use the IKEv2 VPN encryption protocol only. Do not use IKEv1, which is deprecated.

. Add the following certificates to the `optional-extra-manifest/ipsec` folder:

** `left_server.p12`: The certificate bundle for the IPsec endpoints

** `ca.pem`: The certificate authority that you signed your certificates with
+
The certificate files are required for the Network Security Services (NSS) database on each host. These files are imported as part of the Butane configuration in later steps.

. Open a shell prompt at the `optional-extra-manifest/ipsec` folder of the Git repository where you maintain your custom site configuration data.

. Run the `optional-extra-manifest/ipsec/build.sh` script to generate the required Butane and `MachineConfig` CRs files.
+
If the PKCS#12 certificate is protected with a password, set the `-W` argument.
+

----
<1> The `ipsec/build.sh` script generates the Butane and endpoint configuration CRs.
<2> You provide `ca.pem` and `left_server.p12` certificate files that are relevant to your network.

. Create a `custom-manifest/` folder in the repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
Add the `enable-ipsec.yaml` and `99-ipsec-*` YAML files to the directory.
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
siteconfig
  ├── site1-sno-du.yaml
  ├── extra-manifest/
  └── custom-manifest
        ├── enable-ipsec.yaml
        ├── 99-ipsec-worker-endpoint-config.yaml
        └── 99-ipsec-master-endpoint-config.yaml
----

. In your `SiteConfig` CR, add the `custom-manifest/` directory to the `extraManifests.searchPaths` field.
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
clusters:
- clusterName: "site1-sno-du"
  networkType: "OVNKubernetes"
  extraManifests:
    searchPaths:
      - extra-manifest/
      - custom-manifest/
----

. Commit the `SiteConfig` CR changes and updated files in your Git repository and push the changes to provision the managed cluster and configure IPsec encryption.
+
The Argo CD pipeline detects the changes and begins the managed cluster deployment.
+
During cluster provisioning, the {ztp} pipeline appends the CRs in the `custom-manifest/` directory to the default set of extra manifests stored in the `extra-manifest/` directory.
