= Mirroring an Operator catalog

You can mirror the Operator content of a Red Hat-provided catalog, or a custom catalog, into a container image registry using the `oc adm catalog mirror` command. The target registry must support link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]. For a cluster on a restricted network, this registry can be a registry that the cluster has network access to, such as a mirror registry created during a restricted network cluster installation.

You must also mirror the Red Hat-provided index image, or push your own custom-built index image, to the target registry by using the `oc image mirror` command. You can then use the mirrored index image to create a catalog source that allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to load the mirrored catalog onto your {product-title} cluster.

For the steps in this procedure, the target registry is an existing mirror registry that is accessible by both your cluster and a workstation with unrestricted network access. This example also shows mirroring the default `{catalog-name}` catalog, but the process is the same for all catalogs.

.Prerequisites

* Workstation with unrestricted network access
* `podman` version 1.9.3+
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]
* If you are working with private registries, set the `REG_CREDS` environment variable to the file path of your registry credentials for use in later steps. For example, for the `podman` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REG_CREDS=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json
----

.Procedure

. On your workstation with unrestricted network access, use the `podman login` command to authenticate with the your target mirror registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login <mirror_registry>
----

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
. Authenticate with `registry.redhat.io`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----
endif::[]

. The `oc adm catalog mirror` command extracts the contents of an index image to generate the manifests required for mirroring. You can choose either of the following:
+
--
* Allow the default behavior of the command to automatically mirror all of the image content from the index image to your mirror registry after generating manifests.
* Add the `--manifests-only` flag to only generate the manifests required for mirroring, but do not actually mirror the image content to the registry yet. This can be useful for reviewing what will be mirrored, and it allows you to make any changes to the mapping list if you only require a subset of packages. You can then use that file with the `oc image mirror` command to mirror the modified list of images in a later step.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `--manifests-only` flag is intended for advanced selective mirroring of content from the catalog. The `opm index prune` command, if you used it previously to prune the index image, is suitable for most use cases.
====
--
+
On your workstation with unrestricted network access, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror \
    <index_image> \//<1>
    <mirror_registry>:<port> \//<2>
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \//<3>
    [--insecure] \//<4>
    --filter-by-os='.*' \//<5>
    [--manifests-only] <6>
----
<1> Specify the index image for the catalog you want to mirror. For example, this might be a pruned index image that you created previously, or one of the source index images for the default catalogs, such as `{index-image-pullspec}`.
<2> Specify the target registry to mirror the Operator content to.
<3> Optional: If required, specify the location of your registry credentials file.
<4> Optional: If you do not want to configure trust for the target registry, add the `--insecure` flag.
<5> This flag is currently required due to a known issue with multiple architecture support. If unset or set to any value other than `.*`, filtering out different architectures changes the digest of the manifest list, also known as a "multi-arch image", which causes deployments of those images and Operators on disconnected clusters to fail. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1890951[BZ#1890951].
<6> Optional: Only generate the manifests required for mirroring and do not actually mirror the image content to a registry.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
src image has index label for database path: /database/index.db
using database path mapping: /database/index.db:/tmp/153048078
wrote database to /tmp/153048078 <1>
...
wrote mirroring manifests to {index-image}-manifests
----
<1> Directory for the temporary `index.db` database generated by the command.
+
After running the command, a `<image_name>-manifests/` directory is created in the current directory and generates the following files:
+
--
* The `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file defines an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object that can configure nodes to translate between the image references stored in Operator manifests and the mirrored registry.
* The `mapping.txt` file contains all of the source images and where to map them in the target registry. This file is compatible with the `oc image mirror` command and can be used to further customize the mirroring configuration.
--

. If you used the `--manifests-only` flag in the previous step and want to further trim the subset of packages to be mirrored:

.. Modify the list of images in your `mapping.txt` file to your specifications. If you are unsure of the exact names and versions of the subset of images you want to mirror, use the following steps to find them:

... Run the `sqlite3` tool against the temporary database that was generated by the `oc adm catalog mirror` command to retrieve a list of images matching a general search query. The output helps inform how you will later edit your `mapping.txt` file.
+
For example, to retrieve a list of images that are similar to the string `jaeger`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo "select * from related_image \
    where operatorbundle_name like '%jaeger%';" \
    | sqlite3 -line /tmp/153048078/index.db <1>
----
<1> Refer to the previous output of the `oc adm catalog mirror` command to find the path of the database file.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
...
image = {example-registry}/distributed-tracing/jaeger-all-in-one-rhel7@sha256:41f769c2c32f3f050aa42d86f084b739914ff9ba2f0aed2d9b0b69357b48459d
operatorbundle_name = jaeger-operator.v1.17.6

image = {example-registry}/distributed-tracing/jaeger-es-index-cleaner-rhel7@sha256:c64ac461d96523516a199bd132ad4d7148317e503a735028f0d8f7ba063a61cb
operatorbundle_name = jaeger-operator.v1.17.6

image = {example-registry}/distributed-tracing/jaeger-rhel7-operator:1.13.2
operatorbundle_name = jaeger-operator.v1.13.2-1
----

... Use the results from the previous step to help you edit the `mapping.txt` file to only include the subset of images you want to mirror.
+
For example, you can use the `image` values from the previous example output to find that the following matching lines exist in your `mapping.txt` file:
+
.Matching image mappings in `mapping.txt`

...
----
+
In this example, if you only want to mirror these images, you would then remove all other entries in the `mapping.txt` file and leave only the above matching image mapping lines.

.. Still on your workstation with unrestricted network access, use your modified `mapping.txt` file to mirror the images to your registry using the `oc image mirror` command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc image mirror \
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \
    -f ./{index-image}-manifests/mapping.txt
----

. Apply the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc apply -f ./{index-image}-manifests/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----

. If you are not using a custom, pruned version of an index image, push the Red Hat-provided index image to your registry:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc image mirror \
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \
    {index-image-pullspec} \//<1>
    <mirror_registry>:<port>/<namespace>/{index-image}:{tag} <2>
----
<1> Specify the index image for catalog that you mirrored content for in the previous step.
<2> Specify where to mirror the index image.

You can now create a `CatalogSource` object to reference your mirrored index image and Operator content.
