[id="olm-mirror-catalog_{context}"]
= Mirroring an Operator catalog

You can mirror the Operator content of a Red Hat-provided catalog, or a custom catalog, into a container image registry using the `oc adm catalog mirror` command. The target registry must support link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]. For a cluster on a restricted network, this registry can be one that the cluster has network access to, such as a mirror registry created during a restricted network cluster installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The internal registry of the {product-title} cluster cannot be used as the target registry because it does not support pushing without a tag, which is required during the mirroring process.
====

The `oc adm catalog mirror` command also automatically mirrors the index image that is specified during the mirroring process, whether it be a Red Hat-provided index image or your own custom-built index image, to the target registry. You can then use the mirrored index image to create a catalog source that allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to load the mirrored catalog onto your {product-title} cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Workstation with unrestricted network access.
* `podman` version 1.9.3 or later.
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2].
* Decide which namespace on your mirror registry you will use to store the mirrored Operator content. For example, you might create an `olm-mirror` namespace.
* If your mirror registry does not have Internet access, connect removable media to your workstation with unrestricted network access.
* If you are working with private registries, including `registry.redhat.io`, set the `REG_CREDS` environment variable to the file path of your registry credentials for use in later steps. For example, for the `podman` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REG_CREDS=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json
----

.Procedure

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
. If you want to mirror a Red Hat-provided catalog, run the following command on your workstation with unrestricted network access to authenticate with `registry.redhat.io`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----
endif::[]

. The `oc adm catalog mirror` command extracts the contents of an index image to generate the manifests required for mirroring. The default behavior of the command generates manifests, then automatically mirrors all of the image content from the index image, as well as the index image itself, to your mirror registry. Alternatively, if your mirror registry is on a completely disconnected, or _airgapped_, host, you can first mirror the content to removable media, move the media to the disconnected environment, then mirror the content from the media to the registry.

** *Option A: If your mirror registry is on the same network* as your workstation with unrestricted network access, take the following actions on your workstation:

.. If your mirror registry requires authentication, run the following command to log in to the registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login <mirror_registry>
----

.. Run the following command to mirror the content:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror \
    <index_image> \//<1>
    <mirror_registry>:<port>/<namespace> \//<2>
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \//<3>
    [--insecure] \//<4>
    [--index-filter-by-os='<platform>/<arch>'] \//<5>
    [--manifests-only] <6>
----
<1> Specify the index image for the catalog you want to mirror. For example, this might be a pruned index image that you created previously, or one of the source index images for the default catalogs, such as `{index-image-pullspec}`.
<2> Specify the target registry and namespace to mirror the Operator content to, where `<namespace>` is any existing namespace on the registry. For example, you might create an `olm-mirror` namespace to push all mirrored content to.
<3> Optional: If required, specify the location of your registry credentials file. `{REG_CREDS}` is required for `registry.redhat.io`.
<4> Optional: If you do not want to configure trust for the target registry, add the `--insecure` flag.
<5> Optional: Specify which platform and architecture of the index image to select when multiple variants are available. Images are passed as `'<platform>/<arch>[/<variant>]'`. This does not apply to images referenced by the index. Valid values are `linux/amd64`, `linux/ppc64le`, and `linux/s390x`.
<6> Optional: Generate only the manifests required for mirroring, and do not actually mirror the image content to a registry. This option can be useful for reviewing what will be mirrored, and it allows you to make any changes to the mapping list if you require only a subset of packages. You can then use the `mapping.txt` file with the `oc image mirror` command to mirror the modified list of images in a later step. This flag is intended for only advanced selective mirroring of content from the catalog; the `opm index prune` command, if you used it previously to prune the index image, is suitable for most catalog management use cases.

.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
src image has index label for database path: /database/index.db
using database path mapping: /database/index.db:/tmp/153048078
wrote database to /tmp/153048078 <1>
...
wrote mirroring manifests to manifests-{index-image}-1614211642 <2>
----
<1> Directory for the temporary `index.db` database generated by the command.
<2> Be sure to record the manifests directory name that is generated. This directory name is used in a later step.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Quay does not support nested repositories. As a result, running the `oc adm catalog mirror` command will fail with a `401` unauthorized error. As a workaround, you can use the `--max-components=2` option when running the `oc adm catalog mirror` command to disable the creation of nested repositories. For more information on this workaround, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5440741[Unauthorized error thrown while using catalog mirror command with Quay registry] Knowledgebase Solution article. 
==== 

** *Option B: If your mirror registry is on a disconnected host,* take the following actions.

.. Run the following command on your workstation with unrestricted network access to mirror the content to local files:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror \
    <index_image> \//<1>
    file:///local/index \//<2>
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \
    [--insecure]
----
<1> Specify the index image for the catalog you want to mirror. For example, this might be a pruned index image that you created previously, or one of the source index images for the default catalogs, such as `{index-image-pullspec}`.
<2> Mirrors content to local files in your current directory.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
...
info: Mirroring completed in 5.93s (5.915MB/s)
wrote mirroring manifests to manifests-my-index-1614985528 <1>

To upload local images to a registry, run:

	oc adm catalog mirror file://local/index/myrepo/my-index:v1 REGISTRY/REPOSITORY <2>
----
<1> Be sure to record the manifests directory name that is generated. This directory name is used in a later step.
<2> Record the expanded `file://` path that based on your provided index image. This path is used in a later step.

.. Copy the `v2/` directory that is generated in your current directory to removable media.

.. Physically remove the media and attach it to a host in the disconnected environment that has access to the mirror registry.

.. If your mirror registry requires authentication, run the following command on your host in the disconnected environment to log in to the registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login <mirror_registry>
----

.. Run the following command from the parent directory containing the `v2/` directory to upload the images from local files to the mirror registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror \
    file://local/index/<repo>/<index_image>:<tag> \//<1>
    <mirror_registry>:<port>/<namespace> \//<2>
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \
    [--insecure]
----
<1> Specify the `file://` path from the previous command output.
<2> Specify the target registry and namespace to mirror the Operator content to, where `<namespace>` is any existing namespace on the registry. For example, you might create an `olm-mirror` namespace to push all mirrored content to.

. After mirroring the content to your registry, inspect the manifests directory that is generated in your current directory.
+
[NOTE]
====
The manifests directory name is used in a later step.
====
+
If you mirrored content to a registry on the same network in the previous step, the directory name takes the following form:
+
[source,text]
----
manifests-<index_image_name>-<random_number>
----
+
If you mirrored content to a registry on a disconnected host in the previous step, the directory name takes the following form:
+
[source,text]
----
manifests-index/<namespace>/<index_image_name>-<random_number>
----
+
The manifests directory contains the following files, some of which might require further modification:
+
--
* The `catalogSource.yaml` file is a basic definition for a `CatalogSource` object that is pre-populated with your index image tag and other relevant metadata. This file can be used as is or modified to add the catalog source to your cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you mirrored the content to local files, you must modify your `catalogSource.yaml` file to remove any backslash (`/`) characters from the `metadata.name` field. Otherwise, when you attempt to create the object, it fails with an "invalid resource name" error.
====
* The `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file defines an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object that can configure nodes to translate between the image references stored in Operator manifests and the mirrored registry.
+
[NOTE]
====
If your cluster uses an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object to configure repository mirroring, you can use only global pull secrets for mirrored registries. You cannot add a pull secret to a project.
====
* The `mapping.txt` file contains all of the source images and where to map them in the target registry. This file is compatible with the `oc image mirror` command and can be used to further customize the mirroring configuration.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you used the `--manifests-only` flag during the mirroring process and want to further trim the subset of packages to be mirrored, see the steps in the "Mirroring a Package Manifest Format catalog image" procedure about modifying your `mapping.txt` file and using the file with the `oc image mirror` command. After following those further actions, you can continue this procedure.
====
--

. On a host with access to the disconnected cluster, create the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object by running the following command to specify the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file in your manifests directory:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc create -f <path/to/manifests/dir>/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----
+
where `<path/to/manifests/dir>` is the path to the manifests directory for your mirrored content.


You can now create a `CatalogSource` object to reference your mirrored index image and Operator content.
