= About Layer 7 features in ambient mode

Ambient mode includes stable Layer 7 (L7) capabilities implemented through the Gateway API `HTTPRoute` resource and the {istio} `AuthorizationPolicy` resource.

The `AuthorizationPolicy` resource works in both sidecar and ambient modes. In ambient mode, authorization policies can be targeted for `ztunnel` enforcement or attached for waypoint enforcement. To attach a policy to a waypoint, include a `targetRef` that references either the waypoint itself or a Service configured to use that waypoint.

You can attach Layer 4 (L4) or L7 policies to the waypoint proxy to ensure correct identity-based enforcement, as the destination `ztunnel` recognizes traffic by the identity of the waypoint, once it is part of the traffic path.

{istio} peer authentication policies, which configure mutual TLS (mTLS) modes, are supported by ztunnel. In ambient mode, policies that set the mode to `DISABLE` are ignored because ztunnel and HBONE always enforce mTLS. For more information, see "Peer authentication".
