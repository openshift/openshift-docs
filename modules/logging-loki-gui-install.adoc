= Installing the {loki-op} by using the {product-title} web console

To install and configure logging on your {product-title} cluster, additional Operators must be installed. This can be done from the Operator Hub within the web console.

{Product-title} Operators use custom resources (CR) to manage applications and their components. High-level configuration and settings are provided by the user within a CR. The Operator translates high-level directives into low-level actions, based on best practices embedded within the Operator’s logic. A custom resource definition (CRD) defines a CR and lists all the configurations available to users of the Operator. Installing an Operator creates the CRDs, which are then used to generate CRs.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to a supported object store (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Swift, Minio, {rh-storage}).
* You have administrator permissions.
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console *Administrator* perspective, go to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type {loki-op} in the *Filter by keyword* field. Click *{loki-op}* in the list of available Operators, and then click *Install*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Community {loki-op} is not supported by Red Hat.
====

. Select *stable* or *stable-x.y* as the *Update channel*.

+
The {loki-op} must be deployed to the global operator group namespace `openshift-operators-redhat`, so the *Installation mode* and *Installed Namespace* are already selected. If this namespace does not already exist, it is created for you.

. Select *Enable operator-recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace.*
+
This option sets the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label in the `Namespace` object. You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace.

. For *Update approval* select *Automatic*, then click *Install*.
+
If the approval strategy in the subscription is set to *Automatic*, the update process initiates as soon as a new Operator version is available in the selected channel. If the approval strategy is set to *Manual*, you must manually approve pending updates.

.Verification

. Go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Make sure the *openshift-logging* project is selected.
. In the *Status* column, verify that you see green checkmarks with *InstallSucceeded* and the text *Up to date*.

[NOTE]
====
An Operator might display a `Failed` status before the installation finishes. If the Operator install completes with an `InstallSucceeded` message, refresh the page.
