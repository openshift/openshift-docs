= Installing {loki-op} using the {product-title} web console

To install and configure logging on your {product-title} cluster, additional Operators must be installed. This can be done from the Operator Hub within the web console.

{Product-title} Operators use custom resources (CR) to manage applications and their components. High-level configuration and settings are provided by the user within a CR. The Operator translates high-level directives into low-level actions, based on best practices embedded within the Operatorâ€™s logic. A custom resource definition (CRD) defines a CR and lists all the configurations available to users of the Operator. Installing an Operator creates the CRDs, which are then used to generate CRs.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to a supported object store (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Swift, Minio, OpenShift Data Foundation).
* You have administrator permissions.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type {loki-op} in the *Filter by keyword* box. Click *Loki Operator* in the list of available Operators, then click *Install*.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Community Loki Operator is not supported by Red Hat.
====

. Select *stable* or *stable-x.y* as the *Update channel*.
+
--
include::snippets/logging-stable-updates-snip.adoc[]
--
+
The {loki-op} must be deployed to the global operator group namespace `openshift-operators-redhat`, so the *Installation mode* and *Installed Namespace* are already selected. If this namespace does not already exist, it is created for you.

. Select *Enable operator-recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace.*
+
This option sets the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label in the Namespace object. You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace.

. For *Update approval* select *Automatic*, then click *Install*.
+
If the approval strategy in the subscription is set to *Automatic*, the update process initiates as soon as a new Operator version is available in the selected channel. If the approval strategy is set to *Manual*, you must manually approve pending updates.

. Create a secret.
.. Navigate to *Workloads* -> *Secrets* in the *Administrator* perspective of the {product-title} web console.
.. In the *Create* drop-down menu, select *From YAML*.
.. Create a secret that uses the `access_key_id` and `access_key_secret` fields to specify your credentials and the `bucketnames`, `endpoint`, and `region` fields to define the object storage location. AWS is used in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: logging-loki-s3
  namespace: openshift-logging
stringData:
  access_key_id: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
  access_key_secret: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
  bucketnames: s3-bucket-name
  endpoint: https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
  region: eu-central-1
----

. Create a `LokiStack` custom resource (CR).
.. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*. Click the *All instances* tab.
.. Use the *Create new* drop-down menu to select *LokiStack*.
.. Select *YAML view*, then use the following template to create a `LokiStack` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
  name: logging-loki <1>
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  size: 1x.small <2>
  storage:
    schemas:
    - version: v12
      effectiveDate: '2022-06-01'
    secret:
      name: logging-loki-s3 <3>
      type: s3 <4>
  storageClassName: <storage_class_name> <5>
  tenants:
    mode: openshift-logging
----
<1> Use the name `logging-loki`.
<2> Select your Loki deployment size.
<3> Specify the secret used for your log storage.
<4> Specify the corresponding storage type.
<5> Enter the name of an existing storage class for temporary storage. For best performance, specify a storage class that allocates block storage. Available storage classes for your cluster can be listed by using the `oc get storageclasses` command.

. Create or edit the `ClusterLogging` CR to specify using the Loki log store:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogging
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  managementState: Managed
  logStore:
    type: lokistack
    lokistack:
      name: logging-loki
# ...
----

.Verification

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Make sure the *openshift-logging* project is selected.
. In the *Status* column, verify that you see green checkmarks with *InstallSucceeded* and the text *Up to date*.

[NOTE]
====
An Operator might display a `Failed` status before the installation finishes. If the Operator install completes with an `InstallSucceeded` message, refresh the page.
