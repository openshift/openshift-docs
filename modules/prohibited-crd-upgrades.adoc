= Prohibited CRD upgrade changes

The following changes to an existing custom resource definition (CRD) are caught by the CRD upgrade safety preflight check and prevent the upgrade:

- A new required field is added to an existing version of the CRD
- An existing field is removed from an existing version of the CRD
- An existing field type is changed in an existing version of the CRD
- A new default value is added to a field that did not previously have a default value
- The default value of a field is changed
- An existing default value of a field is removed
- New enum restrictions are added to an existing field which did not previously have enum restrictions
- Existing enum values from an existing field are removed
- The minimum value of an existing field is increased in an existing version
- The maximum value of an existing field is decreased in an existing version
- Minimum or maximum field constraints are added to a field that did not previously have constraints

[NOTE]
====
The rules for changes to minimum and maximum values apply to `minimum`, `minLength`, `minProperties`, `minItems`, `maximum`, `maxLength`, `maxProperties`, and `maxItems` constraints.
====

The following changes to an existing CRD are reported by the CRD upgrade safety preflight check and prevent the upgrade, though the operations are technically handled by the Kubernetes API server:

- The scope changes from `Cluster` to `Namespace` or from `Namespace` to `Cluster`
- An existing stored version of the CRD is removed

If the CRD upgrade safety preflight check encounters one of the prohibited upgrade changes, it logs an error for each prohibited change detected in the CRD upgrade.

[TIP]
====
In cases where a change to the CRD does not fall into one of the prohibited change categories, but is also unable to be properly detected as allowed, the CRD upgrade safety preflight check will prevent the upgrade and log an error for an "unknown change".
