= Running metrics queries

You begin working with metrics by entering one or several Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries.

.Procedure

. Open the OpenShift Container Platform web console and navigate to *Monitoring* -> *Metrics*.

. In the query field, enter your PromQL query.
* To show all available metrics and PromQL functions, use the "Insert Metric at Cursor" button.
. For multiple queries, use the "Add Query" button.
. For deleting queries, click the action button for the query and select "Delete query".
. For keeping but not running a query, click the "Disable query" button.
. Once you finish creating queries, click the "Run Queries" button. The metrics from the queries are visualized at the plot.
