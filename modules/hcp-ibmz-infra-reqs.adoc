= {ibm-z-title} infrastructure requirements

The Agent platform does not create any infrastructure, but requires the following resources for infrastructure:

* Agents: An _Agent_ represents a host that is booted with a discovery image, or PXE image and is ready to be provisioned as an {product-title} node.

* DNS: The API and Ingress endpoints must be routable.

The {hcp} feature is enabled by default. If you disabled the feature and want to manually enable it, or if you need to disable the feature, see _Enabling or disabling the {hcp} feature_.
