= Creating the bootstrap machine

You create a bootstrap machine by running the `bootstrap.yml` playbook. This playbook starts the bootstrap virtual machine, and passes it the `bootstrap.ign` Ignition file from the assets directory. The bootstrap node configures itself so it can serve Ignition files to the control plane nodes.

To monitor the bootstrap process, you use the console in the {rh-virtualization} Administration Portal or connect to the virtual machine by using SSH.

.Procedure

. Create the bootstrap machine:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml bootstrap.yml
----

. Connect to the bootstrap machine using a console in the Administration Portal or SSH. Replace `<bootstrap_ip>` with the bootstrap node IP address. To use SSH, enter:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh core@<boostrap.ip>
----

. Collect `bootkube.service` journald unit logs for the release image service from the bootstrap node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[core@ocp4-lk6b4-bootstrap ~]$ journalctl -b -f -u release-image.service -u bootkube.service
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `bootkube.service` log on the bootstrap node outputs etcd `connection refused` errors, indicating that the bootstrap server is unable to connect to etcd on control plane nodes. After etcd has started on each control plane node and the nodes have joined the cluster, the errors should stop.
