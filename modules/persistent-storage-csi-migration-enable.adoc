= Manually enabling CSI automatic migration

If you want to test Container Storage Interface (CSI) migration in development or staging {product-title} clusters, you must manually enable in-tree to CSI migration for the following in-tree volume types:

* VMware vSphere Disk

* Azure File

:FeatureName: CSI automatic migration for the preceding in-tree volume plugins and CSI driver pairs
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

After migration, the default storage class remains the in-tree storage class.

CSI automatic migration will be enabled by default for all storage in-tree plugins in a future {product-title} release, so it is highly recommended that you test it now and report any issues.

[NOTE]
====
Enabling CSI automatic migration drains, and then restarts, all nodes in the cluster in sequence. This might take some time.
====

.Procedure

* Enable feature gates (see _Nodes -> Working with clusters -> Enabling features using feature gates_).
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
After turning on Technology Preview features using feature gates, they cannot be turned off. As a result, cluster upgrades are prevented.
====
+
The following configuration example enables CSI automatic migration for all CSI drivers supported by this feature that are currently in Technology Preview (TP) status:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade <1>
...
----
<1> Enables automatic migration for Azure File and VMware vSphere.
+
You can specify CSI automatic migration for a selected CSI driver by setting `CustomNoUpgrade` `featureSet` and for `featuregates` to one of the following:
+
--

* CSIMigrationAzureFile

* CSIMigrationvSphere
--
+
The following configuration example enables automatic migration to the vSphere CSI driver only:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  featureSet: CustomNoUpgrade
  customNoUpgrade:
    enabled:
      - CSIMigrationvSphere <1>
    ...
----
<1> Enables automatic migration for vSphere only.
