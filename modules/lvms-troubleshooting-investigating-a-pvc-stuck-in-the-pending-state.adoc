= Investigating a PVC stuck in the Pending state

A persistent volume claim (PVC) can get stuck in the `Pending` state for the following reasons:

- Insufficient computing resources.
- Network problems.
- Mismatched storage class or node selector.
- No available persistent volumes (PVs).
- The node with the PV is in the `Not Ready` state.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You have logged in to the {oc-first} as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure

. Retrieve the list of PVCs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pvc
