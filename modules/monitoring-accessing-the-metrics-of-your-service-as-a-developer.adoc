= Accessing the metrics of your service as a developer

After you have enabled monitoring your own services, deployed a service, and set up metrics collection for the service, you can access the metrics of the service as a developer or as a user with view permissions for the project.

[NOTE]
====
The Grafana instance shipped within {product-title} Monitoring is read-only and displays only infrastructure-related dashboards.
====

.Prerequisites

* Deploy the service that you want to monitor.
* Enable monitoring of your own services.
* Have metrics scraping set up for the service.
* Log in as a developer or as a user with view permissions for the project.

.Procedure

. Go to the {product-title} web console, switch to the Developer Perspective, then click *Monitoring* -> *Metrics*. Select the project you want to see the metrics for.
+
[NOTE]
====
Developers can only use the Developer Perspective and not the Administrator Perspective. They can only query metrics from a single project. They cannot access the third-party UIs provided with {product-title} Monitoring.
====
. Use the PromQL interface to run queries for your services.
