= Cluster self-service

Customers can create, scale, and delete their clusters from {cluster-manage-url}, provided that they have pre-purchased the necessary subscriptions.

Actions available in {cluster-manager-first} must not be directly performed from within the cluster as this might cause adverse affects, including having all actions automatically reverted.
