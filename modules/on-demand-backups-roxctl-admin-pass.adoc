= On-demand backups by using the administrator password

[role="_abstract"]
You can back up the entire database of {product-title} by using your administrator password.

.Prerequisites

* You must have the administrator password.
* You must have installed the `roxctl` CLI.

.Procedure

. Set the `ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS` environment variable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS=_<address>_:_<port_number>_
----
. Run the `backup` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -p _<admin_password>_ -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" central backup
----

By default, the `roxctl` CLI saves the backup file in the directory in which you run the command.
You can use the `--output` option to specify the backup file location.
