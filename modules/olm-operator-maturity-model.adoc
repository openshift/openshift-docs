= Operator maturity model

The level of sophistication of the management logic encapsulated within an
Operator can vary. This logic is also in general highly dependent on the type of
the service represented by the Operator.

One can however generalize the scale of the maturity of an Operator's
encapsulated operations for certain set of capabilities that most Operators can
include. To this end, the following Operator Maturity model defines five phases
of maturity for generic day two operations of an Operator:

The above model also shows how these capabilities can best be developed through
the Operator Framework’s Helm, Go, and Ansible capabilities.
