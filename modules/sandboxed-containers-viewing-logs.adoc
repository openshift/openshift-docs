= Viewing debug logs for {sandboxed-containers-first}

Cluster administrators can use the enhanced debug logs for {sandboxed-containers-first} to troubleshoot issues. The logs for each node are printed to the node journal.

You can review the logs for the following {sandboxed-containers-first} components:

* Kata agent
* Kata runtime (`containerd-shim-kata-v2`)
* virtiofsd

Logs for QEMU do not print to the node journal. However, a QEMU failure is reported to the runtime, and the console of the QEMU guest is printed to the node journal. You can view these logs together with the Kata agent logs.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

* To review the Kata agent logs and guest console logs, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<nodename> -- journalctl -D /host/var/log/journal -t kata -g “reading guest console”
----

* To review the kata runtime logs, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<nodename> -- journalctl -D /host/var/log/journal -t kata
----

* To review the virtiofsd logs, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<nodename> -- journalctl -D /host/var/log/journal -t virtiofsd
----
