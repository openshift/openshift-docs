= DIMM memory replacement

Dual in-line memory module (DIMM) problems sometimes only appear after a server reboots.
You can check the log files for these problems.

When you perform a standard reboot and the server does not start, you can see a message in the console that there is a faulty DIMM memory.
In that case, you can acknowledge the faulty DIMM and continue rebooting if the remaining memory is sufficient.
Then, you can schedule a maintenance window to replace the faulty DIMM.

Sometimes, a message in the event logs indicates a bad memory module.
In these cases, you can schedule the memory replacement before the server is rebooted.
