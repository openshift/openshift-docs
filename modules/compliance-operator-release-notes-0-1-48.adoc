== Bug fixes

* Previously, some rules associated with extended Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) definitions had a `checkType` of `None`. This was because the Compliance Operator was not processing extended OVAL definitions when parsing rules. With this update, content from extended OVAL definitions is parsed so that these rules now have a `checkType` of either `Node` or `Platform`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040282[*BZ#2040282*])

* Previously, a manually created `MachineConfig` object for `KubeletConfig` prevented a `KubeletConfig` object from being generated for remediation, leaving the remediation in the `Pending` state. With this release, a `KubeletConfig`  object is created by the remediation, regardless if there is a manually created `MachineConfig` object for `KubeletConfig`. As a result, `KubeletConfig` remediations now work as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040401[*BZ#2040401*])
