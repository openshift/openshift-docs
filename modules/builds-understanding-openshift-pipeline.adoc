= Understanding {product-title} pipelines

Pipelines give you control over building, deploying, and promoting your
applications on {product-title}. Using a combination of the Jenkins Pipeline
Build Strategy, Jenkinsfiles, and the {product-title} Domain Specific Language
(DSL) (provided by the Jenkins Client Plug-in), you can create
advanced build, test, deploy, and promote pipelines for any scenario.

*{product-title} Jenkins Sync Plugin*

The {product-title} Jenkins Sync Plugin keeps `BuildConfig` and Build objects in
sync with Jenkins Jobs and Builds, and provides the following:

 * Dynamic job/run creation in Jenkins.
 * Dynamic creation of slave pod templates from ImageStreams, ImageStreamTags, or
 ConfigMaps.
 * Injecting of environment variables.
 * Pipeline visualization in the OpenShift web console.
 * Integration with the Jenkins git plugin, which passes commit information from
 * Synchronizing secrets into Jenkins credential entries
 OpenShift builds to the Jenkins git plugin.

*{product-title} Jenkins Client Plugin*

The {product-title} Jenkins Client Plugin is a Jenkins plugin which aims to
provide a readable, concise, comprehensive, and fluent Jenkins Pipeline syntax
for rich interactions with an {product-title} API Server. The plugin leverages
the OpenShift command line tool (`oc`) which must be available on the nodes
executing the script.

The Jenkins Client Plug-in must be installed on your Jenkins
master so the {product-title} DSL will be available to use within the JenkinsFile for
your application. This plug-in is installed and enabled by default when using
the {product-title} Jenkins image.

For {product-title} Pipelines within your project, you will must use
the Jenkins Pipeline Build Strategy. This strategy defaults to using a
`jenkinsfile` at the root of your source repository, but also provides the
following configuration options:

* An inline `jenkinsfile` field within your `BuildConfig`.
* A `jenkinsfilePath` field within your `BuildConfig` that references the location
of the `jenkinsfile` to use relative to the source `contextDir`.

[NOTE]
====
The optional `jenkinsfilePath` field specifies the name of the file to use,
relative to the source `contextDir`. If `contextDir` is omitted, it defaults to
the root of the repository. If `jenkinsfilePath` is omitted, it defaults to
`jenkinsfile`.
