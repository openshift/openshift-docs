= Creating a CA certificate bundle file

If you use a self-signed certificate to secure a cluster or a replication repository, certificate verification might fail with the following error message: `Certificate signed by unknown authority`.

You can create a custom CA certificate bundle file and upload it in the {mtc-short} web console when you add a cluster or a replication repository.

.Procedure

Download a CA certificate from a remote endpoint and save it as a CA bundle file:

[source,terminal]
----
$ echo -n | openssl s_client -connect <host_FQDN>:<port> \ <1>
  | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > <ca_bundle.cert> <2>
----
<1> Specify the host FQDN and port of the endpoint, for example, `api.my-cluster.example.com:6443`.
<2> Specify the name of the CA bundle file.
