= OpenAPI function definition

{ServerlessLogicProductName} allows the workflows to interact with remote services using an OpenAPI specfication reference in a function. 

.Example OpenAPI function definition
[source,json]
----
{
   "functions": [
      {
         "name": "myFunction1",
         "operation": "specs/myopenapi-file.yaml#myFunction1"
      }
   ]
}
----

The `operation` attribute is a `string` composed of the following parameters:

* `URI`: The engine uses this to locate the specification file.

* Operation identifier: You can find this identifier in the OpenAPI specification file.

{ServerlessLogicProductName} supports the following URI schemes:

* file: Use this for files located in the file system.
* `http` or `https`: Use these for remotely located files.

Ensure the OpenAPI specification files are available during build time. {ServerlessLogicProductName} uses an internal code generation feature to send requests at runtime. After you build the application image, {ServerlessLogicProductName} will not have access to these files.

If the OpenAPI service you want to add to the workflow does not have a specification file, you can either create one or update the service to generate and expose the file.
