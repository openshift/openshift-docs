= Using the Assisted Installer to generate an OCI-compatible discovery ISO image

Generate a discovery ISO image and upload the image to {oci-first}, so that the agent can perform hardware and network validation checks before you install an {product-title} cluster on {oci}.

.Prerequisites

* You created a child compartment and an object storage bucket on {oci}. See the "Creating OCI resources and services" section.
* You reviewed details about the {product-title} installation and update processes.
* If you use a firewall and you plan to use a Telemetry service, you configured your firewall to allow {product-title} to access the sites required.
* Before you create a virtual machines (VM), refer to {op-system-base-full} certified shapes, instance types, to identify the supported {oci} VM shapes. See link:https://catalog.redhat.com/cloud/detail/216977[Cloud instance types] on Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog portal.

.Procedure

. From the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters/~new[*Install OpenShift with the Assisted Installer*] page on the Hybrid Cloud Console, generate the discovery ISO image by completing all the required {ai-full} steps.
+
.. In the *Cluster Details* step, complete the following fields:
+
[cols="2,2",options="header",subs="quotes"]
|===
|Field |Action required

|*Cluster name*
|Specify the name of your cluster, such as `ocidemo`.

|*Base domain*
|Specify the base domain of the cluster, such as `splat-oci.devcluster.openshift.com`. Provided you previously created a compartment on {oci}, you can get this information by going to *DNS management* -> *Zones* -> *List scope* and then selecting the parent compartment. Your base domain should show under the *Public zones* tab.

|*OpenShift version*
| Specify `OpenShift 4.15` or a later version.

|*CPU architecture*
| Specify `x86_64` or `Arm64`.

|*Integrate with external partner platforms*
|Specify `Oracle Cloud Infrastructure`.

After you specify this value, the *Include custom manifests* checkbox is selected by default.
|===

.. On the *Operators* page, click *Next*.

.. On the *Host Discovery* page, click *Add hosts*.

.. For the *SSH public key* field, add your SSH key from your local system.
+
[TIP]
====
You can create an SSH authentication key pair by using the `ssh-keygen` tool.
====

.. Click *Generate Discovery ISO* to generate the discovery ISO image file.

.. Download the file to your local system.

. Upload the discovery ISO image to the bucket by completing the steps in the link:https://docs.public.oneportal.content.oci.oraclecloud.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/managingobjects_topic-To_upload_objects_to_a_bucket.htm[Uploading an Object Storage Object to a Bucket] section of the Oracle documentation.

. From the *Objects* menu, locate your uploaded image, and then click the overflow menu.

. From the *Create Pre-Authenticated Request* window, select the *Object* tile.

. After you create the request, copy the URL from the *Pre-Authenticated Request URL* field. See link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests_topic-To_create_a_preauthenticated_request_for_all_objects_in_a_bucket.htm[Creating a Pre-Authenticated Request] in the Oracle documentation.
