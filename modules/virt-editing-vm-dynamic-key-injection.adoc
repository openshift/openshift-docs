= Enabling dynamic SSH key injection by using the web console

You can enable dynamic key injection for a virtual machine (VM) by using the {product-title} web console. Then, you can update the public SSH key at runtime.

The key is added to the VM by the QEMU guest agent, which is installed with {op-system-base-full} 9.

.Prerequisites

* The guest operating system is {op-system-base} 9.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines* in the web console.
. Select a VM to open the *VirtualMachine details* page.
. On the *Configuration* tab, click *Scripts*.
. If you have not already added a public SSH key to your project, click the edit icon beside *Authorized SSH key* and select one of the following options:

* *Use existing*: Select a secret from the secrets list.
* *Add new*:
.. Browse to the SSH key file or paste the file in the key field.
.. Enter the secret name.
.. Optional: Select *Automatically apply this key to any new VirtualMachine you create in this project*.
. Set *Dynamic SSH key injection* to on.
. Click *Save*.
