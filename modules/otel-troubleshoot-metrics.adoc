= Exposing the metrics

The OpenTelemetry Collector exposes the metrics about the data volumes it has processed. The following metrics are for spans, although similar metrics are exposed for metrics and logs signals:

`otelcol_receiver_accepted_spans`:: The number of spans successfully pushed into the pipeline.

`otelcol_receiver_refused_spans`:: The number of spans that could not be pushed into the pipeline.
`otelcol_exporter_sent_spans`:: The number of spans successfully sent to the destination.

`otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_spans`:: The number of spans failed to be added to the sending queue.

The Operator creates a `<cr_name>-collector-monitoring` telemetry service that you can use to scrape the metrics endpoint.

.Procedure

. Enable the telemetry service by adding the following lines in the `OpenTelemetryCollector` custom resource (CR):

+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
  config:
    service:
      telemetry:
        metrics:
          address: ":8888" # <1>
# ...
----
<1> The address at which the internal collector metrics are exposed. Defaults to `:8888`.

. Retrieve the metrics by running the following command, which uses the port-forwarding Collector pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc port-forward <collector_pod>
----

. In the `OpenTelemetryCollector` CR, set the `enableMetrics` field to `true` to scrape internal metrics:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
spec:
# ...
  mode: deployment
  observability:
    metrics:
      enableMetrics: true
# ...
----
+
Depending on the deployment mode of the OpenTelemetry Collector, the internal metrics are scraped by using `PodMonitors` or `ServiceMonitors`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, if you do not set the `enableMetrics` field to `true`, you can access the metrics endpoint at `+http://localhost:8888/metrics+`.
====

. On the *Observe* page in the web console, enable *User Workload Monitoring* to visualize the scraped metrics.
+
[NOTE]
====
Not all processors expose the required metrics.
====

. In the web console, go to *Observe* -> *Dashboards* and select the *OpenTelemetry Collector* dashboard from the drop-down list to view it.
+
[TIP]
====
You can filter the visualized data such as spans or metrics by the Collector instance, namespace, or OpenTelemetry components such as processors, receivers, or exporters.
