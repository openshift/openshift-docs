= Authenticating with workload identity federation to access cloud-based log stores

You can use workload identity federation with short-lived tokens to authenticate to cloud-based log stores. With workload identity federation, you do not have to store long-lived credentials in your cluster, reducing the risk of credential leaks and simplifying secret management.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrator permissions.

.Procedure

* Use one of the following options to enable authentication:

** If you used the {ocp-product-title} web console to install the {loki-op}, the system automatically detects clusters that use short-lived tokens. You are prompted to create roles and supply the data required for the {loki-op} to create a `CredentialsRequest` object, which populates a secret.

** If you used the {oc-first} to install the {loki-op}, you must manually create a `Subscription` object. Use the appropriate template for your storage provider, as shown in the following samples. This authentication method supports only the providers listed in the examples.
