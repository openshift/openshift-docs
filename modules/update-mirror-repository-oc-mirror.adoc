= Mirroring resources using the oc-mirror plugin

Use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin to mirror images onto a mirror registry. Compared to using `oc adm release mirror`, the oc-mirror plugin has the following advantages:

* It is simpler to use.

* It can mirror content other than container images.

* After mirroring images for the first time, it is easier to update images in the registry.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the _Mirroring images for a disconnected installation using the oc-mirror plugin_ page of the documentation.

. Follow the instructions on that page to mirror resources onto a mirror registry.

** If you are using oc-mirror for the first time, follow the instructions on that page up until and including the section titled _Installing the ImageContentSourcePolicy and CatalogSource resources into the cluster_.

** If you have already used oc-mirror to mirror resources onto a registry, follow the instructions in the section titled _Keeping your mirror registry content updated_.
