= Setting up the {microshift-short} Kickstart file

You can use the Kickstart file provided with {microshift-short} to provision a host by following the instructions for your install type. The ISO you created in the previous steps then runs on the host that you provision with your Kickstart file. To get started with the {microshift-short} Kickstart file, begin with the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* The host you are provisioning must meet the system requirements for installing {microshift-short}.
* A pull secret from `~/.pull-secret.json` must be present and have read permissions for the current user.

.Procedure

. Install the `microshift-release-info` RPM package containing the sample Kickstart files that are in the `/usr/share/microshift/kickstart` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y microshift-release-info
----

. Install the utilities used during the Kickstart file creation by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y openssl gettext
----

. Set the variables pointing to secrets included in `kickstart.ks`.

* The `PULL_SECRET` file contents are copied to the `/etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret` directory at the post-installation stage to authenticate {ocp} container registry access.
+
.Example command setting the `PULL_SECRET` variable:
[source,terminal]
----
$ export PULL_SECRET="$(cat ~/.pull-secret.json)"
----

* Set a password in the `PASSWD_TEXT` variable to use in the`USER_PASSWD` setting by running the following command:
+
.Example command setting the `PASSWD_TEXT` variable.
[source,terminal]
----
$ PASSWD_TEXT=<my_redhat_user_plain_text_password> <1>
----
<1> Replace _<my_redhat_user_plain_text_password>_ with the password you want to use.

* The `USER_PASSWD` setting is used as an encrypted password for the `redhat` user for logging into the host. Encrypt your password string using the SHA-512 encryption standard.
+
.Example command setting the `USER_PASSWD` variable.
[source,terminal]
----
$ export USER_PASSWD="$(openssl passwd -6 "${PASSWD_TEXT}")"  # <1>
----
<1> Only the encrypted password is included in the Kickstart file. The plain text password is not.

.Next steps
. Follow the instructions for your installation type to create a working Kickstart file from the provided template. Instructions for RPM-based, {op-system-ostree}, and {op-system-image} installations follow this procedure.

. Optional. Create a virtual machine (VM) using the Kickstart file. Creating a VM allows you to test and validate the values in your Kickstart file.
