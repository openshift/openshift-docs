[id="adding-microshift-repos-image-builder_{context}"]
= Adding {microshift-short} repositories to image builder

[role="_abstract"]
Use the following procedure to add the {microshift-short} repositories to image builder on your build host.

include::snippets/microshift-rhel10-bootc-not-osbuild.adoc[leveloffset=1]

.Prerequisites

* Your build host meets the image builder system requirements.
* You have installed and set up image builder and the `composer-cli` tool.
* You have root-user access to your build host.

.Procedure

. Create an image builder configuration file for adding the `{rpm-repo-version}` RPM repository source required to pull {microshift-short} RPMs by running the following command:
+
[source,text,subs="attributes+"]
----
cat > {rpm-repo-version}.toml <<EOF
id = "{rpm-repo-version}"
name = "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform {ocp-version} for RHEL {op-system-version-major}"
type = "yum-baseurl"
url = "https://cdn.redhat.com/content/dist/layered/rhel9/$(uname -m)/rhocp/{ocp-version}/os"
check_gpg = true
check_ssl = true
system = false
rhsm = true
EOF
----

. Create an image builder configuration file for adding the `fast-datapath` RPM repository by running the following command:
+
[source,text,subs="attributes+"]
----
cat > fast-datapath.toml <<EOF
id = "fast-datapath"
name = "Fast Datapath for RHEL 9"
type = "yum-baseurl"
url = "https://cdn.redhat.com/content/dist/layered/rhel9/$(uname -m)/fast-datapath/os"
check_gpg = true
check_ssl = true
system = false
rhsm = true
EOF
----

. Add the sources to the image builder by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ sudo composer-cli sources add {rpm-repo-version}.toml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo composer-cli sources add fast-datapath.toml
----

.Verification

* Confirm that the sources were added properly by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo composer-cli sources list
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
appstream
baseos
fast-datapath
{rpm-repo-version}
----

.Next steps
