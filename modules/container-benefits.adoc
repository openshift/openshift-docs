= The benefits of containerized applications


Applications were once expected to be installed on operating systems that included all of the dependencies for the application.  However, containers provide a standard way to package your application code, configurations, and dependencies into a single unit that can run as a resource-isolated process on a compute server. To run your app in Kubernetes on {product-title}, you must first containerize your app by creating a container image that you store in a container registry.

== Operating system benefits

Containers use small, dedicated Linux operating systems without a kernel. The file system, networking, cgroups, process tables, and namespaces are separate from the host Linux system, but the containers can integrate with the
hosts seamlessly when necessary. Being based on Linux allows containers to use all the advantages that come with the open source development model of rapid innovation.

Because each container uses a dedicated operating system, you can deploy applications that require conflicting software dependencies on the same host. Each container carries its own dependent software and manages its own interfaces, such as networking and file systems, so applications never need to compete for those assets.

== Deployment benefits

If you employ rolling upgrades between major releases of your application, you can continuously improve your applications without downtime and still maintain compatibility with the current release.

You can also deploy and test a new version of an application alongside the existing version. Deploy the new application version in addition to the current version. If the container passes your tests, simply deploy more new containers and remove the old ones. 

Since all the software dependencies for an application are resolved within the container itself, you can use a generic operating system on each host in your data center. You do not need to configure a specific operating system for each application host. When your data center needs more capacity, you can deploy another generic host system.
