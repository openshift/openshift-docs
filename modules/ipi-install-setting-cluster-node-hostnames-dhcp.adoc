= Setting the cluster node hostnames through DHCP

On {op-system-first} machines, `NetworkManager` sets the hostnames. By default, DHCP provides the hostnames to `NetworkManager`, which is the recommended method. `NetworkManager` gets the hostnames through a reverse DNS lookup in the following cases:

* If DHCP does not provide the hostnames
* If you use kernel arguments to set the hostnames
* If you use another method to set the hostnames

Reverse DNS lookup occurs after the network has been initialized on a node, and can increase the time it takes `NetworkManager` to set the hostname. Other system services can start prior to `NetworkManager` setting the hostname, which can cause those services to use a default hostname such as `localhost`.

[TIP]
====
You can avoid the delay in setting hostnames by using DHCP to provide the hostname for each cluster node. Additionally, setting the hostnames through DHCP can bypass manual DNS record name configuration errors in environments that have a DNS split-horizon implementation.
