= Step results in build run status

After a `BuildRun` resource completes its execution, the `.status` field contains the `.status.taskResults` result emitted from the steps generated by the build run controller. The result includes the image digest or the commit SHA of the source code that is used for building the image. In a `BuildRun` resource, the `.status.sources` field contains the result from the execution of source steps and the `.status.output` field contains the result from the execution of output steps. 

The following example shows a `BuildRun` resource with step results for a Git source:

[NOTE] 
====
You get to see the digest and size of the output image only if it is defined in your build strategy.
