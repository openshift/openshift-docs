= Performance tuning the VPA Operator

As a cluster administrator, you can tune the performance of your Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA) to limit the rate at which the VPA makes requests of the Kubernetes API server and to specify the CPU and memory resources for the VPA recommender, updater, and admission controller component pods.

You can also configure the VPA to monitor only those workloads a VPA custom resource (CR) manages. By default, the VPA monitors every workload in the cluster. As a result, the VPA accrues and stores 8 days of historical data for all workloads. The can be used by the VPA if a new VPA CR is created for a workload. However, this causes the VPA to use significant CPU and memory. This can cause the VPA to fail, particularly on larger clusters. By configuring the VPA to monitor only workloads with a VPA CR, you can save on CPU and memory resources. One tradeoff is that where you have a running workload and you create a VPA CR to manage that workload. The VPA does not have any historical data for that workload. As a result, the initial recommendations are not as useful as those after the workload is running for some time.

Use these tunings to ensure the VPA has enough resources to operate at peak efficiency and to prevent throttling, and a possible delay in pod admissions.

You can perform the following tunings on the VPA components by editing the `VerticalPodAutoscalerController` custom resource (CR):

* To prevent throttling and pod admission delays, set the queries per second (QPS) and burst rates for VPA requests of the Kubernetes API server by using the `kube-api-qps` and `kube-api-burst` parameters.

* To ensure enough CPU and memory, set the CPU and memory requests for VPA component pods by using the standard `cpu` and `memory` resource requests.

* To configure the VPA to monitor only workloads that the VPA CR manages, set the `memory-saver` parameter to `true` for the recommender component.

For guidelines on the resources and rate limits that you could set for each VPA component, the following tables provide recommended baseline values, depending on the size of your cluster and other factors.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These recommended values derive from internal Red{nbsp}Hat testing on clusters that are not necessarily representative of real-world clusters. Before you configure a production cluster, ensure you test these values in a non-production cluster.

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended that you set the memory limit on your containers to at least double the recommended requests in the table. However, because CPU is a compressible resource, setting CPU limits for containers can throttle the VPA. As such, it is recommended that you do not set a CPU limit on your containers.

. QPS specifies the queries per second (QPS) limit when making requests to Kubernetes API server. The default for the updater and recommender pods is `5.0`.
. Burst specifies the burst limit when making requests to Kubernetes API server. The default for the updater and recommender pods is `10.0`.

[NOTE]
====
If you have more than 4,000 VPAs in your cluster, it is recommended that you start performance tuning with the values in the table and slowly increase the values until you achieve the required recommender and updater latency and performance. Adjust these values slowly because increased QPS and Burst can affect cluster health and slow down the Kubernetes API server if too many API requests are sent to the API server from the VPA components.

Hiding these two NOTEs as not supported. These and the the above should be sub-bullets for "If you have more than 4000 VPAs in your cluster, note the following recommendations:".
** It is recommended that you increase the recommender and updater interval, which is how often the VPA fetches pod metrics. However, with the longer intervals, the Operator takes longer to recommend and restart pods. The example `VerticalPodAutoscalerController` CR that follows includes the parameters to increase the intervals.
** If you increase the `recommender-interval` value, it is recommended that you also increase the `checkpoints-timeout` value, which configures the timeout for writing VPA checkpoints after the start of the recommender interval. It is recommended that you set the timeout to the same value `recommender-interval` so that the recommender pod has time to write checkpoints before the next interval. The example `VerticalPodAutoscalerController` CR that follows includes the parameters to increase the timeout.

The following example VPA controller CR is for a cluster with 1,000 to 2,000 containers and a pod creation surge of 26 to 50. The CR sets the following values:

* The container memory and CPU requests for all three VPA components
* The container memory limit for all three VPA components
* The QPS and burst rates for all three VPA components
* The `memory-saver` parameter to `true` for the VPA recommender component
