= Performance tuning the VPA Operator

As a cluster administrator, you can tune the performance of your Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA) to limit the rate at which the VPA makes requests of the Kubernetes API server and to specify the CPU and memory resources for the VPA recommender, updater, and admission controller component pods.

Additionally, you can configure the VPA Operator to monitor only those workloads that are being managed by a VPA custom resource (CR). By default, the VPA Operator monitors every workload in the cluster. This allows the VPA Operator to accrue and store 8 days of historical data for all workloads, which the Operator can use if a new VPA CR is created for a workload. However, this causes the VPA Operator to use significant CPU and memory, which could cause the Operator to fail, particularly on larger clusters. By configuring the VPA Operator to monitor only workloads with a VPA CR, you can save on CPU and memory resources. One trade-off is that if you have a workload that has been running, and you create a VPA CR to manage that workload, the VPA Operator does not have any historical data for that workload. As a result, the initial recommendations are not as useful as those after the workload had been running for some time.

These tunings allow you to ensure the VPA has sufficient resources to operate at peak efficiency and to prevent throttling and a possible delay in pod admissions. 

You can perform the following tunings on the VPA components by editing the `VerticalPodAutoscalerController` custom resource (CR):

* To prevent throttling and pod admission delays, set the queries-per-second (QPS) and burst rates for VPA requests of the Kubernetes API server by using the `kube-api-qps` and `kube-api-burst` parameters.

* To ensure sufficient CPU and memory, set the CPU and memory requests for VPA component pods by using the standard `cpu` and `memory` resource requests.

* To configure the VPA Operator to monitor only workloads that are being managed by a VPA CR, set the `memory-saver` parameter to `true` for the recommender component.

For guidelines on the resources and rate limits that you could set for each VPA component, the following tables provide recommended baseline values, depending on the size of your cluster and other factors. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
These recommended values were derived from internal Red{nbsp}Hat testing on clusters that are not necessarily representative of real-world clusters. You should test these values in a non-production cluster before configuring a production cluster.

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended that you set the memory limit on your containers to at least double the recommended requests in the table. However, because CPU is a compressible resource, setting CPU limits for containers can throttle the VPA. As such, it is recommended that you do not set a CPU limit on your containers.

. QPS specifies the queries per second (QPS) limit when making requests to Kubernetes API server. The default for the updater and recommender pods is `5.0`. 
. Burst specifies the burst limit when making requests to Kubernetes API server. The default for the updater and recommender pods is `10.0`.

[NOTE]
====
If you have more than 4000 VPAs in your cluster, it is recommended that you start performance tuning with the values in the table and slowly increase the values until you achieve the desired recommender and updater latency and performance. You should adjust these values slowly because increased QPS and Burst could affect the cluster health and slow down the Kubernetes API server if too many API requests are being sent to the API server from the VPA components.

////
Hiding these two NOTEs as not supported. These and the the above should be sub-bullets for "If you have more than 4000 VPAs in your cluster, note the following recommendations:".
** It is recommended that you increase the recommender and updater interval, which is how often the VPA fetches pod metrics. However, with the longer intervals, the Operator takes longer to recommend and restart pods. The example `VerticalPodAutoscalerController` CR that follows includes the parameters to increase the intervals.
** If you increase the `recommender-interval` value, it is recommended that you also increase the `checkpoints-timeout` value, which configures the timeout for writing VPA checkpoints after the start of the recommender interval. It is recommended that you set the timeout to the same value `recommender-interval` so that the recommender pod has time to write checkpoints before the next interval. The example `VerticalPodAutoscalerController` CR that follows includes the parameters to increase the timeout.

The following example VPA controller CR is for a cluster with 1000 to 2000 containers and a pod creation surge of 26 to 50. The CR sets the following values: 

* The container memory and CPU requests for all three VPA components
* The container memory limit for all three VPA components
* The QPS and burst rates for all three VPA components
* The `memory-saver` parameter to `true` for the VPA recommender component
