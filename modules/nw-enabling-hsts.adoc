= Enabling HTTP strict transport security

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy is a security enhancement, which
ensures that only HTTPS traffic is allowed on the host. Any HTTP requests are
dropped by default. This is useful for ensuring secure interactions with
websites, or to offer a secure application for the user's benefit.

When HSTS is enabled, HSTS adds a Strict Transport Security header to HTTPS
responses from the site. You can use the `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy` value
in a route to redirect to send HTTP to HTTPS. However, when HSTS is enabled, the
client changes all requests from the HTTP URL to HTTPS before the request is
sent, eliminating the need for a redirect. This is not required to be supported
by the client, and can be disabled by setting `max-age=0`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
HSTS works only with secure routes (either edge terminated or re-encrypt). The
configuration is ineffective on HTTP or passthrough routes.
====

.Procedure
* To enable HSTS on a route, add the `haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header`
value to the edge terminated or re-encrypt route:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;includeSubDomains;preload <1> <2> <3>
----
+
<1> `max-age` is the only required parameter.
It measures the length of time, in seconds, that the
HSTS policy is in effect. The client updates `max-age` whenever a response
with a HSTS header is received from the host. When `max-age` times out, the
client discards the policy.
+
<2> `includeSubDomains` is optional. When included, it tells the client
that all subdomains
of the host are to be treated the same as the host.
+
<3> `preload` is optional. When `max-age` is greater than 0, then including
`preload` in  `haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header` allows external
services to include this site in their HSTS preload lists. For example, sites
such as Google can construct a list of sites that have `preload` set. Browsers
can then use these lists to determine which sites they can communicate with
over HTTPS,
before they have interacted with the site. Without `preload` set, browsers must
have interacted with the site over HTTPS to get the header.
