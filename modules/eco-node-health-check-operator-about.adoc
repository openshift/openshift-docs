= About the Node Health Check Operator

The Node Health Check Operator deploys the `NodeHealthCheck` controller, which in turn creates the `NodeHealthCheck` custom resource (CR). The Node Health Check Operator also installs the Poison Pill Operator as a default remediation provider.

The Operator uses the controller to detect the health of a node in the cluster. The controller creates a `NodeHealthCheck` custom resource (CR), which defines a set of criteria and thresholds to determine the node's health. 

When node health check detects an unhealthy node, it creates a remediation CR that triggers the remediation provider. For example, the node health check creates the `PoisonPillRemediation` CR, which triggers the Poison Pill Operator to remediate the unhealthy node. 

The `NodeHealthCheck` CR resembles the following YAML file:

[source,yaml]

----

<1> Specifies the amount (in percentage) of nodes allowed to be concurrently remediated in the targeted pool. If the number of healthy nodes equals to or exceeds the limit set by `minHealthy`, remediation occurs. The default value is 51%.
<2> Prevents any new remediation from starting, while allowing any ongoing remediations to persist. The default value is empty. However, you can enter an array of strings that identify the cause of pausing the remediation. For example, `pause-test-cluster`.

[NOTE]
====
During the upgrade process, nodes in the cluster might become temporarily unavailable and get identified as unhealthy. In the case of worker nodes, when the Operator detects that the cluster is upgrading, it stops remediating new unhealthy nodes to prevent such nodes from rebooting.
====
<3> Specifies a remediation template from the remediation provider. For example, from the Poison Pill Operator. 
<4> Specifies a `selector` that matches labels or expressions that you want to check. The default value is empty, which selects all nodes.
<5> Specifies a list of the conditions that determine whether a node is considered unhealthy. 	
<6> Specifies the timeout duration for a node condition. If a condition is met for the duration of the timeout, the node will be remediated. Long timeouts can result in long periods of downtime for a workload on an unhealthy node.

== Understanding the Node Health Check Operator workflow

When a node is identified as unhealthy, the Operator checks how many other nodes are unhealthy. If the number of healthy nodes exceeds the amount that is specified in the `minHealthy` field of the `NodeHealthCheck` CR, the controller creates a remediation CR from the details that are provided in the external remediation template by the remediation provider. After remediation, the node's health status is updated accordingly.

When the node turns healthy, the controller deletes the external remediation template
and updates the node's health status.
