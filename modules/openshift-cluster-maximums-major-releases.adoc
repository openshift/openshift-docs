= {product-title} tested cluster maximums for major releases

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not provide direct guidance on sizing your {product-title} cluster. This is because determining whether your cluster is within the supported bounds of {product-title} requires careful consideration of all the multidimensional factors that limit the cluster scale.
====

{product-title} supports tested cluster maximums rather than absolute cluster maximums. Not every combination of {product-title} version, control plane workload, and network plugin are tested, so the following table does not represent an absolute expectation of scale for all deployments. It might not be possible to scale to a maximum on all dimensions simultaneously. The table contains tested maximums for specific workload and deployment configurations, and serves as a scale guide as to what can be expected with similar deployments.

1. Pause pods were deployed to stress the control plane components of {product-title} at 2000 node scale. The ability to scale to similar numbers will vary depending upon specific deployment and workload parameters.
2. The pod count displayed here is the number of test pods. The actual number of pods depends on the application's memory, CPU, and storage requirements.
3. This was tested on a cluster with 31 servers: 3 control planes, 2 infrastructure nodes, and 26 worker nodes. If you need 2,500 user pods, you need both a `hostPrefix` of `20`, which allocates a network large enough for each node to contain more than 2000 pods, and a custom kubelet config with `maxPods` set to `2500`. For more information, see link:https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/running-2500-pods-per-node-on-ocp-4.13[Running 2500 pods per node on OCP 4.13].
4. The maximum tested pods per node is 2,500 for clusters using the `OVNKubernetes` network plugin. The maximum tested pods per node for the `OpenShiftSDN` network plugin is 500 pods.
5. When there are a large number of active projects, etcd might suffer from poor performance if the keyspace grows excessively large and exceeds the space quota. Periodic maintenance of etcd, including defragmentation, is highly recommended to free etcd storage.
6. There are several control loops in the system that must iterate over all objects in a given namespace as a reaction to some changes in state. Having a large number of objects of a given type in a single namespace can make those loops expensive and slow down processing given state changes. The limit assumes that the system has enough CPU, memory, and disk to satisfy the application requirements.
7. Each service port and each service back-end has a corresponding entry in `iptables`. The number of back-ends of a given service impact the size of the `Endpoints` objects, which impacts the size of data that is being sent all over the system.
8. Tested on a cluster with 29 servers: 3 control planes, 2 infrastructure nodes, and 24 worker nodes. The cluster had 500 namespaces. {product-title} has a limit of 1,024 total custom resource definitions (CRD), including those installed by {product-title}, products integrating with {product-title} and user-created CRDs. If there are more than 1,024 CRDs created, then there is a possibility that `oc` command requests might be throttled.

== Example scenario

As an example, 500 worker nodes (m5.2xl) were tested, and are supported, using {product-title} {product-version}, the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, and the following workload objects:

* 200 namespaces, in addition to the defaults
* 60 pods per node; 30 server and 30 client pods (30k total)
* 57 image streams/ns (11.4k total)
* 15 services/ns backed by the server pods (3k total)
* 15 routes/ns backed by the previous services (3k total)
* 20 secrets/ns (4k total)
* 10 config maps/ns (2k total)
* 6 network policies/ns, including deny-all, allow-from ingress and intra-namespace rules
* 57 builds/ns

The following factors are known to affect cluster workload scaling, positively or negatively, and should be factored into the scale numbers when planning a deployment.  For additional information and guidance, contact your sales representative or link:https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat support].

* Number of pods per node
* Number of containers per pod
* Type of probes used (for example, liveness/readiness, exec/http)
* Number of network policies
* Number of projects, or namespaces
* Number of image streams per project
* Number of builds per project
* Number of services/endpoints and type
* Number of routes
* Number of shards
* Number of secrets
* Number of config maps
* Rate of API calls, or the cluster “churn”, which is an estimation of how quickly things change in the cluster configuration.
** Prometheus query for pod creation requests per second over 5 minute windows: `sum(irate(apiserver_request_count{resource="pods",verb="POST"}[5m]))`
** Prometheus query for all API requests per second over 5 minute windows: `sum(irate(apiserver_request_count{}[5m]))`
* Cluster node resource consumption of CPU
* Cluster node resource consumption of memory
