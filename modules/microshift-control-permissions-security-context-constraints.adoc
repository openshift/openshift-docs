= Control permissions with security context constraints

You can use security context constraints (SCCs) to control permissions for the pods in your cluster. These permissions determine the actions that a pod can perform and what resources it can access. You can use SCCs to define a set of conditions that a pod must run with to be accepted into the system.

For more information see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html[Managing security context constraints].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only RWO volume mounts are supported. SCC could be blocked if pods are not operating with the SCC contexts.
