== New features and enhancements

* {coo-short} is now enabled for {ocp-product-title} platform monitoring. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-476[*COO-476*])
** Implements HTTPS support for {coo-short} web server. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-480[*COO-480*])
** Implements authn/authz for {coo-short} web server. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-481[*COO-481*])
** Configures ServiceMonitor resource to collect metrics from {coo-short}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-482[*COO-482*])
** Adds `operatorframework.io/cluster-monitoring=true` annotation to the OLM bundle. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-483[*COO-483*])
** Defines the alerting strategy for {coo-short} . (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-484[*COO-484*])
** Configures PrometheusRule for alerting. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-485[*COO-485*])

* Support level annotations have been added to the `UIPlugin` CR when created. The support level is based on the plugin type, with values of `DevPreview`, `TechPreview`, or `GeneralAvailability`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-318[*COO-318*])

// must-gather postponed to 1.1
//* You can now gather debugging information about {coo-short} by using the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-194[*COO-194*])

* You can now configure the Alertmanager `scheme` and `tlsConfig` fields in the Prometheus CR. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-219[*COO-219*])

// Dev preview so cannot document
//* You can now install the Monitoring UI plugin using {coo-short}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-262[*COO-262*])

* The extended Technical Preview for the troubleshooting panel adds support for correlating traces with Kubernetes resources and directly with other observable signals including logs, alerts, metrics, and network events. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-450[*COO-450*])
** You can select a Tempo instance and tenant when you navigate to the tracing page by clicking *Observe -> Tracing* in the web console. The preview troubleshooting panel only works with the `openshift-tracing / platform` instance and the `platform` tenant.
** The troubleshooting panel works best in the *Administrator* perspective. It has limited functionality in the Developer perspective due to authorization issues with some back ends, most notably Prometheus for metrics and alerts. This will be addressed in a future release.

== Bug fixes

* Previously, the default namespace for the {coo-short}  installation was `openshift-operators`. With this update, the defaullt namespace changes to `openshift-cluster-observability-operator`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-32[*COO-32*])

* Previously, `korrel8r` was only able to parse time series selector expressions. With this update, `korrel8r` can parse any valid PromQL expression to extract the time series selectors that it uses for correlation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-558[*COO-558*])

* Previously, when viewing a Tempo instance from the Distributed Tracing UI plugin, the scatter plot graph showing the traces duration was not rendered correctly. The bubble size was too large and overlapped the x and y axis. With this update, the graph is rendered correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-319[*COO-319*])
