= Example: Comparing a cluster with the telco core reference configuration

You can use the `cluster-compare` plugin to compare a reference configuration with a configuration from a live cluster or `must-gather` data.

This example compares a configuration from a live cluster with the telco core reference configuration. The telco core reference configuration is derived from the telco core reference design specifications (RDS). The telco core RDS is designed for clusters to support large scale telco applications including control plane and some centralized data plane functions.

The reference configuration is packaged in a container image with the telco core RDS.

For further examples of using the `cluster-compare` plugin with the telco core and telco RAN distributed unit (DU) profiles, see the "Additional resources" section.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You have credentials to access the `registry.redhat.io` container image registry.

* You installed the `cluster-compare` plugin.

.Procedure

. Log on to the container image registry with your credentials by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----

. Extract the content from the `telco-core-rds-rhel9` container image by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir -p ./out
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run -it registry.redhat.io/openshift4/openshift-telco-core-rds-rhel9:v4.18 | base64 -d | tar xv -C out
----
+
You can view the reference configuration in the `reference-crs-kube-compare/` directory.

. Compare the configuration for your cluster to the telco core reference configuration by running the following command:

$ oc cluster-compare -r out/telco-core-rds/configuration/reference-crs-kube-compare/metadata.yaml

====
Get the output in the `junit` format by adding `-o junit` to the command. For example:
[source,terminal]

$ oc cluster-compare -r out/telco-core-rds/configuration/reference-crs-kube-compare/metadata.yaml -o junit

The `junit` output includes the following result types:

* Passed results for each fully matched template.
* Failed results for differences found or missing required custom resources (CRs).
* Skipped results for differences patched using the user override mechanism.
