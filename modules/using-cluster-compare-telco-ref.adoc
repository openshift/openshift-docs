= Example: Comparing a cluster with the telco core reference configuration

You can use the `cluster-compare` plugin to compare a reference configuration with a configuration from a live cluster or `must-gather` data.

This example compares a configuration from a live cluster with the telco core reference configuration. The telco core reference configuration is derived from the telco core reference design specifications (RDS). The telco core RDS is designed for clusters to support large scale telco applications including control plane and some centralized data plane functions.

The reference configuration is packaged in a container image with the telco core RDS.

For further examples of using the `cluster-compare` plugin with the telco core and telco RAN distributed unit (DU) profiles, see the "Additional resources" section.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You have credentials to access the `registry.redhat.io` container image registry.

* You installed the `cluster-compare` plugin.

.Procedure

. Log on to the container image registry with your credentials by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----

. Extract the content from the `telco-core-rds-rhel9` container image by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir -p ./out
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run -it registry.redhat.io/openshift4/openshift-telco-core-rds-rhel9:v4.18 | base64 -d | tar xv -C out
----
+
You can view the reference configuration in the `reference-crs-kube-compare/` directory.

** `metadata.yaml` is the configuration file for the reference configuration.
** `optional` is the directory for optional templates.
** `required` is the directory for required templates.

. Compare the configuration for your cluster to the telco core reference configuration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc cluster-compare -r out/telco-core-rds/configuration/reference-crs-kube-compare/metadata.yaml

** `Cluster CR` shows the CR under comparison. The plugin displays each CR with a difference from the corresponding template.
** `Reference File` shows the template matching with the CR for comparison.
** `Diff Output` shows the difference between the template and the cluster CR.
** `Summary` shows the summary of differences.
** `CRs with diffs` shows the number of CRs in the comparison with differences from the corresponding templates.
** `CRs in reference missing from the cluster` shows the number of CRs represented in the reference configuration, but missing from the live cluster.
** `Missing CRs` shows the list of CRs represented in the reference configuration, but missing from the live cluster.
** `No CRs are unmatched to reference CRs` shows that there are no CRs that did not match to a corresponding template in the reference configuration.
** `Metadata Hash` shows the metadata hash that identifies the reference configuration.
** `No patched CRs` shows that there are no patched CRs.

[NOTE]
====
Get the output in the `junit` format by adding `-o junit` to the command. For example:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc cluster-compare -r out/telco-core-rds/configuration/reference-crs-kube-compare/metadata.yaml -o junit
----

The `junit` output includes the following result types:

* Passed results for each fully matched template.
* Failed results for differences found or missing required custom resources (CRs).
* Skipped results for differences patched using the user override mechanism.
