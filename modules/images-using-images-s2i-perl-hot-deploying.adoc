= Hot deploying for Perl

Hot deployment allows you to quickly make and deploy changes to your application
without having to generate a new S2I build. To enable hot deployment in this
image, you must set the `PERL_APACHE2_RELOAD` environment variable to `true`. You can use the `oc set env` command to update environment variables of existing objects.

[WARNING]
====
You should only use this option while developing or debugging. It is not recommended to turn this on in your production environment.
