= About dynamic provisioning

The StorageClass resource object describes and classifies storage that can
be requested, as well as provides a means for passing parameters for
dynamically provisioned storage on demand. StorageClass objects can also
serve as a management mechanism for controlling different levels of
storage and access to the storage. Cluster Administrators (`cluster-admin`)
 or Storage Administrators (`storage-admin`) define and create the
StorageClass objects that users can request without needing any intimate
knowledge about the underlying storage volume sources.

The {product-title} persistent volume framework enables this functionality
and allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage.
The framework also gives users a way to request those resources without
having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

Many storage types are available for use as persistent volumes in
{product-title}. While all of them can be statically provisioned by an
administrator, some types of storage are created dynamically using the
built-in provider and plug-in APIs.

When using Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage, the dynamic StorageClasses are
created when Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage 4.2 is deployed from the
Operator Hub as described in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_container_storage/4.2/html-single/deploying_openshift_container_storage/index#verify_that_the_storage_classes_are_created_and_listed[Verify that the storage classes are created and listed]
