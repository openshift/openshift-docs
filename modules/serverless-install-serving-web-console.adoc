. In the *Create Knative Serving* page, you can install Knative Serving using the default settings by clicking *Create*.

You can also modify settings for the Knative Serving installation by editing the `KnativeServing` object using either the form provided, or by editing the YAML.

* Using the form is recommended for simpler configurations that do not require full control of `KnativeServing` object creation.
* Editing the YAML is recommended for more complex configurations that require full control of `KnativeServing` object creation. You can access the YAML by clicking the *edit YAML* link in the top right of the *Create Knative Serving* page.
+
After you complete the form, or have finished modifying the YAML, click *Create*.
+
