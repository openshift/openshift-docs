= Creating default cluster-wide node selectors  

You can use default node selectors on pods together with labels on nodes to constrain all pods created in a cluster to specific nodes.

With cluster node selectors, when you create a pod in that cluster, {product-title} adds the appropriate `<key>:<value>` and schedules
the pod on nodes with matching labels. 

[NOTE]
====
You can add additional `<key>:<value>` pairs for the pod.
But you cannot add a different `<value>` for a default `<key>`.
====

For example, if the cluster node selector is `region: east` the following pod spec adds a new pair and is allowed:

----
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    region: east
    type: user-node
----

The following pod spec uses a different value for `region` and is not allowed:

----
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    region: west
----

If the project where you are creating the pod has a project node selector, that selector takes preference over a cluster node selector.

.Procedure

To add a default cluster node selector: 

. Edit the Scheduler Operator Custom Resource to add the cluster node selectors:
+
----
$ oc edit scheduler cluster
----
+
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Scheduler
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNodeSelector: type=user-node,region=east <1>
  policy:
    name: ""
----
<1> Add a node selector with the appropriate `<key>:<value>` pairs. 
+
After making this change, wait for the pods in the `openshift-kube-apiserver` project to redeploy. This can take several minutes. The default cluster node selector does not take effect until the pods redeploy.

. Edit a node or MachineSet to add labels:
+
----
$ oc label <resource> <name> <key>=<value>
----
+
For example, to label a node:
+
----
$ oc label nodes ip-10-0-142-25.ec2.internal type=user-node region=east
----
+
To label a MachineSet:
+
----
$ oc label MachineSet abc612-msrtw-worker-us-east-1c type=user-node region=east
----

When you create a pod, {product-title} adds the appropriate `<key>:<value>` and schedules
the pod on the labeled node.

For example:

----
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    region: east
    type: user-node
----
