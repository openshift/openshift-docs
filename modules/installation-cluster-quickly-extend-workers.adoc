= Install a cluster quickly in AWS Local Zones

For {product-title} {product-version}, you can quickly install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to extend compute nodes to Local Zone locations. By using this installation route, the installation program automatically creates network resources and Local Zone subnets for each Local Zone that you defined in your configuration file. To customize the installation, you must modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you deploy the cluster.
