= Install a cluster quickly in {aws-service-name-full}

For {product-title} {product-version}, you can quickly install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
to extend compute nodes to {aws-service-name-full} locations. By using this installation route, the installation
program automatically creates network resources and {aws-service-name-single} subnets for each {aws-service-name-single}
defined in the configuration file. To customize the installation, you must modify parameters in
the `install-config.yaml` file before you deploy the cluster.
