[id="lvms-monitoring-using-lvms_{context}"]
= Monitoring {lvms}

When {lvms} is installed using the {product-title} Web Console, you can monitor the cluster by using the *Block and File* dashboard in the console by default.
However, when you use {rh-rhacm} to install {lvms}, you need to configure {rh-rhacm} Observability to monitor all the {sno} clusters from one place.

[id="lvms-monitoring-using-lvms-metrics_{context}"]
== Metrics

You can monitor {lvms} by viewing the metrics exported by the Operator on the {rh-rhacm} dashboards and the alerts that are triggered.

* Add the following `topolvm` metrics to the `allow` list:
+
[source,terminal]
----
topolvm_thinpool_data_percent
topolvm_thinpool_metadata_percent
topolvm_thinpool_size_bytes
----

[NOTE]
====
Metrics are updated every 10 minutes or when there is a change in the thin pool, such as a new logical volume creation.
====

[id="lvms-monitoring-using-lvms-alerts_{context}"]
== Alerts

When the thin pool and volume group are filled up, further operations fail and might lead to data loss.
{lvms} sends the following alerts about the usage of the thin pool and volume group when utilization crosses a certain value:

.Alerts for Logical Volume Manager cluster in {rh-rhacm}
[[alerts_for_LVMCluster_in_{rh-rhacm}]]
[%autowidth,frame="topbot",options="header"]

|Alert| Description
|`VolumeGroupUsageAtThresholdNearFull`|This alert is triggered when both the volume group and thin pool utilization cross 75% on nodes. Data deletion or volume group expansion is required.
|`VolumeGroupUsageAtThresholdCritical`|This alert is triggered when both the volume group and thin pool utilization cross 85% on nodes. `VolumeGroup` is critically full. Data deletion or volume group expansion is required.
|`ThinPoolDataUsageAtThresholdNearFull`|This alert is triggered when the thin pool data utilization in the volume group crosses 75% on nodes. Data deletion or thin pool expansion is required.
|`ThinPoolDataUsageAtThresholdCritical`|This alert is triggered when  the thin pool data utilization in the volume group crosses 85% on nodes. Data deletion or thin pool expansion is required.
|`ThinPoolMetaDataUsageAtThresholdNearFull`|This alert is triggered when the thin pool metadata utilization in the volume group crosses 75% on nodes. Data deletion or thin pool expansion is required.
|`ThinPoolMetaDataUsageAtThresholdCritical`|This alert is triggered when the thin pool metadata utilization in the volume group crosses 85% on nodes. Data deletion or thin pool expansion is required.
