[id="lvms-monitoring_{context}"]
= Monitoring {lvms}

To enable cluster monitoring, you must add the following label in the namespace where you have installed {lvms}:
[source,text]
----
openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
For information about enabling cluster monitoring in {rh-rhacm}, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/{rh-rhacm-version}/html-single/observability/index[Observability] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/{rh-rhacm-version}/html-single/observability/index#adding-custom-metrics[Adding custom metrics].

[id="lvms-monitoring-using-lvms-metrics_{context}"]
== Metrics

You can monitor {lvms} by viewing the metrics.

The following table describes the `topolvm` metrics:

.`topolvm` metrics
[%autowidth,options="header"]
|===
|Alert | Description
|`topolvm_thinpool_data_percent` | Indicates the percentage of data space used in the LVM thinpool.
|`topolvm_thinpool_metadata_percent` | Indicates the percentage of metadata space used in the LVM thinpool. 
|`topolvm_thinpool_size_bytes` | Indicates the size of the LVM thin pool in bytes.
|`topolvm_volumegroup_available_bytes` | Indicates the available space in the LVM volume group in bytes.
|`topolvm_volumegroup_size_bytes` | Indicates the size of the LVM volume group in bytes.
|`topolvm_thinpool_overprovisioned_available` | Indicates the available over-provisioned size of the LVM thin pool in bytes.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Metrics are updated every 10 minutes or when there is a change, such as a new logical volume creation, in the thin pool.

[id="lvms-monitoring-using-lvms-alerts_{context}"]
== Alerts

When the thin pool and volume group reach maximum storage capacity, further operations fail. This can lead to data loss.

{lvms} sends the following alerts when the usage of the thin pool and volume group exceeds a certain value:

.LVM Storage alerts
[%autowidth, options="header"]
|===
|Alert| Description
|`VolumeGroupUsageAtThresholdNearFull`|This alert is triggered when both the volume group and thin pool usage exceeds 75% on nodes. Data deletion or volume group expansion is required.
|`VolumeGroupUsageAtThresholdCritical`|This alert is triggered when both the volume group and thin pool usage exceeds 85% on nodes. In this case, the volume group is critically full. Data deletion or volume group expansion is required.
|`ThinPoolDataUsageAtThresholdNearFull`|This alert is triggered when the thin pool data uusage in the volume group exceeds 75% on nodes. Data deletion or thin pool expansion is required.
|`ThinPoolDataUsageAtThresholdCritical`|This alert is triggered when the thin pool data usage in the volume group exceeds 85% on nodes. Data deletion or thin pool expansion is required.
|`ThinPoolMetaDataUsageAtThresholdNearFull`|This alert is triggered when the thin pool metadata usage in the volume group exceeds 75% on nodes. Data deletion or thin pool expansion is required.
|`ThinPoolMetaDataUsageAtThresholdCritical`|This alert is triggered when the thin pool metadata usage in the volume group exceeds 85% on nodes. Data deletion or thin pool expansion is required.
