= Manual approval strategy

If you use the *Manual* approval strategy, you must manually approve every pending update. If {product-title} and {VirtProductName} updates are out of sync, your cluster becomes unsupported. To avoid risking the supportability and functionality of your cluster, use the *Automatic* approval strategy. 

If you must use the *Manual* approval strategy, maintain a supportable cluster by approving pending Operator updates as soon as they become available.
