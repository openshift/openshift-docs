== Configuring multiple IOThreads for fast storage access

You can improve storage performance by configuring multiple IOThreads for a virtual machine (VM) that uses fast storage, such as solid-state drive (SSD) or non-volatile memory express (NVMe). This configuration option is only available by editing YAML of the VM.

[NOTE]
====
Multiple IOThreads are supported only when `blockMultiQueue` is enabled and the disk bus is set to `virtio`. You must set this configuration for the configuration to work correctly.
====

.Procedure

. Click *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines* from the side menu.

. Select a virtual machine to open the *VirtualMachine details* page.

. Click the *YAML* tab to open the VM manifest.

. In the YAML editor, locate the `spec.template.spec.domain` section and add or modify the following fields:
+
[source,yaml]
----
domain:
  ioThreadsPolicy: supplementalPool
  ioThreads:
    supplementalPoolThreadCount: 4
  devices:
    blockMultiQueue: true
    disks:
    - name: datavolume
      disk:
        bus: virtio
# ...
----

. Click *Save*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `spec.template.spec.domain` setting cannot be changed while the VM is running. You must stop the VM before applying the changes, and then restart the VM for the new settings to take effect.
