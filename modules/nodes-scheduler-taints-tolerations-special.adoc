= Controlling Nodes with special hardware using taints and tolerations

In a cluster where a small subset of nodes have specialized hardware (for example GPUs), you can use taints and tolerations to keep pods that do not need the specialized hardware off of those nodes, leaving the nodes for pods that do need the specialized hardware. You can also require pods that need specialized hardware to use specific nodes.

.Procedure

To ensure pods are blocked from the specialized hardware:

. Taint the nodes that have the specialized hardware using one of the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> disktype=ssd:NoSchedule
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> disktype=ssd:PreferNoSchedule
----

. Adding a corresponding toleration to pods that use the special hardware using an admission controller.

For example, the admission controller could use some characteristic(s) of the pod to determine that the pod should be allowed to use the special nodes by adding a toleration.

To ensure pods can only use the specialized hardware, you need some additional mechanism. For example, you could label the nodes that have the special hardware and use node affinity on the pods that need the hardware.
