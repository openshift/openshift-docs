== Resolved issues

{mtc-first} 1.8.10 has the following major resolved issues:

.`migmigration` failed to clean up stale virt-handler pods for stopped VMs

With this release, `migmigration` object no longer fails to clean up stale `virt-handler` pods for stopped virtual machines (VMs) in an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) cluster with {mtc-short} Operator and {odf-first} storage cluster-CEPH RBD virtualization. This resolution addresses an issue where migration failure occurred due to an attempt to clean up non-existent `virt-handler` pods during live migration when the VM was stopped and no VMI existed. As a result, stopped VMs no longer prevent successful migration. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIG-1762[(MIG-1762)]
