= Downloading migration logs

You can download the migration controller, Velero, and Restic logs in the CAM web console to troubleshoot a failed migration.

.Procedure

. Click the *Options* menu {kebab} of a migration plan and select *Logs*.
. To download a single controller log, select the following:

* *Cluster*
* *Log source*: Velero, Restic, or migration controller
* *Pod source*: For example, `velero-_7659c69dd7-ctb5x_`

. Click *Download all logs* to download the migration controller logs of the cluster hosting the CAM and the Velero and Restic logs of the source and target clusters.

Optionally, you can access the logs by using the CLI, as in this example for the migration controller:

----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-migration | grep controller
controller-manager-78c469849c-v6wcf           1/1     Running     0          4h49m

$ oc logs controller-manager-78c469849c-v6wcf -f -n openshift-migration
