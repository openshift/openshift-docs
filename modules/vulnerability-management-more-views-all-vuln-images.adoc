= Viewing all vulnerable images

You can view a list of vulnerabilities for user workloads, platform vulnerabilities, and inactive images on the same page.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Vulnerability Management* -> *Results*.
. Click *More Views* and select *All vulnerable images*.
. Optional: You can choose to view observed vulnerabilities or those that have been deferred or marked as false positives. Click one of the following tabs:
* *Observed*: Lists vulnerabilities that {product-title-short} observed across all images and workloads.
* *Deferred*: Lists vulnerabilities that have been observed but had a deferral request submitted and approved in the exception management workflow.
* *False positives*: Lists vulnerabilities that have been observed but were identified as false positives in the exception management workflow.
. Optional: You can select the following options to refine the list of results:
* *Prioritize by namespace view*: Displays a list of namespaces sorted according to the risk priority. You can use this view to quickly identify and address the most critical areas. In this view, click *<number> deployments* in a table row to return to the all vulnerable images view, with filters applied to show only deployments for the selected namespace.
* *Default filters*: You can select filters for CVE severity and CVE status that are automatically applied across all views on this page. These filters are applied when you visit the page from another section of the {product-title-short} web portal or from a bookmarked URL. They are saved in the local storage of your browser.
. Click one of the following tabs to view the data that you want:
* *<number> CVEs*: Displays vulnerabilities organized by CVE
* *<number> Images*: Displays images that contain discovered vulnerabilities.
* *<number> Deployments*: Displays deployments that contain discovered vulnerabilities.
. Optional: Choose the appropriate method to re-organize the information in the *User Workloads* tab:
** To sort the table in ascending or descending order, select a column heading.
** To filter the table, use the filter bar.
** To select the categories that you want to display in the table, perform the following steps:
... Click *Columns*.
... Choose the appropriate method to manage the columns:
**** To view all the categories, click *Select all*.
**** To reset to the default categories, click *Reset to default*.
**** To view only the selected categories, select the one or more categories that you want to view, and then click *Save*.
. To filter the list of results by entity, for example, to search for a specific named CVE, select the appropriate filters and attributes.
+
To select multiple entities and attributes, click the right arrow icon to add another criteria. Depending on your choices, enter the appropriate information such as text, or select a date or object.
+
The filter entities and attributes are listed in the following table.

.CVE filtering
[cols="2",options="header"]
|===
|Entity|Attributes

|Image
a|
* *Name*: The name of the image.
* *Operating system*: The operating system of the image.
* *Tag*: The tag for the image.
* *Label*: The label for the image.
* *Registry*: The registry where the image is located.
|CVE
a|
* *Name*: The name of the CVE.
* *Discovered time*: The date when {product-title-short} discovered the CVE.
* *CVSS*: The severity level for the CVE.
+
The following values are associated with the severity level for the CVE:
+
** *is greater than*
** *is greater than or equal to*
** *is equal to*
** *is less than or equal to*
** *is less than*
* *EPSS probability*: The likelihood that the vulnerability will be exploited according to the link:https://www.first.org/epss/model[Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)]. This EPSS data provides a percentage estimate of the probability that exploitation of this vulnerability will be observed in the next 30 days. The EPSS collects data of observed exploitation activity from partners, and exploitation activity does not mean that an attempted exploitation was successful. The EPSS score should be used as a single data point _along with other information_, such as the age of the CVE, to help you prioritize the vulnerabilities to address. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7106599[{product-title-short} and EPSS].
|Image Component
a|

* *Name*: The name of the image component, for example, `activerecord-sql-server-adapter`
* *Source*:
** OS
** Python
** Java
** Ruby
** Node.js
** Go
** Dotnet Core Runtime
** Infrastructure

* *Version*: Version of the image component; for example, `3.4.21`. You can use this to search for a specific version of a component, for example, in conjunction with a component name.
|Deployment
a|
* *Name*: Name of the deployment.
* *Label*: Label for the deployment.
* *Annotation*: The annotation for the deployment.
* *Status*: Whether the deployment is inactive or active.
|Namespace
a|
* *ID*: The `metadata.uid` of the namespace that is created by Kubernetes.
* *Name*: The name of the namespace.
* *Label*: The label for the namespace.
* *Annotation*: The annotation for the namespace.
|Cluster
a|
* *ID*: The alphanumeric ID for the cluster. This is an internal identifier that {product-title-short} assigns for tracking purposes.
* *Name*: The name of the cluster.
* *Label*: The label for the cluster.
* *Type*: The cluster type, for example, OCP.
* *Platform type*: The platform type, for example, OpenShift 4 cluster.
|===
* *CVE severity*: You can select one or more levels.
* *CVE status*: You can select *Fixable* or *Not fixable*.

[NOTE]
====
The *Filtered view* icon indicates that the displayed results were filtered based on the criteria that you selected. You can click *Clear filters* to remove all filters, or remove individual filters by clicking on them.

In the list of results, click a CVE, image name, or deployment name to view more information about the item. For example, depending on the item type, you can view the following information:

* Whether a CVE is fixable
* Whether an image is active
* The Dockerfile line in the image that contains the CVE
* External links to information about the CVE in Red{nbsp}Hat and other CVE databases
