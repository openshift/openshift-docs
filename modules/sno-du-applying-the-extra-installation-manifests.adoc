= Applying the extra installation manifests

To apply the distributed unit (DU) configuration to the single node cluster, the following
extra installation manifests need to be included during installation:

* Enable workload partitioning.
* Other MachineConfigs â€“ It is recommended, but not required, to apply these custom resources (CRs)
during installation in order to minimize the number of reboots that can occur during post-install
configuration.
