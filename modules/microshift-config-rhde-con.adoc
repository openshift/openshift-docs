= Configuring {op-system-bundle}

{microshift-short} and {op-system-base-full} work together to bring a lighter-weight, single-node Kubernetes to the edge. This combination means that there is a single node that is both control-plane and worker. It also means that the operating system handles many functions. You add features by installing optional RPMs or Operators. In many cases, you must configure the operating system or other resources in addition to the {microshift-short} service.

Bringing many of these pieces together is the {microshift-short} configuration file, `config.yaml`. The {microshift-short} configuration file customizes your application platform and can enable many advanced functions. For example:

* Ingress is available by default, but you can add advanced functions such as TLS and route admission specifications by using parameters in the {microshift-short} configuration file.
* If you do not need storage, you can disable the built-in storage provider by using the {microshift-short} configuration file. If you do want to use the built-in storage provider, you must make your adjustments in the `lvmd.config` file. The role of the {microshift-short} configuration file in this case is to set whether you use the default storage provider.
* Advanced networking functions, such as using multiple networks. The Multus package is an installable RPM, but you set up access by using the {microshift-short} configuration file to set parameters. In addition, you must configure network settings on your networks through the host.

For your convenience, a `config.yaml.default` file is automatically installed. You can copy and rename this file `config.yaml` and use it as a starting point for your own custom configuration.

[NOTE]
====
You can also add features that operate without configurations to the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file. For example, you can install and configure GitOps for application management without configuring {microshift-short}.
