= Understanding changes in external IP behavior with OVN-Kubernetes

When migrating from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes (OVN-K), services that use external IPs might become inaccessible across namespaces due to `NetworkPolicy` enforcement.

In OpenShift SDN, external IPs were accessible across namespaces by default. However, in OVN-K, network policies strictly enforce multitenant isolation, preventing access to services exposed via external IPs from other namespaces.

To ensure accessibility, consider the following alternatives:

* Use an ingress or route: Instead of exposing services by using external IPs, configure an ingress or route to allow external access while maintaining security controls.

* Adjust `NetworkPolicies`: Modify `NetworkPolicy` rules to explicitly allow access from required namespaces and ensure that traffic is allowed to the designated service ports. Without allowing traffic to the required ports, access might still be blocked, even if the namespace is explicitly allowed.

* Use a `LoadBalancer` service: If applicable, deploy a `LoadBalancer` service instead of relying on external IPs.

For more information on configuring NetworkPolicies, see "Configuring NetworkPolicies".
