= Linking your AWS account

You can link your AWS account to existing IAM roles by using the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI, `rosa`.

.Prerequisites

* You have an AWS account.
* You are using {cluster-manager-url} to create clusters.
* You have the permissions required to install AWS account-wide roles. See the "Additional resources" of this section for more information.
* You have installed and configured the latest AWS (`aws`) and ROSA (`rosa`) CLIs on your installation host.
* You have created your `ocm-role` and `user-role` IAM roles, but have not yet linked them to your AWS account. You can check whether your IAM roles are already linked by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list ocm-role
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list user-role
----
+
If `Yes` is displayed in the `Linked` column for both roles, you have already linked the roles to an AWS account.
