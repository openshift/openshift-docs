[id="attaching-additional-labels-to-your-time-series-and-alerts_{context}"]
= Attaching additional labels to your time series and alerts

Using the external labels feature of Prometheus, you can attach custom labels to all time series and alerts leaving Prometheus.

.Prerequisites

* *If you are configuring core {product-title} monitoring components*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the ConfigMap:
** *To attach custom labels to all time series and alerts leaving the Prometheus instance that monitors core {product-title} projects*:
.. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

.. Define a map of labels you want to add for every metric under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      externalLabels:
        <key>: <value> <1>
----
+
<1> Substitute `<key>: <value>` with a map of key-value pairs where `<key>` is a unique name for the new label and `<value>` is its value.
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not use `prometheus` or `prometheus_replica` as key names, because they are reserved and will be overwritten.
====
+
For example, to add metadata about the region and environment to all time series and alerts, use:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      externalLabels:
        region: eu
        environment: prod
----

** *To attach custom labels to all time series and alerts leaving the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects*:
.. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

.. Define a map of labels you want to add for every metric under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      externalLabels:
        <key>: <value> <1>
----
+
<1> Substitute `<key>: <value>` with a map of key-value pairs where `<key>` is a unique name for the new label and `<value>` is its value.
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not use `prometheus` or `prometheus_replica` as key names, because they are reserved and will be overwritten.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
In the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project, Prometheus handles metrics and Thanos Ruler handles alerting and recording rules. Setting `externalLabels` for `prometheus` in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap will only configure external labels for metrics and not for any rules.
====
+
For example, to add metadata about the region and environment to all time series and alerts related to user-defined projects, use:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      externalLabels:
        region: eu
        environment: prod
----

. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.
+
[NOTE]
====
Configurations applied to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap are not activated unless a cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to a monitoring ConfigMap, the pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
