[id="attaching-additional-labels-to-your-time-series-and-alerts_{context}"]
= Attaching additional labels to your time series and alerts

Using the external labels feature of Prometheus, you can attach additional custom labels to all time series and alerts leaving the Prometheus cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Make sure you have the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap object with the `data/config.yaml` section.

.Procedure

. Start editing the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap:
+
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Define a map of labels you want to add for every metric under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      externalLabels:
        <key>: <value> <1>
----
+
<1> Substitute `<key>: <value>` with a map of key-value pairs where `<key>` is a unique name of the new label and `<value>` is its value.
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not use `prometheus` or `prometheus_replica` as key names, because they are reserved and would be overwritten.
====
+
For example, to add metadata about the region and environment to all time series and alerts, use:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      externalLabels:
        region: eu
        environment: prod
----

. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.
