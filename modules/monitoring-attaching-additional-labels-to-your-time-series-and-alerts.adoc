[id="attaching-additional-labels-to-your-time-series-and-alerts_{context}"]
= Attaching additional labels to your time series and alerts

You can attach custom labels to all time series and alerts leaving Prometheus by using the external labels feature of Prometheus.

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* *If you are configuring core {product-title} monitoring components*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* The `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object exists. This object is created by default when the cluster is created.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the `ConfigMap` object:
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
** *To attach custom labels to all time series and alerts leaving the Prometheus instance that monitors core {product-title} projects*:
.. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

.. Define a map of labels you want to add for every metric under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      externalLabels:
        <key>: <value> # <1>
----
+
<1> Substitute `<key>: <value>` with a map of key-value pairs where `<key>` is a unique name for the new label and `<value>` is its value.
+
[WARNING]
====
* Do not use `prometheus` or `prometheus_replica` as key names, because they are reserved and will be overwritten.

* Do not use `cluster` or `managed_cluster` as key names. Using them can cause issues where you are unable to see data in the developer dashboards.
====
+
For example, to add metadata about the region and environment to all time series and alerts, use the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      externalLabels:
        region: eu
        environment: prod
----

** *To attach custom labels to all time series and alerts leaving the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects*:
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
.. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

.. Define a map of labels you want to add for every metric under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      externalLabels:
        <key>: <value> # <1>
----
+
<1> Substitute `<key>: <value>` with a map of key-value pairs where `<key>` is a unique name for the new label and `<value>` is its value.
+
[WARNING]
====
* Do not use `prometheus` or `prometheus_replica` as key names, because they are reserved and will be overwritten.

* Do not use `cluster` or `managed_cluster` as key names. Using them can cause issues where you are unable to see data in the developer dashboards.

[NOTE]
====
In the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project, Prometheus handles metrics and Thanos Ruler handles alerting and recording rules. Setting `externalLabels` for `prometheus` in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object will only configure external labels for metrics and not for any rules.
====
+
For example, to add metadata about the region and environment to all time series and alerts related to user-defined projects, use the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      externalLabels:
        region: eu
        environment: prod
----

. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
+
[NOTE]
====
Configurations applied to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object are not activated unless a cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
====
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to a monitoring config map, the pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
