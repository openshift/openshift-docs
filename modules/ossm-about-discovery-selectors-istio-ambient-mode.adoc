= About discovery selectors and Istio ambient mode

{istio} ambient mode includes workloads when the control plane discovers each workload and the appropriate label enables traffic redirection through the Ztunnel proxy. By default, the control plane discovers workloads in all namespaces across the cluster. As a result, each proxy receives configuration for every namespace, including workloads that are not enrolled in the mesh. In shared or multi-tenant clusters, limiting mesh participation to specific namespaces helps reduce configuration overhead and supports multiple service meshes within the same cluster.
