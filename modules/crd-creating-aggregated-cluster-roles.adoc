= Creating cluster roles for Custom Resource Definitions

Cluster administrators can grant permissions to existing cluster-scoped Custom
Resource Definitions (CRDs). If you use the `admin`, `edit`, and `view` default
cluster roles, take advantage of cluster role aggregation for their rules.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must explicitly assign permissions to each of these roles. The roles with
more permissions do not inherit rules from roles with fewer permissions. If you
assign a rule to a role, you must also assign that verb to roles that have more
permissions. For example, if you grant the `get crontabs` permission to the view
role, you must also grant it to the `edit` and `admin` roles. The `admin` or
`edit` role is usually assigned to the user that created a project through the
project template.

.Prerequisites

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
- Create a CRD.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
- A cluster-scoped CRD has been created in your cluster.
endif::[]

.Procedure

. Create a cluster role definition file for the CRD. The cluster role definition
is a YAML file that contains the rules that apply to each cluster role. The
{product-title} controller adds the rules that you specify to the default
cluster roles.

kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 <1>
metadata:
  name: aggregate-cron-tabs-admin-edit <2>
  labels:
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin: "true" <3>

kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: aggregate-cron-tabs-view <2>
  labels:
    # Add these permissions to the "view" default role.
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: "true" <8>
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-cluster-reader: "true" <9>
rules:
- apiGroups: ["stable.example.com"] <5>
  resources: ["crontabs"] <6>
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"] <7>
----
<1> Use the `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1` API.
<2> Specify a name for the definition.
<3> Specify this label to grant permissions to the admin default role.
<4> Specify this label to grant permissions to the edit default role.
<5> Specify the group name of the CRD.
<6> Specify the plural name of the CRD that these rules apply to.
<7> Specify the verbs that represent the permissions that are granted to the role.
For example, apply read and write permissions to the `admin` and `edit` roles
and only read permission to the `view` role.
<8> Specify this label to grant permissions to the `view` default role.
<9> Specify this label to grant permissions to the `cluster-reader` default role.
