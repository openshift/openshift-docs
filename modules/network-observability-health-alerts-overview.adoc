= Health alerts

A health alert banner that directs you to the dashboard can appear on the *Network Traffic* and *Home* pages if an alert is triggered. Alerts are generated in the following cases:

* The `NetObservLokiError` alert occurs if the `flowlogs-pipeline` workload is dropping flows because of Loki errors, such as if the Loki ingestion rate limit has been reached.
* The `NetObservNoFlows` alert occurs if no flows are ingested for a certain amount of time.
* The `NetObservFlowsDropped` alert occurs if the Network Observability eBPF agent hashmap table is full, and the eBPF agent processes flows with degraded performance, or when the capacity limiter is triggered.
