= Updating waypoint proxies with InPlace strategy in ambient mode

[role="_abstract"]
During an `InPlace` update in ambient mode, waypoint proxies are going to be updated to the latest control plane version without restarting application workloads because they are deployed and managed as separate Gateway API resources that scale and upgrade independently.

.Prerequisites

* You have updated the {istio} control plane with `InPlace` update strategy.

.Procedure

* Confirm that the waypoint proxy was updated proxy version by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ istioctl proxy-status | grep waypoint
----
+
You should see an output similar to the following example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+attributes"]
----
waypoint-5d9c8b7f9-abc12.bookinfo     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     istiod-6cf8d4f9cb-wm7x6.istio-system     {istio-latest}
----
+
You can run the command to query the {istio} control plane and verify that the waypoint proxy connects and synchronizes. The output lists the waypoint proxy name and namespace, the synchronization status for each configuration type, the connected `istiod` pod, and the {istio} version of the running proxy. Columns showing `SYNCED` confirm that the waypoint proxy is successfully receiving configuration from the control plane.
