= Minimum {ibm-z-title} system environment

You can install {product-title} version {product-version} on the following {ibm-name} hardware:

* {ibm-name} z16 (all models), {ibm-name} z15 (all models), {ibm-name} z14 (all models)
* {ibm-linuxone-name} 4 (all models), {ibm-linuxone-name} III (all models), {ibm-linuxone-name} Emperor II, {ibm-linuxone-name} Rockhopper II

ifdef::ibm-z-lpar[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
When running {product-title} on {ibm-z-name} without a hypervisor use the Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) to manage your machine.
// Once blog url is available add: For details see blog...

== Hardware requirements

* The equivalent of six Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFL), which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* At least one network connection to both connect to the `LoadBalancer` service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You can use dedicated or shared IFLs to assign sufficient compute resources. Resource sharing is one of the key strengths of {ibm-z-name}. However, you must adjust capacity correctly on each hypervisor layer and ensure sufficient resources for every {product-title} cluster.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since the overall performance of the cluster can be impacted, the LPARs that are used to set up the {product-title} clusters must provide sufficient compute capacity. In this context, LPAR weight management, entitlements, and CPU shares on the hypervisor level play an important role.

== Operating system requirements

ifdef::ibm-z[]
* One instance of z/VM 7.2 or later

On your z/VM instance, set up:

* Three guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines
* Two guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines
* One guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine
endif::ibm-z[]
ifdef::ibm-z-lpar[]
* Five logical partitions (LPARs)
** Three LPARs for {product-title} control plane machines
** Two LPARs for {product-title} compute machines
* One machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine
endif::ibm-z-lpar[]

[discrete]
== {ibm-z-title} network connectivity requirements

ifdef::ibm-z[]
To install on {ibm-z-name} under z/VM, you require a single z/VM virtual NIC in layer 2 mode. You also need:

* A direct-attached OSA or RoCE network adapter
* A z/VM VSwitch set up. For a preferred setup, use OSA link aggregation.
endif::ibm-z[]
ifdef::ibm-z-lpar[]
To install on {ibm-z-name} in an LPAR, you need:

* A direct-attached OSA or RoCE network adapter
* For a preferred setup, use OSA link aggregation.
endif::ibm-z-lpar[]

[discrete]
=== Disk storage
// We might need two headings:
// === Disk storage for the z/VM guest virtual machines
// === Disk storage for the LPARs

ifdef::ibm-z[]
* FCP attached disk storage
endif::ibm-z[]
ifdef::ibm-z-lpar[]
* FCP attached disk storage
endif::ibm-z-lpar[]

[discrete]
=== Storage / Main Memory

* 16 GB for {product-title} control plane machines
* 8 GB for {product-title} compute machines
* 16 GB for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine
