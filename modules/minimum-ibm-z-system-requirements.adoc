[id="minimum-ibm-z-system-requirements_{context}"]
= Minimum IBM Z system environment

You can install {product-title} version {product-version} on the following IBM hardware:

* IBM z15 (all models), IBM z14 (all models), IBM z13, and IBM z13s
* LinuxONE, any version

[discrete]
== Hardware requirements

* The equivalent of 6 IFLs, which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* At least one network connection to both connect to the `LoadBalancer` service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You can use dedicated or shared IFLs to assign sufficient compute resources. Resource sharing is one of the key strengths of IBM Z. However, you must adjust capacity correctly on each hypervisor layer and ensure sufficient resources for every {product-title} cluster.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since the overall performance of the cluster can be impacted, the LPARs that are used to setup the {product-title} clusters must provide sufficient compute capacity. In this context, LPAR weight management, entitlements, and CPU shares on the hypervisor level play an important role.

[discrete]
== Operating system requirements

* One instance of z/VM 7.1 or later

On your z/VM instance, set up:

* 3 guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines
* 2 guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines
* 1 guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine

[discrete]
== IBM Z network connectivity requirements

To install on IBM Z under z/VM, you require a single z/VM virtual NIC in layer 2 mode. You also need:

*   A direct-attached OSA or RoCE network adapter
*   A z/VM VSwitch set up. For a preferred setup, use OSA link aggregation.

[discrete]
=== Disk storage for the z/VM guest virtual machines

* FICON attached disk storage (DASDs). These can be z/VM minidisks, fullpack minidisks, or dedicated DASDs, all of which must be formatted as CDL, which is the default. To reach the minimum required DASD size for {op-system-first} installations, you need extended address volumes (EAV). If available, use HyperPAV to ensure optimal performance.
* FCP attached disk storage

[discrete]
=== Storage / Main Memory

* 16 GB for {product-title} control plane machines
* 8 GB for {product-title} compute machines
* 16 GB for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine
