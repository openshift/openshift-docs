= Creating alerting rules

You can create alerting rules, which will fire alerts based on values of chosen metrics.

[NOTE]
====
Viewing and managing your rules and alerts is not yet integrated into the web console. A cluster administrator can instead use the Alertmanager UI or the Thanos Ruler. See the respective sections for instructions.
====

.Prerequisites

* Log in as a user that has the `monitoring-rules-edit` role for the namespace where you want to create the alerting rule.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for alerting rules. In this example, it is called `example-app-alerting-rule.yaml`.

. Fill the file with the configuration for the alerting rules:
+
[NOTE]
====
When you create an alerting rule, a namespace label is enforced on it if a rule with the same name exists in another namespace.
====
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: example-alert
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  groups:
  - name: example
    rules:
    - alert: VersionAlert
      expr: version{job="prometheus-example-app"} == 0
----
+
This configuration creates an alerting rule named `example-alert`, which fires an alert when the `version` metric exposed by the sample service becomes `0`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For every namespace, you can use metrics of that namespace and cluster metrics, but not metrics of another namespace.

For example, an alerting rule for `ns1` can have metrics from `ns1` and cluster metrics, such as the CPU and memory metrics. However, the rule cannot include metrics from `ns2`.

Additionally, you cannot create alerting rules for the `openshift-*` core OpenShift namespaces. {product-title} Monitoring by default provides a set of alerting rules for these namespaces.
====

. Apply the configuration file to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-app-alerting-rule.yaml
----
+
It will take some time to create the alerting rules.
