= About the mirror registry

You can mirror the images that are required for {product-title} installation and subsequent product updates to a separate container image registry, or _mirror registry_. These actions use the same process. The release image, which contains the description of the content, and the images it references are all mirrored. In addition, the Operator catalog source image and the images that it references must be mirrored for each Operator that you use. After you mirror the content, you configure each cluster to retrieve this content from your mirror registry.

The mirror registry can be any container image registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]. All major cloud provider registries, as well as Red Hat Quay, Artifactory, and others, have the necessary support. Using one of these registries ensures that {product-title} can verify the integrity of each image in disconnected environments.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The internal registry of the {product-title} cluster cannot be used as the target registry because it does not support pushing without a tag, which is required during the mirroring process.
====


The mirror registry must be reachable by every machine in the clusters that you provision. If the container image registry is unreachable, installation, updating, or normal operations such as workload relocation might fail. For that reason, you must run mirror registries in a highly available way, and the mirror registries must at least match the production availability of your {product-title} clusters.

When you populate a mirror registry with {product-title} images, you can follow two scenarios. If you have a host that can access both the internet and your mirror registry, but not your cluster nodes, you can directly mirror the content from that machine. If you have no such host, you must mirror the images to a file system and then bring that host or removable media into your restricted environment.

For mirrored registries, to view the source of pulled images, you must review the `Trying to access` log entry in the CRI-O logs. Other methods to view the image pull source, such as using the `crictl images` command on a node, show the non-mirrored image name, even though the image is pulled from the mirrored location.
