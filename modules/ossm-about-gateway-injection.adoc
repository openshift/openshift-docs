= About gateway injection
:context: ossm-about-gateway-injection

Gateway injection relies upon the same mechanism as sidecar injection to inject the Envoy proxy into gateway pods. To install a gateway using gateway injection, you create a Kubernetes `Deployment` object and an associated Kubernetes `Service` object in a namespace that is visible to the {istio} control plane. When creating the `Deployment` object you label and annotate it so that the {istio} control plane injects a proxy, and the proxy is configured as a gateway. After installing the gateway, you configure it to control ingress and egress traffic using the {istio} `Gateway` and `VirtualService` resources.
