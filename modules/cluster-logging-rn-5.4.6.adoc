== Bug fixes
* Before this update, Fluentd would sometimes not recognize that the Kubernetes platform rotated the log file and would no longer read log messages. This update corrects that by setting the configuration parameter suggested by the upstream development team. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2792[LOG-2792])

* Before this update, each rollover job created empty indices when the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource had JSON parsing defined. With this update, new indices are not empty. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2823[LOG-2823])

* Before this update, if you deleted the Kibana Custom Resource, the {product-title} web console continued displaying a link to Kibana. With this update, removing the Kibana Custom Resource also removes that link. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3054[LOG-3054])
