= OpenTelemetry Collector configuration options

The OpenTelemetry Collector consists of five types of components that access telemetry data:

Receivers:: A receiver, which can be push or pull based, is how data gets into the Collector. Generally, a receiver accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format, and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the applicable pipelines. By default, no receivers are configured. One or more receivers must be configured. Receivers may support one or more data sources.

Processors:: Optional. Processors process the data between it is received and exported. By default, no processors are enabled. Processors must be enabled for every data source. Not all processors support all data sources. Depending on the data source, multiple processors might be enabled. Note that the order of processors matters.

Exporters:: An exporter, which can be push or pull based, is how you send data to one or more back ends or destinations. By default, no exporters are configured. One or more exporters must be configured. Exporters can support one or more data sources. Exporters might be used with their default settings, but many exporters require configuration to specify at least the destination and security settings.

Connectors:: A connector connects two pipelines. It consumes data as an exporter at the end of one pipeline and emits data as a receiver at the start of another pipeline. It can consume and emit data of the same or different data type. It can generate and emit data to summarize the consumed data, or it can merely replicate or route data.

Extensions:: An extension adds capabilities to the Collector. For example, authentication can be added to the receivers and exporters automatically.

You can define multiple instances of components in a custom resource YAML file. When configured, these components must be enabled through pipelines defined in the `spec.config.service` section of the YAML file. As a best practice, only enable the components that you need.

|===
|Parameter |Description |Values |Default
|receivers:
|A receiver is how data gets into the Collector. By default, no receivers are configured. There must be at least one enabled receiver for a configuration to be considered valid. Receivers are enabled by being added to a pipeline.
|`otlp`, `jaeger`, `prometheus`, `zipkin`, `kafka`, `opencensus`
|None

|processors:
|Processors run through the received data before it is exported. By default, no processors are enabled.
|`batch`, `memory_limiter`, `resourcedetection`, `attributes`, `span`, `k8sattributes`, `filter`, `routing`
|None

|exporters:
|An exporter sends data to one or more back ends or destinations. By default, no exporters are configured. There must be at least one enabled exporter for a configuration to be considered valid. Exporters are enabled by being added to a pipeline. Exporters might be used with their default settings, but many require configuration to specify at least the destination and security settings.
|`otlp`, `otlphttp`, `debug`, `prometheus`, `kafka`
|None

|connectors:
|Connectors join pairs of pipelines by consuming data as end-of-pipeline exporters and emitting data as start-of-pipeline receivers. Connectors can be used to summarize, replicate, or route consumed data.
