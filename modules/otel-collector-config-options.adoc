= OpenTelemetry Collector configuration options

The OpenTelemetry Collector consists of five types of components that access telemetry data:

* Receivers
* Processors
* Exporters
* Connectors
* Extensions

You can define multiple instances of components in a custom resource YAML file. When configured, these components must be enabled through pipelines defined in the `spec.config.service` section of the YAML file. As a best practice, only enable the components that you need.

.Parameters used by the Operator to define the OpenTelemetry Collector
[options="header"]
[cols="l, a, a, a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Values |Default
|receivers:
|A receiver is how data gets into the Collector. By default, no receivers are configured. There must be at least one enabled receiver for a configuration to be considered valid. Receivers are enabled by being added to a pipeline.
|`otlp`, `jaeger`, `prometheus`, `zipkin`, `kafka`, `opencensus`
|None

|processors:
|Processors run through the received data before it is exported. By default, no processors are enabled.
|`batch`, `memory_limiter`, `resourcedetection`, `attributes`, `span`, `k8sattributes`, `filter`, `routing`
|None

|exporters:
|An exporter sends data to one or more back ends or destinations. By default, no exporters are configured. There must be at least one enabled exporter for a configuration to be considered valid. Exporters are enabled by being added to a pipeline. Exporters might be used with their default settings, but many require configuration to specify at least the destination and security settings.
|`otlp`, `otlphttp`, `debug`, `prometheus`, `kafka`
|None

|connectors:
|Connectors join pairs of pipelines by consuming data as end-of-pipeline exporters and emitting data as start-of-pipeline receivers. Connectors can be used to summarize, replicate, or route consumed data.
|`spanmetrics`
|None

|extensions:
|Optional components for tasks that do not involve processing telemetry data.
|`bearertokenauth`, `oauth2client`, `jaegerremotesamplin`, `pprof`, `health_check`, `memory_ballast`, `zpages`
|None

  pipelines:
|Components are enabled by adding them to a pipeline under `services.pipeline`.
