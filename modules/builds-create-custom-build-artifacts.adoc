= Creating custom build artifacts

You must create the image you want to use as your custom build image.

.Procedure

. Starting with an empty directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:
+
[source,terminal]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel8/buildah
# In this example, `/tmp/build` contains the inputs that build when this
# custom builder image is run. Normally the custom builder image fetches
# this content from some location at build time, by using git clone as an example.
ADD dockerfile.sample /tmp/input/Dockerfile
ADD build.sh /usr/bin
RUN chmod a+x /usr/bin/build.sh
# /usr/bin/build.sh contains the actual custom build logic that will be run when
# this custom builder image is run.
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/build.sh"]
----

. In the same directory, create a file named `dockerfile.sample`. This file is included in the custom build image and defines the image that is produced by the custom build:
+
[source,terminal]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
RUN touch /tmp/build
----

. In the same directory, create a file named `build.sh`. This file contains the logic that is run when the custom build runs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
#!/bin/sh
# Note that in this case the build inputs are part of the custom builder image, but normally this
# is retrieved from an external source.
cd /tmp/input
# OUTPUT_REGISTRY and OUTPUT_IMAGE are env variables provided by the custom
# build framework
TAG="${OUTPUT_REGISTRY}/${OUTPUT_IMAGE}"


# performs the build of the new image defined by dockerfile.sample
buildah --storage-driver vfs bud --isolation chroot -t ${TAG} .


# buildah requires a slight modification to the push secret provided by the service
# account to use it for pushing the image
cp /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/push/.dockercfg /tmp
(echo "{ \"auths\": " ; cat /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/push/.dockercfg ; echo "}") > /tmp/.dockercfg


# push the new image to the target for the build
buildah --storage-driver vfs push --tls-verify=false --authfile /tmp/.dockercfg ${TAG}
