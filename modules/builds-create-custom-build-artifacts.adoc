= Creating custom build artifacts

You must create the image you want to use as your custom build image.

.Procedure

. Starting with an empty directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the
following content:
+
----
FROM docker.io/centos:7
RUN yum install -y buildah
# For simplicity, /tmp/build contains the inputs we’ll be building when we
# run this custom builder image. Normally the custom builder image would
# fetch this content from some location at build time. (e.g. via git clone).
ADD Dockerfile.sample /tmp/input/Dockerfile
ADD build.sh /usr/bin
RUN chmod a+x /usr/bin/build.sh
# /usr/bin/build.sh contains the actual custom build logic that will be executed when
# this custom builder image is executed.
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/build.sh"]
----

. In the same directory, create a file named `Dockerfile.sample`. This file will be
included in the custom build image and defines the image that will be produced
by the custom build:
+
----
FROM docker.io/centos:7
RUN touch /tmp/built
----

. In the same directory, create a file named `build.sh`. This file contains the
logic that will be executed when the custom build runs:
+
----
#!/bin/sh
# Note that in this case the build inputs are part of the custom builder image, but normally this
# would be retrieved from an external source.
cd /tmp/input
# OUTPUT_REGISTRY and OUTPUT_IMAGE are env variables provided by the custom
# build framework
TAG="${OUTPUT_REGISTRY}/${OUTPUT_IMAGE}"


# performs the build of the new image defined by Dockerfile.sample
buildah --storage-driver vfs bud --isolation chroot -t ${TAG} .


# buildah requires a slight modification to the push secret provided by the service
# account in order to use it for pushing the image
cp /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/push/.dockercfg /tmp
(echo "{ \"auths\": " ; cat /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/push/.dockercfg ; echo "}") > /tmp/.dockercfg


# push the new image to the target for the build
buildah --storage-driver vfs push --tls-verify=false --authfile /tmp/.dockercfg ${TAG}
