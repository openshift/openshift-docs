= Creating ZTP custom resources for multiple managed clusters

If you are installing multiple managed clusters, zero touch provisioning (ZTP) uses ArgoCD and `SiteConfig` to manage the processes that create the custom resources (CR) and generate and apply the policies for multiple clusters, in batches of no more than 100, using the GitOps approach.

Installing and deploying the clusters is a two stage process, as shown here:
