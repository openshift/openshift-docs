[id="serverless-config-replicas_{context}"]
= Configuring high availability replicas on {ServerlessProductName}

High availability (HA) functionality is available by default on {ServerlessProductName} for the `autoscaler-hpa`, `controller`, `activator`, `kourier-control`, and `kourier-gateway` controllers. These components are configured with two replicas by default.

You modify the number of replicas that are created per controller by changing the configuration of `KnativeServing.spec.highAvailability` in the KnativeServing custom resource definition.
// This field also specifies the minimum number of _activators_ if you are using the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA). For more information about HPA, see

.Prerequisites

* An {product-title} account with cluster administrator access.
* Installed the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *OperatorHub* -> *Installed Operators*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not modify any YAML contained inside the `config` field. Some of the configuration values in this field are injected by the {ServerlessOperatorName}, and modifying them will cause your deployment to become unsupported.

* The default `replicas` value is `2`.
* Changing the value to `1` will disable HA, or you can increase the number of replicas as required. The example configuration shown specifies a replica count of `3` for all HA controllers.
