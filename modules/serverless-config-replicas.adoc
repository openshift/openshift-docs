= Configuring high availability replicas on {ServerlessProductName}

High availability (HA) functionality is available by default on {ServerlessProductName} for the `autoscaler-hpa`, `controller`, `activator`, `kourier-control`, and `kourier-gateway` controllers. These components are configured with two replicas by default.

You modify the number of replicas that are created per controller by changing the configuration of the `KnativeServing.spec.highAvailability` spec in the `KnativeServing` custom resource definition (CRD).

.Prerequisites
* You have access to a {product-title} account with cluster administrator access.
* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster.
* You have logged into the web console.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *OperatorHub* -> *Installed Operators*.

+
. Select the `knative-serving` namespace.
+
. Click *Knative Serving* in the list of *Provided APIs* for the {ServerlessOperatorName} to go to the *Knative Serving* tab.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not modify any YAML contained inside the `config` field. Some of the configuration values in this field are injected by the {ServerlessOperatorName}, and modifying them will cause your deployment to become unsupported.
====
+
* The default `replicas` value is `2`.
* Changing the value to `1` will disable HA, or you can increase the number of replicas as required. The example configuration shown specifies a replica count of `3` for all HA controllers.
