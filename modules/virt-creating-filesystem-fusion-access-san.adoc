= Creating a file system with {FusionSAN}

You need to create a file system to represent your required storage.

The file system is based on the storage available in the worker nodes you selected when creating the storage cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You created a {FusionSAN} storage cluster.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Storage* -> *{FusionSAN}*.

. In the *File systems* tab, click *Create file system*.

. Enter a *Name* for the new file system.

. Select the LUNs that you want to use as the storage volumes for your file system.

. Click *Create file system*. 
+
The *{FusionSAN}* page reloads, and the new file system appears in the *File systems* tab.

.Next steps

Repeat this procedure for each file system that you want to create.

.Verification

. Watch the *Status* of the file system in the *File systems* tab until it is marked as *Healthy*.
+
[NOTE]
====
This may take several minutes.
====

. Click on the *StorageClass* for the file system.

. In the *YAML* tab, verify the following:
+
.. The value in the `name` field is the name of the file system you created.
.. The value in the `provisioner` field is `spectrumscale.csi.ibm.com`.
.. The value in the `volBackendFs` field matches the name of the file system you created.
