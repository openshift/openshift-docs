[id="cnf-image-based-upgrade-troubleshooting_{context}"]
= Troubleshooting image-based upgrades with {lcao}

Perform troubleshooting steps on the managed clusters that are affected by an issue.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR to upgrade your clusters, ensure that the `lcm.openshift.io/ibgu-<stage>-completed or `lcm.openshift.io/ibgu-<stage>-failed` cluster labels are updated properly after performing troubleshooting or recovery steps on the managed clusters.
This ensures that the {cgu-operator} continues to manage the image-based upgrade for the cluster.

== Collecting logs

You can use the `oc adm must-gather` CLI to collect information for debugging and troubleshooting.

.Procedure

* Collect data about the Operators by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc adm must-gather \
  --dest-dir=must-gather/tmp \
  --image=$(oc -n openshift-lifecycle-agent get deployment.apps/lifecycle-agent-controller-manager -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name == "manager")].image}') \
  --image=quay.io/konveyor/oadp-must-gather:latest \// <1>
  --image=quay.io/openshift/origin-must-gather:latest <2>
----
<1> (Optional) You can add this options if you need to gather more information from the {oadp-short} Operator.
<2> (Optional) You can add this options if you need to gather more information from the SR-IOV Operator.

[id="cnf-image-based-upgrade-troubleshooting-manual-cleanup_{context}"]
== AbortFailed or FinalizeFailed error

Issue::
+
--
During the finalize stage or when you stop the process at the `Prep` stage, {lcao} cleans up the following resources:

* Stateroot that is no longer required
* Precaching resources
* {oadp-short} CRs
* `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR

If the {lcao} fails to perform the above steps, it transitions to the `AbortFailed` or `FinalizeFailed` states.
The condition message and log show which steps failed.

.Example error message
[source,yaml]
----
message: failed to delete all the backup CRs. Perform cleanup manually then add 'lca.openshift.io/manual-cleanup-done' annotation to ibu CR to transition back to Idle
      observedGeneration: 5
      reason: AbortFailed
      status: "False"
      type: Idle
----
--

Resolution::
+
--
. Inspect the logs to determine why the failure occurred.

. To prompt {lcao} to retry the cleanup, add the `lca.openshift.io/manual-cleanup-done` annotation to the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR.

+
After observing this annotation, {lcao} retries the cleanup and, if it is successful, the `ImageBasedUpgrade` stage transitions to `Idle`.

+
If the cleanup fails again, you can manually clean up the resources.

[id="cnf-image-based-upgrade-troubleshooting-stateroot_{context}"]
=== Cleaning up stateroot manually

Issue::

Stopping at the `Prep` stage, {lcao} cleans up the new stateroot. When finalizing after a successful upgrade or a rollback, {lcao} cleans up the old stateroot.
If this step fails, it is recommended that you inspect the logs to determine why the failure occurred.

Resolution::
+
--
. Check if there are any existing deployments in the stateroot by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ostree admin status
----

. If there are any, clean up the existing deployment by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ostree admin undeploy <index_of_deployment>
----

. After cleaning up all the deployments of the stateroot, wipe the stateroot directory by running the following commands:

+
[WARNING]
====
Ensure that the booted deployment is not in this stateroot.
====

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ stateroot="<stateroot_to_delete>"

[id="cnf-image-based-upgrade-troubleshooting-oadp-resources_{context}"]
=== Cleaning up {oadp-short} resources manually

Issue::

Automatic cleanup of {oadp-short} resources can fail due to connection issues between {lcao} and the S3 backend. By restoring the connection and adding the `lca.openshift.io/manual-cleanup-done` annotation, the {lcao} can successfully cleanup backup resources.

Resolution::
--
. Check the backend connectivity by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get backupstoragelocations.velero.io -n openshift-adp
----

== {lvms} volume contents not restored

When {lvms} is used to provide dynamic persistent volume storage, {lvms} might not restore the persistent volume contents if it is configured incorrectly.

[id="cnf-image-based-upgrade-troubleshooting-lvms-backup_{context}"]
=== Missing {lvms}-related fields in Backup CR

Issue::
Your `Backup` CRs might be missing fields that are needed to restore your persistent volumes.
You can check for events in your application pod to determine if you have this issue by running the following:

$ oc describe pod <your_app_name>

Resolution::
You must include `logicalvolumes.topolvm.io` in the application `Backup` CR.
Without this resource, the application restores its persistent volume claims and persistent volume manifests correctly, however, the `logicalvolume` associated with this persistent volume is not restored properly after pivot.

Resolution::
The reason for this issue is that the `logicalvolume` status is not preserved in the `Restore` CR.
This status is important because it is required for Velero to reference the volumes that must be preserved after pivoting.
You must include the following fields in the application `Restore` CR:

== Debugging failed Backup and Restore CRs

Issue::
The backup or restoration of artifacts failed.

Resolution::
You can debug `Backup` and `Restore` CRs and retrieve logs with the Velero CLI tool.
The Velero CLI tool provides more detailed information than the OpenShift CLI tool.

. Describe the `Backup` CR that contains errors by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -n openshift-adp velero-7c87d58c7b-sw6fc -c velero -- ./velero describe backup -n openshift-adp backup-acm-klusterlet --details
----

. Describe the `Restore` CR that contains errors by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -n openshift-adp velero-7c87d58c7b-sw6fc -c velero -- ./velero describe restore -n openshift-adp restore-acm-klusterlet --details
----

. Download the backed up resources to a local directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -n openshift-adp velero-7c87d58c7b-sw6fc -c velero -- ./velero backup download -n openshift-adp backup-acm-klusterlet -o ~/backup-acm-klusterlet.tar.gz
