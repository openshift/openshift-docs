[role="_abstract"]
Source-to-image (S2I) is a build process in {product-title} that injects your source code into a container image. S2I automates the creation of ready-to-run container images from your application source code without manual configuration.

S2I performs the following steps:

. Runs the `FROM <builder image>` command
. Copies the source code to a defined location in the builder image
. Runs the assemble script in the builder image
. Sets the run script in the builder image as the default command

Buildah then creates the container image.
