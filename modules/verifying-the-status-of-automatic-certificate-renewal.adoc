= Verifying the status of automatic certificate renewal

By viewing the *Clusters* page, you can verify that the automatic certificate renewal is active. 

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, click *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
. Verify that *Auto-refresh enabled* appears in the *Credential Expiration* column.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If a secured cluster displays a warning about soon-to-expire credentials even though auto-refresh is enabled, you must manually restart the pods of the affected cluster to apply the latest certificates and prevent downtime.

For more information, see "Applying the latest internal certificates".
