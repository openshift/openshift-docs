= About reviewing resource consumption

Line chart graphs in the {VirtProductName} dashboard present data for virtual machines or `virt-launcher` pods that are consuming the most resources for a selected time range.

The following table shows monitored resources and describes the metrics associated with each resource for top consumers in each pod.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Monitored resources| Description

|Memory swap traffic
|Virtual machines consuming the most memory pressure when swapping memory.
|vCPU wait
|Virtual machines experiencing the maximum wait time (in seconds) for their vCPUs.
|CPU Usage
|The `virt-launcher` pods with virtual machines that are using the most CPU.
|Network traffic
|Virtual machines that are saturating the network by receiving the most amount of network traffic (in bytes).
|Storage traffic
|Virtual machines with the highest amount (in bytes) of storage-related traffic.
|Storage IOPS
|Virtual machines with the highest amount of I/O operations per second over a time period.
|Memory usage
|The `virt-launcher` pods with virtual machines that are using the most memory (in bytes).

Viewing the maximum resource consumption is limited to the top five consumers.
