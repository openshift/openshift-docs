For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features,
see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[].
endif::[]
2. Turning this feature set on is not supported, cannot be undone, and prevents upgrades. 
Because of its nature, this setting cannot be validated.  If you have any typos or accidentally 
apply invalid combinations your cluster might fail in an unrecoverable way.

[NOTE]
====
If you use the CustomNoUpgrade feature set to disable a feature that appears in the web console, 
you might see that feature, but no objects are listed. For example, if you disable builds, you can 
see the *Builds* tab in the web console, but there are no builds present.

If you attempt to use commands associated with a disabled feature, such as `oc start-build`, 
{product-title} displays an error.

If you disable a feature that any application in the cluster relies on, the application might not
function properly, depending upon the feature disabled and how the application uses that feature.

3. Turning on this feature set does not prevent cluster upgrades.
4. Turning this feature set on is not supported, cannot be undone, and prevents upgrades.

You can enable or disable these feature sets by editing the Feature Gate Custom Resource.
