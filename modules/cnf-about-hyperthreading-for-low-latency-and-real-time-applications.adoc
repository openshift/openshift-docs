= About Hyper-Threading for low latency and real-time applications

Hyper-Threading is an Intel processor technology that allows a physical CPU processor core to function as two logical cores, executing two independent threads simultaneously. Hyper-Threading allows for better system throughput for certain workload types where parallel processing is beneficial. The default {product-title} configuration expects Hyper-Threading to be enabled.

For telecommunications applications, it is important to design your application infrastructure to minimize latency as much as possible. Hyper-Threading can slow performance times and negatively affect throughput for compute-intensive workloads that require low latency. Disabling Hyper-Threading ensures predictable performance and can decrease processing times for these workloads.

[NOTE]
====
Hyper-Threading implementation and configuration differs depending on the hardware you are running {product-title} on. Consult the relevant host hardware tuning information for more details of the Hyper-Threading implementation specific to that hardware. Disabling Hyper-Threading can increase the cost per core of the cluster.
