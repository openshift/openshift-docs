= Defining cluster size requirements

To install and use {ServerlessProductName}, the {product-title} cluster must be sized correctly.

[NOTE]
====
The following requirements relate only to the pool of worker machines of the {product-title} cluster. Control plane nodes are not used for general scheduling and are omitted from the requirements.
====

The total size requirements to run {ServerlessProductName} are dependent on the applications deployed. By default, each pod requests approximately 400m of CPU, so the minimum requirements are based on this value. Lowering the actual CPU request of applications can increase the number of possible replicas.

If you have high availability (HA) enabled on your cluster, this requires between 0.5 - 1.5 cores and between 200MB - 2GB of memory for each replica of the Knative Serving control plane.
