= Defining cluster size requirements for an {ServerlessProductName} installation

To install and use {ServerlessProductName}, the {product-title} cluster must be sized correctly.

[NOTE]
====
The following requirements relate only to the pool of worker machines of the {product-title} cluster. Control plane nodes are not used for general scheduling and are omitted from the requirements.
====

The total size requirements to run {ServerlessProductName} are dependent on the applications deployed. By default, each pod requests approximately 400m of CPU, so the minimum requirements are based on this value. Lowering the actual CPU request of applications can increase the number of possible replicas.

[NOTE]
====
The following limitations apply to all {ServerlessProductName} deployments:

* Maximum number of Knative services: 1000
* Maximum number of Knative revisions: 1000
