= Defining cluster size requirements for an {ServerlessProductName} installation

To install and use {ServerlessProductName}, the {product-title} cluster must be sized correctly.
The minimum requirement for {ServerlessProductName} is a cluster with 10 CPUs and 40GB memory.
The total size requirements to run {ServerlessProductName} are dependent on the applications deployed. By default, each pod requests approximately 400m of CPU, so the minimum requirements are based on this value.
In the size requirement provided, an application can scale up to 10 replicas. Lowering the actual CPU request of applications can increase the number of possible replicas.

[NOTE]
====
The requirements provided relate only to the pool of worker machines of the {product-title} cluster. Master nodes are not used for general scheduling and are omitted from the requirements.

[NOTE]
====
The following limitations apply to all {ServerlessProductName} deployments:

* Maximum number of Knative services: 1000
* Maximum number of Knative revisions: 1000
