= Configuring /dev/fuse for unprivileged builds in pods

By exposing the `/dev/fuse` device to an unprivileged pod, you grant it the capability to perform Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) mounts. This is achieved by adding the `io.kubernetes.cri-o.Devices: "/dev/fuse"` annotation to your pod definition. This setup allows an unprivileged user within the pod to use tools like `podman` with storage drivers such as `fuse-overlayfs` by mimicking privileged build capabilities in a secure and efficient manner without granting full privileged access to the pod.

.Procedure

. Define the pod with `/dev/fuse` access:
+
* Create a YAML file named `fuse-builder-pod.yaml` with the following content: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: fuse-builder-pod
  annotations:
    io.kubernetes.cri-o.Devices: "/dev/fuse" <1>
spec:
  containers:
  - name: build-container
    image: quay.io/podman/stable <2>
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
    args: ["echo 'Container is running. Use oc exec to get a shell.'; sleep infinity"] <3>
    securityContext: <4>
      runAsUser: 1000
----
+
<1> The `io.kubernetes.cri-o.Devices: "/dev/fuse"` annotation makes the FUSE device available.
<2> This annotation specifies a container that uses an image that includes `podman` (for example, `quay.io/podman/stable`).
<3> This command keeps the container running so you can `exec` into it.
<4> This annotation specifies a `securityContext` that runs the container as an unprivileged user (for example, `runAsUser: 1000`).
*

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your cluster's Security Context Constraints (SCCs) or other policies, you might need to further adjust the `securityContext` specification, for example, by allowing specific capabilities if `/dev/fuse` alone is not sufficient for `fuse-overlayfs` to operate.
====
+
* Create the pod  by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f fuse-builder-pod.yaml
----

. Verify that the pod is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods fuse-builder-pod
----

. Access the pod and prepare the build environment:
+
After the `fuse-builder-pod` pod is in the `Running` state, open a shell session into the `build-container` environment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -ti fuse-builder-pod -- /bin/bash
----
+
You are now inside the container. Because the default working directory might not be writable by the unprivileged user, change to a writable directory like `/tmp`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd /tmp
$ pwd
/tmp
----

. Create a dockerfile and build an image using Podman:
+
Inside the pod's shell and within the `/tmp` directory, you can now create a `Dockerfile` and use `podman` to build a container image. If `fuse-overlayfs` is the default or configured storage driver, Podman is able to leverage `fuse-overlayfs` because of the available `/dev/fuse` device.
+
.. Create a sample `Dockerfile`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat > Dockerfile <<EOF
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal
RUN microdnf install -y findutils && microdnf clean all
RUN echo "This image was built inside a pod with /dev/fuse by user $(id -u)" > /app/build_info.txt
COPY Dockerfile /app/Dockerfile_copied
WORKDIR /app
CMD ["sh", "-c", "cat /app/build_info.txt && echo '--- Copied Dockerfile ---' && cat /app/Dockerfile_copied"]
EOF
----
+
.. Build the image using `podman`. The `-t` flag tags the image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman build -t my-fuse-built-image:latest .
----
+
You should see Podman executing the build steps.

. Optional: Test the built image:
+
Still inside the `fuse-builder-pod`, you can run a container from the image you just built to test it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run --rm my-fuse-built-image:latest
----
+
This should output the content of the `/app/build_info.txt` file and the copied Dockerfile.

. Exit the pod and clean up:
+
* After you are done, exit the shell session in the pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ exit
----
+
* You can then delete the pod if it's no longer needed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pod fuse-builder-pod
----
+
* Remove the local YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rm fuse-builder-pod.yaml
----
