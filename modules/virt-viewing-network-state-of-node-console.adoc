[id="virt-viewing-network-state-of-node-console_{context}"]
= Viewing the network state of a node (NNS) from the web console

As an administrator, you can use the {product-title} web console to observe `NodeNetworkState` resources and network interfaces, and access network details.

.Procedure
. Navigate to *Networking* â†’ *NodeNetworkState*.
+
In the *NodeNetworkState* page, you can view the list of `NodeNetworkState` resources and the corresponding interfaces that are created on the nodes. You can use *Filter* based on *Interface state*, *Interface type*, and *IP*, or the search bar based on criteria *Name* or *Label*, to narrow down the displayed `NodeNetworkState` resources.

. To access the detailed information about `NodeNetworkState` resource, click the `NodeNetworkState` resource name listed in the *Name* column .

. To expand and view the *Network Details* section for the `NodeNetworkState` resource, click the greater than (*>*) symbol . Alternatively, you can click on each interface type under the *Network interface* column to view the network details.

[id="virt-viewing-graphical-representation-of-nns-topology_{context}"]
== Viewing a graphical representation of the NNS topology

To make the configuration of the node network in the cluster easier to understand, you can view it in the form of a diagram. The NNS topology diagram displays all node components (network interface controllers, bridges, bonds, and VLANs), their properties and configurations, and connections between the nodes.

To open the topology view of the cluster, do the following:

. In the *Administrator* view of the web console, navigate to *Networking* -> *NodeNetworkState*.
. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the *Topology* icon.
+
The NNS topology diagram opens. Each group of components represents a single node.
+
* To display the configuration and propertires of a node, click inside the border of the node.
* To display the features or the YAML file of a specific component (for example, an interface or a bridge), click the icon of the component.
* The icons of active components have green borders; the icons of disconnected components have red borders.
