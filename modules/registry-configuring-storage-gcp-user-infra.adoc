= Configuring the registry storage for {gcp-short} with user-provisioned infrastructure

[role="_abstract"]
If the Registry Operator cannot create a {gcp-first} bucket, you must set up the storage medium manually and configure the settings in the registry custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* A cluster on {gcp-short} with user-provisioned infrastructure.
* To configure registry storage for {gcp-short}, you need to provide Registry Operator
cloud credentials.
* For GCS on {gcp-short} storage, the secret is expected to contain one key whose value is the
contents of a credentials file provided by {gcp-short}:
** `REGISTRY_STORAGE_GCS_KEYFILE`

[WARNING]
====
You can secure your registry images that use a {gcp-full} Storage bucket by setting link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-public-access-prevention[public access prevention].

.Procedure

. Set up an link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle[Object Lifecycle Management policy] to abort incomplete multipart uploads that are one day old.

. Fill in the storage configuration in `configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster`:
