= Configuring the registry storage for GCP with user-provisioned infrastructure

If the Registry Operator cannot create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) bucket, you must set up the storage medium manually and configure the settings in the registry custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* A cluster on GCP with user-provisioned infrastructure.
* To configure registry storage for GCP, you need to provide Registry Operator
cloud credentials.
* For GCS on GCP storage, the secret is expected to contain one key whose value is the
contents of a credentials file provided by GCP:
** `REGISTRY_STORAGE_GCS_KEYFILE`

.Procedure

. Set up an link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle[Object Lifecycle Management policy] to abort incomplete multipart uploads that are one day old.

. Fill in the storage configuration in `configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster

.Example configuration
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
storage:
  gcs:
    bucket: <bucket-name>
    projectID: <project-id>
    region: <region-name>
# ...

You can secure your registry images that use a Google Cloud Storage bucket by setting link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-public-access-prevention[public access prevention].
