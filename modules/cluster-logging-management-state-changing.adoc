= Changing the cluster logging management state

You must set the operator to the _unmanaged_ state in order to modify the components managed by the Cluster Logging Operator:

* the Curator CronJob, 
* the `Elasticsearch` CR,
* the Kibana Deployment, 
* the log collector DaemonSet.

If you make changes to these components in managed state, the Cluster Logging Operator reverts those changes. 

[NOTE]
====
An unmanaged cluster logging environment does not receive updates until you return the Cluster Logging Operator to Managed state.
====

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Logging Operator must be installed.

.Procedure

. Edit the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) in the `openshift-logging` project:
+
----
$ oc edit ClusterLogging instance
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ oc edit ClusterLogging instance
 
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "instance"

....
