= The factory install workflow

The factory install pipeline is used to build out your factory environment (hub and spoke clusters) in readiness for the spoke cluster to be shipped off-site.

The following diagram provides a high level overview of the pipelines used to prepare the spoke clusters:

* **Hub deployment**: This first part deploys the hub cluster configuration. The assumption being {product-title} is installed with OpenShift Data Foundation and persistent volumes have been created with supporting DHCP and DNS configuration.
* **Spoke deployment**: This second part rapidly deploys relocatable spoke clusters on the preferred hardware in parallel. When deployment completes, the spoke cluster (with hardware) is shipped to the end customers, after which the end customers configure the spoke clusters with minimal steps to have a fully operational OpenShift cluster.
