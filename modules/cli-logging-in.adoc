= Logging in to the CLI

You can log in to the `oc` CLI to access and manage your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You must have installed the CLI.

[NOTE]
====
To access a cluster that is accessible only over an HTTP proxy server, you can set the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` variables.
These environment variables are respected by the `oc` CLI so that all communication with the cluster goes through the HTTP proxy.
====

.Procedure

* Log in to the CLI using the `oc login` command and enter the required
information when prompted.
