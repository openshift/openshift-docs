= Single node clusters

You use zero touch provisioning (ZTP) to deploy single node clusters to run distributed units (DUs) on small hardware footprints at disconnected
far edge sites. A single node cluster runs {product-title} on top of one bare metal machine, hence the single node. Edge servers contain a single node with supervisor functions and worker functions on the same host that are deployed at low bandwidth or disconnected edge sites.

{product-title} is configured on the single node to use workload partitioning. Workload partitioning separates cluster management workloads from
user workloads and can run the cluster management workloads on a reserved set of CPUs.
Workload partitioning is useful for resource-constrained environments, such as single-node production deployments,
where you want to reserve most of the CPU resources for user workloads and configure {product-title} to use fewer CPU resources within the host.

A single node cluster hosting a DU application on a node is divided into the following configuration categories:

* Common - Values are the same for all single node cluster sites managed by a hub cluster.
* Pools of sites - Common across a pool of sites where a pool size can be 1 to _n_.
* Site specific - Likely specific to a site with no overlap with other sites, for example, a vlan.
