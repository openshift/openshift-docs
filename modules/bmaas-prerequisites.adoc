= Prerequisites for using BMaaS

To use the Bare Metal as a Service (BMaaS) Technology Preview, complete the following prerequisites:

BareMetalHost Configuration::
All bare-metal hosts must use a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) configured with the Redfish protocol and virtual media (`redfish-virtualmedia`) driver. Each bare-metal host requires a boot interface with a MAC address configured to receive an IP address lease.

Network Requirements::
A DHCP server, separate from the {product-title} and Metal^3^ infrastructure, must be operational on the same Layer 2 network as the bare-metal hosts. The DHCP server must be configured to match the MAC addresses of the boot interfaces on the bare-metal hosts, enabling IP address assignment for communication with Metal^3^ components.

Cluster Privileges::
You must have `cluster-admin` privileges on the {product-title} cluster to perform BMaaS configuration tasks.

Web server with images::
BMaaS does not provide images for deployment on hardware. You must configure a web server with the images and checksums you want to use. The `image` field of the `BareMetalHost` spec references these images during deployment. Ensure that the bare-metal hosts can reach the web server URL. The following is an example of an image and checksum you might include:

  * `http://example.com/rhel9.qcow2`
  * `http://example.com/rhel9.qcow2.sha512sum`
  * `http://example.com/stream9.qcow2`
  * `http://example.com/stream9.qcow2.sha512sum`

These prerequisites ensure that BMaaS can provision and manage bare-metal hosts effectively.
