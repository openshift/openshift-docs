= Storing scorecard test results

You can enable local storage of scorecard test results by using the `scorecard` command or by modifying your `config.yaml` file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There is a known issue with the Operator SDK scorecard storage utility. Currently, running the `operator-sdk scorecard` command with the `--test-output` flag returns an empty directory. There is no known workaround at this time. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2017669[*BZ#2017669*])
====

.Procedure

. If you want to run a scorecard test from the command line and store the results, run the following command in a terminal window:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk scorecard <bundle_directory_or_image> --test-output=/<output_directory> <.>
----
<.> Define the output directory.
+
If you do not specify a directory, the command stores the test results in the `test-output` directory of your working directory.

. If you want to enable local storage in your configuration file, add the following to your `config.yaml` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
tests:
  - entrypoint:
    - scorecard-test
    - <test_entrypoint> <.>
    image: quay.io/operator-framework/scorecard-test:v1.10.0
    labels:
      suite: <test_suite> <.>
      test: <test_name> <.>
    storage:
      spec:
        mountPath:
          path: /<output_directory> <.>
----
<.> Replace `<test_entrypoint>` with the command and arguments that you want to run, such as `scorecared-test`.
<.> Define the test suite that you want to run, such as `olm`.
<.> Define the test name that you want to run, such as `olm-bundle-validation-test`.
<.> Set the the location of directory to store your test results, such as `test-results`.
