[id="installation-bare-metal-config-yaml_{context}"]
= Sample `install-config.yaml` file for bare metal

You can customize the `install-config.yaml` file to specify more details about
your {product-title} cluster's platform or modify the values of the required
parameters.

----
<1> The base domain of the cluster. All DNS records must be sub-domains of this
base and include the cluster name.
<2> The `controlPlane` section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a
sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures,
the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`, and the
first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Although both sections
currently define a single machine pool, it is possible that future versions
of {product-title} will support defining multiple compute pools during
installation. Only one control plane pool is used.
<3> Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or
`hyperthreading`. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled
to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by
setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable simultaneous
multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster
machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning
accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.
====
<4> You must set the value of the `replicas` parameter to `0`. This parameter
controls the number of workers that the cluster creates and manages for you,
which are functions that the cluster does not perform when you
use user-provisioned infrastructure. You must manually deploy worker
machines for the cluster to use before you finish installing {product-title}.
<5> The number of control plane machines that you add to the cluster. Because
the cluster uses this values as the number of etcd endpoints in the cluster, the
value must match the number of control plane machines that you deploy.
<6> The cluster name that you specified in your DNS records.
<7> A block of IP addresses from which Pod IP addresses are allocated. This block must
not overlap with existing physical networks. These IP addresses are used for the
Pod network, and if you need to access the Pods from an external network, configure
load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.
<8> The subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if
`hostPrefix` is set to `23`, then each node is assigned a `/23` subnet out of
the given `cidr`, which allows for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IPs addresses. If
you are required to provide access to nodes from an external network, configure
load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.
<9> The IP address pool to use for service IP addresses. You can enter only
one IP address pool. If you need to access the services from an external network,
configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.
<10> You must set the platform to `none`. You cannot provide additional platform
configuration variables for bare metal infrastructure.
ifndef::restricted[]
<11> The pull secret that you obtained from the
link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull Secret] page on the {cloud-redhat-com} site. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are
provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the
container images for {product-title} components.
endif::restricted[]
ifdef::restricted[]
<11> For `bastion_host_name`, specify the registry domain name
that you specified in the certificate for your mirror registry, and for
`<credentials>`, specify the base64-encoded user name and password for
your mirror registry.
endif::restricted[]
<12> The public portion of the default SSH key for the `core` user in
{op-system-first}.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery on, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.
====
ifdef::restricted[]
<13> Provide the contents of the certificate file that you used for your mirror
registry.
<14> Provide the `imageContentSources` section from the output of the command to
mirror the repository.
