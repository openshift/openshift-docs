= ServiceMonitor resources

A ServiceMonitor is a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) provided by the
Prometheus Operator that discovers the `Endpoints` in Service objects and
configures Prometheus to monitor those Pods.

In Go-based Operators generated using the Operator SDK, the
`GenerateServiceMonitor()` helper function can take a Service object and
generate a ServiceMonitor Custom Resource (CR) based on it.
