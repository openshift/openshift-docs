= Service monitors

A `ServiceMonitor` is a custom resource provided by the Prometheus Operator that discovers the `Endpoints` in `Service` objects and configures Prometheus to monitor those pods.

In Go-based Operators generated using the Operator SDK, the `GenerateServiceMonitor()` helper function can take a `Service` object and generate a `ServiceMonitor` object based on it.
