= Verify installation

After you complete the installation and configure necessary integrations, run sample applications to evaluate the results of security assessments and policy violations.

The sample applications described below are specifically designed to verify the build and deploy-time assessment features of {product-title}.

To run the sample application:

. Create a new namespace (or project).
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-project test
----

. Start a few workloads with critical vulnerabilities:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc run shell --labels=app=shellshock,team=test-team --image=vulnerables/cve-2014-6271 -n test
$ oc run samba --labels=app=rce --image=vulnerables/cve-2017-7494 -n test
----
+
{product-title} automatically scans these deployments for security risk and policy violations as soon as they're submitted to the cluster.
