= Understanding Operator installation policy

Using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), cluster administrators can choose to specify a service account for an Operator group so that all Operators associated with the group are deployed and run against the privileges granted to the service account.

The `APIService` and `CustomResourceDefinition` resources are always created by OLM using the `cluster-admin` role. A service account associated with an Operator group should never be granted privileges to write these resources.

If the specified service account does not have adequate permissions for an Operator that is being installed or upgraded, useful and contextual information is added to the status of the respective resource(s) so that it is easy for the cluster administrator to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

Any Operator tied to this Operator group is now confined to the permissions granted to the specified service account. If the Operator asks for permissions that are outside the scope of the service account, the install fails with appropriate errors.
