= Understanding Operator installation policy

Using OLM, cluster administrators can choose to specify a service account for an
OperatorGroup so that all Operators associated with the OperatorGroup are
deployed and run against the privileges granted to the service account.

`APIService` and `CustomResourceDefinition` resources are always created by OLM
using the `cluster-admin` role. A service account associated with an
OperatorGroup should never be granted privileges to write these resources.

If the specified service account does not have adequate permissions for an
Operator that is being installed or upgraded, useful and contextual information
is added to the status of the respective resource(s) so that it is easy for the
cluster administrator to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

Any Operator tied to this OperatorGroup is now confined to the permissions
granted to the specified service account. If the Operator asks for permissions
that are outside the scope of the service account, the install fails with
appropriate errors.
