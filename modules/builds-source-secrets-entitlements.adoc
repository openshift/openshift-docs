= Adding subscription entitlements as a build secret

Builds that use Red Hat subscriptions to install content must include the
entitlement keys as a build secret.

.Prerequisites

You must have access to Red Hat entitlements through your subscription, and
the entitlements must have separate public and private key files.

.Procedure

. Create a secret containing your entitlements, ensuring that there are separate
files containing the public and private keys:
+
----
$  oc create secret generic etc-pki-entitlement --from-file /path/to/entitlement/{ID}.pem \
> --from-file /path/to/entitlement/{ID}-key.pem ...
----

. Add the secret as a build input in the build configuration:
+
[source, yaml]
----
source:
  secrets:
  - secret:
      name: etc-pki-entitlement
    destinationDir: etc-pki-entitlement
----
