= Adding subscription entitlements as a build secret

Builds that use Red Hat subscriptions to install content must include the entitlement keys as a build secret.

.Prerequisites

You must have access to Red Hat entitlements through your subscription, and the entitlements must have separate public and private key files.

.Procedure

. Create a secret containing your entitlements, ensuring that there are separate files containing the public and private keys:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc create secret generic etc-pki-entitlement --from-file /path/to/entitlement/{ID}.pem \
> --from-file /path/to/entitlement/{ID}-key.pem ...
----

. Add the secret as a build volume in the build configuration’s Docker strategy:
+
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  dockerStrategy:
    from:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: ubi:latest
    volumes:
    - name: etc-pki-entitlement
      mounts:
      - destinationPath: /etc/pki/entitlement
      source:
        type: Secret
        secret:
          secretName: etc-pki-entitlement
----
