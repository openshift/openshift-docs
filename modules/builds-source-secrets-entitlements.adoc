= Adding subscription entitlements as a build secret

Builds that use Red Hat subscriptions to install content must include the entitlement keys as a build secret.

.Prerequisites

You must have access to Red Hat entitlements through your subscription. The entitlement secret is automatically created by the Insights Operator.


[TIP]
====
When you perform an Entitlement Build using {op-system-base-full} 7, you must have the following instructions in your Dockerfile before you run any `yum` commands:

[source,terminal]
----
RUN rm /etc/rhsm-host
----
====

.Procedure

. Add the secret as a build input in the build configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
source:
  secrets:
  - secret:
      name: etc-pki-entitlement
    destinationDir: etc-pki-entitlement
----
