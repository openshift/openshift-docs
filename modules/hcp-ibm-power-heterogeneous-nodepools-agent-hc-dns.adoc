= DNS configuration for hosted control planes

Domain Name Service (DNS) configuration for hosted control planes enables external clients to reach ingress controllers so that they can route traffic to internal components. Configuring this setting ensures that traffic is routed to either `ppc64le` or `x86_64` compute node.

You can point an `*.apps.<cluster_name>` record to either of the compute nodes where the ingress application is hosted. Or, if you are able to set up a load balancer on top of the compute nodes, point this record to this load balancer. When you are creating a heterogeneous node pool, make sure the compute nodes can reach each other or keep them in the same network.
