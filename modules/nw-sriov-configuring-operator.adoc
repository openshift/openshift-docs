[id="nw-sriov-configuring-operator_{context}"]
= Configuring the SR-IOV Network Operator

[IMPORTANT]
====
Modifying the SR-IOV Network Operator configuration is not normally necessary.
The default configuration is recommended for most use cases.
Complete the steps to modify the relevant configuration only if the default behavior of the Operator is not compatible with your use case.
====

The SR-IOV Network Operator adds the `SriovOperatorConfig.sriovnetwork.openshift.io` CustomResourceDefinition resource.
The Operator automatically creates a SriovOperatorConfig custom resource (CR) named `default` in the `openshift-sriov-network-operator` namespace.

[NOTE]
=====
The `default` CR contains the SR-IOV Network Operator configuration for your cluster.
To change the Operator configuration, you must modify this CR.

== SR-IOV Network Operator config custom resource

The fields for the `sriovoperatorconfig` custom resource are described in the following table:

.SR-IOV Network Operator config custom resource
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6a",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|Specifies the name of the SR-IOV Network Operator instance.
The default value is `default`.
Do not set a different value.

|`metadata.namespace`
|`string`
|Specifies the namespace of the SR-IOV Network Operator instance.
The default value is `openshift-sriov-network-operator`.
Do not set a different value.

|`spec.configDaemonNodeSelector`
|`string`

By default, this field is not set and the Operator deploys the SR-IOV Network Config daemon set on worker nodes.

|`spec.disableDrain`
|`boolean`
|Specifies whether to disable the node draining process or enable the node draining process when you apply a new policy to configure the NIC on a node.
Setting this field to `true` facilitates software development and installing {product-title} on a single node. By default, this field is not set.

For single-node clusters, set this field to `true` after installing the Operator. This field must remain set to `true`.

== About the Network Resources Injector

The Network Resources Injector is a Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller
application. It provides the following capabilities:

* Mutation of resource requests and limits in a pod specification to add an SR-IOV resource name according to an SR-IOV network attachment definition annotation.
* Mutation of a pod specification with a Downward API volume to expose pod annotations, labels, and huge pages requests and limits. Containers that run in the pod can access the exposed information as files under the `/etc/podnetinfo` path.

By default, the Network Resources Injector is enabled by the SR-IOV Network Operator and runs as a daemon set on all control plane nodes. The following is an example of Network Resources Injector pods running in a cluster with three control plane nodes:

$ oc get pods -n openshift-sriov-network-operator

[id="about-sr-iov-operator-admission-control-webhook_{context}"]
== About the SR-IOV Network Operator admission controller webhook

The SR-IOV Network Operator Admission Controller webhook is a Kubernetes Dynamic
Admission Controller application. It provides the following capabilities:

* Validation of the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` CR when it is created or updated.
* Mutation of the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` CR by setting the default value for the `priority` and `deviceType` fields when the CR is created or updated.

By default the SR-IOV Network Operator Admission Controller webhook is enabled by the Operator and runs as a daemon set on all control plane nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Use caution when disabling the SR-IOV Network Operator Admission Controller webhook. You can disable the webhook under specific circumstances, such as troubleshooting, or if you want to use unsupported devices. For information about configuring unsupported devices, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7010183[Configuring the SR-IOV Network Operator to use an unsupported NIC].

[id="about-custom-node-selectors_{context}"]
== About custom node selectors

The SR-IOV Network Config daemon discovers and configures the SR-IOV network devices on cluster nodes.
By default, it is deployed to all the `worker` nodes in the cluster.
You can use node labels to specify on which nodes the SR-IOV Network Config daemon runs.

[id="disable-enable-network-resource-injector_{context}"]
== Disabling or enabling the Network Resources Injector

To disable or enable the Network Resources Injector, which is enabled by default, complete the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You must have installed the SR-IOV Network Operator.

.Procedure

- Set the `enableInjector` field. Replace `<value>` with `false` to disable the feature or `true` to enable the feature.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch sriovoperatorconfig default \
  --type=merge -n openshift-sriov-network-operator \
  --patch '{ "spec": { "enableInjector": <value> } }'
----

[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to update the Operator:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovOperatorConfig
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator

* You must have installed the SR-IOV Network Operator.

.Procedure

- Set the `enableOperatorWebhook` field. Replace `<value>` with `false` to disable the feature or `true` to enable it:

[id="configuring-custom-nodeselector_{context}"]
== Configuring a custom NodeSelector for the SR-IOV Network Config daemon

The SR-IOV Network Config daemon discovers and configures the SR-IOV network devices on cluster nodes. By default, it is deployed to all the `worker` nodes in the cluster. You can use node labels to specify on which nodes the SR-IOV Network Config daemon runs.

To specify the nodes where the SR-IOV Network Config daemon is deployed, complete the following procedure.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
When you update the `configDaemonNodeSelector` field, the SR-IOV Network Config daemon is recreated on each selected node.
While the daemon is recreated, cluster users are unable to apply any new SR-IOV Network node policy or create new SR-IOV pods.
=====

.Procedure

- To update the node selector for the operator, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch sriovoperatorconfig default --type=json \
  -n openshift-sriov-network-operator \
  --patch '[{
      "op": "replace",
      "path": "/spec/configDaemonNodeSelector",
      "value": {<node_label>}
    }]'
----
+
Replace `<node_label>` with a label to apply as in the following example:
`"node-role.kubernetes.io/worker": ""`.
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to update the Operator:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovOperatorConfig
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  configDaemonNodeSelector:
    <node_label>

[id="configure-sr-iov-operator-single-node_{context}"]
== Configuring the SR-IOV Network Operator for single node installations

By default, the SR-IOV Network Operator drains workloads from a node before every policy change.
The Operator performs this action to ensure that there no workloads using the virtual functions before the reconfiguration.

For installations on a single node, there are no other nodes to receive the workloads.
As a result, the Operator must be configured not to drain the workloads from the single node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After performing the following procedure to disable draining workloads, you must remove any workload that uses an SR-IOV network interface before you change any SR-IOV network node policy.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You must have installed the SR-IOV Network Operator.

.Procedure

- To set the `disableDrain` field to `true`, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch sriovoperatorconfig default --type=merge \
  -n openshift-sriov-network-operator \
  --patch '{ "spec": { "disableDrain": true } }'
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to update the Operator:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovOperatorConfig
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  disableDrain: true
