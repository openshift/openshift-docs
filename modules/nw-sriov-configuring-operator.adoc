The Network Resources Injector is a Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller 
application that provides functionality of patching pod specifications with 
requests and limits of custom network resources managed by the SRIOV network device
plugin

By default the Network Resource Injector will be enabled by the operator. Follow this procedure to disable it.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You must have installed the SR-IOV Operator.
