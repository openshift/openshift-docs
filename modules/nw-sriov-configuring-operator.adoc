[id="about-network-resource-injector_{context}"]
== About the Network Resources Injector

The Network Resources Injector is a Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller application, which provides the following capabilities:

* Mutation of resource requests and limits in a pod specification to add an SR-IOV resource name according to an SR-IOV network attachment definition annotation.
* Mutation of a pod specification with a Downward API volume to expose pod annotations, labels, and huge pages requests and limits. Containers that run in the pod can access the exposed information as files under the `/etc/podnetinfo` path.

The Network Resources Injector is enabled by the SR-IOV Network Operator when the `enableInjector` is set to `true` in the `SriovOperatorConfig` CR. The `network-resources-injector` pod runs as a daemon set on all control plane nodes. The following is an example of Network Resources Injector pods running in a cluster with three control plane nodes:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-sriov-network-operator
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
network-resources-injector-5cz5p          1/1     Running   0          10m
network-resources-injector-dwqpx          1/1     Running   0          10m
network-resources-injector-lktz5          1/1     Running   0          10m
----

By default, the `failurePolicy` field in the Network Resources Injector webhook is set to `Ignore`. This default setting prevents pod creation from being blocked if the webhook is unavailable.

If you set the `failurePolicy` field to `Fail`, and the Network Resources Injector webhook is unavailable, the webhook attempts to mutate all pod creation and update requests. This behavior can block pod creation and disrupt normal cluster operations. To prevent such issues, you can enable the `featureGates.resourceInjectorMatchCondition` feature in the `SriovOperatorConfig` object to limit the scope of the Network Resources Injector webhook. If this feature is enabled, the webhook applies only to pods with the secondary network annotation `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks`.

If you set the `failurePolicy` field to `Fail` after enabling the `resourceInjectorMatchCondition` feature, the webhook applies only to pods with the secondary network annotation `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks`. If the webhook is unavailable, pods without this annotation are still deployed, preventing unnecessary disruptions to cluster operations.

The `featureGates.resourceInjectorMatchCondition` feature is disabled by default. To enable this feature, set the `featureGates.resourceInjectorMatchCondition` field to `true` in the `SriovOperatorConfig` object.

== About the SR-IOV Network Operator admission controller webhook

The SR-IOV Network Operator Admission Controller webhook is a Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller application. It provides the following capabilities:

* Validation of the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` CR when it is created or updated.
* Mutation of the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` CR by setting the default value for the `priority` and `deviceType` fields when the CR is created or updated.

The SR-IOV Network Operator Admission Controller webhook is enabled by the Operator when the `enableOperatorWebhook` is set to `true` in the `SriovOperatorConfig` CR. The `operator-webhook` pod runs as a daemon set on all control plane nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Use caution when disabling the SR-IOV Network Operator Admission Controller webhook. You can disable the webhook under specific circumstances, such as troubleshooting, or if you want to use unsupported devices. For information about configuring unsupported devices, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7010183[Configuring the SR-IOV Network Operator to use an unsupported NIC].

[id="about-custom-node-selectors_{context}"]
== About custom node selectors

The SR-IOV Network Config daemon discovers and configures the SR-IOV network devices on cluster nodes.
By default, it is deployed to all the `worker` nodes in the cluster.
You can use node labels to specify on which nodes the SR-IOV Network Config daemon runs.

[id="configuring-custom-nodeselector_{context}"]
== Configuring a custom NodeSelector for the SR-IOV Network Config daemon

The SR-IOV Network Config daemon discovers and configures the SR-IOV network devices on cluster nodes. By default, it is deployed to all the `worker` nodes in the cluster. You can use node labels to specify on which nodes the SR-IOV Network Config daemon runs.

To specify the nodes where the SR-IOV Network Config daemon is deployed, complete the following procedure.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
When you update the `configDaemonNodeSelector` field, the SR-IOV Network Config daemon is recreated on each selected node.
While the daemon is recreated, cluster users are unable to apply any new SR-IOV Network node policy or create new SR-IOV pods.
=====

.Procedure

- To update the node selector for the operator, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch sriovoperatorconfig default --type=json \
  -n openshift-sriov-network-operator \
  --patch '[{

[id="configure-sr-iov-operator-single-node_{context}"]
== Configuring the SR-IOV Network Operator for single node installations

By default, the SR-IOV Network Operator drains workloads from a node before every policy change.
The Operator performs this action to ensure that there no workloads using the virtual functions before the reconfiguration.

For installations on a single node, there are no other nodes to receive the workloads.
As a result, the Operator must be configured not to drain the workloads from the single node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After performing the following procedure to disable draining workloads, you must remove any workload that uses an SR-IOV network interface before you change any SR-IOV network node policy.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You must have installed the SR-IOV Network Operator.

.Procedure

- To set the `disableDrain` field to `true` and the `configDaemonNodeSelector` field to `node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""`, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch sriovoperatorconfig default --type=merge -n openshift-sriov-network-operator --patch '{ "spec": { "disableDrain": true, "configDaemonNodeSelector": { "node-role.kubernetes.io/master": "" } } }'
