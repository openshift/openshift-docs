= Configuring the SR-IOV Network Operator

[IMPORTANT]
====
Modifying the SR-IOV Network Operator configuration is not normally necessary.
The default configuration is recommended for most use cases.
Complete the steps to modify the relevant configuration only if the default behavior of the Operator is not compatible with your use case.
====

The SR-IOV Network Operator adds the `SriovOperatorConfig.sriovnetwork.openshift.io` CustomResourceDefinition resource.
The operator automatically creates a SriovOperatorConfig custom resource (CR) named `default` in the `openshift-sriov-network-operator` namespace.

[NOTE]
=====
The `default` CR contains the SR-IOV Network Operator configuration for your cluster.
To change the operator configuration, you must modify this CR.
=====

The SriovOperatorConfig CR provides several fields for configuring the operator:

* `enableInjector` allows project administrators to enable or disable the Network Resources Injector daemon set.
* `enableOperatorWebhook` allows project administrators to enable or disable the Operator Admission Controller webook daemon set.
* `configDaemonNodeSelector` allows project administrators to schedule the SR-IOV Network Config Daemon on selected nodes.

== About the Network Resources Injector

The Network Resources Injector is a Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller
application. It provides the following capabilities:

* Mutation of resource requests and limits in `Pod` specification to add an SR-IOV resource name according to an SR-IOV network attachment definition annotation.
* Mutation of `Pod` specifications with downward API volume to expose pod annotations and labels to the running container as files under the `/etc/podnetinfo` path.

By default the Network Resources Injector is enabled by the SR-IOV operator and runs as a daemon set on all master nodes. The following is an example of Network Resources Injector pods running in a cluster with three master nodes:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-sriov-network-operator

[id="about-sr-iov-operator-admission-control-webhook_{context}"]
== About the SR-IOV Operator admission controller webhook

The SR-IOV Operator Admission Controller webook is a Kubernetes Dynamic
Admission Controller application. It provides the following capabilities:

* Validation of the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` CR when it is created or updated.
* Mutation of the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` CR by setting the default value for the `priority` and `deviceType` fields when the CR is created or updated.

By default the SR-IOV Operator Admission Controller webook is enabled by the operator and runs as a daemon set on all master nodes.
The following is an example of the Operator Admission Controller webook pods running in a cluster with three master nodes:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-sriov-network-operator
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]

[id="about-custom-node-selectors_{context}"]
== About custom node selectors

The SR-IOV Network Config daemon discovers and configures the SR-IOV network devices on cluster nodes.
By default, it is deployed to all the `worker` nodes in the cluster.
You can use node labels to specify on which nodes the SR-IOV Network Config daemon runs.

[id="disable-enable-network-resource-injector_{context}"]
== Disabling or enabling the Network Resources Injector

To disable or enable the Network Resources Injector, which is enabled by default, complete the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You must have installed the SR-IOV Operator.

.Procedure

- Set the `enableInjector` field. Replace `<value>` with `false` to disable the feature or `true` to enable the feature.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch sriovoperatorconfig default \
  --type=merge -n openshift-sriov-network-operator \
  --patch '{ "spec": { "enableInjector": <value> } }'
----

[id="disable-enable-sr-iov-operator-admission-control-webhook_{context}"]
== Disabling or enabling the SR-IOV Operator admission controller webhook

To disable or enable the admission controller webhook, which is enabled by default, complete the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You must have installed the SR-IOV Operator.

.Procedure

- Set the `enableOperatorWebhook` field. Replace `<value>` with `false` to disable the feature or `true` to enable it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch sriovoperatorconfig default --type=merge \
  -n openshift-sriov-network-operator \
  --patch '{ "spec": { "enableOperatorWebhook": <value> } }'

[id="configuring-custom-nodeselector_{context}"]
== Configuring a custom NodeSelector for the SR-IOV Network Config daemon

The SR-IOV Network Config daemon discovers and configures the SR-IOV network devices on cluster nodes. By default, it is deployed to all the `worker` nodes in the cluster. You can use node labels to specify on which nodes the SR-IOV Network Config daemon runs.

To specify the nodes where the SR-IOV Network Config daemon is deployed, complete the following procedure.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
When you update the `configDaemonNodeSelector` field, the SR-IOV Network Config daemon is recreated on each selected node.
While the daemon is recreated, cluster users are unable to apply any new SR-IOV Network node policy or create new SR-IOV pods.
=====

.Procedure

- To update the node selector for the operator, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch sriovoperatorconfig default --type=json \
  -n openshift-sriov-network-operator \
  --patch '[{
      "op": "replace",
      "path": "/spec/configDaemonNodeSelector",
      "value": {<node-label>}
    }]'
----
+
Replace `<node-label>` with a label to apply as in the following example:
`"node-role.kubernetes.io/worker": ""`.
