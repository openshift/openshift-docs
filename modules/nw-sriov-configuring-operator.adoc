= Configuring the SR-IOV Network Operator

The SR-IOV Network Operator adds the `SriovOperatorConfig.sriovnetwork.openshift.io` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to {product-title}.
You can configure the SR-IOV software compoenents by modifying the default 
SriovOperatorConfig Custom Resource (CR).

[NOTE]
=====
There is one Custom Resource of SriovOperatorConfig being created when
the operator is up. Change the operator configuration by modifying this
pre-created Custom Resource. The `default` Custom Resource is created in
`openshift-sriov-network-operator` namespace.
=====

`SriovOperatorConfig` provides three options for configuring operator:
* `enableInjector` allows project administrators to enable or disable Network
Resources Injector DaemonSet.
* `enableOperatorWebhook` allows project adminstrators to enable or disable
Operator Admission Controller Webhook DaemonSet.
* `configDaemonNodeSelector` allows project adminstrators to schedule SR-IOV
Network Config Daemon on selected nodes.

== Disabling Network Resources Injector

The Network Resources Injector is a Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller 
application that:

* Mutates resource requests and limits in pod specifiction to add SR-IOV
resource name according to SR-IOV network attachment definition annotation.
* Mutates pod specifications with downward API volume to expose pod annotations
and labels to the running container as files under `/etc/podnetinfo`.

By default the Network Resources Injector will be enabled by SR-IOV operator
and runs as a Kubernetes DaemonSet on all master nodes. Below is an example
of Network Resources Injector pods running in a cluster with three master
nodes:

----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-sriov-network-operator
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
network-resources-injector-5cz5p          1/1     Running   0          10m
network-resources-injector-dwqpx          1/1     Running   0          10m
network-resources-injector-lktz5          1/1     Running   0          10m
----

Follow this procedure to disable it.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You must have installed the SR-IOV Operator.

.Procedure
. Update the default SriovOperatorConfig Custom Resource
+
----
$ oc patch sriovoperatorconfig default --patch '{ "spec": { "enableInjector": false}}' --type=merge -n openshift-sriov-network-operator
----

. To re-enable Network Resources Injector
+
----
$ oc patch sriovoperatorconfig default --patch '{ "spec": { "enableInjector": true}}' --type=merge -n openshift-sriov-network-operator

[id="disabling-sr-iov-operator-admission-control-webhook_{context}"]
== Disabling SR-IOV Operator admission controller webhook
The SRIOV Operator Admission Controller Webhook is a Kubernetes Dynamic
Admission Controller application that:

* Validating the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` Custom Resource when it being created
or updated.
* Mutating the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` Custom Resource by setting the default
value to `priority` and `deviceType` when it being created or updated.

By default the SR-IOV Operator Admission Controller Webhook will be enabled by
the operator and runs as a Kubernetes DaemonSet on all master nodes. Below is
an example of Operator Admission Controller Webhook pods running in a cluster
with three master nodes:

----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-sriov-network-operator
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
operator-webhook-9jkw6                    1/1     Running   0          16m
operator-webhook-kbr5p                    1/1     Running   0          16m
operator-webhook-rpfrl                    1/1     Running   0          16m
----

Follow this procedure to disable it.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You must have installed the SR-IOV Operator.

[id="configuring-custom-nodeselector_{context}"]
== Configuring Custom NodeSelector for SRIOV Network Config Daemon

The SR-IOV Network Config Daemon is in charge of discovering and configuring
SRIOV network devices on the nodes.

By default, it will be deployed to all the `worker` nodes in the cluster. You
can follow this procedure to select the nodes, where the SR-IOV Network Config
Daemon shall be deployed to, with node labels.

.Procedure
. Update the default SriovOperatorConfig Custom Resource
+
----
$ oc patch sriovoperatorconfig default --patch '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/configDaemonNodeSelector", "value": {<node-label>}}]' --type=json -n openshift-sriov-network-operator
----

[NOTE]
=====
Replace `<node-label>` with label to apply.
For example: `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""`.
=====

[NOTE]
=====
Updating of `configDaemonNodeSelector` will cause `SR-IOV Network Config Daemon`
be recreated on all the nodes that have `SR-IOV Network Config Daemon` deployed.
This will block user from applying new SR-IOV Network Node Policy and creating
new SR-IOV pods until `SR-IOV Network Config Daemon` is recreated on target nodes.
=====
