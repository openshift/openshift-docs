= Azure File cross-subscription support

Cross-subscription support allows you to have an {product-title} cluster in one Azure subscription and mount your Azure file share in another Azure subscription by using the Azure File Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Both the {product-title} cluster and the Azure File share (pre-provisioning or to be provisioned) should be inside the same tenant.
