= About low latency

Many of the deployed applications in the Telco space require low latency that can only tolerate zero packet loss. Tuning for zero packet loss helps mitigate the inherent issues that degrade network performance. For more information, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/tuning-zero-packet-loss-red-hat-openstack-platform-part-1[Tuning for Zero Packet Loss in {rh-openstack-first}].

The Edge computing initiative also comes in to play for reducing latency rates. Think of it as being on the edge of the cloud and closer to the user. This greatly reduces the distance between the user and distant data centers, resulting in reduced application response times and performance latency.

Administrators must be able to manage their many Edge sites and local services in a centralized way so that all of the deployments can run at the lowest possible management cost. They also need an easy way to deploy and configure certain nodes of their cluster for real-time low latency and high-performance purposes. Low latency nodes are useful for applications such as Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) and Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK).

{product-title} currently provides mechanisms to tune software on an {product-title} cluster for real-time running and low latency (around <20 microseconds reaction time). This includes tuning the kernel and {product-title} set values, installing a kernel, and reconfiguring the machine. But this method requires setting up four different Operators and performing many configurations that, when done manually, is complex and could be prone to mistakes.

{product-title} uses the Node Tuning Operator to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for {product-title} applications. The cluster administrator uses this performance profile configuration that makes it easier to make these changes in a more reliable way. The administrator can specify whether to update the kernel to kernel-rt, reserve CPUs for cluster and operating system housekeeping duties, including pod infra containers, and isolate CPUs for application containers to run the workloads.

{product-title} also supports workload hints for the Node Tuning Operator that can tune the `PerformanceProfile` to meet the demands of different industry environments. Workload hints are available for `highPowerConsumption` (very low latency at the cost of increased power consumption) and `realTime` (priority given to optimum latency). A combination of `true/false` settings for these hints can be used to deal with application-specific workload profiles and requirements.

Workload hints simplify the fine-tuning of performance to industry sector settings. Instead of a “one size fits all” approach, workload hints can cater to usage patterns such as placing priority on:

* Low latency
* Real-time capability
* Efficient use of power

Ideally, all of the previously listed items are prioritized. Some of these items come at the expense of others however. The Node Tuning Operator is now aware of the workload expectations and better able to meet the demands of the workload. The cluster admin can now specify into which use case that workload falls. The Node Tuning Operator uses the `PerformanceProfile` to fine tune the performance settings for the workload.

The environment in which an application is operating influences its behavior. For a typical data center with no strict latency requirements, only minimal default tuning is needed that enables CPU partitioning for some high performance workload pods. For data centers and workloads where latency is a higher priority, measures are still taken to optimize power consumption. The most complicated cases are clusters close to latency-sensitive equipment such as manufacturing machinery and software-defined radios. This last class of deployment is often referred to as Far edge. For Far edge deployments, ultra-low latency is the ultimate priority, and is achieved at the expense of power management.
