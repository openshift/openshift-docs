= Custom resource and verification status information

The preflight check provides information on the status of the custom resource (CR) and the status of the verification.

.Possible CR statuses

The possible CR statuses are as follows:
--
`True`:: The Special Resource Operator (SRO) CR will upgrade without kernel compatibility issues.
`False`:: There is an issue with kernel compatibility for the CR. The `Status Reason` field provides additional information on this.
`Error`:: The status check was not completed due to an internal error. The `Status Reason` field provides additional information on debugging this.
`Unknown`:: The check has not yet verified the status of the CR. This might be because the process has not yet reached the specific CR or not enough time has elapsed for the check to complete.
--

.Possible verification statuses

The possible verification statuses are as follows:

--
`True`:: The image exists and is compatible, or the image does not exist but there is a `BuildConfig` resource in place.
`False`:: The image does not exist and there is no `BuildConfig` resource in place, or an image exists but it is not compatible with the new kernel version.
+
If the verification status is `False`, you can take one of the following steps:
+
* Create a prebuilt image with the correct name and check the status field again.
* Change the CR to include a `BuildConfig` reosurce.
