= Using dual Intel E810 NIC hardware with PTP

{product-title} supports single and dual NIC Intel E810 hardware for precision PTP timing in grandmaster clocks (T-GM) and boundary clocks (T-BC).

Dual NIC grandmaster clock::
You can use a cluster host that has dual NIC hardware as PTP grandmaster clock.
One NIC receives timing information from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS).
The second NIC receives the timing information from the first using the SMA1 Tx/Rx connections on the E810 NIC faceplate.
The system clock on the cluster host is synchronized from the NIC that is connected to the GNSS satellite.
+
Dual NIC grandmaster clocks are a feature of distributed RAN (D-RAN) configurations where the Remote Radio Unit (RRU) and Baseband Unit (BBU) are located at the same radio cell site.
D-RAN distributes radio functions across multiple sites, with backhaul connections linking them to the core network.

[NOTE]
====
In a dual NIC T-GM configuration, a single `ts2phc` process reports as two `ts2phc` instances in the system.
====

Dual NIC boundary clock::
For 5G telco networks that deliver mid-band spectrum coverage, each virtual distributed unit (vDU) requires connections to 6 radio units (RUs). To make these connections, each vDU host requires 2 NICs configured as boundary clocks.
+
Dual NIC hardware allows you to connect each NIC to the same upstream leader clock with separate `ptp4l` instances for each NIC feeding the downstream clocks.
