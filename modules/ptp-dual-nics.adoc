= Using PTP with dual NIC hardware

{product-title} supports single and dual NIC hardware for precision PTP timing in the cluster.

For 5G telco networks that deliver mid-band spectrum coverage, each virtual distributed unit (vDU) requires connections to 6 radio units (RUs). To make these connections, each vDU host requires 2 NICs configured as boundary clocks.

Dual NIC hardware allows you to connect each NIC to the same upstream leader clock with separate `ptp4l` instances for each NIC feeding the downstream clocks.
