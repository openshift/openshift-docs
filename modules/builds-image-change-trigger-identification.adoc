= Image change trigger identification

As a developer, if you have configured image change triggers, you can identify which image change initiated the last build.

To accomplish this, you must identify elements in your build configuration's specification and status that are related to image change triggers.

This way, you can use the timestamp in `buildConfig.status.imageChangeTriggers` to identify the most recent build. Then you can use the name and namespace of the image stream that triggered this build to find the corresponding image change trigger in the `buildConfig.spec.triggers`.


== Image change trigger elements in the specification

In your build configuration specification, `buildConfig.spec.triggers` is an array of build trigger policies, `BuildTriggerPolicy`.

Each `BuildTriggerPolicy` has a `type` field and set of pointers fields, where each pointer field corresponds to one of the allowed values for the `type` field. As such, only one pointer field can be set for a given `BuildTriggerPolicy`.

So for image change triggers, the value of `type` is `ImageChange`.

Then, the `imageChange` field is the pointer to an `ImageChangeTrigger` object. So this will be set. It has the following fields:

* `lastTriggeredImageID`: This field is deprecated in {product-title} 4.8, but is still being set. It will be ignored in a future release. It contains the resolved image reference for the `ImageStreamTag` when the last build was triggered from this `BuildConfig`.
* `paused`: This field is used to temporarily disable this particular image change trigger.
* `from`: This field is used to reference the `ImageStreamTag` that drives this image change trigger. Its type is the core Kubernetes type, `OwnerReference`. The `from` field has the following fields of note:
  * `kind`: In this case, the only supported value is `ImageStreamTag`.
  * `namespace`: The namespace where the `ImageStreamTag` lives.
  * `name`: The name of the `ImageStreamTag`.

The following example shows the relative location of the elements mentioned in the preceding list and omits unrelated elements, such as `name`, `source`, and `strategy`.

.Example `BuildConfig.spec`
[source,yaml]
----
kind: BuildConfig
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
spec:
  triggers:
  - imageChange:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: <1>
        namespace: <2>
    type: ImageChange
----
<1> The name of an image stream, such as `input:latest`.
<2> A namespace, such as `my-namespace`.

== Image change trigger elements in the status

In your build configuration status, `buildConfig.status.imageChangeTriggers` is an array of `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` elements. Each `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` element includes the `from`, `lastTriggeredImageID`, and `lastTriggerTime` elements shown in the following example. This example omits elements that are not related to image change triggers.

.Example `BuildConfig.status`
[source,yaml]
----
kind: BuildConfig
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
status:
  imageChangeTriggers:
     - from:
          name: <1>
          namespace: <2>
       lastTriggeredImageID: <3>
       lastTriggerTime: <4>
----
<1> The name of an image stream, such as `input:latest`.
<2> A namespace, such as `my-namespace`.
<3> The SHA or ID of the `ImageStreamTag` when a build started. Its value is updated each time a build is started, even if this `ImageStreamTag` is not the reason the build started.
<4> The last time this particular `ImageStreamTag` triggered a build to start. Its value is only updated when this trigger specifically started a Build.

== Identification of image change triggers

The `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` that has the most recent `lastTriggerTime` triggered the most recent build. You can use its `name` and `namespace` to correlate it with the `ImageStreamTag` of one of the image change triggers you defined in the `buildConfig.spec.triggers`.
