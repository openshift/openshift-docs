= Deploying a {sno} cluster using the openshift-install program

You can use the `openshift-install` program to configure and deploy a host that you preinstalled with an image-based installation. To configure the target host with site-specific details, you must create the following resources:

* The `install-config.yaml` installation manifest
* The `image-based-config.yaml` manifest

The `openshift-install` program uses these resources to generate a configuration ISO that you attach to the preinstalled target host to complete the deployment.

[NOTE]
====
For more information about the specifications for the `image-based-config.yaml` manifest, see "Reference specifications for the image-based-config.yaml manifest".
====

.Prerequisites

* You preinstalled a host with {sno} using an image-based installation.
* You downloaded the latest version of the `openshift-install` program.
* You created a pull secret to authenticate pull requests. For more information, see "Using image pull secrets".

.Procedure

. Create a working directory by running the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir ibi-config-iso-workdir <1>
----
<1> Replace `ibi-config-iso-workdir` with the name of your working directory.

. Create the installation manifest:

.. Create a YAML file that defines the `install-config` manifest:
+
--
.Example `install-config.yaml` file

sshKey: 'ssh-rsa <your_ssh_pub_key>'
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your cluster deployment requires a proxy configuration, you must do the following:

* Create a seed image from a seed cluster featuring a proxy configuration. The proxy configurations do not have to match.
* Configure the machineNetwork field in your installation manifest.
====

.. Save the file in your working directory. 

. Optional. Create a configuration template in your working directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install image-based create config-template --dir ibi-config-iso-workdir/
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
INFO Config-Template created in: ibi-config-iso-workdir

The command creates the `image-based-config.yaml` configuration template in your working directory:

│   └── kubeconfig
└── imagebasedconfig.iso
----

. Attach the `imagebasedconfig.iso` to the preinstalled host using your preferred method and restart the host to complete the configuration process and deploy the cluster.

.Verification
When the configuration process completes on the host, access the cluster to verify its status.

. Export the `kubeconfig` environment variable to your kubeconfig file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=ibi-config-iso-workdir/auth/kubeconfig

. Verify that the cluster is responding by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
