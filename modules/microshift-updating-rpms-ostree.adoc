= Applying updates on an OSTree system

To update {product-title} on an `rpm-ostree` system such as {op-system-ostree-first}, embed the new version of {product-title} on a new operating system image. The steps you use depends on how your existing deployment is set up. The following procedure outlines the general steps you can take, with links to the {op-system-ostree} documentation. The {op-system-ostree} documentation is your resource for specific details on building an updated operating system image. Back up and system rollback are automatic with this update type.

[NOTE]
====
You can also use this workflow to update applications running in the {product-title} cluster. Ensure compatibility between the application and the adjacent versions of {product-title} and {op-system-ostree} before starting an update.
====

.Prerequisites

* The system requirements for installing {product-title} have been met.
* You have root user access to the host.
* The version of {product-title} you have is compatible with the {op-system-ostree} image you are preparing to use.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot downgrade {product-title} with this process. Downgrades are not supported.
====

.Procedure

. Create an Image Builder configuration file for adding the `{rpm-repo-version}` RPM repository source required to pull {product-title} RPMs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cat > {rpm-repo-version}.toml <<EOF
id = "{rpm-repo-version}"
name = "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform {ocp-version} for RHEL {op-system-version-major}"
type = "yum-baseurl"
url = "https://cdn.redhat.com/content/dist/layered/{rhel-major}/$(uname -m)/rhocp/{ocp-version}/os"
check_gpg = true
check_ssl = true
system = false
rhsm = true
EOF
----

. Add the update RPM source to the Image Builder by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ sudo composer-cli sources add {rpm-repo-version}.toml
----

. Build a new image of {op-system-ostree} that contains the new version of {product-title}. To determine the steps required, use the following documentation:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/composing_installing_and_managing_rhel_for_edge_images/managing-rhel-for-edge-images_composing-installing-managing-rhel-for-edge-images#proc_building-a-commit-update_managing-rhel-for-edge-images[Building a RHEL for Edge commit update]

. Update the host to use the new image of {op-system-ostree}. To determine the steps required, use the following documentation:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/composing_installing_and_managing_rhel_for_edge_images/managing-rhel-for-edge-images_composing-installing-managing-rhel-for-edge-images#how-are-rhel-for-edge-image-updates-deployed_managing-rhel-for-edge-images[Deploying RHEL for Edge image updates]

. Reboot the host to apply updates by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl reboot
