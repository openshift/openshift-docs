= SELinux File Context Relabeling

When a pod is created and requires a volume to be mounted, the CRI-O container runtime is instructed by the node's kubelet process upon pod creation to relabel the entire volume with proper SELinux contexts.

There are three methods for skipping the SELinux relabeling for a volume:

* Skip SELinux Relabeling using the `spc_t` SELinux context
* Automating SELinux Relabeling using the Cluster Resource Override Operator
* Skip SELinux Relabeling with a custom `RuntimeClass`

By default, volume SELinux context relabeling happens for every volume on container startup and can cause significant delays when the volume has many files and directories as the procedure has to occur asynchronously, recursively through the entire volume. However, if a pod is configured to have the SELinux `spc_t` type, or is configured to have `io.kubernetes.cri-o.TrySkipVolumeSELinuxLabel` and the volume is already correctly labeled, then the relabel process will be skipped.
