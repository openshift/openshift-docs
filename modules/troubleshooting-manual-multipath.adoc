[id="manual-multipath_{context}"]
= Manually add World Wide Identifiers (WWIDs) for enabling multipathing on {op-system}

[role="_abstract"]
Placeholder text.

If a node requires an update or a reboot, you must have two viable paths to the boot device present. In situations where the number of paths drops to a single path, you can workaround this by manually adding the necessary WWIDs when you access the boot menu.

.Procedure

. Add `rd.multipath=default` to the kernel command line.

. Find the WWIDs of the target multipath devices:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# multipath -ll
----

. Manually add the resulting WWIDs to `/etc/multipath/wwids`. You can view the file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# cat `/etc/multipath/wwids`
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
# Multipath wwids, Version: 1.0
# NOTE: This file is automatically maintained by multipath and multipathd,
# You should not need to edit this file in normal circumstances.
#
# Valid WWIDs:
