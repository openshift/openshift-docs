= Using the CLI to create a virtual machine

.Procedure

The `spec` object of the virtual machine configuration file references
the virtual machine settings, such as the number of cores and the amount
of memory, the disk type, and the volumes to use.

. Attach the virtual machine disk to the virtual machine by referencing
the relevant PVC `claimName` as a volume.

. To create a virtual machine with the {product-title} client, run this command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <vm.yaml>
----

. Since virtual machines are created in a *Stopped* state, run a virtual machine
instance by starting it.
