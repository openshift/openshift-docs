= Creating DNS records on an public managed zone for GCP by using Red Hat External DNS Operator

You can create DNS records on a public managed zone for GCP by using Red Hat External DNS Operator.

.Procedure

. Check the user. The user must have access to the `kube-system` namespace. If you don’t have the credentials, as you can fetch the credentials from the `kube-system` namespace to use the cloud provider client:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc whoami
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
system:admin
----

. Copy the value of service_account.json in gcp-credentials secret in a file encoded-gcloud.json by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secret gcp-credentials -n kube-system --template='{{$v := index .data "service_account.json"}}{{$v}}' | base64 -d - > decoded-gcloud.json
----

. Export Google credentials:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=decoded-gcloud.json
----

. Activate your account by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ gcloud auth activate-service-account  <client_email as per decoded-gcloud.json> --key-file=decoded-gcloud.json
----

. Set your project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ gcloud config set project <project_id as per decoded-gcloud.json>
----

. Get the routes to check the domain:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get routes --all-namespaces | grep console
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
openshift-console          console             console-openshift-console.apps.test.gcp.example.com                       console             https   reencrypt/Redirect     None
openshift-console          downloads           downloads-openshift-console.apps.test.gcp.example.com                     downloads           http    edge/Redirect          None
----

. Get the list of managed zones to find the zone which corresponds to the previously found route’s domain:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ gcloud dns managed-zones list | grep test.gcp.example.com
qe-cvs4g-private-zone test.gcp.example.com
----

. Create `ExternalDNS` resource for `route` source:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: externaldns.olm.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalDNS
metadata:
  name: sample-gcp <1>
spec:
  domains:
    - filterType: Include <2>
      matchType: Exact <3>
      name: test.gcp.example.com <4>
  provider:
    type: GCP <5>
  source:
    openshiftRouteOptions: <6>
      routerName: default <7>
    type: OpenShiftRoute <8>
EOF
----
<1> Specifies the name of External DNS CR.
<2> By default all hosted zones are selected as potential targets. You can include a hosted zone that you need.
<3> The matching of the target zone's domain has to be exact (as opposed to regular expression match).
<4> Specify the exact domain of the zone you want to update. The hostname of the routes must be subdomains of the specified domain.
<5> Defines Google Cloud DNS provider.
<6> You can define options for the source of DNS records.
<7> If the source is `OpenShiftRoute` then you can pass the OpenShift Ingress Controller name. External DNS selects the canonical hostname of that router as the target while creating CNAME record.
<8> Defines OpenShift `route` resource as the source for the DNS records which gets created in the previously specified DNS provider.

. Check the records created for OCP routes using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ gcloud dns record-sets list --zone=qe-cvs4g-private-zone | grep console
