= Creating DNS records on a public managed zone for GCP

You can create DNS records on a public managed zone for GCP by using the External DNS Operator.

.Prerequisites

* You must have administrator privileges.

.Procedure

. Copy the `gcp-credentials` secret in the `encoded-gcloud.json` file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secret gcp-credentials -n kube-system --template='{{$v := index .data "service_account.json"}}{{$v}}' | base64 -d - > decoded-gcloud.json
----

. Export your Google credentials by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=decoded-gcloud.json
----

. Activate your account by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ gcloud auth activate-service-account  <client_email as per decoded-gcloud.json> --key-file=decoded-gcloud.json
----

. Set your project by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ gcloud config set project <project_id as per decoded-gcloud.json>
----

. Get a list of routes by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get routes --all-namespaces | grep console
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
openshift-console          console             console-openshift-console.apps.test.gcp.example.com                       console             https   reencrypt/Redirect     None
openshift-console          downloads           downloads-openshift-console.apps.test.gcp.example.com                     downloads           http    edge/Redirect          None
----

. Get a list of managed zones by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ gcloud dns managed-zones list | grep test.gcp.example.com
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
qe-cvs4g-private-zone test.gcp.example.com
----

. Create a YAML file, for example, `external-dns-sample-gcp.yaml`, that defines the `ExternalDNS` object:
+
.Example `external-dns-sample-gcp.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: externaldns.olm.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalDNS
metadata:
  name: sample-gcp <1>
spec:
  domains:
    - filterType: Include <2>
      matchType: Exact <3>
      name: test.gcp.example.com <4>
  provider:
    type: GCP <5>
  source:
    openshiftRouteOptions: <6>
      routerName: default <7>
    type: OpenShiftRoute <8>
----
<1> Specifies the External DNS name.
<2> By default, all hosted zones are selected as potential targets. You can include your hosted zone.
<3> The domain of the target must match the string defined by the `name` key.
<4> Specify the exact domain of the zone you want to update. The hostname of the routes must be subdomains of the specified domain.
<5> Defines the provider type.
<6> You can define options for the source of DNS records.
<7> If the source type is `OpenShiftRoute`, you can pass the OpenShift Ingress Controller name. External DNS selects the canonical hostname of that router as the target while creating CNAME record.
<8> Defines the `route` resource as the source for GCP DNS records.

. Check the DNS records created for {product-title} routes by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ gcloud dns record-sets list --zone=qe-cvs4g-private-zone | grep console
