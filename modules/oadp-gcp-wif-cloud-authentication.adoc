= Google workload identity federation cloud authentication

Applications running outside Google Cloud use service account keys, such as usernames and passwords, to gain access to Google Cloud resources. These service account keys might become a security risk if they are not properly managed.

With Google's workload identity federation, you can use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to offer IAM roles, including the ability to impersonate service accounts, to external identities. This eliminates the maintenance and security risks associated with service account keys.

Workload identity federation handles encrypting and decrypting certificates, extracting user attributes, and validation. Identity federation externalizes authentication, passing it over to Security Token Services (STS), and reduces the demands on individual developers. Authorization and controlling access to resources remain the responsibility of the application.

[NOTE]
====
Google workload identity federation is available for OADP 1.3.x and later.
====

[NOTE]
====
For backing up volumes, OADP on GCP with Google workload identity federation authentication supports only CSI snapshots.
====

If you do not use Google workload identity federation cloud authentication, continue to _Installing the Data Protection Application_.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed a cluster in manual mode with link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.html#installing-gcp-with-short-term-creds_installing-gcp-customizations[GCP Workload Identity configured].
* You have access to the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) and to the associated workload identity pool.

.Procedure

. Create an `oadp-credrequest` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir -p oadp-credrequest
----
. Create a `CredentialsRequest.yaml` file as following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
echo 'apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: oadp-operator-credentials
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: GCPProviderSpec
    permissions:
    - compute.disks.get
    - compute.disks.create
    - compute.disks.createSnapshot
    - compute.snapshots.get
    - compute.snapshots.create
    - compute.snapshots.useReadOnly
    - compute.snapshots.delete
    - compute.zones.get
    - storage.objects.create
    - storage.objects.delete
    - storage.objects.get
    - storage.objects.list
    - iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob
    skipServiceCheck: true
  secretRef:
    name: cloud-credentials-gcp
    namespace: <OPERATOR_INSTALL_NS>
  serviceAccountNames:
  - velero
' > oadp-credrequest/credrequest.yaml
----
. Use the `ccoctl` utility to process the `CredentialsRequest` objects in the `oadp-credrequest` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl gcp create-service-accounts \
    --name=<name> \
    --project=<gcp_project_id> \
    --credentials-requests-dir=oadp-credrequest \
    --workload-identity-pool=<pool_id> \
    --workload-identity-provider=<provider_id>
----
The `manifests/openshift-adp-cloud-credentials-gcp-credentials.yaml` file is now available to use in the following steps.
. Create a namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create namespace <OPERATOR_INSTALL_NS>
----
. Apply the credentials to the namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f manifests/openshift-adp-cloud-credentials-gcp-credentials.yaml
----
