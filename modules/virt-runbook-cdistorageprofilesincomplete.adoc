[id="meaning-cdistorageprofilesincomplete"]
== Meaning

This alert fires when a Containerized Data Importer (CDI) storage profile is
incomplete.

If a storage profile is incomplete, the CDI cannot infer persistent volume claim
(PVC) fields, such as `volumeMode` and  `accessModes`, which are required to
create a virtual machine (VM) disk.
