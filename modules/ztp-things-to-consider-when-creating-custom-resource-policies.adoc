= Considerations when creating custom resource policies

* The custom resources used to create the ACM policies should be defined with consideration of possible overlay to its metadata and spec/data. For example, if the custom resource `metadata.name` does not change between clusters then you should set the `metadata.name` value in the custom resource file. If the custom resource will have multiple instances in the same cluster, then the custom resource `metadata.name` must be defined in the policy template file.

* In order to apply the node selector for a specific machine config pool, you have to set the node selector value as `$mcp` in order to let the policy generator overlay the `$mcp` value with the defined mcp in the policy template.

* Subscription source files do not change.
