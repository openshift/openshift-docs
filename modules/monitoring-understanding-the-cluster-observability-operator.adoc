= Understanding the Cluster Observability Operator

A default monitoring stack created by the Cluster Observability Operator (COO) includes a highly available Prometheus instance capable of sending metrics to an external endpoint by using remote write.

Each COO stack also includes an optional Thanos Querier component, which you can use to query a highly available Prometheus instance from a central location, and an optional Alertmanager component, which you can use to set up alert configurations for different services.

== Advantages of using Cluster Observability Operator

The `MonitoringStack` CRD used by the COO offers an opinionated default monitoring configuration for COO-deployed monitoring components, but you can customize it to suit more complex requirements.

Deploying a COO-managed monitoring stack can help meet monitoring needs that are difficult or impossible to address by using the core platform monitoring stack deployed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO).
A monitoring stack deployed using COO has the following advantages over core platform and user workload monitoring:

Extendability:: Users can add more metrics to a COO-deployed monitoring stack, which is not possible with core platform monitoring without losing support.
In addition, COO-managed stacks can receive certain cluster-specific metrics from core platform monitoring by using federation.
Multi-tenancy support:: The COO can create a monitoring stack per user namespace.
You can also deploy multiple stacks per namespace or a single stack for multiple namespaces.
For example, cluster administrators, SRE teams, and development teams can all deploy their own monitoring stacks on a single cluster, rather than having to use a single shared stack of monitoring components.
Users on different teams can then independently configure features such as separate alerts, alert routing, and alert receivers for their applications and services.
Scalability:: You can create COO-managed monitoring stacks as needed.
Multiple monitoring stacks can run on a single cluster, which can facilitate the monitoring of very large clusters by using manual sharding. This ability addresses cases where the number of metrics exceeds the monitoring capabilities of a single Prometheus instance.
Flexibility:: Deploying the COO with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) decouples COO releases from {product-title} release cycles.
This method of deployment enables faster release iterations and the ability to respond rapidly to changing requirements and issues.
Additionally, by deploying a COO-managed monitoring stack, users can manage alerting rules independently of {product-title} release cycles.
Highly customizable:: The COO can delegate ownership of single configurable fields in custom resources to users by using Server-Side Apply (SSA), which enhances customization.
