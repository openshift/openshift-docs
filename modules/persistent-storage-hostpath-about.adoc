= Overview

{product-title} supports hostPath mounting for development and testing on a single-node cluster.

In a production cluster, you would not use hostPath. Instead, a cluster administrator would provision a network resource, such as a GCE Persistent Disk volume, an NFS share, or an Amazon EBS volume. Network resources support the use of StorageClasses to set up dynamic provisioning.

A hostPath volume must be provisioned statically.
