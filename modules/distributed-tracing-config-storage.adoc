= Jaeger storage configuration options

You configure storage for the Collector, Ingester, and Query services under `spec.storage`. Multiple instances of each of these components can be provisioned as required for performance and resilience purposes.

[id="distributed-tracing-config-auto-provisioning-es_{context}"]
== Auto-provisioning an Elasticsearch instance

When the `storage:type` is set to `elasticsearch` but there is no value set for `spec:storage:options:es:server-urls`, the Jaeger Operator uses the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to create an Elasticsearch cluster based on the configuration provided in the `storage` section of the custom resource file.

.Restrictions

* You can have only one Jaeger with self-provisioned Elasticsearch instance per namespace. The Elasticsearch cluster is meant to be dedicated for a single Jaeger instance.
* There can be only one Elasticsearch per namespace.

[NOTE]
====
If you already have installed Elasticsearch as part of OpenShift Logging, the Jaeger Operator can use the installed OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to provision storage.
====

The following configuration parameters are for a _self-provisioned_ Elasticsearch instance, that is an instance created by the Jaeger Operator using the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. You specify configuration options for self-provisioned Elasticsearch under `spec:storage:elasticsearch`  in your configuration file.

.Elasticsearch resource configuration parameters
[options="header"]
[cols="l, a, a, a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Values |Default value
|elasticsearch:
  nodeCount:
|Number of Elasticsearch nodes. For high availability use at least 3 nodes. Do not use 2 nodes as “split brain” problem can happen.
|Integer value. For example, Proof of concept = 1,
Minimum deployment =3
|3

|elasticsearch:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu:
|Number of central processing units for requests, based on your environment's configuration.
|Specified in cores or millicores (for example, 200m, 0.5, 1). For example, Proof of concept = 500m,
Minimum deployment =1
|1

|elasticsearch:
  resources:
    requests:
      memory:
|Available memory for requests, based on your environment's configuration.
|Specified in bytes (for example, 200Ki, 50Mi, 5Gi). For example, Proof of concept = 1Gi,
Minimum deployment = 16Gi*
|16Gi

|elasticsearch:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu:
|Limit on number of central processing units, based on your environment's configuration.
|Specified in cores or millicores (for example, 200m, 0.5, 1). For example, Proof of concept = 500m,
Minimum deployment =1
|

|elasticsearch:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory:
|Available memory limit based on your environment's configuration.
|Specified in bytes (for example, 200Ki, 50Mi, 5Gi). For example, Proof of concept = 1Gi,
Minimum deployment = 16Gi*
|

|elasticsearch:
  redundancyPolicy:
|Data replication policy defines how Elasticsearch shards are replicated across data nodes in the cluster. If not specified, the Jaeger Operator automatically determines the most appropriate replication based on number of nodes.
|`ZeroRedundancy`(no replica shards), `SingleRedundancy`(one replica shard), `MultipleRedundancy`(each index is spread over half of the Data nodes), `FullRedundancy` (each index is fully replicated on every Data node in the cluster).
|

|
3+|*Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting though this is NOT recommended for production deployments. For production use, you should have no less than 16Gi allocated to each pod by default, but preferably allocate as much as you can, up to 64Gi per pod.

.Production storage example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: simple-prod
spec:
  strategy: production
  storage:
    type: elasticsearch

      nodeCount: 3
      resources:
        requests:

.Storage example with persistent storage:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: simple-prod
spec:
  strategy: production
  storage:
    type: elasticsearch
    elasticsearch:
      nodeCount: 1
      storage: # <1>
        storageClassName: gp2
        size: 5Gi
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 4Gi
        limits:
          memory: 4Gi
      redundancyPolicy: ZeroRedundancy
----

<1> Persistent storage configuration. In this case AWS `gp2` with `5Gi` size. When no value is specified, Jaeger uses `emptyDir`. The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator provisions `PersistentVolumeClaim` and `PersistentVolume` which are not removed with Jaeger instance. You can mount the same volumes if you create a Jaeger instance with the same name and namespace.


[id="distributed-tracing-config-external-es_{context}"]
== Connecting to an existing Elasticsearch instance

You can use an existing Elasticsearch cluster for storage with Jaeger, that is, an instance that was not auto-provisioned by the Jaeger Operator. You do this by specifying the URL of the existing cluster as the `spec:storage:options:es:server-urls` value in your configuration.

.Restrictions

* You cannot share or reuse a {ProductName} logging Elasticsearch instance with Jaeger. The Elasticsearch cluster is meant to be dedicated for a single Jaeger instance.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not provide support for your external Elasticsearch instance. You can review the tested integrations matrix on the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5381021[Customer Portal].
====

The following configuration parameters are for an already existing Elasticsearch instance, also known as an _external_  Elasticsearch instance. In this case, you specify configuration options for Elasticsearch under `spec:storage:options:es` in your custom resource file.
