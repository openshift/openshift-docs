= Source-to-image strategy

When using a `Source` strategy, all defined input secrets are copied to their
respective `destinationDir`. If you left `destinationDir` empty, then the
secrets are placed in the working directory of the builder image.

The same rule is used when a `destinationDir` is a relative path; the secrets
are placed in the paths that are relative to the image's working directory.
The final directory in the `destinationDir` path is created if it does not exist in the builder image.
All preceding directories in the `destinationDir` must exist, or an error will occur.

[NOTE]
====
Input secrets are added as world-writable (have `0666` permissions) and will
be truncated to size zero after executing the *_assemble_* script. This means
that the secret files will exist in the resulting image, but they will be empty
for security reasons.

Input ConfigMaps are not truncated after the *_assemble_* script completes.
