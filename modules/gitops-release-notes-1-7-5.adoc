== Fixed issues

The following issues have been resolved in the current release:

* Before this update, there was a mismatch in the RSA key for known hosts in the `argocd-ssh-known-hosts-cm` config map. This update fixes the issue by matching the RSA key with the upstream project. Now, you can use the default RSA keys on default deployments. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-3239[GITOPS-3239]

* Before this update, an old Redis image version was used when deploying the {gitops-title} Operator, which resulted in vulnerabilities. This update fixes the vulnerabilities on Redis by upgrading it to the latest version of the `registry.redhat.io/rhel-8/redis-6` image. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-3240[GITOPS-3240]
