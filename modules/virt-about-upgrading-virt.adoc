= About updating {VirtProductName}

* Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) manages the lifecycle of the {VirtProductName} Operator. The Marketplace Operator, which is deployed during {product-title} installation, makes external Operators available to your cluster.

* OLM provides z-stream and minor version updates for {VirtProductName}. Minor version updates become available when you update {product-title} to the next minor version. You cannot update {VirtProductName} to the next minor version without first updating {product-title}.

* {VirtProductName} subscriptions use a single update channel that is named *stable*. The *stable* channel ensures that your {VirtProductName} and {product-title} versions are compatible.

* If your subscription's approval strategy is set to *Automatic*, the update process starts as soon as a new version of the Operator is available in the *stable* channel. It is highly recommended to use the *Automatic* approval strategy to maintain a supportable environment. Each minor version of {VirtProductName} is only supported if you run the corresponding {product-title} version. For example, you must run {VirtProductName} {VirtVersion} on {product-title} {VirtVersion}.

** Though it is possible to select the *Manual* approval strategy, this is not recommended because it risks the supportability and functionality of your cluster. With the *Manual* approval strategy, you must manually approve every pending update. If {product-title} and {VirtProductName} updates are out of sync, your cluster becomes unsupported.

* The amount of time an update takes to complete depends on your network
connection. Most automatic updates complete within fifteen minutes.

* Updating {VirtProductName} does not interrupt network connections.

* Data volumes and their associated persistent volume claims are preserved during update.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have virtual machines running that use hostpath provisioner storage, they cannot be live migrated and might block an {product-title} cluster update.

As a workaround, you can reconfigure the virtual machines so that they can be powered off automatically during a cluster update. Remove the `evictionStrategy: LiveMigrate` field and set the `runStrategy` field to `Always`.
