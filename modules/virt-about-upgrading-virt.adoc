= About upgrading {VirtProductName}

== How {VirtProductName} upgrades work

* You can upgrade to the next minor version of {VirtProductName} by using the
{product-title} web console to change the channel of your Operator subscription.

* You can enable automatic _z-stream_ updates during {VirtProductName} installation.

* Updates are delivered via the _Marketplace Operator_, which is deployed
during {product-title} installation. The Marketplace Operator makes
external Operators available to your cluster.

* The amount of time an update takes to complete depends on your network
connection. Most automatic updates complete within fifteen minutes.

== How {VirtProductName} upgrades affect your cluster

* Upgrading does not interrupt virtual machine workloads.
** Virtual machine pods are not restarted or migrated during an upgrade. If you
need to update the `virt-launcher` pod, you must restart or live migrate the
virtual machine.
+
[NOTE]
====
Each virtual machine has a `virt-launcher` pod that runs the virtual machine
instance. The `virt-launcher` pod runs an instance of `libvirt`, which is
used to manage the virtual machine process.
====

* Upgrading does not interrupt network connections.

* Data volumes and their associated persistent volume claims are preserved during
upgrade.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have virtual machines running that cannot be live migrated, they might block an {product-title} cluster upgrade.
This includes virtual machines that use hostpath provisioner storage or SR-IOV network interfaces.

As a workaround, you can reconfigure the virtual machines so that they can be powered off automatically during a cluster upgrade. Remove the `evictionStrategy: LiveMigrate` field and
set the `runStrategy` field to `Always`.
