= Configuring control plane nodes as schedulable

You can configure control plane nodes to be
schedulable, meaning that new pods are allowed for placement on the master
nodes. By default, control plane nodes are not schedulable.

You can set the masters to be schedulable, but must retain the worker nodes.

[NOTE]
====
You can deploy {product-title} with no worker nodes on a bare metal cluster.
In this case, the control plane nodes are marked schedulable by default.
====

You can allow or disallow control plane nodes to be schedulable by configuring the `mastersSchedulable` field.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you configure control plane nodes from the default unschedulable to schedulable, additional subscriptions are required. This is because control plane nodes then become worker nodes.
