= Configuring master nodes as schedulable

You can configure master nodes to be
schedulable, meaning that new pods are allowed for placement on the master
nodes. By default, master nodes are not schedulable. 

You can set the masters to be schedulable, but must retain the worker nodes.

[NOTE]
====
You can deploy {product-title} with no worker nodes on a bare metal cluster. 
In this case, the master nodes are marked schedulable by default.
====

You can allow or disallow master nodes to be schedulable by configuring the
`mastersSchedulable` field.
