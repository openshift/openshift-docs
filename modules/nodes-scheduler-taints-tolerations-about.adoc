= Understanding taints and tolerations

A _taint_ allows a node to refuse a pod to be scheduled unless that pod has a matching _toleration_.

You apply taints to a node through the `Node` specification (`NodeSpec`) and apply tolerations to a pod through the `Pod` specification (`PodSpec`). When you apply a taint a node, the scheduler cannot place a pod on that node unless the pod can tolerate the taint.

|Parameter |Description

|`key`
|The `key` is any string, up to 253 characters. The key must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.

|`value`
| The `value` is any string, up to 63 characters. The value must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.

|`effect`

|The effect is one of the following:

!====
!`NoSchedule` ^[1]^
!* New pods that do not match the taint are not scheduled onto that node.
* Existing pods on the node remain.
!`PreferNoSchedule`
!* New pods that do not match the taint might be scheduled onto that node, but the scheduler tries not to.
* Existing pods on the node remain.
!`NoExecute`

!====
!`Equal`
!The `key`/`value`/`effect` parameters must match. This is the default.

1. If you add a `NoSchedule` taint to a control plane node (also known as the master node) the node must have the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=:NoSchedule` taint, which is added by default.

A toleration matches a taint:

* If the `operator` parameter is set to `Equal`:
** the `key` parameters are the same;
** the `value` parameters are the same;
** the `effect` parameters are the same.

* If the `operator` parameter is set to `Exists`:
** the `key` parameters are the same;
** the `effect` parameters are the same.

The following taints are built into {product-title}:

* `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready`: The node is not ready. This corresponds to the node condition `Ready=False`.
* `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable`: The node is unreachable from the node controller. This corresponds to the node condition `Ready=Unknown`.
* `node.kubernetes.io/out-of-disk`: The node has insufficient free space on the node for adding new pods. This corresponds to the node condition `OutOfDisk=True`.
* `node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure`: The node has memory pressure issues. This corresponds to the node condition `MemoryPressure=True`.
* `node.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure`: The node has disk pressure issues. This corresponds to the node condition `DiskPressure=True`.
* `node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable`: The node network is unavailable.
* `node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable`: The node is unschedulable.
* `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized`: When the node controller is started with an external cloud provider, this taint is set on a node to mark it as unusable. After a controller from the cloud-controller-manager initializes this node, the kubelet removes this taint.


[id="nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations-about-seconds_{context}"]
== Understanding how to use toleration seconds to delay pod evictions

You can specify how long a pod can remain bound to a node before being evicted by specifying the `tolerationSeconds` parameter in the `Pod` specification or `MachineSet` object. If a taint with the `NoExecute` effect is added to a node, a pod that does tolerate the taint, which has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the pod is not evicted until that time period expires.

.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
....
  template:
....
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key1"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "value1"
        effect: "NoExecute"
        tolerationSeconds: 3600
----

Here, if this pod is running but does not have a matching toleration, the pod stays bound to the node for 3,600 seconds and then be evicted. If the taint is removed before that time, the pod is not evicted.

[id="nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations-about-multiple_{context}"]
== Understanding how to use multiple taints

You can put multiple taints on the same node and multiple tolerations on the same pod. {product-title} processes multiple taints and tolerations as follows:

. Process the taints for which the pod has a matching toleration.
. The remaining unmatched taints have the indicated effects on the pod:
+
* If there is at least one unmatched taint with effect `NoSchedule`, {product-title} cannot schedule a pod onto that node.
* If there is no unmatched taint with effect `NoSchedule` but there is at least one unmatched taint with effect `PreferNoSchedule`, {product-title} tries to not schedule the pod onto the node.
* If there is at least one unmatched taint with effect `NoExecute`, {product-title} evicts the pod from the node if it is already running on the node, or the pod is not scheduled onto the node if it is not yet running on the node.
+
** Pods that do not tolerate the taint are evicted immediately.
+
** Pods that tolerate the taint without specifying `tolerationSeconds` in their `Pod` specification remain bound forever.
+
** Pods that tolerate the taint with a specified `tolerationSeconds` remain bound for the specified amount of time.

For example:

* Add the following taints to the node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoExecute
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key2=value2:NoSchedule
----

* The pod has the following tolerations:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
....
  template:
....
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key1"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "value1"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
      - key: "key1"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "value1"
        effect: "NoExecute"
----

In this case, the pod cannot be scheduled onto the node, because there is no toleration matching the third taint. The pod continues running if it is already running on the node when the taint is added, because the third taint is the only
one of the three that is not tolerated by the pod.

[id="nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations-about-taintNodesByCondition_{context}"]
== Understanding pod scheduling and node conditions (taint node by condition)

The Taint Nodes By Condition feature, which is enabled by default, automatically taints nodes that report conditions such as memory pressure and disk pressure. If a node reports a condition, a taint is added until the condition clears. The taints have the `NoSchedule` effect, which means no pod can be scheduled on the node unless the pod has a matching toleration.

The scheduler checks for these taints on nodes before scheduling pods. If the taint is present, the pod is scheduled on a different node. Because the scheduler checks for taints and not the actual node conditions, you configure the scheduler to ignore some of these node conditions by adding appropriate pod tolerations.

To ensure backward compatibility, the daemon set controller automatically adds the following tolerations to all daemons:

* node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure
* node.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure
* node.kubernetes.io/out-of-disk (only for critical pods)
* node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable (1.10 or later)
* node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable (host network only)

You can also add arbitrary tolerations to daemon sets.

[id="nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations-about-taintBasedEvictions_{context}"]
== Understanding evicting pods by condition (taint-based evictions)

The Taint-Based Evictions feature, which is enabled by default, evicts pods from a node that experiences specific conditions, such as `not-ready` and `unreachable`.
When a node experiences one of these conditions, {product-title} automatically adds taints to the node, and starts evicting and rescheduling the pods on different nodes.

Taint Based Evictions have a `NoExecute` effect, where any pod that does not tolerate the taint is evicted immediately and any pod that does tolerate the taint will never be evicted, unless the pod uses the `tolerationSeconds` parameter.

The `tolerationSeconds` parameter allows you to specify how long a pod stays bound to a node that has a node condition. If the condition still exists after the `tolerationSeconds` period, the taint remains on the node and the pods with a matching toleration are evicted. If the condition clears before the `tolerationSeconds` period, pods with matching tolerations are not removed.

If you use the `tolerationSeconds` parameter with no value, pods are never evicted because of the not ready and unreachable node conditions.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} evicts pods in a rate-limited way to prevent massive pod evictions in scenarios such as the master becoming partitioned from the nodes.

By default, if more than 55% of nodes in a given zone are unhealthy, the node lifecycle controller changes that zone's state to `PartialDisruption` and the rate of pod evictions is reduced. For small clusters (by default, 50 nodes or less) in this state, nodes in this zone are not tainted and evictions are stopped.

For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#rate-limits-on-eviction[Rate limits on eviction] in the Kubernetes documentation.
====

{product-title} automatically adds a toleration for `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` and `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` with `tolerationSeconds=300`, unless the `Pod` configuration specifies either toleration.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
....
  template:
....
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready
        operator: Exists
        effect: NoExecute
        tolerationSeconds: 300 <1>
      - key: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable
        operator: Exists
        effect: NoExecute
        tolerationSeconds: 300
----

<1> These tolerations ensure that the default pod behavior is to remain bound for five minutes after one of these node conditions problems is detected.

You can configure these tolerations as needed. For example, if you have an application with a lot of local state, you might want to keep the pods bound to node for a longer time in the event of network partition, allowing for the partition to recover and avoiding pod eviction.

Pods spawned by a daemon set are created with `NoExecute` tolerations for the following taints with no `tolerationSeconds`:

* `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable`
* `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready`

As a result, daemon set pods are never evicted because of these node conditions.

[id="nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations-all_{context}"]
== Tolerating all taints

You can configure a pod to tolerate all taints by adding an `operator: "Exists"` toleration with no `key` and `value` parameters.
Pods with this toleration are not removed from a node that has taints.
