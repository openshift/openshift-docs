= Using a Proxy

If your Git repository can only be accessed using a proxy, you can define the
proxy to use in the `source` section of the `BuildConfig`. You can configure
both a HTTP and HTTPS proxy to use. Both fields are optional. Domains for which
no proxying should be performed can also be specified in the *NoProxy* field.

[NOTE]
====
Your source URI must use the HTTP or HTTPS protocol for this to work.

[source,yaml]
----
source:
  git:
    uri: "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
    httpProxy: http://proxy.example.com
    httpsProxy: https://proxy.example.com
    noProxy: somedomain.com, otherdomain.com

Cluster administrators can also configure a global proxy for Git cloning using Ansible.
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
For Pipeline strategy builds, given the current restrictions with the Git
plug-in for Jenkins, any Git operations through the Git plug-in will not
leverage the HTTP or HTTPS proxy defined in the `BuildConfig`. The Git plug-in
only will use the proxy configured in the Jenkins UI at the Plugin Manager
panel. This proxy will then be used for all git interactions within Jenkins,
across all jobs.
