= Embedding {microshift-short} containers for offline deployments

You can use Image Builder to create `rpm-ostree` system images with embedded {microshift-short} container images. To embed container images, you must add the image references to your Image Builder blueprint.

.Prerequisites

* You have root-user access to your build host.
* Your build host meets the Image Builder system requirements.
* You have installed and set up Image Builder and the `composer-cli` tool.
* You have created a {op-system-ostree} image blueprint.
* You have installed jq.

.Procedure

. Get the exact list of container image references used by the {microshift-short} version you are deploying. You can either install the `microshift-release-info` RPM package by following step 2 or download and unpack the RPM by following step 3.

. To install the `microshift-release-info` RPM package:

.. Install the `microshift-release-info` RPM package by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y microshift-release-info-<release_version>
----
Replace `<release_version>` with the numerical value of the release you are deploying, using the entire version number, such as `4.14.0`.

.. List the contents of the `/usr/share/microshift/release` directory to verify the presence of the release information files by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls /usr/share/microshift/release
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
release-x86_64.json
release-aarch64.json
----
+
If you installed the `microshift-release-info` RPM, you can proceed to step 4.

. If you did not complete step 2, download and unpack the `microshift-release-info` RPM without installing it:

.. Download the RPM package by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf download microshift-release-info-<release_version>
----
Replace `<release_version>` with the numerical value of the release you are deploying, using the entire version number, such as `4.14.0`.
+
.Example rpm
[source,terminal]
----
microshift-release-info-4.14.0.*.el9.noarch.rpm <1>
----
<1> The `*` represents the date and commit ID. Your output should contain both, for example `-202311101230.p0.g7dc6a00.assembly.4.14.0`.

.. Unpack the RPM package without installing it by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rpm2cpio <my_microshift_release_info> | cpio -idmv <1>
./usr/share/microshift/release/release-aarch64.json
./usr/share/microshift/release/release-x86_64.json
----
<1> Replace `<my_microshift_release_info>` with the name of the RPM package from the previous step.

. Define the location of your JSON file, which contains the container reference information, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RELEASE_FILE=</path/to/your/release-$(uname -m).json>
----
Replace `</path/to/your/release-$(uname -m).json>` with the full path to your JSON file. Be sure to use the file needed for your architecture.

. Define the location of your TOML file, which contains instructions for building the image, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ BLUEPRINT_FILE=</path/to/your/blueprint.toml>
----
Replace `</path/to/your/blueprint.toml>` with the full path to your JSON file.

. Generate and then embed the container image references in your blueprint TOML file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  jq -r '.images | .[] | ("[[containers]]\nsource = \"" + . + "\"\n")' "${RELEASE_FILE}" >> "${BLUEPRINT_FILE}"
----
+
.Example resulting `<my_blueprint.toml>` fragment showing container references
[source,terminal]
----
[[containers]]
source = "quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev@sha256:82cfef91557f9a70cff5a90accba45841a37524e9b93f98a97b20f6b2b69e5db"

[[containers]]
source = "quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev@sha256:82cfef91557f9a70cff5a90accba45841a37524e9b93f98a97b20f6b2b69e5db"
----

. You can manually embed any container image by adding it to the Image Builder blueprint using the following example:
+
.Example section for manually embedding container image to Image Builder
[source,terminal]
----
[[containers]]
source = "<my_image_pullspec_with_tag_or_digest>"
----
Replace `<my_image_pullspec_with_tag_or_digest>` with the exact reference to a container image used by the {microshift-short} version you are deploying.
