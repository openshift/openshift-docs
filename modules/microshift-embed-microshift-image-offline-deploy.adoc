= Embedding {microshift-short} containers for offline deployments

You can use image builder to create {op-system-ostree} images with embedded {microshift-short} container images. To embed container images, you must add the image references to your image builder blueprint file.

.Prerequisites

* You have root-user access to your build host.
* Your build host meets the image builder system requirements.
* You installed and set up image builder and the `composer-cli` tool.
* You created a {op-system-ostree} image blueprint.
* You installed jq.

.Procedure

. Get the exact list of container image references used by the {microshift-short} version you are deploying. You can either install the `microshift-release-info` RPM package by following step 2 or download and unpack the RPM by following step 3.

. To install the `microshift-release-info` RPM package:

.. Install the `microshift-release-info` RPM package by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y microshift-release-info-_<release_version>_
----
Replace `_<release_version>_` with the numerical value of the release you are deploying, using the entire version number, such as `4.19.1`.

.. List the contents of the `/usr/share/microshift/release` directory to verify the presence of the release information files by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo ls /usr/share/microshift/release
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
release-x86_64.json
release-aarch64.json
----
+
If you installed the `microshift-release-info` RPM, proceed to step 4.

. If you did not complete step 2, download and unpack the `microshift-release-info` RPM without installing it:

.. Download the RPM package by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ sudo dnf download microshift-release-info-_<release_version>_ # <1>
----
<1> Replace `_<release_version>_` with the numerical value of the release you are deploying, using the entire version number, such as `4.19.1`.
+
.Example RPM output
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
microshift-release-info-4.18.1.-202511101230.p0.g7dc6a00.assembly.4.18.1.el9.noarch.rpm
----

.. Unpack the RPM package without installing it by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ rpm2cpio _<my_microshift_release_info>_ | cpio -idmv # <1>
./usr/share/microshift/release/release-aarch64.json
./usr/share/microshift/release/release-x86_64.json
----
<1> Replace `_<my_microshift_release_info>_` with the name of the RPM package from the previous step.

. Define the location of your JSON file, which contains the container reference information, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ RELEASE_FILE=_</path/to/your/release-$(uname -m).json>_ # <1>
----
<1> Replace `_</path/to/your/release-$(uname -m).json>_` with the full path to your JSON file. Be sure to use the file needed for your architecture.

. Define the location of your TOML file, which contains instructions for building the image, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ BLUEPRINT_FILE=_</path/to/your/blueprint.toml>_ # <1>
----
<1> Replace `_</path/to/your/blueprint.toml>_` with the full path to your TOML file.

. Generate and then embed the container image references in your blueprint TOML file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  jq -r '.images | .[] | ("[[containers]]\nsource = \"" + . + "\"\n")' "${RELEASE_FILE}" >> "${BLUEPRINT_FILE}"
----
+
.Example resulting TOML fragment showing container references
[source,terminal]
----
[[containers]]
source = "quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev@sha256:82cfef91557f9a70cff5a90accba45841a37524e9b93f98a97b20f6b2b69e5db"

[[containers]]
source = "quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev@sha256:82cfef91557f9a70cff5a90accba45841a37524e9b93f98a97b20f6b2b69e5db"
----

. You can manually embed any container image by adding it to an image builder blueprint file using the following example:
+

[source,text,subs="+quotes"]
----
[[containers]]
source = "_<my_image_pullspec_with_tag_or_digest>_"
----
Replace `_<my_image_pullspec_with_tag_or_digest>_` with the exact reference to a container image used by the {microshift-short} version you are deploying.
