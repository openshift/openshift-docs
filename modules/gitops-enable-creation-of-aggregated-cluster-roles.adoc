= Enable the creation of aggregated cluster roles

You can enable the creation of aggregated cluster roles by setting the value of the `.spec.aggregatedClusterRoles` field to `true` in the Argo CD custom resource (CR). When you enable the creation of aggregated cluster roles, the {gitops-title} Operator takes the following actions:

* Creates an `<argocd_name>-<argocd_namespace>-argocd-application-controller` aggregated cluster role with a predefined `aggregationRule` field by default.
* Creates a corresponding cluster role binding and manages it.
* Creates and manages `view` and `admin` cluster roles for Application Controller to add user-defined permissions into the aggregated cluster role.
