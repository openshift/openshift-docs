New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
{cgu-operator-first} is an Operator that runs only on the hub cluster for managing how changes including cluster and Operator upgrades, configuration, and so on are rolled out to the network.

Limits and requirements::
* {cgu-operator} supports concurrent cluster deployment in batches of 400.

* Precaching and backup features are for {sno} clusters only.

Engineering considerations::
* Only policies that have the `ran.openshift.io/ztp-deploy-wave` annotation are automatically applied by {cgu-operator} during initial cluster installation.

* You can create further `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CRs to control the policies that {cgu-operator} remediates.
