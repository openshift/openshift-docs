= Hub cluster management characteristics

{rh-rhacm-first} is the recommended cluster management solution.
Configure it to the following limits on the hub cluster:

* Configure a maximum of 5 {rh-rhacm} policies with a compliant evaluation interval of at least 10 minutes.

* Use a maximum of 10 managed cluster templates in policies.
Where possible, use hub-side templating.

* Disable all {rh-rhacm} add-ons except for the `policy-controller` and `observability-controller` add-ons.
Set `Observability` to the default configuration.

====
Configuring optional components or enabling additional features will result in additional resource usage and can reduce overall system performance.
