= Replacing an unhealthy etcd member whose etcd pod is crashlooping

This procedure details the steps to replace an etcd member that is unhealthy because the etcd pod is crashlooping.

.Prerequisites

* You have identified the unhealthy etcd member.
* You have verified that the etcd pod is crashlooping.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have taken an etcd backup.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to take an etcd backup before performing this procedure so that your cluster can be restored if you encounter any issues.
====

.Procedure

. Stop the crashlooping etcd pod.

.. Debug the node that is crashlooping.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal <1>
----
<1> Replace this with the name of the unhealthy node.

.. Change your root directory to the host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# chroot /host
----

.. Move the existing etcd pod file out of the kubelet manifest directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# mkdir /var/lib/etcd-backup
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd-pod.yaml /var/lib/etcd-backup/
----

.. Move the etcd data directory to a different location:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# mv /var/lib/etcd/ /tmp
----
+
You can now exit the node shell.

. Remove the unhealthy member.

.. Choose a pod that is _not_ on the affected node.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-etcd | grep -v etcd-quorum-guard | grep etcd
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
etcd-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal                2/3     Error       7          6h9m

----

.. Connect to the running etcd container, passing in the name of a pod that is not on the affected node.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-ip-10-0-154-204.ec2.internal
----

.. View the member list:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member list -w table
----
+

+------------------+---------+------------------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+

+
Take note of the ID and the name of the unhealthy etcd member, because these values are needed later in the procedure.

.. Remove the unhealthy etcd member by providing the ID to the `etcdctl member remove` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member remove 62bcf33650a7170a
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Member 62bcf33650a7170a removed from cluster ead669ce1fbfb346
----

.. View the member list again and verify that the member was removed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member list -w table
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

+
You can now exit the node shell.

. Remove the old secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed.

.. List the secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secrets -n openshift-etcd | grep ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal <1>
----
<1> Pass in the name of the unhealthy etcd member that you took note of earlier in this procedure.
+
There is a peer, serving, and metrics secret as shown in the following output:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
etcd-peer-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal              kubernetes.io/tls                     2      47m

----

.. Delete the secrets for the unhealthy etcd member that was removed.

... Delete the peer secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-peer-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal
----

... Delete the serving secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-serving-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal
----

... Delete the metrics secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-serving-metrics-ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal
----

. Force etcd redeployment.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd cluster -p='{"spec": {"forceRedeploymentReason": "single-master-recovery-'"$( date --rfc-3339=ns )"'"}}' --type=merge <1>
----
<1> The `forceRedeploymentReason` value must be unique, which is why a timestamp is appended.
+
When the etcd cluster Operator performs a redeployment, it ensures that all control plane nodes have a functioning etcd pod.

.Verification

* Verify that the new member is available and healthy.

.. Connect to the running etcd container again.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a cluster-admin user, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-ip-10-0-154-204.ec2.internal
----

.. Verify that all members are healthy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl endpoint health
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

https://10.0.154.204:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 16.698331ms
