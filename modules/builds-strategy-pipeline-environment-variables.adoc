= Using environment variables for pipeline builds

To make environment variables available to the Pipeline build process, you can add environment variables to the `jenkinsPipelineStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig`.

Once defined, the environment variables will be set as parameters for any Jenkins job associated with the `BuildConfig`

.Procedure

To define environment variables to be used during build:

[source,yaml]
----
jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "FOO"
      value: "BAR"

----

You can also manage environment variables defined in the `BuildConfig` with the `oc set env` command.
