= Non-administrator access to metrics

As a developer, one can enable user workload monitoring for an application or service in a project. As an administrator, you use the same feature to enable monitoring for infrastructure workloads. In that case, a developer or administrator of that project can examine the exposed metrics using the Developer Perspective in the Web console.
