== Known issues

* The AMQ Streams Operator might prevent the installation or upgrade of the {ServerlessOperatorName}. If this happens, the following error is thrown by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM):
+
[source,terminal]
----
WARNING: found multiple channel heads: [amqstreams.v1.7.2 amqstreams.v1.6.2], please check the `replaces`/`skipRange` fields of the operator bundles.
----
+
You can fix this issue by uninstalling the AMQ Streams Operator before installing or upgrading the {ServerlessOperatorName}. You can then reinstall the AMQ Streams Operator.

// Added note about the following to admin and dev metrics assemblies - remove these if the issue gets resolved.
* If Service Mesh is enabled with mTLS, metrics for Knative Serving are disabled by default because Service Mesh prevents Prometheus from scraping metrics.
+
If you want to enable Knative Serving metrics for use with Service Mesh and mTLS, you must complete the following steps:

.. Specify `prometheus` as the `metrics.backend-destination` in the `observability` spec of the Knative Serving custom resource (CR):
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeServing
metadata:
  name: knative-serving
spec:
  config:
    observability:
      metrics.backend-destination: "prometheus"
----
+
This step prevents metrics from being disabled by default.

.. Apply the following network policy to allow traffic from the Prometheus namespace:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-monitoring-ns
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: "openshift-monitoring"
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
----

.. Modify and reapply the default Service Mesh control plane in the `istio-system` namespace, so that it includes the following spec:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  proxy:
    networking:
      trafficControl:
        inbound:
          excludedPorts:
          - 8444
----

* If you deploy Service Mesh CRs with the Istio ingress enabled, you might see the following warning in the `istio-ingressgateway` pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
2021-05-02T12:56:17.700398Z warning envoy config [external/envoy/source/common/config/grpc_subscription_impl.cc:101] gRPC config for type.googleapis.com/envoy.api.v2.Listener rejected: Error adding/updating listener(s) 0.0.0.0_8081: duplicate listener 0.0.0.0_8081 found
----
+
Your Knative services might also not be accessible.
+
You can use the following workaround to fix this issue by recreating the `knative-local-gateway` service:

.. Delete the existing `knative-local-gateway` service in the `istio-system` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete services -n istio-system knative-local-gateway
----

.. Create and apply a `knative-local-gateway` service that contains the following YAML:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
 name: knative-local-gateway
 namespace: istio-system
 labels:
   experimental.istio.io/disable-gateway-port-translation: "true"
spec:
 type: ClusterIP
 selector:
   istio: ingressgateway
 ports:
   - name: http2
     port: 80
     targetPort: 8081
----

* If you have 1000 Knative services on a cluster, and then perform a reinstall or upgrade of Knative Serving, there is a delay when you create the first new service after the `KnativeServing` custom resource definition (CRD) becomes `Ready`.
+
The `3scale-kourier-control` service reconciles all previously existing Knative services before processing the creation of a new service, which causes the new service to spend approximately 800 seconds in an `IngressNotConfigured` or `Unknown` state before the state updates to `Ready`.
