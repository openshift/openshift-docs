== Known issues

* You must upgrade {product-title} to version 4.6.30, 4.7.11, or higher before upgrading to {ServerlessProductName} 1.16.0.

* The AMQ Streams Operator might prevent the installation or upgrade of the {ServerlessOperatorName}. If this happens, the following error is thrown by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM):
+
[source,terminal]
----
WARNING: found multiple channel heads: [amqstreams.v1.7.2 amqstreams.v1.6.2], please check the `replaces`/`skipRange` fields of the operator bundles.
----
+
You can fix this issue by uninstalling the AMQ Streams Operator before installing or upgrading the {ServerlessOperatorName}. You can then reinstall the AMQ Streams Operator.

* If Service Mesh is enabled with mTLS, metrics for Knative Serving are disabled by default because Service Mesh prevents Prometheus from scraping metrics. For instructions on enabling Knative Serving metrics for use with Service Mesh and mTLS, see the "Integrating Service Mesh with OpenShift Serverless" section of the Serverless documentation.

* If you deploy Service Mesh CRs with the Istio ingress enabled, you might see the following warning in the `istio-ingressgateway` pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
2021-05-02T12:56:17.700398Z warning envoy config [external/envoy/source/common/config/grpc_subscription_impl.cc:101] gRPC config for type.googleapis.com/envoy.api.v2.Listener rejected: Error adding/updating listener(s) 0.0.0.0_8081: duplicate listener 0.0.0.0_8081 found
----
+
Your Knative services might also not be accessible.
+
You can use the following workaround to fix this issue by recreating the `knative-local-gateway` service:

.. Delete the existing `knative-local-gateway` service in the `istio-system` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete services -n istio-system knative-local-gateway
----

.. Create and apply a `knative-local-gateway` service that contains the following YAML:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
 name: knative-local-gateway
 namespace: istio-system
 labels:
   experimental.istio.io/disable-gateway-port-translation: "true"
spec:
 type: ClusterIP
 selector:
   istio: ingressgateway
 ports:
   - name: http2
     port: 80
     targetPort: 8081
----

* If you have 1000 Knative services on a cluster, and then perform a reinstall or upgrade of Knative Serving, there is a delay when you create the first new service after the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR) becomes `Ready`.
+
The `3scale-kourier-control` service reconciles all previously existing Knative services before processing the creation of a new service, which causes the new service to spend approximately 800 seconds in an `IngressNotConfigured` or `Unknown` state before the state updates to `Ready`.

* If you create a new subscription for a Kafka channel, or a new Kafka source, there might be a delay in the Kafka data plane becoming ready to dispatch messages after the newly created subscription or sink reports a ready status.
+
As a result, messages that are sent during the time when the data plane is not reporting a ready status might not be delivered to the subscriber or sink.
+
