* You must verify that you are using the latest {product-title-short} 3.74 Operator and there are no pending manual Operator upgrades.
* You must verify that you backed up your Central database.
endif::[]
* You have access to an {ocp} cluster web console using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

== Changing the subscription channel by using the web console
Use the following instructions for changing the subscription channel by using the web console:

.Procedure
. In the *Administrator* perspective of the {ocp} web console, go to *Ecosystem* → *Installed Operators*.
. Click the {product-title-short} Operator.
. Click the *Subscription* tab.
. Click the name of the update channel under *Update Channel*.
. Select *stable*, then click *Save*.
. For subscriptions with an *Automatic* approval strategy, the update begins automatically. Go back to the *Ecosystem* → *Installed Operators* page to monitor the progress of the update. When complete, the status changes to *Succeeded* and *Up to date*.
+
For subscriptions with a *Manual* approval strategy, you can manually approve the update from the *Subscription* tab.

== Changing the subscription channel by using command line
Use the following instructions for changing the subscription channel by using command line:

.Procedure
* Run the following command to change the subscription channel to `stable`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n rhacs-operator \ <1>
  patch subscriptions.operators.coreos.com rhacs-operator \
  --type=merge --patch='{ "spec": { "channel": "stable" }}'
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.

During the update, the {product-title-short} Operator provisions a new deployment called `central-db` and your data begins migrating. It takes around 30 minutes and happens only after you upgrade.
