= Machine configuration

New in this release::
* The CRI-O wipe disable `MachineConfig` CR is no longer needed as CRI-O now handles unclean shutdowns by performing a quick check and repair in the event of an unclean shutdown.

Limits and requirements::
* To ensure images on disk are static other than during scheduled maintenance in defined maintenance windows, do not set the pod `imagePullPolicy` field to `Always`.
* The configuration CRs in this table are required components unless otherwise noted.
