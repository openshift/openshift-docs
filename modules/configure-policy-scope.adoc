= Configuring the policy scope

[role="_abstract"]
You can define the scope of a policy to restrict or allow the policy for certain entities. You can enable the policy to apply only to a specific cluster, namespace, or deployment label. For policies configured for the deploy and runtime lifecycle stages, you can also exclude a cluster, namespace, deployment, or deployment label so that the policy is not applied. For the build lifecycle stage, you can exclude specific images so that, for example, those images will not trigger a violation during the continuous integration part of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

.Procedure

. To restrict by scope, click *Add inclusion scope*. This enables this policy to only be applied for a specific cluster, a namespace, or a deployment label.
You can add multiple scopes and also use regular expressions in link:https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[RE2 Syntax] for namespaces and labels.
. To exclude by scope, for example, to exclude specific deployments, clusters, namespaces, and deployment labels from the policy, click *Add exclusion scope*. The policy will not apply to the entities that you select. You can add multiple scopes and also use regular expressions in link:https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[RE2 Syntax] for namespaces and labels. However, you cannot use regular expressions for selecting deployments.

[NOTE]
====
This function is only available for policies configured for the deploy and runtime lifecycle stages.
====
. For policies configured for the build lifecycle stage, you can exclude images from the policy. In the *Exclude images (Build lifecycle only)* field, enter the images that you do not want to trigger a violation for.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Excluded Images* setting only applies when you check images in a continuous integration system with the *Build* lifecycle stage.
It does not have any effect if you use this policy to check running deployments in the *Deploy* lifecycle stage or runtime activities in the *Runtime* lifecycle stage.
