= Uninstalling the web terminal

Uninstalling the web terminal is a two-step process:

. Delete the components and custom resources (CRs) that were added when you installed the Operator.
. Uninstall the Web Terminal Operator.

Uninstalling the Web Terminal Operator does not remove any of its custom resource definitions (CRDs) or managed resources that are created when the Operator is installed. These components must be manually uninstalled for security purposes. Removing these components also allows you to save cluster resources by ensuring that terminals do not idle when the Operator is uninstalled.

.Prerequisites
* Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

== Deleting the web terminal components and custom resources

Use the CLI to delete the CRs that are created during installation of the  Web Terminal Operator.

.Procedure
. Run the following commands to ensure that all `DevWorkspace` CRs are removed along with their related Kubernetes objects, such as deployments.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete devworkspaces.workspace.devfile.io --all-namespaces --all --wait
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete workspaceroutings.controller.devfile.io --all-namespaces --all --wait
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete components.controller.devfile.io --all-namespaces --all --wait
----
+
[WARNING]
====
If this step is not complete, finalizers make it difficult to fully uninstall the Operator easily.
====
+
. Run the following commands to remove the CRDs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io workspaceroutings.controller.devfile.io
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io components.controller.devfile.io
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io devworkspaces.workspace.devfile.io
----
+
. Remove the `DevWorkspace-Webhook-Server` deployment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete deployment/devworkspace-webhook-server -n openshift-operators
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When you run this and the following steps, you cannot use the `oc exec` commands to run commands in a container. After you remove the webhooks you will be able to use the `oc exec` commands again.
====
+
. Run the following commands to remove any lingering services, secrets, and config maps:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete all --selector app.kubernetes.io/part-of=devworkspace-operator,app.kubernetes.io/name=devworkspace-webhook-server
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete serviceaccounts devworkspace-webhook-server -n openshift-operators
----

$ oc delete configmap devworkspace-controller -n openshift-operators

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete clusterrole devworkspace-webhook-server
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete clusterrolebinding devworkspace-webhook-server
----

. Run the following commands to remove mutating or validating webhook configurations:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations controller.devfile.io
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete validatingwebhookconfigurations controller.devfile.io

== Uninstalling the Operator using the web console

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators -> Installed Operators*.
. Scroll the filter list or type a keyword into the *Filter by name* box to find the *Web Terminal* Operator.
. Click the Options menu {kebab} for the Web Terminal Operator, and then select *Uninstall Operator*.
