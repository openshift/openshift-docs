= BMC addressing for Fujitsu iRMC

[role="_abstract"]
You can connect to a Fujitsu iRMC system using the iRMC protocol or the IPMI protocol. The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the {product-title} cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

|====
|Protocol|Address Format
|iRMC| `irmc://<out-of-band-ip>`
|IPMI| `ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>`
|====

Fujitsu nodes can use `irmc://<out-of-band-ip>` and defaults to port `443`. The following example demonstrates an iRMC configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.
