= Checking machine config pool status

To see the status of the Machine Config Operator (MCO), its sub-components, and the resources it manages, use the following `oc` commands:

where:

UPDATED:: The `True` status indicates that the MCO has applied the current machine config to the nodes in that MCP. The current machine config is specified in the `STATUS` field in the `oc get mcp` output. The `False` status indicates a node in the MCP is updating.
UPDATING:: The `True` status indicates that the MCO is applying the desired machine config, as specified in the `MachineConfigPool` custom resource, to at least one of the nodes in that MCP. The desired machine config is the new, edited machine config. Nodes that are updating might not be available for scheduling. The `False` status indicates that all nodes in the MCP are updated.
DEGRADED:: A `True` status indicates the MCO is blocked from applying the current or desired machine config to at least one of the nodes in that MCP, or the configuration is failing. Nodes that are degraded might not be available for scheduling. A `False` status indicates that all nodes in the MCP are ready.
MACHINECOUNT:: Indicates the total number of machines in that MCP.
READYMACHINECOUNT:: Indicates the total number of machines in that MCP that are ready for scheduling.
UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT:: Indicates the total number of machines in that MCP that have the current machine config.
DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT:: Indicates the total number of machines in that MCP that are marked as degraded or unreconcilable.

In the previous output, there are three control plane (master) nodes and three worker nodes. The control plane MCP and the associated nodes are updated to the current machine config. The nodes in the worker MCP are being updated to the desired machine config. Two of the nodes in the worker MCP are updated and one is still updating, as indicated by the `UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT` being `2`. There are no issues, as indicated by the `DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT` being `0` and `DEGRADED` being `False`.
+
While the nodes in the MCP are updating, the machine config listed under `CONFIG` is the current machine config, which the MCP is being updated from. When the update is complete, the listed machine config is the desired machine config, which the MCP was updated to.

[NOTE]
====
If a node is being cordoned, that node is not included in the `READYMACHINECOUNT`, but is included in the `MACHINECOUNT`. Also, the MCP status is set to `UPDATING`. Because the node has the current machine config, it is counted in the `UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT` total:

Note that the `MachineConfig` objects listed as `rendered` are not meant to be changed or deleted.

The output from the command shows that this `MachineConfig` object contains both configuration files (`cloud.conf` and `kubelet.conf`) and a systemd service (Kubernetes Kubelet):

If something goes wrong with a machine config that you apply, you can always back out that change. For example, if you had run `oc create -f ./myconfig.yaml` to apply a machine config, you could remove that machine config by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f ./myconfig.yaml
----

If that was the only problem, the nodes in the affected pool should return to a non-degraded state. This actually causes the rendered configuration to roll back to its previously rendered state.

If you add your own machine configs to your cluster, you can use the commands shown in the previous example to check their status and the related status of the pool to which they are applied.
