= Checking Machine Config Pool status

To see the status of the Machine Config Operator, its sub-components,
and the resources it manages, use the following `oc` commands:

.Procedure
. To see the number of MCO-managed nodes available on your cluster for each pool, type:

$ oc get machineconfigpool

In the previous output, there are three master and three worker nodes. All machines are updated
and none are currently updating. Because all nodes are Updated and Ready and none are Degraded,
you can ell that there are no issues.

. To see each existing `machineconfig`, type:
+
[source,terminal]

$ oc get machineconfigs

Note that the `machineconfigs` listed as `rendered` are not meant to be
changed or deleted. Expect them to be hidden at some point in the future.

. Check the status of worker (or change to master) to see the status of that pool of nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe mcp worker
...
  Degraded Machine Count:     0
  Machine Count:              3

  Unavailable Machine Count:  0
  Updated Machine Count:      3

. You can view the contents of a particular machineconfig (in this case,
`01-master-kubelet`). The trimmed output from the following `oc describe`
command shows that this `machineconfig` contains both configuration files
(`cloud.conf` and `kubelet.conf`) and a systemd service
(Kubernetes Kubelet):

If something goes wrong with a machineconfig that you apply, you can always
back out that change. For example, if you had run `oc create -f ./myconfig.yaml`
to apply a machineconfig, you could remove that machineconfig by typing:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f ./myconfig.yaml
----
+
If that was the only problem, the nodes in the affected pool should return to a non-degraded state.
This actually causes the rendered configuration to roll back to its previously rendered state.

If you add your own MachineConfigs to your cluster, you can use the commands
shown in the previous example to check their status and the related status of
the pool to which they are applied.
