= Recommended etcd practices

For large and dense clusters, etcd can suffer from poor performance if the keyspace grows excessively large and exceeds the space quota.Periodic maintenance of etcd including defragmentation needs to be done to free up space in the data store. It is highly recommended that you monitor
Prometheus for etcd metrics and defragment it when needed before etcd raises a cluster-wide alarm that puts the cluster into a maintenance mode, which only accepts key reads and deletes. Some of the key metrics to monitor are `etcd_server_quota_backend_bytes` which is the current quota limit, `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes` which indicates the actual database usage after a history compaction, and `etcd_debugging_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes` which shows the database size including free space waiting for defragmentation.

Etcd replicates requests among all the members, so its performance strongly depends on network input/output (IO) latency. High network latencies result in etcd heartbeats taking longer than the election timeout, which leads to leader elections that are disruptive to the cluster. A key metric to monitor on a deployed {product-title} cluster is the 99th percentile of etcd network peer latency  on each etcd cluster member. Use Prometheus to track the metric. `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(etcd_network_peer_round_trip_time_seconds_bucket[2m]))` reports the round trip time for etcd to finish replicating the client requests between the members; it should be less than 50 ms.
