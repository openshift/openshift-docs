= Recommended etcd practices

For large and dense clusters, etcd can suffer from poor performance if the keyspace grows too large and exceeds the space quota. Periodically maintain and defragment etcd to free up space in the data store. Monitor Prometheus for etcd metrics and defragment it when required; otherwise, etcd can raise a cluster-wide alarm that puts the cluster into a maintenance mode that accepts only key reads and deletes.

.Monitor these key metrics:

* `etcd_server_quota_backend_bytes`, which is the current quota limit
* `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes`, which indicates the actual database usage after a history compaction
* `etcd_debugging_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes`, which shows the database size, including free space waiting for defragmentation

For more information about defragmenting etcd, see the "Defragmenting etcd data" section.

Because etcd writes data to disk and persists proposals on disk, its performance depends on disk performance. Slow disks and disk activity from other processes can cause long fsync latencies. Those latencies can cause etcd to miss heartbeats, not commit new proposals to the disk on time, and ultimately experience request timeouts and temporary leader loss. Run etcd on machines that are backed by SSD or NVMe disks with low latency and high throughput. Consider single-level cell (SLC) solid-state drives (SSDs), which provide 1 bit per memory cell, are durable and reliable, and are ideal for write-intensive workloads.

Some key metrics to monitor on a deployed {product-title} cluster are p99 of etcd disk write ahead log duration and the number of etcd leader changes. Use Prometheus to track these metrics.

* The `etcd_disk_wal_fsync_duration_seconds_bucket` metric reports the etcd disk fsync duration.
* The `etcd_server_leader_changes_seen_total` metric reports the leader changes.
* To rule out a slow disk and confirm that the disk is reasonably fast, verify that the 99th percentile of the `etcd_disk_wal_fsync_duration_seconds_bucket` is less than 10 ms.

To validate the hardware for etcd before or after you create the {product-title} cluster, you can use an I/O benchmarking tool called fio.

.Prerequisites

* Container runtimes such as Podman or Docker are installed on the machine that you're testing.
* Data is written to the `/var/lib/etcd` path.

.Procedure
* Run fio and analyze the results:

** If you use Podman, run this command:

----
$ sudo podman run --volume /var/lib/etcd:/var/lib/etcd:Z quay.io/openshift-scale/etcd-perf
----

** If you use Docker, run this command:
[source,terminal]

----
$ sudo docker run --volume /var/lib/etcd:/var/lib/etcd:Z quay.io/openshift-scale/etcd-perf
----

The output reports whether the disk is fast enough to host etcd by comparing the 99th percentile of the fsync metric captured from the run to see if it is less than 10 ms.

Because etcd replicates the requests among all the members, its performance strongly depends on network input/output (I/O) latency. High network latencies result in etcd heartbeats taking longer than the election timeout, which results in leader elections that are disruptive to the cluster. A key metric to monitor on a deployed {product-title} cluster is the 99th percentile of etcd network peer latency on each etcd cluster member. Use Prometheus to track the metric.

The `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(etcd_network_peer_round_trip_time_seconds_bucket[2m]))` metric reports the round trip time for etcd to finish replicating the client requests between the members. Ensure that it is less than 50 ms.
