= Scheduling individual upgrades through the {cluster-manager} console

You can schedule upgrades for a {product-title} cluster manually one time by using {cluster-manager} console.

.Procedure

. Log in to {cluster-manager-url}.
. Select a cluster to upgrade.
. Click the *Settings* tab.
. In the *Update strategy* pane, select *Individual Updates*.
. Select the version you want to upgrade your cluster to. Recommended cluster upgrades appear in the UI.
. If you select an update version that requires approval, provide an administrator’s acknowledgment and click *Approve and continue*.
+
. In the *Node draining* pane, select a grace period interval from the list. The grace period enables the nodes to gracefully drain before forcing the pod eviction. The default is *1 hour*.
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot change the node drain grace period after you start the upgrade process.
====
+
. In the *Update strategy* pane, click *Save* to apply your update strategy.
. In the *Update status* pane, review the *Update available* information and click *Update*.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Update* button is enabled only when an upgrade is available.
====
+
. In the *Select version* dialog, choose a target upgrade version and click *Next*.
. In the *Schedule update* dialog, schedule your cluster upgrade.
+
* To upgrade within an hour, select *Update now* and click *Next*.
* To upgrade at a later time, select *Schedule a different time* and set a time and date for your upgrade. Click *Next* to proceed to the confirmation dialog.
+
. After reviewing the version and schedule summary, select *Confirm update*.
+
The cluster is scheduled for an upgrade to the target version. This action can take an hour or longer, depending on the selected upgrade schedule and your workload configuration, such as pod disruption budgets.
+
The status is displayed in the *Update status* pane.

.Troubleshooting
* Sometimes a scheduled upgrade does not trigger. See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6648291[Upgrade maintenance cancelled] for more information.
