ifdef::sts[]
.Prerequisites

* If you are upgrading your cluster from 4.7 to 4.8, you have upgraded the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) account-wide roles and policies to version 4.8. You have also updated the `cloudcredential.openshift.io/upgradeable-to` annotation in the `CloudCredential` custom resource. For more information, see _Preparing an upgrade from 4.7 to 4.8_.
endif::sts[]

.Procedure

. Log in to {cluster-manager-url}.
. Select a cluster to upgrade.
. Click the *Settings* tab.
. In the *Update strategy* pane, select *Individual Updates*.
. Select the version you want to upgrade your cluster to. Recommended cluster upgrades appear in the UI.
. If you select an update version that requires approval, provide an administratorâ€™s acknowledgment and click *Approve and continue*.
+
For information about administrator acknowledgment, see xref:./../upgrading/rosa-upgrading-cluster-prepare.adoc#upgrade-49-acknowledgement_rosa-updating-cluster-prepare[Administrator acknowledgment when upgrading to OpenShift 4.9].
. In the *Node draining* pane, select a grace period interval from the list. The grace period enables the nodes to gracefully drain before forcing the pod eviction. The default is *1 hour*.
. In the *Update strategy* pane, click *Save* to apply your update strategy.
. In the *Update status* pane, review the *Update available* information and click *Update*.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Update* button is enabled only when an upgrade is available.
====
+
. In the *Select version* dialog, choose a target upgrade version and click *Next*.
. In the *Schedule update* dialog, schedule your cluster upgrade.
+
* To upgrade within an hour, select *Update now* and click *Next*.
* To upgrade at a later time, select *Schedule a different time* and set a time and date for your upgrade. Click *Next* to proceed to the confirmation dialog.
+
. After reviewing the version and schedule summary, select *Confirm update*.
+
The cluster is scheduled for an upgrade to the target version. This action can take an hour or longer, depending on the selected upgrade schedule and your workload configuration, such as pod disruption budgets.
+
The status is displayed in the *Update status* pane.
