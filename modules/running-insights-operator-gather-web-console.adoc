= Running an Insights Operator gather operation from the web console
To collect data, you can run an Insights Operator gather operation by using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. On the console, select *Administration* -> *CustomResourceDefinitions*.
. On the *CustomResourceDefinitions* page, in the *Search by name* field, find the *DataGather* resource definition, and then click it.
. On the console, select *Administration* -> *CustomResourceDefinitions*.
. On the *CustomResourceDefinitions* page, in the *Search by name* field, find the *DataGather* resource definition, and then click it.
. On the *CustomResourceDefinition details* page, click the *Instances* tab.
. Click *Create DataGather*.
. To create a new `DataGather` operation, edit the following configuration file and then save your changes.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather> <1>
spec:
 gatherers: <2>
   - name: workloads
     state: Disabled
----

--
<1> Under *metadata*, replace `<your_data_gather>` with a unique name for the gather operation.
<2> Under *gatherers*, specify any individual gather operations that you intend to disable. In the example provided, `workloads` is the only data gather operation that is disabled and all of the other default operations are set to run.
When the `spec` parameter is empty, all of the default gather operations run.
--

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not add a prefix of `periodic-gathering-` to the name of your gather operation because this string is reserved for other administrative operations and might impact the intended gather operation.

.Verification

. On the console, select to *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
. On the Pods page, go to the *Project* pull-down menu, and then select *Show default projects*.
. Select the `openshift-insights` project from the *Project* pull-down menu.
. On the console, select to *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
. On the Pods page, go to the *Project* pull-down menu, and then select *Show default projects*.
. Select the `openshift-insights` project from the *Project* pull-down menu.
. Check that your new gather operation is prefixed with your chosen name under the list of pods in the `openshift-insights` project. Upon completion, the Insights Operator automatically uploads the data to Red Hat for processing.
