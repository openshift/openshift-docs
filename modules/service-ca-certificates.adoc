= Service CA certificates

[discrete]
== Purpose

`service-ca` is an Operator that creates a self-signed CA when an
{product-title} cluster is deployed.

[discrete]
== Expiration

A custom expiration term is not supported. The self-signed CA is stored in a
secret with qualified name `service-ca/signing-key` in fields `tls.crt`
(certificate(s)), `tls.key` (private key), and `ca-bundle.crt` (CA bundle).

Other services can request a service serving certificate by annotating a
service resource with `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name:
<secret name>`. In response, the Operator generates a new certificate, as
`tls.crt`, and private key, as `tls.key` to the named secret. The certificate
is valid for two years.

Other services can request that the CA bundle for the service CA be injected
into APIService or ConfigMap resources by annotating with
`service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle: true` to support validating
certificates generated from the service CA. In response, the Operator writes its
current CA bundle to the `CABundle` field of APIService or as `service-ca.crt`
to a ConfigMap.

As of {product-title} 4.3.5, automated rotation is supported and is backported
to some 4.2.z and 4.3.z releases. For any release supporting automated rotation,
the service CA is valid for 26 months and is automatically refreshed when there
is less than 13 months validity left. If necessary, you can manually refresh
the service CA.

The service CA expiration of 26 months is longer than the expected upgrade
interval for a supported {product-title} cluster, such that non-control plane
consumers of service CA certificates will be refreshed after CA rotation and
prior to the expiration of the pre-rotation CA.

[WARNING]
====
A manually-rotated service CA does not maintain trust with the previous service
CA. You might experience a temporary service disruption until the pods in the
cluster are restarted, which ensures that pods are using service serving
certificates issued by the new service CA.
