= About Operator and extention catalogs

Cluster administrators can add curated collections of Operators and extensions, called _catalogs_, to a cluster. After a catalog is added to cluster, the Operators and extensions in that catalog are available for installation. Installed Operators and extensions in a catalog are elligible for over-the-air updates when Operator authors publish new versions, patches, or other updates to the subscribed catalog.
