= Descheduler profiles

The following descheduler profiles are available:

`AffinityAndTaints`:: This profile evicts pods that violate inter-pod anti-affinity, node affinity, and node taints.
+
It enables the following strategies:
+
* `RemovePodsViolatingInterPodAntiAffinity`: removes pods that are violating inter-pod anti-affinity.
* `RemovePodsViolatingNodeAffinity`: removes pods that are violating node affinity.
* `RemovePodsViolatingNodeTaints`: removes pods that are violating `NoSchedule` taints on nodes.
+
Pods with a node affinity type of `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` are removed.

`TopologyAndDuplicates`:: This profile evicts pods in an effort to evenly spread similar pods, or pods of the same topology domain, among nodes.
+
It enables the following strategies:
+
* `RemovePodsViolatingTopologySpreadConstraint`: finds unbalanced topology domains and tries to evict pods from larger ones when `DoNotSchedule` constraints are violated.
* `RemoveDuplicates`: ensures that there is only one pod associated with a replica set, replication controller, deployment, or job running on same node. If there are more, those duplicate pods are evicted for better pod distribution in a cluster.

`LifecycleAndUtilization`:: This profile evicts long-running pods and balances resource usage between nodes.
+
It enables the following strategies:
+
* `RemovePodsHavingTooManyRestarts`: removes pods that have been restarted too many times.
+
Pods that are restarted more than 100 times are removed. This includes restarts for Init Containers.

* `LowNodeUtilization`: finds nodes that are underutilized and evicts pods, if possible, from overutilized nodes in the hope that recreation of evicted pods will be scheduled on these underutilized nodes.
+
A node is considered underutilized if its usage is below 20% for all thresholds (CPU, memory, and number of pods).
+
A node is considered overutilized if its usage is above 50% for any of the thresholds (CPU, memory, and number of pods).

* `PodLifeTime`: evicts pods that are too old.
+
Pods that are older than 24 hours are removed.
