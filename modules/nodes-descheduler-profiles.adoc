= Descheduler profiles
ifdef::nodes[]
The following descheduler profiles are available:

`AffinityAndTaints`:: This profile evicts pods that violate inter-pod anti-affinity, node affinity, and node taints.
+
It enables the following strategies:
+
* `RemovePodsViolatingInterPodAntiAffinity`: removes pods that are violating inter-pod anti-affinity.
* `RemovePodsViolatingNodeAffinity`: removes pods that are violating node affinity.
* `RemovePodsViolatingNodeTaints`: removes pods that are violating `NoSchedule` taints on nodes.
+
Pods with a node affinity type of `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` are removed.

`TopologyAndDuplicates`:: This profile evicts pods in an effort to evenly spread similar pods, or pods of the same topology domain, among nodes.
+
It enables the following strategies:
+
* `RemovePodsViolatingTopologySpreadConstraint`: finds unbalanced topology domains and tries to evict pods from larger ones when `DoNotSchedule` constraints are violated.
* `RemoveDuplicates`: ensures that there is only one pod associated with a replica set, replication controller, deployment, or job running on same node. If there are more, those duplicate pods are evicted for better pod distribution in a cluster.

`LifecycleAndUtilization`:: This profile evicts long-running pods and balances resource usage between nodes.
+
It enables the following strategies:
+
* `RemovePodsHavingTooManyRestarts`: removes pods whose containers have been restarted too many times.
+
Pods where the sum of restarts over all containers (including Init Containers) is more than 100.

* `LowNodeUtilization`: finds nodes that are underutilized and evicts pods, if possible, from overutilized nodes in the hope that recreation of evicted pods will be scheduled on these underutilized nodes.
+
A node is considered underutilized if its usage is below 20% for all thresholds (CPU, memory, and number of pods).
+
A node is considered overutilized if its usage is above 50% for any of the thresholds (CPU, memory, and number of pods).

* `PodLifeTime`: evicts pods that are too old.
+
By default, pods that are older than 24 hours are removed. You can customize the pod lifetime value.

`SoftTopologyAndDuplicates`:: This profile is the same as `TopologyAndDuplicates`, except that pods with soft topology constraints, such as `whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway`, are also considered for eviction.
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not enable both `SoftTopologyAndDuplicates` and `TopologyAndDuplicates`. Enabling both results in a conflict.
====

`EvictPodsWithLocalStorage`:: This profile allows pods with local storage to be eligible for eviction.

`EvictPodsWithPVC`:: This profile allows pods with persistent volume claims to be eligible for eviction. If you are using `Kubernetes NFS Subdir External Provisioner`, you must add an excluded namespace for the namespace where the provisioner is installed.

ifdef::virt[]
Use the Technology Preview `DevPreviewLongLifecycle` profile to enable the descheduler on a virtual machine. This is the only descheduler profile currently available for {VirtProductName}. To ensure proper scheduling, create VMs with CPU and memory requests for the expected load.

`DevPreviewLongLifecycle`:: This profile balances resource usage between nodes and enables the following strategies:
+
* `RemovePodsHavingTooManyRestarts`: removes pods whose containers have been restarted too many times and pods where the sum of restarts over all containers (including Init Containers) is more than 100. Restarting the VM guest operating system does not increase this count.
* `LowNodeUtilization`: evicts pods from overutilized nodes when there are any underutilized nodes. The destination node for the evicted pod will be determined by the scheduler.
** A node is considered underutilized if its usage is below 20% for all thresholds (CPU, memory, and number of pods).
** A node is considered overutilized if its usage is above 50% for any of the thresholds (CPU, memory, and number of pods).
