= Hot deploying for Node.js

Hot deployment allows you to quickly make and deploy changes to your application without having to generate a new source-to-image (S2I) build. In order to immediately pick up changes made in your application source code, you must run your built image with the `DEV_MODE=true` environment variable.

You can set new environment variables when creating new applications, or updating
environment variables for existing objects.

[WARNING]
====
Only use the `DEV_MODE=true` environment variable while developing or debugging. Using this in your production environment is not recommended.

.Procedure

* To change the source code of a running pod, open a remote shell into the container:

$ oc rsh <pod_id>
----
+
Entering into a running container changes your current directory to `/opt/app-root/src`, where the source code is located.
