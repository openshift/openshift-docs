. From the side navigation menu in the *Administrator* perspective, click *Home* -> *Projects* and then click *Create Project*.

. Enter a name for your project. Optional: Add a *Display Name* and *Description*. Click *Create*.

. Switch to the Developer perspective from the side navigation menu to create an app.

. Click *+Add* from the side navigation menu. From the *Add pane* menu bar, make sure that the *Project* is the one that you just created.

http://nodejs-<project>.<cluster_name>-<hash>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud
