endif::[]

.Procedure

. Go to the *Clusters* page in {cluster-manager-url}. 

. Click the options icon (&#8942;) next to the cluster you want to view.

. Click *Open console*.

. Your cluster console opens in a new browser window. Login to your Red Hat account with your configured identity provider credentials.

. In the *Administrator* perspective, select *Home* -> *Projects* -> *Create Project*.

. Enter a name for your project and optionally add a *Display Name* and *Description*.

. Click *Create* to create the project.

. Switch to the *Developer* perspective and select *+Add*. Verify that the selected *Project* is the one that you just created.

. In the *Developer Catalog* dialog, select *All services*.

. In the *Git* section, click *Try sample*.

. Add a unique name in the *Name* field. The value will be used to name the associated resources.

. Confirm that *Deployment* and *Create a route* are selected.

. Click *Create* to deploy the application. It will take a few minutes for the pods to deploy.

. Optional: Check the status of the pods in the *Topology* pane by selecting your *Node.js* app and reviewing its sidebar. You must wait for the `nodejs` build to complete and for the `nodejs` pod to be in a *Running* state before continuing.

. When the deployment is complete, click the route URL for the application, which has a format similar to the following:
+
----
https://nodejs-<project>.<cluster_name>.<hash>.<region>.openshiftapps.com/
----
+
A new tab in your browser opens with a message similar to the following:
+
----
Welcome to your Node.js application on OpenShift
----

. Optional: Delete the application and clean up the resources that you created:
.. In the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Home* -> *Projects*.
.. Click the action menu for your project and select *Delete Project*.
