. When the deployment is complete, click the route URL for the application, which has a format similar to the following:
+
----
https://nodejs-<project>.<cluster_name>.<hash>.<region>.openshiftapps.com/
----

A new tab in your browser opens with a message similar to the following:
+
----
Welcome to your Node.js application on OpenShift
----

. Optional: Delete the application and clean up the resources that you created:
.. In the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Home* -> *Projects*.
.. Click the action menu for your project and select *Delete Project*.
