= About boot image management

By default, for {gcp-first} and {aws-first} clusters, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) updates the boot image in the machine sets in your cluster whenever you update your cluster.

For {gcp-short} and {aws-short}, you can disable the boot image management feature, if needed. When the feature is disabled, the boot image no longer updates with the cluster. For example, with the feature disabled, if your cluster was originally created with {product-title} 4.16, the boot image that the MCO would use to create nodes is the same 4.16 version, even if your cluster is at a later version.

However, using an older boot image could cause the following issues:

* Extra time to start nodes
* Certificate expiration issues
* Version skew issues

For information on how to disable this feature, see "Disabling boot image management". If you disable this feature, you can re-enable the feature at any time. For information, see "Enabling boot image management".

[NOTE]
====
The ability to configure boot image management is available for only {gcp-short} and {aws-short} clusters. It is not supported for clusters managed by the {cluster-capi-operator}.
====

How the cluster behaves after disabling or re-enabling the feature, depends upon when you made the change, including the following scenarios:

* If you disable the feature before updating to a new {product-title} version:
** The boot image version used by the machine sets remains the same {product-title} version as when the feature was disabled. 
** When you scale up nodes, the new nodes use that same {product-title} version.

* If you disable the feature after updating to a new {product-title} version: 
** The boot image version used by the machine sets is updated to match the updated {product-title} version. 
** When you scale up nodes, the new nodes use the updated {product-title} version. 
** If you update to a later {product-title} version, the boot image version in the machine sets remains at the current version and is not updated with the cluster.

* If you enable the feature after disabling: 
** The boot image version used by the machine sets is updated to the current {product-title} version, if different. 
** When you scale up nodes, the new nodes use the current {product-title} version in the cluster. 

[NOTE]
====
Because a boot image is used only when a node is scaled up, this feature has no effect on existing nodes.

To view the current boot image used in your cluster, examine a machine set:

----
<1> This boot image is the same as the originally-installed {product-title} version, in this example {product-title} 4.12, regardless of the current version of the cluster. The way that the boot image is represented in the machine set depends on the platform, as the structure of the `providerSpec` field differs from platform to platform.

// The following admonition is intended to address https://issues.redhat.com/browse//OSDOCS-14592
[IMPORTANT]
====
If any of the machine sets for which you want to enable boot image management use a `*-user-data` secret that is based on Ignition version 2.2.0, the Machine Config Operator converts the Ignition version to 3.4.0 when you enable the feature. {product-title} versions 4.5 and lower use Ignition version 2.2.0. If this conversion fails, the MCO or your cluster could degrade. An error message that includes _err: converting ignition stub failed: failed to parse Ignition config_ is added to the output of the `oc get ClusterOperator machine-config` command. You can use the following general steps to correct the problem:

. Disable the boot image management feature. For information, see "Disabling boot image management".
. Manually update the `*-user-data` secret to use Ignition version to 3.2.0.
. Enable the boot image management feature. For information, see "Enabling boot image management".
