= About the Node Maintenance Operator

The Node Maintenance Operator watches for new or deleted `NodeMaintenance` CRs. When a new `NodeMaintenance` CR is detected, no new workloads are scheduled and the node is cordoned off from the rest of the cluster. All pods that can be evicted are evicted from the node. When a `NodeMaintenance` CR is deleted, the node that is referenced in the CR is made available for new workloads.

[NOTE]
====
Using a `NodeMaintenance` CR for node maintenance tasks achieves the same results as the `oc adm cordon` and `oc adm drain` commands using standard {product-title} CR processing.
