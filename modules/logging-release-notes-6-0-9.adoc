== Bug fixes

* Before this update, merging data from the `message` field into the root of a Syslog log event caused  inconsistencies with the ViaQ data model. These inconsistencies could overwrite system information, duplicate data, or corrupt the log event. This update makes Syslog parsing and merging consistent with the other output types and resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7183[LOG-7183])

* Before this update, log forwarding failed when the cluster-wide proxy configuration included a URL with a username containing an encoded `@` symbol; for example, `user%40name`. This update adds the correct support for URL-encoded values in proxy configurations and resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7186[LOG-7186])
