= How to plan your environment according to cluster limits

[IMPORTANT]
====
Oversubscribing the physical resources on a node affects resource guarantees the
Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod placement. Learn what measures you can
take to avoid memory swapping.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some of the limits are stretched only in a single dimension. They will vary
when many objects are running on the cluster.
====

While planning your environment, determine how many pods are expected to fit per
node:

----
Maximum Pods per Cluster / Expected Pods per Node = Total Number of Nodes
----

The number of pods expected to fit on a node is dependent on the application
itself. Consider the application's memory, CPU, and storage requirements.

.Example scenario

If you want to scope your cluster for 2200 pods per cluster, you would need at
least nine nodes, assuming that there are 250 maximum pods per node:

----
2200 / 250 = 8.8
----

If you increase the number of nodes to 20, then the pod distribution changes to
110 pods per node:

----
2200 / 20 = 110
----
