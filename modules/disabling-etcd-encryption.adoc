= Disabling etcd encryption

You can disable encryption of etcd data in your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Modify the API server object:
+
----
$ oc edit apiserver
----

. Set the `encryption` field type to `identity`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  encryption:
    type: identity <1>
----
<1> The `identity` type is the default value and means that no encryption is performed.

. Save the file to apply the changes.
+
The decryption process starts. It can take 20 minutes or longer for this process to complete, depending on the size of your cluster.

. Verify that etcd decryption was successful.

.. Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the OpenShift API server to verify that its resources were successfully decrypted:
+
----
$ oc get openshiftapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
----
+
The output shows `DecryptionCompleted` upon successful decryption:
+
----
DecryptionCompleted
Encryption mode set to identity and everything is decrypted
----
+
If the output shows `DecryptionInProgress`, this means that decryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

.. Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the Kubernetes API server to verify that its resources were successfully decrypted:
+
----
$ oc get kubeapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
----
+
The output shows `DecryptionCompleted` upon successful decryption:
+
----
DecryptionCompleted
Encryption mode set to identity and everything is decrypted
----
+
If the output shows `DecryptionInProgress`, this means that decryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.
