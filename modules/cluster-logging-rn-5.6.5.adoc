== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the template definitions prevented Elasticsearch from indexing some labels and namespace_labels, causing issues with data ingestion. With this update, the fix replaces dots and slashes in labels to ensure proper ingestion, effectively resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3419[LOG-3419])

* Before this update, if the Logs page of the OpenShift Web Console failed to connect to the LokiStack, a generic error message was displayed, providing no additional context or troubleshooting suggestions. With this update, the error message has been enhanced to include more specific details and recommendations for troubleshooting. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3750[LOG-3750])

* Before this update, time range formats were not validated, leading to errors selecting a custom date range. With this update, time formats are now validated, enabling users to select a valid range. If an invalid time range format is selected, an error message is displayed to the user. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3583[LOG-3583])

* Before this update, when searching logs in Loki, even if the length of an expression did not exceed 5120 characters, the query would fail in many cases. With this update, query authorization label matchers have been optimized, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3480[LOG-3480])

* Before this update, the Loki Operator failed to produce a memberlist configuration that was sufficient for locating all the components when using a memberlist for private IPs. With this update, the fix ensures that the generated configuration includes the advertised port, allowing for successful lookup of all components.
