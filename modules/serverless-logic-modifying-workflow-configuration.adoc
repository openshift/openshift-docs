= Modifying workflow configuration

The {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} decides the workflow configuration based on two `ConfigMaps` for each workflow: a workflow for `user-defined` properties and a workflow for Operator `managed-properties`: 

* *User-defined properties:* if your workflow requires particular configurations, ensure that you create a `ConfigMap` named `<workflow-name>-props` that includes all the configurations before workflow deployment. For example, if your workflow name is `greeting`, the `ConfigMap` name is `greeting-managed-props`. If such `ConfigMap` does not exists, the Operator creates the workflow to have empty or default content.

* *Managed properties:* automatically generated by the Operator and stored in a `ConfigMap` named `<workflow-name>-managed-props`. These properties are typically related to configurations for the workflow. The properties connect to supporting services, the eventing system, and so on.

[NOTE]
====
Managed properties always override user-defined properties with the same key. These managed properties are read-only and reset by the Operator during each reconciliation cycle.
====

.Prerequisites 

* You have {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} installed on your cluster.
* You have created your {ServerlessLogicProductName} project. 
* You have access to a {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have previously created the workflow `user-defined` properties `ConfigMap`, or the Operator has created it.

.Procedure

. Open your terminal and access the {ServerlessLogicProductName} project. Ensure that you are working within the correct project, `namespace`, where your workflow service is deployed.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project <your-project-name>
----

. Identify the name of the workflow you want to configure. 
+ 
For example, if your workflow is named `greeting`, the user-defined properties are stored in a `ConfigMap` named `greeting-props`.

. Edit the workflow `ConfigMap` by executing the following example command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configmap greeting-props
----
+
Replace `greeting` with the actual name of your workflow.

. Modify the `application.properties` section.
+
Locate the `data` section and update the `application.properties` field with your desired configuration.
+
.Example of `ConfigMap`

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    app: greeting
  name: greeting-props
  namespace: default
data:
  application.properties: |
    my.properties.key = any-value
  ...
----

. After updating the properties, save the file and exit the editor. The updated configuration will be applied automatically.

[NOTE]
====
The workflow runtime is based on Quarkus, so all the keys under `application.properties` must follow Quarkus property syntax. If the format is invalid, the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} might overwrite your changes with default values during the next reconciliation cycle.
====

.Verification 

* To confirm that your changes are applied successfully, execute the following example command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap greeting-props -o yaml
----
