= Minimum scale bounds

The minimum number of replicas that can serve an application is determined by the `minScale` annotation.

The `minScale` value defaults to `0` replicas if the following conditions are met:

* The `minScale` annotation is not set
* Scaling to zero is enabled
* The class `KPA` is used

If scale to zero is not enabled, the `minScale` value defaults to `1`.
