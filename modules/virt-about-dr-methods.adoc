= About disaster recovery methods

For an overview of disaster recovery (DR) concepts, architecture, and planning considerations, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7041594[Red Hat {VirtProductName} disaster recovery guide] in the Red Hat Knowledgebase.

The two primary DR methods for {VirtProductName} are Metropolitan Disaster Recovery (Metro-DR) and Regional-DR.

Metro-DR::

Metro-DR uses synchronous replication. It writes to storage at both the primary and secondary sites so that the data is always synchronized between sites. Because the storage provider is responsible for ensuring that the synchronization succeeds, the environment must meet the throughput and latency requirements of the storage provider.

Regional-DR::

Regional-DR uses asynchronous replication. The data in the primary site is synchronized with the secondary site at regular intervals. For this type of replication, you can have a higher latency connection between the primary and secondary sites.

== Metro-DR for {rh-storage-first}

{VirtProductName} supports the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.14/html-single/configuring_openshift_data_foundation_disaster_recovery_for_openshift_workloads/index#metro-dr-solution[Metro-DR solution for {rh-storage}], which provides two-way synchronous data replication between managed {VirtProductName} clusters installed on primary and secondary sites. This solution combines {rh-rhacm-first}, Red Hat Ceph Storage, and {rh-storage} components.

Use this solution during a site disaster to fail applications from the primary to the secondary site, and to relocate the application back to the primary site after restoring the disaster site. 

This synchronous solution is only available to metropolitan distance data centers with a 10 millisecond latency or less.
