=== WMCO kubelet configuration changes 

With this release, the WMCO now sets the following values in the `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR):

* The `system-reserved` parameter on new Windows nodes is now set to 2GiB of memory for system processes by default, as recommended in the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/windows-resource-management/#resource-reservation[Kubernetes documentation]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WINC-1373[WINC-1373])
* The `enforceNodeAllocatable` on new Windows nodes is now set to `none` by default. Previously, the value was set to `[]` to avoid a known issue. Both settings disable the enforcement of node allocatable resource limits. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WINC-926[WINC-926]) 
* The `evictionHard` parameters, `imagefs.available` and `nodefs.available`, are now set to `15%` and `10%` respectively by default, as recommended in the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/node-pressure-eviction/#eviction-signals[Kubernetes documentation]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WINC-1374[WINC-1374])

The `KubeletConfig` object configures the kubelet service, which runs on each node in the cluster to ensure that containers in a pod are running.

[id="wmco-10-19-0-new-features-ec2launch_{context}"]
=== WMCO kubelet configuration changes 

For disconnected clusters, the Windows AMI that you are using must have the EC2LaunchV2 agent version 2.0.2107 or later installed. Previously, the minimum required EC2LaunchV2 agent version was 2.0.1643. For more information, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2launch-v2-install.html[Install the latest version of EC2Launch v2] in the AWS documentation.

[id="wmco-10-19-0-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes

* Previously, when using the `optional_namespaces` parameter in an `ImageTagMirrorSet` CR, Windows nodes could fail to pull the specified image, resulting in a image not found error. With this fix, the `optional_namespace` parameter works as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-47696[OCPBUGS-47696])

* Previously, Windows Server 2019 nodes did not have a running an SSH server because of network instability. As a result, you were unable to SSH into that node. With this fix, the WMCO installs the SSH server node creation. As a result, you can SSH into the Windows nodes as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56131[OCPBUGS-56131])

* Previously, because an `Endpoint_IP` variable was not resolving, the Windows Instance Config Daemon (WICD) repeatedly reported an `Endpoint_IP` error. This fix adds retries to ensure that the `Endpoint_IP` is created before continuing. As a result, the error message is no longer reported. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1721[OCPBUGS-1721])

[id="wmco-10-19-0-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues 

* Some Windows 2019 Bring-Your-Own-Host (BYOH) Window instances could enter a non-ready state after upgrading to 4.19. Red{nbsp}Hat has not been able to reproduce the issue outside the testing environment, and advises caution when upgrading. If you experience this situation, restart the non-ready instance. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-47696[OCPBUGS-47696])
