[id="improving-network-traffic-performance-using-vf_{context}"]
= Improving network traffic performance using a virtual function

Follow this procedure to assign a virtual function to the OVN-Kubernetes management port and increase its network traffic performance.

This procedure results in the creation of two pools: the first has a virtual function used by OVN-Kubernetes, and the second comprises the remaining virtual functions.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Add the `network.operator.openshift.io/smart-nic` label to each worker node with a SmartNIC present by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node-name> network.operator.openshift.io/smart-nic=
----
+
Use the `oc get nodes` command to get a list of the available nodes.

. Create a policy named `sriov-node-mgmt-vf-policy.yaml` for the management port with content such as the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: sriov-node-mgmt-vf-policy
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  deviceType: netdevice
  eSwitchMode: "switchdev"
  nicSelector:
    deviceID: "1019"
    rootDevices:
    - 0000:d8:00.0
    vendor: "15b3"
    pfNames:
    - ens8f0#0-0 <.>
  nodeSelector:
    network.operator.openshift.io/smart-nic: ""
  numVfs: 6 <.>
  priority: 5
  resourceName: mgmtvf
----
<.> Replace this device with the appropriate network device for your use case. The `#0-0` part of the `pfNames` value reserves a single virtual function used by OVN-Kubernetes.
<.> The value provided here is an example. Replace this value with one that meets your requirements. For more information, see _SR-IOV network node configuration object_ in the _Additional resources_ section.

. Create a policy named `sriov-node-policy.yaml` with content such as the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: sriov-node-policy
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  deviceType: netdevice
  eSwitchMode: "switchdev"
  nicSelector:
    deviceID: "1019"
    rootDevices:
    - 0000:d8:00.0
    vendor: "15b3"
    pfNames:
    - ens8f0#1-5 <.>
  nodeSelector:
    network.operator.openshift.io/smart-nic: ""
  numVfs: 6 <.>
  priority: 5
  resourceName: mlxnics
----
<.> Replace this device with the appropriate network device for your use case.
<.> The value provided here is an example. Replace this value with the value specified in the `sriov-node-mgmt-vf-policy.yaml` file. For more information, see _SR-IOV network node configuration object_ in the _Additional resources_ section.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `sriov-node-mgmt-vf-policy.yaml` file has different values for the `pfNames` and `resourceName` keys than the `sriov-node-policy.yaml` file.
====

. Apply the configuration for both policies:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f sriov-node-policy.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f sriov-node-mgmt-vf-policy.yaml
----

. Create a Cluster Network Operator (CNO) ConfigMap in the cluster for the management configuration:

.. Create a ConfigMap named `hardware-offload-config.yaml` with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
    name: hardware-offload-config
    namespace: openshift-network-operator
data:
    mgmt-port-resource-name: openshift.io/mgmtvf
----

.. Apply the configuration for the ConfigMap:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hardware-offload-config.yaml
----
