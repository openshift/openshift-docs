= {product-title-short} policy structure

[role="_abstract"]

{product-title-short} policies are structured text objects that define security rules and the action {product-title-short} performs when these rules are broken.

//Graphic needed but currently there is no graphics support for our doc team.

An {product-title-short} policy contains the following parts:

* *Policy definition*: Specifies the policy's metadata and its rules, including the following components: 
** *Policy details*: Text to assist policy authors in managing policies and end users in the remediation process.
** *Lifecycle*: A fundamental policy attribute that determines when that policy is evaluated.
** *Policy rules*: A set of conditions that are used with an implied `OR`, for example, rule 1 _or_ rule 2. Each rule consists of predefined building blocks called policy criteria that use an `AND` relationship, for example, criterion A _and_ criterion B. {product-title-short} uses intuitive text to describe the conditions that you want, rather than having you specify potentially complex Kubernetes conditions.

Most {product-title-short} criteria configure the condition on which to trigger the policy, and many criteria include a `NOT` form. However, a few criteria are designed to define the positive, expected behavior. Whether a criteria is designed for positive or negative condition depends on the context, because they are designed to make creating policies intuitive for policy users. The following examples show negative and positive forms of policy criteria:
** Negative form: `Container Registry name is <gcr.io>` triggers if the specific `gcr.io`  registry is used. Consequently, `Container Registry name is NOT <quay.io>` triggers if any registry is used other than the allowed one registry, quay.io. This is a generalized rule.
** Negative form: `Liveness probe is <Not Defined>` triggers if a liveness probe is missing from the configuration. `Liveness probe is <Defined>` can be used to receive a positive indication by using a notifier for all compliant workloads. 
** Positive form: The `Drop capabilities, Capabilities that MUST be dropped: <SYS_ADMIN>` rule defines the expected behavior. If a workload fails to drop the `SYS_ADMIN` property, it violates the policy and triggers a violation alert.
* *Policy behavior*: Specifies the action, inform or enforce, that {product-title-short} takes for a given scope.
** *Scope*: By default, {product-title-short} policies are _global_; they apply across all secured clusters, on all namespaces, for all workloads and images. The policy scope can be modified by explicitly including or excluding a mix of cluster, namespace, and deployment selection criteria. Policy scopes can use regular expression to select a namespace name, namespace label, or a deployment name or deployment label, whihc automatically applies across all clusters, including new ones.  
** *Action*: This section determines if a policy is active, for example, enabled or disabled, whether it is enforced, and which notifiers to use for routing alerts.
