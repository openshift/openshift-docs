= Creating automated etcd backups

The automated backup feature for etcd supports both recurring and single backups. Recurring backups create a cron job that starts a single backup each time the job triggers.

:FeatureName: Automating etcd backups
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

Follow these steps to enable automated backups for etcd.

[WARNING]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on your cluster prevents minor version updates. The `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set cannot be disabled. Do not enable this feature set on production clusters.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR) file named `enable-tech-preview-no-upgrade.yaml` with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade
----

. Apply the CR and enable automated backups:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f enable-tech-preview-no-upgrade.yaml
----

. It takes time to enable the related APIs. Verify the creation of the custom resource definition (CRD) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get crd | grep backup
----
+
.Example output
