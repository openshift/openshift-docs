= Creating automated etcd backups

The automated backup feature for etcd supports both recurring and single backups. Recurring backups create a cron job that starts a single backup each time the job triggers.

[id="enabling-automated-etcd-backups_{context}"]
== Enabling automated etcd backups

Follow these steps to enable automated backups for etcd.

[WARNING]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on your cluster prevents minor version updates. The `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set cannot be disabled. Do not enable this feature set on production clusters.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR) file named `enable-tech-preview-no-upgrade.yaml` with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade
----

. Apply the CR and enable automated backups:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f enable-tech-preview-no-upgrade.yaml
----

. It takes time to enable the related APIs. Verify the creation of the custom resource definition (CRD) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get crd | grep backup
----
+

[id="creating-single-etcd-backup_{context}"]
== Creating a single etcd backup

Follow these steps to create a single etcd backup by creating and applying a custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have a PVC to save backup data to.

.Procedure

. Create a CR file named `etcd-single-backup.yaml` with contents such as the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: EtcdBackup
metadata:
  name: etcd-single-backup
  namespace: openshift-etcd
spec:
  pvcName: etcd-backup-pvc <1>
----
<1> The name of the persistent volume claim (PVC) to save the backup to. Adjust this value according to your environment.

. Apply the CR to start a single backup:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f etcd-single-backup.yaml
----

[id="creating-recurring-etcd-backups_{context}"]
== Creating recurring etcd backups

Follow these steps to create automated recurring backups of etcd.

Use dynamically-provisioned storage to keep the created etcd backup data in a safe, external location if possible. If dynamically-provisioned storage is not available, consider storing the backup data on an NFS share to make backup recovery more accessible.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. If dynamically-provisioned storage is available, complete the following steps to create automated recurring backups:

.. Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) named `etcd-backup-pvc.yaml` with contents such as the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: etcd-backup-pvc
  namespace: openshift-etcd
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 200Gi <1>
  storageClassName: standard-csi <2>
  volumeMode: Filesystem
----
<1> The amount of storage available to the PVC. Adjust this value for your requirements.
<2> The name of the `StorageClass` required by the claim. Adjust this value according to your environment.
+
[NOTE]
====
Each of the following providers require changes to the `accessModes` and `storageClassName` keys:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Provider|`accessModes` value|`storageClassName` value

|AWS with the `versioned-installer-efc_operator-ci` profile
|`- ReadWriteMany`
|`efs-sc`

|Google Cloud Platform
|`- ReadWriteMany`
|`filestore-csi`

|Microsoft Azure
|`- ReadWriteMany`
|`azurefile-csi`
|===
====

.. Apply the PVC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f etcd-backup-pvc.yaml
----

.. Verify the creation of the PVC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pvc
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME              STATUS    VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
etcd-backup-pvc   Pending                                      standard-csi   51s
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Dynamic PVCs stay in the `Pending` state until they are mounted.
====

. If dynamically-provisioned storage is unavailable, create a local storage PVC by completing the following steps:
+
[WARNING]
====
If you delete or otherwise lose access to the node that contains the stored backup data, you can lose data.
====

.. Create a `StorageClass` CR file named `etcd-backup-local-storage.yaml` with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: etcd-backup-local-storage
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
----

.. Apply the `StorageClass` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f etcd-backup-local-storage.yaml
----

.. Create a PV named `etcd-backup-pv-fs.yaml` from the applied `StorageClass` with content such as the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: etcd-backup-pv-fs
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 100Gi <1>
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
  storageClassName: local-storage
  local:
    path: /mnt/
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values:
          - <example-master-node> <2>
----
<1> The amount of storage available to the PV. Adjust this value for your requirements.
<2> Replace this value with the node to attach this PV to.
+
[TIP]
====
Run the following command to list the available nodes:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
====

.. Verify the creation of the PV by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pv
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                    CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS      CLAIM   STORAGECLASS    REASON   AGE

----

.. Create a PVC named `etcd-backup-pvc.yaml` with contents such as the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: etcd-backup-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi <1>
  storageClassName: local-storage
----
<1> The amount of storage available to the PVC. Adjust this value for your requirements.

.. Apply the PVC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f etcd-backup-pvc.yaml
----

. Create a custom resource definition (CRD) file named `etcd-recurring-backups.yaml`. The contents of the created CRD define the schedule and retention type of automated backups.
+
For the default retention type of `RetentionNumber` with 15 retained backups, use contents such as the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: etcd-recurring-backup
spec:
  etcd:
    schedule: "20 4 * * *" <1>
    timeZone: "UTC"
    pvcName: etcd-backup-pvc
----
<1> The `CronTab` schedule for recurring backups. Adjust this value for your needs.
+
To use retention based on the maximum number of backups, add the following key-value pairs to the `etcd` key:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  etcd:
    retentionPolicy:
      retentionType: RetentionNumber <1>
      retentionNumber:
        maxNumberOfBackups: 5 <2>
----
<1> The retention type. Defaults to `RetentionNumber` if unspecified.
<2> The maximum number of backups to retain. Adjust this value for your needs. Defaults to 15 backups if unspecified.
+
[WARNING]
====
A known issue causes the number of retained backups to be one greater than the configured value.
====
+
For retention based on the file size of backups, use the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  etcd:
    retentionPolicy:
      retentionType: RetentionSize
      retentionSize:
        maxSizeOfBackupsGb: 20 <1>
----
<1> The maximum file size of the retained backups in gigabytes. Adjust this value for your needs. Defaults to 10 GB if unspecified.
+
[WARNING]
====
A known issue causes the maximum size of retained backups to be up to 10 GB greater than the configured value.
====

. Create the cron job defined by the CRD by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f etcd-recurring-backup.yaml
----

. To find the created cron job, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cronjob -n openshift-etcd
