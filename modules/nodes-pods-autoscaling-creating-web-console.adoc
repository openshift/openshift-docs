= Creating a horizontal pod autoscaler by using the web console

From the web console, you can create a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) that specifies the minimum and maximum number of pods you want to run on a deployment. You can also define the amount of CPU or memory usage that your pods should target..

[NOTE]
====
An HPA cannot be added to deployments that are part of an Operator-backed service, Knative service, or Helm chart.
====

.Procedure

To create an HPA in the web console:

. In the *Topology* view, click the node to reveal the side pane.
. From the *Actions* drop-down list, select *Add HorizontalPodAutoscaler* to open the *Add HorizontalPodAutoscaler* form.

[NOTE]
====
If any of the values for CPU and memory usage are missing, a warning is displayed.

To edit an HPA in the web console:

. In the *Topology* view, click the node to reveal the side pane.
. From the *Actions* drop-down list, select *Edit HorizontalPodAutoscaler* to open the *Edit Horizontal Pod Autoscaler* form.
. From the *Edit Horizontal Pod Autoscaler* form, edit the minimum and maximum pod limits and the CPU and memory usage, and click *Save*.

[NOTE]
====
While creating or editing the horizontal pod autoscaler in the web console, you can switch from *Form view* to *YAML view*.
====

To remove an HPA in the web console:

. In the *Topology* view, click the node to reveal the side panel.
. From the *Actions* drop-down list, select *Remove HorizontalPodAutoscaler*.
