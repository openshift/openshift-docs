= Creating a horizontal pod autoscaler by using the web console

From the web console, you can create a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) that specifies the minimum and maximum number of pods you want to run on a `Deployment` or `DeploymentConfig` object. You can also define the amount of CPU or memory usage that your pods should target.

[NOTE]
====
An HPA cannot be added to deployments that are part of an Operator-backed service, Knative service, or Helm chart.
====

.Procedure

To create an HPA in the web console:

. In the *Topology* view, click the node to reveal the side pane.

. From the *Actions* drop-down list, select *Add HorizontalPodAutoscaler* to open the *Add HorizontalPodAutoscaler* form.

.Add HorizontalPodAutoscaler

. From the *Add HorizontalPodAutoscaler* form, define the name, minimum and maximum pod limits, the CPU and memory usage, and click *Save*.

[NOTE]
====
If any of the values for CPU and memory usage are missing, a warning is displayed.
