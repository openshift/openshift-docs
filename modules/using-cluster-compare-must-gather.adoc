= Using the cluster-compare plugin with must-gather data

You can use the `cluster-compare` plugin to compare a reference configuration with configuration custom resources (CRs) from `must-gather` data. 

Validate cluster configurations by using `must-gather` data to troubleshoot configuration issues in production environments. 

[NOTE]
====
For production environments, use the `cluster-compare` plugin with `must-gather` data only.
====

* You have access to `must-gather` data from a target cluster.

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have downloaded the `cluster-compare` plugin and included it in your `PATH` environment variable.

* You have access to a reference configuration. 

.Procedure

* Compare the `must-gather` data to a reference configuration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc cluster-compare -r <path_to_reference_config>/metadata.yaml -f "must-gather*/*/cluster-scoped-resources","must-gather*/*/namespaces" -R
----
+
** `-r` specifies a path to the `metadata.yaml` file of the reference configuration. You can specify a local directory or a URI.
** `-f` specifies the path to the `must-gather` data directory. You can specify a local directory or a URI. This example restricts the comparison to the relevant cluster configuration directories. 
** `-R` searches the target directories recursively.
+

<1> The CR under comparison. The plugin displays each CR with a difference from the corresponding template.
<2> The template matching with the CR for comparison.
<3> The output in Linux diff format shows the difference between the template and the cluster CR.
<4> After the plugin reports the line diffs for each CR, the summary of differences are reported.
<5> The number of CRs in the comparison with differences from the corresponding templates.
<6> The number of CRs represented in the reference configuration, but missing from the live cluster.
<7> The list of CRs represented in the reference configuration, but missing from the live cluster.
<8> The CRs that did not match to a corresponding template in the reference configuration.
<9> The metadata hash identifies the reference configuration.

[NOTE]
====
Get the output in the `junit` format by adding `-o junit` to the command. For example:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc cluster-compare -r <path_to_reference_config>/metadata.yaml -f "must-gather*/*/cluster-scoped-resources","must-gather*/*/namespaces" -R -o junit
----

The `junit` output includes the following result types:

* Passed results for each fully matched template.
* Failed results for differences found or missing required custom resources (CRs).
* Skipped results for differences patched using the user override mechanism.
