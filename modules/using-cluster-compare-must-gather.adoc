= Using the cluster-compare plugin with must-gather data

You can use the `cluster-compare` plugin to compare a reference configuration with configuration custom resources (CRs) from `must-gather` data. 

Validate cluster configurations by using `must-gather` data to troubleshoot configuration issues in production environments. 

[NOTE]
====
For production environments, use the `cluster-compare` plugin with `must-gather` data only.
====

* You have access to `must-gather` data from a target cluster.

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have downloaded the `cluster-compare` plugin and included it in your `PATH` environment variable.

* You have access to a reference configuration. 

.Procedure

* Compare the `must-gather` data to a reference configuration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc cluster-compare -r <path_to_reference_config>/metadata.yaml -f "must-gather*/*/cluster-scoped-resources","must-gather*/*/namespaces" -R
----
+
** `-r` specifies a path to the `metadata.yaml` file of the reference configuration. You can specify a local directory or a URI.
** `-f` specifies the path to the `must-gather` data directory. You can specify a local directory or a URI. This example restricts the comparison to the relevant cluster configuration directories. 
** `-R` searches the target directories recursively.
+
