= Load balancing for A/B testing

The user sets up a route with multiple services. Each service handles a version
of the application.

Each service is assigned a `weight` and the portion of requests to each service
is the `service_weight` divided by the `sum_of_weights`. The `weight` for each
service is distributed to the service's endpoints so that the sum of the
endpoint `weights` is the service `weight`.

The route can have up to four services. The `weight` for the service can be
between `0` and `256`. When the `weight` is `0`, the service does not participate in load-balancing
but continues to serve existing persistent connections. When the service `weight`
is not `0`, each endpoint has a minimum `weight` of `1`. Because of this, a
service with a lot of endpoints can end up with higher `weight` than desired.
In this case, reduce the number of pods to get the desired load balance
`weight`.

See the
xref:../../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#alternateBackends[Alternate
Backends and Weights] section for more information.

The web console allows users to set the weighting and show balance between them:

.Procedure

To set up the A/B environment:

. Create the two applications and give them different names. Each creates a
DeploymentConfig. The applications are versions of the same program; one
is usually the current production version and the other the proposed new
version.
.. Create the first application. The following example creates an application called `ab-example-a`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example --name=ab-example-a
----
+
.. Create the second application:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example --name=ab-example-b
----
+
Both applications are deployed and services are created.

. Make the application available externally via a route. At this point, you can
expose either. It can be convenient to expose the current production version
first and later modify the route to add the new version.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose svc/ab-example-a
----
+
Browse to the application at `ab-example-<project>.<router_domain>` to verify
that you see the desired version.

. When you deploy the route, the router balances the traffic according to the
`weights` specified for the services. At this point, there is a single service
with default `weight=1` so all requests go to it. Adding the other service as an
`alternateBackends` and adjusting the `weights` brings the A/B setup to
life. This can be done by the `oc set route-backends` command or by editing the
route.
+
Setting the `oc set route-backend` to `0` means the service does not participate
in load-balancing, but continues to serve existing persistent connections.
+
[NOTE]
====
Changes to the route just change the portion of traffic to the various services.
You might have to scale the DeploymentConfigs to adjust the number of pods
to handle the anticipated loads.
====
+
To edit the route, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit route <route_name>
----
+

== Managing weights of an existing route using the web console

.Procedure

. Navigate to the *Networking* -> *Routes* page.

. Click the Actions menu {kebab} next to the Route you want to edit and select *Edit Route*.

. Edit the YAML file. Update the `weight` to be an integer between `0` and `256` that specifies the relative weight of the target against other target reference objects. The value `0` suppresses requests to this back end. The default is `100`. Run `oc explain routes.spec.alternateBackends` for more information about the options.

. Click *Save*.

[id="deployments-ab-testing-lb-web-new-route_{context}"]
== Managing weights of an new route using the web console

. Navigate to the *Networking* -> *Routes* page.

. Click *Create Route*.

. Enter the route *Name*.

. Select the *Service*.

. Click *Add Alternate Service*.

. Enter a value for *Weight* and *Alternate Service Weight*. Enter a number between `0` and `255` that depicts relative weight compared with other targets. The default is `100`.

. Select the *Target Port*.

. Click *Create*.

[id="deployments-ab-testing-lb-cli_{context}"]
== Managing weights using the CLI

.Procedure

. To manage the services and corresponding weights load balanced by the route,
use the `oc set route-backends` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set route-backends ROUTENAME \
    [--zero|--equal] [--adjust] SERVICE=WEIGHT[%] [...] [options]
----
+
For example, the following sets `ab-example-a` as the primary service with
`weight=198` and `ab-example-b` as the first alternate service with a
`weight=2`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set route-backends ab-example ab-example-a=198 ab-example-b=2
----
+
This means 99% of traffic is sent to service `ab-example-a` and 1% to
service `ab-example-b`.
+
This command does not scale the DeploymentConfigs. You might be required to do
so to have enough pods to handle the request load.

. Run the command with no flags to verify the current configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set route-backends ab-example
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                    KIND     TO           WEIGHT
routes/ab-example       Service  ab-example-a 198 (99%)
routes/ab-example       Service  ab-example-b 2   (1%)
----

. To alter the weight of an individual service relative to itself or to the
primary service, use the `--adjust` flag. Specifying a percentage adjusts the
service relative to either the primary or the first alternate (if you specify
the primary). If there are other backends, their weights are kept proportional
to the changed.
+
The following example alters the weight of `ab-example-a` and `ab-example-b` services:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set route-backends ab-example --adjust ab-example-a=200 ab-example-b=10
----
+
Alternatively, alter the weight of a service by specifying a percentage:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set route-backends ab-example --adjust ab-example-b=5%
----
+
By specifying `+` before the percentage declaration, you can adjust a weighting relative to the current setting. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set route-backends ab-example --adjust ab-example-b=+15%
----
+
The `--equal` flag sets the `weight` of all services to `100`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set route-backends ab-example --equal
----
+
The `--zero` flag sets the `weight` of all services to `0`. All requests then
return with a 503 error.
+
[NOTE]
====
Not all routers may support multiple or weighted backends.

[id="deployments-ab-one-service-multi-dc_{context}"]
== One service, multiple DeploymentConfigs

.Procedure

. Create a new application, adding a label `ab-example=true` that will be common
to all shards:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example --name=ab-example-a
----
+
The application is deployed and a service is created. This is the first shard.

. Make the application available via a route (or use the service IP directly):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose svc/ab-example-a --name=ab-example
----

. Browse to the application at `ab-example-<project>.<router_domain>` to verify
you see the `v1` image.

. Create a second shard based on the same source image and label as the first
shard, but with a different tagged version and unique environment variables:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example:v2 \
    --name=ab-example-b --labels=ab-example=true \
    SUBTITLE="shard B" COLOR="red"
----

. At this point, both sets of pods are being served under the route. However,
because both browsers (by leaving a connection open) and the router (by default,
through a cookie) attempt to preserve your connection to a back-end server,
you might not see both shards being returned to you.
+
To force your browser to one or the other shard:

.. Use the `oc scale` command to reduce replicas of `ab-example-a` to `0`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale dc/ab-example-a --replicas=0
----
+
Refresh your browser to show `v2` and `shard B` (in red).

.. Scale `ab-example-a` to `1` replica and `ab-example-b` to `0`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale dc/ab-example-a --replicas=1; oc scale dc/ab-example-b --replicas=0
----
+
Refresh your browser to show `v1` and `shard A` (in blue).

. If you trigger a deployment on either shard, only the pods in that shard are
affected. You can trigger a deployment by changing the `SUBTITLE` environment
variable in either DeploymentConfig:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit dc/ab-example-a
----
+
or
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit dc/ab-example-b
----
