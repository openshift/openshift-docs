= Recommended practices for scaling the cluster

When scaling up the cluster to higher node counts:

* Spread nodes across all of the available zones for higher availability.
* Scale up by no more than 25 to 50 machines at once.
* Consider creating new MachineSets in each available zone with alternative
instance types of similar size to help mitigate any periodic provider capacity
constraints. For example, on AWS, use m5.large and m5d.large.

[NOTE]
====
Cloud providers might implement a quota for API services. Therefore, gradually
scale the cluster.
====

The controller might not be able to create the machines if the replicas in the
MachineSets are set to higher numbers all at one time. The number of requests
the cloud platform, which {product-title} is deployed on top of, is able to
handle impacts the process. The controller will start to query more while trying
to create, check, and update the machines with the status. The cloud platform on
which {product-title} is deployed has API request limits and excessive queries
might lead to machine creation failures due to cloud platform limitations.
