= Additional requirements for advanced use-cases

For more advanced use-cases such as logging or metering on {product-title}, you must deploy more resources. Recommended requirements for such use-cases are 24 CPUs and 96GB of memory.

If you have high availability (HA) enabled on your cluster, this requires between 0.5 - 1.5 cores and between 200MB - 2GB of memory for each replica of the Knative Serving control plane.
HA is enabled for some Knative Serving components by default. You can disable HA by following the documentation on "Configuring high availability replicas".
