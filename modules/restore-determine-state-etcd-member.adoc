= Determining the state of the unhealthy etcd member

The steps to replace an unhealthy etcd member depend on which of the following states your etcd member is in:

* The machine is not running or the node is not ready
* The etcd pod is crashlooping

This procedure determines which state your etcd member is in. This enables you to know which procedure to follow to replace the unhealthy etcd member.

[NOTE]
====
If you are aware that the machine is not running or the node is not ready, but you expect it to return to a healthy state soon, then you do not need to perform a procedure to replace the etcd member. The etcd cluster Operator will automatically sync when the machine or node returns to a healthy state.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have identified an unhealthy etcd member.

.Procedure

. Determine if the *machine is not running*:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machines -A -ojsonpath='{range .items[*]}{@.status.nodeRef.name}{"\t"}{@.status.providerStatus.instanceState}{"\n"}' | grep -v running
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal  stopped <1>
----
<1> This output lists the node and the status of the node's machine. If the status is anything other than `running`, then the *machine is not running*.
+
// TODO: xref
If the *machine is not running*, then follow the _Replacing an unhealthy etcd member whose machine is not running or whose node is not ready_ procedure.


. Determine if the *node is not ready*.
+
If either of the following scenarios are true, then the *node is not ready*.

** If the machine is running, then check whether the node is unreachable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{range .spec.taints[*]}{.key}{" "}' | grep unreachable
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal	node-role.kubernetes.io/master node.kubernetes.io/unreachable node.kubernetes.io/unreachable <1>
----
<1> If the node is listed with an `unreachable` taint, then the *node is not ready*.

** If the node is still reachable, then check whether the node is listed as `NotReady`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master | grep "NotReady"
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
ip-10-0-131-183.ec2.internal   NotReady   master   122m   v1.23.0 <1>
----
<1> If the node is listed as `NotReady`, then the *node is not ready*.

+
// TODO: xref
If the *node is not ready*, then follow the _Replacing an unhealthy etcd member whose machine is not running or whose node is not ready_ procedure.


. Determine if the *etcd pod is crashlooping*.
+
If the machine is running and the node is ready, then check whether the etcd pod is crashlooping.

.. Verify that all control plane nodes are listed as `Ready`:

----
<1> Since this status of this pod is `Error`, then the *etcd pod is crashlooping*.

// TODO: xref
If the *etcd pod is crashlooping*, then follow the _Replacing an unhealthy etcd member whose etcd pod is crashlooping_ procedure.
