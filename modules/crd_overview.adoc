In the Kubernetes API a resource is an endpoint that stores a collection of API objects of a certain kind.
For example, the built-in pods resource contains a collection of Pod objects.

A _custom resource_ is an object that extends the Kubernetes API or allows you to
introduce your own API into a project or a cluster.

ifeval::["{context}" == "admin-guide-custom-resources"]
A _custom resource definition_ (CRD) file defines your own object kinds and lets
the API Server handle the entire lifecycle. Deploying a CRD into the cluster 
causes the Kubernetes API server to begin serving the specified custom resource.

When you create a new custom resource definition (CRD), the Kubernetes API Server
reacts by creating a new RESTful resource path, that can be accessed by an entire cluster
or a single project (namespace). As with existing built-in objects, deleting a
project deletes all custom objects in that project.

If you want to grant access to the CRD to users, use cluster role aggregation to
grant access to users with the admin, edit, or view default cluster roles. 
Cluster role aggregation allows the insertion of custom policy rules into these
cluster roles. This behavior integrates the new resource into the 
cluster's RBAC policy as if it was a built-in resource.

[NOTE]
====
While only cluster admins can create CRDs, you can create an object from a CRD 
if you have read and write permission to it.
