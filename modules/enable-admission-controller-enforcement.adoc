= Enabling admission controller enforcement during installation

[role="_abstract"]
You can enable admission controller enforcement when you install a cluster.

. When installing a cluster by using the Operator, Helm, or `roxctl` CLI methods, follow the instructions in "Installing Secured Cluster services for {product-title-short} on Red Hat OpenShift" and "Installing Secured Cluster services for {product-title-short} on other platforms" to enable admission controller enforcement during installation.
. When installing a cluster by using the legacy installation method, follow these steps:
.. In the {product-title-short} portal, select *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
.. Click *Secure a cluster* -> *Legacy installation method*. 
.. In the *Dynamic configuration (syncs with Sensor)* section, in the *Admission controller enforcement behavior* field, select *Enforce policies*.
.. Select *Next*.
.. Select *Finish*. {product-title-short} automatically synchronizes the admission controller and applies the changes.

.Verification
* The `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` Kubernetes resource contains information about enforcement configuration behavior. The configuration settings are available in the admission controller logs.
