= Upgrading the {mtc-full} on {product-title} versions 4.2 to 4.5

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You must have access to `registry.redhat.io`.
* You must have `podman` installed.

.Procedure

. Log in to `registry.redhat.io` with your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----

. Download the `operator.yml` file by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman cp $(podman create \
  registry.redhat.io/rhmtc/openshift-migration-legacy-rhel8-operator:v{mtc-version}):/operator.yml ./
----

. Replace the {mtc-full} Operator by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc replace --force -f operator.yml
----

. Scale the `migration-operator` deployment to `0` to stop the deployment by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale -n openshift-migration --replicas=0 deployment/migration-operator
----

. Scale the `migration-operator` deployment to `1` to start the deployment and apply the changes by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale -n openshift-migration --replicas=1 deployment/migration-operator
----

. Verify that the `migration-operator` was upgraded by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -o yaml -n openshift-migration get deployment/migration-operator | grep image: | awk -F ":" '{ print $NF }'
----

. Download the `controller.yml` file by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman cp $(podman create \
  registry.redhat.io/rhmtc/openshift-migration-legacy-rhel8-operator:v{mtc-version}):/controller.yml ./
----

. Create the `migration-controller` object by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f controller.yml
----

ifdef::upgrading-3-4[]
. If you have previously added the {product-title} 3 cluster to the {mtc-short} web console, you must update the service account token in the web console because the upgrade process deletes and restores the `openshift-migration` namespace:

.. Obtain the service account token by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc sa get-token migration-controller -n openshift-migration
----

.. In the {mtc-short} web console, click *Clusters*.
.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the cluster and select *Edit*.
.. Enter the new service account token in the *Service account token* field.
.. Click *Update cluster* and then click *Close*.
endif::[]

. Verify that the {mtc-short} pods are running by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-migration
----
