[id="olmv1-version-range-support_{context}"]
= Support for version ranges

In {olmv1-first}, you can specify a version range by using a comparison string in an Operator or extension's custom resource (CR). If you specify a version range in the CR, {olmv1} installs or updates to the latest version of the Operator that can be resolved within the version range.

.Resolved version workflow
* The resolved version is the latest version of the Operator that satisfies the constraints of the Operator and the environment.
* An Operator update within the specified range is automatically installed if it is resolved successfully.
* An update is not installed if it is outside of the specified range or if it cannot be resolved successfully.
