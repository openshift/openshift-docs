New in this release::
* No RDS updates in this release

Description::
+
--
The SiteConfig Operator is a template-driven solution designed to provision clusters through various installation methods.
It introduces the unified `ClusterInstance` API, which replaces the deprecated `SiteConfig` API.
By leveraging the `ClusterInstance` API, the SiteConfig Operator improves cluster provisioning by providing the following:

* Better isolation of definitions from installation methods
* Unification of Git and non-Git workflows
* Consistent APIs across installation methods
* Enhanced scalability
* Increased flexibility with custom installation templates
* Valuable insights for troubleshooting deployment issues

The SiteConfig Operator provides validated default installation templates to facilitate cluster deployment through both the Assisted Installer and Image-based Installer provisioning methods:

* **Assisted Installer** automates the deployment of {product-title} clusters by leveraging predefined configurations and validated host setups.
It ensures that the target infrastructure meets {product-title} requirements.
The Assisted Installer streamlines the installation process while minimizing time and complexity compared to manual setup.

* **Image-based Installer** expedites the deployment of {sno} clusters by utilizing preconfigured and validated {product-title} seed images.
Seed images are preinstalled on target hosts, enabling rapid reconfiguration and deployment.
The Image-based Installer is particularly well-suited for remote or disconnected environments, because it simplifies the cluster creation process and significantly reduces deployment time.

Limits and requirements::
* A single hub cluster supports up to 3500 deployed {sno} clusters.
