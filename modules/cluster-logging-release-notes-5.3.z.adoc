This release includes link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0044[RHSA-2022:0044 OpenShift Logging Bug Fix Release 5.3.2]

[id="openshift-logging-5-3-2-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes
* Before this update, Elasticsearch rejected logs from the Event Router due to a parsing error. This update changes the data model to resolve the parsing error. However, as a result, previous indices might cause warnings or errors within Kibana. The `kubernetes.event.metadata.resourceVersion` field causes errors until existing indices are removed or reindexed. If this field is not used in Kibana, you can ignore the error messages. If you have a retention policy that deletes old indices, the policy eventually removes the old indices and stops the error messages. Otherwise, manually reindex to stop the error messages. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2087[LOG-2087])

* Before this update, the OpenShift Logging Dashboard displayed the wrong pod namespace in the table that displays top producing and collected containers over the last 24 hours. With this update, the OpenShift Logging Dashboard displays the correct pod namespace. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2051[LOG-2051])

* Before this update, any situation with Elasticsearch OutputDefault defined for cluster logforwarding and Elasticsearch outputs did not have structured keys, the configuration was replacing the output secret with the default secret used to communicate to the default log store. With this update, the defined output secret is correctly used.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2046[LOG-2046])

== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the Fluentd container image included builder tools that were unnecessary at run time. This update removes those tools from the image. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1998[LOG-1998])

* Before this update, the Logging dashboard displayed an empty CPU graph because of a reference to an invalid metric. With this update, the Logging dashboard displays CPU graphs correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1925[LOG-1925])

* Before this update, the Elasticsearch Prometheus exporter plugin compiled index-level metrics using a high-cost query that impacted the Elasticsearch node performance. This update implements a lower-cost query that improves performance. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1897[LOG-1897])
