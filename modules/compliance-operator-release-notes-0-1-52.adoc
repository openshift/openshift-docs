* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:4657[RHBA-2022:4657 - OpenShift Compliance Operator bug fix update]

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-52-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

* The FedRAMP high SCAP profile is now available for use in {product-title} environments. For more information, See xref:../../security/compliance_operator/co-scans/compliance-operator-supported-profiles.adoc#compliance-operator-supported-profiles[Supported compliance profiles].

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-52-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `OpenScap` container would crash due to a mount permission issue in a security environment where `DAC_OVERRIDE` capability is dropped. Now, executable mount permissions are applied to all users. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082151[*BZ#2082151*])

* Previously, the compliance rule `ocp4-configure-network-policies` could be configured as `MANUAL`. Now, compliance rule `ocp4-configure-network-policies` is set to `AUTOMATIC`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2072431[*BZ#2072431*])

* Previously, the Cluster Autoscaler would fail to scale down because the Compliance Operator scan pods were never removed after a scan. Now, the pods are removed from each node by default unless explicitly saved for debugging purposes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2075029[*BZ#2075029*])

* Previously, applying the Compliance Operator to the `KubeletConfig` would result in the node going into a `NotReady` state due to unpausing the Machine Config Pools too early. Now, the Machine Config Pools are unpaused appropriately and the node operates correctly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2071854[*BZ#2071854*])

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator used `base64` instead of `url-encoded` code in the latest release, causing Compliance Operator remediation to fail. Now, the Compliance Operator checks encoding to handle both `base64` and `url-encoded` Machine Config code and the remediation applies correctly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082431[*BZ#2082431*])

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-52-known-issue"]
== Known issue

* When `"debug":true` is set within the `ScanSettingBinding` object, the pods generated by the `ScanSettingBinding` object are not removed when that binding is deleted. As a workaround, run the following command to delete the remaining pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pods -l compliance.openshift.io/scan-name=ocp4-cis
----
+
