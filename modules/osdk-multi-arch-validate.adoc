= Validating your Operator's multi-platform readiness

You can validate your Operator's multi-platform readiness by running the `bundle validate` command. The command verifies that your Operator project meets the following conditions:

* Your Operator's manager image supports the platforms labeled in the cluster service version (CSV) file.
* Your Operator's CSV has labels for the supported platforms for Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and OperatorHub.

.Procedure

* Run the following command to validate your Operator project for multiple architecture readiness:

$ operator-sdk bundle validate ./bundle \

WARN[0014] Warning: Value test-operator.v0.0.1: check if the CSV is missing the label (operatorframework.io/arch.<value>) for the Arch(s): ["amd64" "arm64" "ppc64le" "s390x"]. Be aware that your Operator manager image ["quay.io/example-org/test-operator:v1alpha1"] provides this support. Thus, it is very likely that you want to provide it and if you support more than amd64 architectures, you MUST,use the required labels for all which are supported.Otherwise, your solution cannot be listed on the cluster for these architectures
