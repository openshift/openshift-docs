= Creating and booting the agent image

Use this procedure to boot the agent image on your machines.

.Procedure

. Create the agent image by running the following command:

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install --dir <install_directory> agent create image
----
+
NOTE: Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) supports multipathing on the primary disk, allowing stronger resilience to hardware failure to achieve higher host availability. Multipathing is enabled by default in the agent ISO image, with a default `/etc/multipath.conf` configuration.

. Boot the `agent.x86_64.iso` or `agent.aarch64.iso` image on the bare metal machines.
