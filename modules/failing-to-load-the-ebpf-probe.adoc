= Failing to load the eBPF probe

Before Collector starts, it loads the eBPF probe; however, in rare cases, you might encounter issues where Collector cannot load the eBPF probe, which results in various error messages or exceptions. In such cases, you must check the logs to identify the problems with failure in loading the eBPF probe.

Consider the following Collector log:

[source,terminal]
----
[...]
[INFO    2025/07/24 10:26:37] Trying to open the right engine!
[INFO    2025/07/24 10:26:41] libbpf: prog 'execve_x': -- BEGIN PROG LOAD LOG --
[...]
-- END PROG LOAD LOG --
[INFO    2025/07/24 10:26:41] libbpf: prog 'execve_x': failed to load: -7
[INFO    2025/07/24 10:26:41] libbpf: failed to load object 'bpf_probe'
[INFO    2025/07/24 10:26:41] libbpf: failed to load BPF skeleton 'bpf_probe': -7
[INFO    2025/07/24 10:26:41] libpman: failed to load BPF object (errno: 7 | message: Argument list too long)

If you encounter this kind of error, you must report it to {product-title} ({product-title-short}) support team or create an issue in the `stackrox/collector` GitHub repository.
