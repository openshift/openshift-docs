= Failing to load the eBPF probe

Before Collector starts, it loads the eBPF probe; however, in rare cases, you might encounter issues where Collector cannot load the eBPF probe, which results in various error messages or exceptions. In such cases, you must check the logs to identify the problems with failure in loading the eBPF probe.

Consider the following Collector log:
