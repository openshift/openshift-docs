= Creating more {op-system-first} machines using an ISO image

You can create more compute machines for your bare metal cluster by using an
ISO image to create the machines.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your
cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.
* Obtain the URL of the BIOS or UEFI {op-system} image file that you uploaded
to your HTTP server during cluster installation.

.Procedure

. Use the ISO file to install {op-system} on more compute machines. Use the same
method that you used when you created machines before you installed the cluster:
** Burn the ISO image to a disk and boot it directly.
** Use ISO redirection with a LOM interface.

. After the instance boots, press the `TAB` or `E` key to edit the kernel command line.
. Add the parameters to the kernel command line:

----
coreos.inst=yes
coreos.inst.install_dev=sda <1>
coreos.inst.image_url=<bare_metal_image_URL> <2>
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://example.com/worker.ign <3>
----
<1> Specify the block device of the system to install to.
<2> Specify the URL of the UEFI or BIOS image that you uploaded to your server.
<3> Specify the URL of the compute Ignition config file. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.

. Press `Enter` to complete the installation. After {op-system} installs, the system
reboots. After the system reboots, it applies the Ignition config file that you
specified.

. Continue to create more compute machines for your cluster.
