= Windows Machine Config Operator upgrades

When a new version of the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) is released that is compatible with the current cluster version, the Operator is upgraded based on the upgrade channel and subscription approval strategy it was installed with when using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). The WMCO upgrade results in the Kubernetes components in the Windows machine being upgraded.

[NOTE]
====
If you are upgrading to a new version of the WMCO and want to use cluster monitoring, you must have the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true` label present in the WMCO namespace. If you add the label to a pre-existing WMCO namespace, and there are already Windows nodes configured, restart the WMCO pod to allow monitoring graphs to display.
====

For a non-disruptive upgrade, the WMCO terminates the Windows machines configured by the previous version of the WMCO and recreates them using the current version. This is done by deleting the `Machine` object, which results in the drain and deletion of the Windows node. To facilitate an upgrade, the WMCO adds a version annotation to all the configured nodes. During an upgrade, a mismatch in version annotation results in the deletion and recreation of a Windows machine. To have minimal service disruptions during an upgrade, the WMCO only updates one Windows machine at a time.

After the update, it is recommended that you set the `spec.os.name.windows` parameter in your workload pods. The WMCO uses this field to authoritatively identify the pod operating system for validation and is used to enforce Windows-specific pod security context constraints (SCCs).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The WMCO is only responsible for updating Kubernetes components, not for Windows operating system updates. You provide the Windows image when creating the VMs; therefore, you are responsible for providing an updated image. You can provide an updated Windows image by changing the image configuration in the `MachineSet` spec.
