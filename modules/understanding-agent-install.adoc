= Understanding Agent installation
As a {product-title} user, you can leverage all the advantages of the Assisted Installer hosted service in disconnected environments. You can generate an ISO that contains all the technology required to run both a user friendly guided deployment and a fully automated one.
The Agent installation comprises of a bootable ISO that contains the Assisted discovery agent and the Assisted service; both are required to perform the first cluster installation.

The `openshift-install agent create` subcommand generates an ephemeral ISO that is generated based on the inputs that you provide in the following manifests:

* `ClusterImageSet`
* `ClusterDeployment`
* `pull-secret`
* `InfraEnv`
* `AgentClusterInstall`
* `NMStateConfig`

//TODO workflow diagram

You can install a disconnected {product-title} cluster through the `openshift-install agent create image` subcommand for:

* **A single-node {product-title} cluster (SNO)**: A node that is both a master and worker.
* **A three-node {product-title} cluster** : A compact cluster that has three master nodes that are also worker nodes.
* **Highly available {product-title} cluster (HA)**: Three master nodes with any number of worker nodes.

The following platforms are supported:

* none
* bare-metal
* vSphere

[id="about-static-networking"]
== About static networking

You need to provide one static IP configuration for `node0`, which is the node that runs the installation backend and will eventually be a part of `node0`.
The `NMStateConfig.yaml` file contains the network configuration for all the nodes that are going to join the cluster and is stored in a user created sub-directory named as **cluster-manifests**.
You can configue `nmstate` for one node or more by using the yaml seperator.
