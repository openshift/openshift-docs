= Understanding Agent-based Installer
As an {product-title} user, you can leverage the advantages of the Assisted Installer hosted service in disconnected environments.

The Agent-based installation comprises a bootable ISO that contains the Assisted discovery agent and the Assisted Service. Both are required to perform the cluster installation, but the latter runs on only one of the hosts.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, ISO boot support on {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) is available only for {op-system-base-full} KVM, which provides the flexibility to choose either PXE or ISO-based installation. For installations with z/VM and Logical Partition (LPAR), only PXE boot is supported.
====

The `openshift-install agent create image` subcommand generates an ephemeral ISO based on the inputs that you provide. You can choose to provide inputs through the following manifests:

Preferred:

* `install-config.yaml`
* `agent-config.yaml`

Optional: ZTP manifests

* `cluster-manifests/cluster-deployment.yaml`
* `cluster-manifests/agent-cluster-install.yaml`
* `cluster-manifests/pull-secret.yaml`
* `cluster-manifests/infraenv.yaml`
* `cluster-manifests/cluster-image-set.yaml`
* `cluster-manifests/nmstateconfig.yaml`
* `mirror/registries.conf`
* `mirror/ca-bundle.crt`

== Agent-based Installer workflow
One of the control plane hosts runs the Assisted Service at the start of the boot process and eventually becomes the bootstrap host. This node is called the *rendezvous host* (node 0).
The Assisted Service ensures that all the hosts meet the requirements and triggers an {product-title} cluster deployment. All the nodes have the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image written to the disk. The non-bootstrap nodes reboot and initiate a cluster deployment.
Once the nodes are rebooted, the rendezvous host reboots and joins the cluster. The bootstrapping is complete and the cluster is deployed.

You can install a disconnected {product-title} cluster through the `openshift-install agent create image` subcommand for the following topologies:

* **A single-node {product-title} cluster (SNO)**: A node that is both a master and worker.
* **A three-node {product-title} cluster** : A compact cluster that has three master nodes that are also worker nodes.
* **Highly available {product-title} cluster (HA)**: Three master nodes with any number of worker nodes.

== Recommended resources for topologies

Recommended cluster resources for the following topologies:

.Recommended cluster resources
[options="header"]
|====
|Topology|Number of control plane nodes|Number of compute nodes|vCPU|Memory|Storage
|Single-node cluster|1|0|8 vCPU cores|16 GB of RAM| 120 GB
|Compact cluster|3|0 or 1|8 vCPU cores|16 GB of RAM|120 GB
|HA cluster|3|2 and above |8 vCPU cores|16 GB of RAM|120 GB
|====


In the `install-config.yaml`, specify the platform on which to perform the installation. The following platforms are supported:

* `baremetal`
* `vsphere`
* `none`
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For platform `none`:

* The `none` option requires the provision of DNS name resolution and load balancing infrastructure in your cluster. See _Requirements for a cluster using the platform "none" option_ in the "Additional resources" section for more information.

* Review the information in the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4207611[guidelines for deploying {product-title} on non-tested platforms] before you attempt to install an {product-title} cluster in virtualized or cloud environments.
