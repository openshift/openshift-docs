= Understanding Agent-based Installer
As a {product-title} user, you can leverage all the advantages of the Assisted Installer hosted service in disconnected environments.

The Agent installation comprises a bootable ISO that contains the Assisted discovery agent and the Assisted Service; both are required to perform the first cluster installation.

The `openshift-install agent create image` subcommand generates an ephemeral ISO based on the inputs that you provide. You can choose to provide inputs through the following manifests:

Preferred:

* `install-config.yaml`
* `agent-config.yaml`

or

Optional: ZTP manifests

* `cluster-deployment.yaml`
* `agent-cluster-install.yaml`
* `pull-secret.yaml`
* `infraenv.yaml`
* `cluster-image-set.yaml`
* `nmstateconfig.yaml`
* `registries.conf`
* `ca-bundle.crt`

== Agent-based Installer workflow
One of the control plane hosts runs the Assisted Service at the start of the boot process and eventually becomes the bootstrap host. This node is called the rendezvous host.
The Assisted Service ensures that all the hosts meet the requirements and triggers an {product-title} cluster deployment. All the nodes have the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image written to the disk. The non-bootstrap nodes reboot and initiate a cluster deployment.
Once the nodes are rebooted, the rendezvous host reboots and joins the cluster. The bootstrapping is complete and the cluster is deployed.

.Node lifecycle workflow

You can install a disconnected {product-title} cluster through the `openshift-install agent create image` subcommand for the following topologies:

* **A single-node {product-title} cluster (SNO)**: A node that is both a master and worker.
* **A three-node {product-title} cluster** : A compact cluster that has three master nodes that are also worker nodes.
* **Highly available {product-title} cluster (HA)**: Three master nodes with any number of worker nodes.

== Recommended resources for topologies

Recommended cluster resources for the following topologies:
