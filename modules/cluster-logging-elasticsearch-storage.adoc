= Configuring Elasticsearch storage

Elasticsearch requires persistent storage.  The faster the storage, the faster the Elasticsearch performance.

[WARNING]
====
Using NFS storage as a volume or a persistent volume (or via NAS such as
Gluster) is not supported for Elasticsearch storage, as Lucene relies on file
system behavior that NFS does not supply. Data corruption and other problems can
occur.
====

.Prerequisites
 
* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

.Procedure

. Edit the Cluster Logging CR to specify that each data node in the cluster is bound to a Persistent Volume Claim.

 spec:
    logStore:
      type: "elasticsearch"
      elasticsearch:
        nodeCount: 3
        storage:
          storageClassName: "gp2"
          size: "200G"

This example specifies each data node in the cluster is bound to a Persistent Volume Claim that requests "200G" of AWS General Purpose SSD (gp2) storage.
