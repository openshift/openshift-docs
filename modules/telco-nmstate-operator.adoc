= NMState Operator

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
The NMState Operator provides a Kubernetes API for performing network configurations across cluster nodes.

Limits and requirements::
Not applicable

Engineering considerations::
* The initial networking configuration is applied using `NMStateConfig` content in the installation CRs. The NMState Operator is used only when needed for network updates.
* When SR-IOV virtual functions are used for host networking, the NMState Operator using `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` is used to configure those VF interfaces, for example, VLANs and the MTU.
