= Creating source-to-image build in a network restricted environment

You can create a `source-to-image` build in a network network restricted environment by mirroring the images required by `source-to-image` buildStrategy and then creating a `source-to-image` build. 

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster can connect and interact with the git source that you will use to create the source-to-image build.
* You have the builder-image required to create the `source-to-image` build in your local registry. If you do not have the builder-image in the local registry, mirror the source image. For more information on mirroring images for network restricted environment, see: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-installation-images.html


.Procedure

. Run the following command to mirror the images required by the `source-to-image` buildStrategy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror --insecure -a <registry-authentication> registry.redhat.io/source-to-image/source-to-image-rhel8@sha256:d041c1bbe503d152d0759598f79802e257816d674b342670ef61c6f9e6d401c5 <mirror-registry>/<repo>/source-to-image-source-to-image-rhel8
----

. Perform the steps mentioned in the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.1/html/work_with_builds/running-builds#ob-creating-a-s2i-build_using-builds[Creating a source-to-image build] section.
