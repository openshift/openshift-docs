= Installation scenarios

When determining whether an Operator can be installed or upgraded on a cluster,
OLM considers the following scenarios:

* A cluster administrator creates a new OperatorGroup and specifies a service
account. All Operator(s) associated with this OperatorGroup are installed and
run against the privileges granted to the service account.

* A cluster administrator creates a new OperatorGroup and does not specify any
service account. {product-title} maintains backward compatibility, so the
default behavior remains and Operator installs and upgrades are permitted.

* For existing OperatorGroups that do not specify a service account, the default
behavior remains and Operator installs and upgrades are permitted.

* A cluster administrator updates an existing OperatorGroup and specifies a
service account. OLM allows the existing Operator to continue to run with their
current privileges. When such an existing Operator is going through an upgrade,
it is reinstalled and run against the privileges granted to the service account
like any new Operator.

* A service account specified by an OperatorGroup changes by adding or removing
permissions, or the existing service account is swapped with a new one. When
existing Operators go through an upgrade, it is reinstalled and run against the
privileges granted to the updated service account like any new Operator.

* A cluster administrator removes the service account from an OperatorGroup. The
default behavior remains and Operator installs and upgrades are permitted.
