== Enhancements

The following enhancements have been made with {ols-official} 0.1.5:

* This release introduces support for Large Language Model (LLM) authentication using {azure-official} with {entra-id}.

* This release introduces the ability to attach logs on the *Details* page for the `DaemonSet`, `Deployment`, `Job`, `ReplicaSet` and `StatefulSet` resource types. When asking {ols-long} a question, attaching logs helps provide additional context so {ols-short} can provide a more refined answer. 

* When the {ols-long} Service is not running, the chat window now indicates that the Service is not ready.
