= Comparing Routes and ingress

Routes provide more flexibility and advanced features compared to ingress. This makes routes suitable for complex routing scenarios. Routes are simpler to set up and use, especially for basic external access needs. Ingress is often used for simpler, straightforward external access. Routes are used for more complex scenarios that require advanced routing and SSL/TLS termination.
