= PTP Operator

New in this release::
* A new version two of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) fast event REST API is available.
Consumer applications can now subscribe directly to the events REST API in the PTP events producer sidecar.
The PTP fast event REST API v2 is compliant with the link:https://orandownloadsweb.azurewebsites.net/download?id=344[O-RAN O-Cloud Notification API Specification for Event Consumers 3.0].
You can change the API version by setting the `ptpEventConfig.apiVersion` field in the `PtpOperatorConfig` resource.

Description::
See "Recommended {sno} cluster configuration for vDU application workloads" for details of support and configuration of PTP in cluster nodes.
The DU node can run in the following modes:
+
* As an ordinary clock (OC) synced to a grandmaster clock or boundary clock (T-BC).

* As a grandmaster clock (T-GM) synced from GPS with support for single or dual card E810 NICs.

* As dual boundary clocks (one per NIC) with support for E810 NICs.

* As a T-BC with a highly available (HA) system clock when there are multiple time sources on different NICs.

* Optional: as a boundary clock for radio units (RUs).

Limits and requirements::
* Limited to two boundary clocks for dual NIC and HA.

* Limited to two card E810 configurations for T-GM.

Engineering considerations::
* Configurations are provided for ordinary clock, boundary clock, boundary clock with highly available system clock, and grandmaster clock.

* PTP fast event notifications uses `ConfigMap` CRs to store PTP event subscriptions.

*  The PTP events REST API v2 does not have a global subscription for all lower hierarchy resources contained in the resource path.
You subscribe consumer applications to the various available event types separately.
