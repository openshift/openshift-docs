= PTP Operator

New in this release::
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-12504[Enable 2 Port Ordinary Clock Use Case for IA]
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-13189[CNF-13189: Remove the internal API and sidecar support]
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-16651[CNF-16651: 3 Card WPC T-G]

Description::
Configure PTP in cluster nodes with `PTPConfig` CRs for the RAN DU use case with features like Grandmaster clock (T-GM) support using GPS, ordinary clock (OC), boundary clocks (T-BC), dual boundary clocks, high availability (HA), and optional fast event notification over HTTP.
PTP ensures precise timing and reliability in the RAN environment.

Limits and requirements::
* Limited to two boundary clocks for nodes with dual NICs and HA
* Limited to two Westport channel NIC configurations for T-GM

Engineering considerations::
* RAN DU RDS configurations are provided for ordinary clocks, boundary clocks, grandmaster clocks, and highly available dual NIC boundary clocks.
* PTP fast event notifications use `ConfigMap` CRs to persist subscriber details.
* Hierarchical event subscription as described in the O-RAN specification is not supported for PTP events.
* The PTP fast events REST API v1 is end of life.
