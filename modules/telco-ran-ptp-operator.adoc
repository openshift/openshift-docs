= PTP Operator

New in this release::
* PTP grandmaster clock (T-GM) GPS timing with single channel Intel E810-XXV-4T Westport Channel NIC – minimum firmware version 4.30 (Technology Preview)

* PTP grandmaster clock (T-GM) GPS timing with dual channel Intel E810-XXVDA4T Westport Channel NIC – minimum firmware version 4.40 (Technology Preview)

* PTP events and metrics for grandmaster (T-GM) are new in  {product-title} {product-version} (Technology Preview)

Description::
Configure of link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-reference-cluster-configuration-for-vdu.html#ztp-sno-du-configuring-ptp_sno-configure-for-vdu[PTP timing] support for cluster nodes.
The DU node can run in the following modes:
+
* As an ordinary clock synced to a T-GM or boundary clock (T-BC)

* As dual boundary clocks, one per NIC (high availability is not supported)

* As grandmaster clock with support for E810 Westport Channel NICs (Technology Preview)

* Optionally as a boundary clock for radio units (RUs)

+
Optional: subscribe applications to PTP events that happen on the node that the application is running.
You subscribe the application to events via HTTP.

Limits and requirements::
* High availability is not supported with dual-NIC configurations.

* GPS offsets are not reported.
Use a default offset of less than or equal to 5.

* DPLL offsets are not reported.
Use a default offset of less than or equal to 5.

Engineering considerations::
* Configurations are provided for ordinary clock, boundary clock, or grandmaster clock

* PTP fast event notifications uses `ConfigMap` CRs to store PTP event subscriptions

* Use Intel E810-XXV-4T Westport Channel NICs for PTP grandmaster clocks with GPS timing, minimum firmware version 4.40
