= PTP Operator

New in this release::
* {product-title} 4.20 introduced unassisted holdover for boundary clocks and time synchronous clocks as a Technology Preview feature. This feature is now Generally Available (GA).

Description::
Configure Precision Time Protocol (PTP) in cluster nodes.
PTP ensures precise timing and reliability in the RAN environment, compared to other clock synchronization protocols, like NTP.
Support includes::
* Grandmaster clock (T-GM): use GPS to sync the local clock and provide time synchronization to other devices
* Boundary clock (T-BC): receive time from another PTP source and redistribute it to other devices
* Ordinary clock (T-TSC): synchronize the local clock from another PTP time provider

Configuration variations allow for multiple NIC configurations for greater time distribution and high availability (HA), and optional fast event notification over HTTP.

Limits and requirements::

* Supports the PTP G.8275.1 profile for the following telco use-cases:
** T-GM use-case:
*** Limited to a maximum of 3 Westport channel NICs
*** Requires GNSS input to one NIC card, with SMA connections to synchronize additional NICs
*** HA support N/A
** T-BC use-case:
*** Limited to a maximum of 2 NICs
*** System clock HA support is optional in 2-NIC configuration.
** T-TSC use-case:
*** Limited to single NIC only
*** System clock HA support is optional in active/standby 2-port configuration.
* Log reduction must be enabled with `true` or `enhanced`.

Engineering considerations::
* Example RAN DU RDS configurations are provided for:
** T-GM, T-BC, and T-TSC
** Variations with and without HA
* PTP fast event notifications use `ConfigMap` CRs to persist subscriber details.
* Hierarchical event subscription as described in the O-RAN specification is not supported for PTP events.
* Cluster Node(s) must have proper NTP configuration to ensure correct time prior to PTP operator taking ownership of node timing.
