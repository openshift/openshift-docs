= PTP Operator

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-reference-cluster-configuration-for-vdu.html#ztp-sno-du-configuring-ptp_sno-configure-for-vdu[PTP timing] for details of support and configuration of PTP in cluster nodes.
The DU node can run in the following modes:
+
* As an ordinary clock (OC) synced to a grandmaster clock or boundary clock (T-BC)

* As a grandmaster clock synced from GPS with support for single or dual card E810 Westport Channel NICs

* As dual boundary clocks (one per NIC) with support for E810 Westport Channel NICs
+
[NOTE]
====
Highly available boundary clocks are not supported.
====

* Optional: as a boundary clock for radio units (RUs)

+
--
Events and metrics for grandmaster clocks are a Tech Preview feature added in the 4.14 {rds} RDS. For more information see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/networking/ptp/using-ptp-events.html[Using the PTP hardware fast event notifications framework].

You can subscribe applications to PTP events that happen on the node where the DU application is running.

Limits and requirements::
* High availability is not supported with dual-NIC configurations.

* Digital Phase-Locked Loop (DPLL) clock synchronization is not supported for E810 Westport Channel NICs.

* GPS offsets are not reported.
Use a default offset of less than or equal to 5.

* DPLL offsets are not reported.
Use a default offset of less than or equal to 5.

Engineering considerations::
* Configurations are provided for ordinary clock, boundary clock, or grandmaster clock

* PTP fast event notifications uses `ConfigMap` CRs to store PTP event subscriptions

* Use Intel E810-XXV-4T Westport Channel NICs for PTP grandmaster clocks with GPS timing, minimum firmware version 4.40
