= Understanding {product-title} workers and masters

With installation complete, the cluster is now fully in charge of managing itself. Management of worker (compute) and master (control plane) nodes is done from within the cluster. So, before moving on to what the {product-title} cluster does to help you develop and deploy applications, you should explore how an {product-title} cluster manages itself. For that, we focus on three things; workers, masters (the control plane) and Operators.

To see which workers and masters are running on your cluster, type:

----
$ oc get nodes

NAME                                   STATUS ROLES  AGE    VERSION
ip-10-0-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal Ready  worker 4h20m  v1.23.0
ip-10-0-0-2.us-east-2.compute.internal Ready  master 4h39m  v1.23.0

ip-10-0-0-6.us-east-2.compute.internal Ready  worker 4h20m  v1.23.0

To see more information about internal and external IP addresses, the type of operating system ({op-system}), kernel version, and container runtime (CRI-O), add the `-o wide` option.

$ oc get nodes -o wide
