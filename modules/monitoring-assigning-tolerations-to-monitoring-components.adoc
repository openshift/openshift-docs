= Assigning tolerations to monitoring components

You can assign tolerations to any of the monitoring stack components to enable moving them to tainted nodes.

.Prerequisites

* *If you are configuring core {product-title} monitoring components*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the ConfigMap:
** *To assign tolerations to a component that monitors core {product-title} projects*:
.. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

.. Specify `tolerations` for the component:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      tolerations:
        <toleration_specification>
----
+
Substitute `<component>` and `<toleration_specification>` accordingly.
+
For example, `oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule` adds a taint to `node1` with the key `key1` and the value `value1`. This prevents monitoring components from deploying pods on `node1` unless a toleration is configured for that taint. The following example configures the `alertmanagerMain` component to tolerate the example taint:
+
[source,yaml,subs=quotes]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alertmanagerMain:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key1"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "value1"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
----

** *To assign tolerations to a component that monitors user-defined projects*:
.. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

.. Specify `tolerations` for the component:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      tolerations:
        <toleration_specification>
----
+
Substitute `<component>` and `<toleration_specification>` accordingly.
+
For example, `oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule` adds a taint to `node1` with the key `key1` and the value `value1`. This prevents monitoring components from deploying pods on `node1` unless a toleration is configured for that taint. The following example configures the `thanosRuler` component to tolerate the example taint:
+
[source,yaml,subs=quotes]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    thanosRuler:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key1"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "value1"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
----

. Save the file to apply the changes. The new component placement configuration is applied automatically.
+
[NOTE]
====
Configurations applied to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap are not activated unless a cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to a monitoring ConfigMap, the pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
