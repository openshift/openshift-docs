The following table lists the actions you must take for each deployment scenario during certificate authority (CA) rotation or upgrades:

.Required user actions
[cols="2,6",options="header"]
|===
|Deployment scenario |What you must do

|Operator-managed secured clusters
|No action is needed if Central is also Operator-managed. The Operator automates rotation.

|Helm-managed secured clusters
|Re-register with a new init bundle or cluster registration secret before the 5-year CA expires.

|Upgrading a Central instance older than 4 years to {rh-rhacs-first} 4.9
a|
[NOTE]
====
Central switches to certificates signed by the new CA and secured clusters older than version 4.9 cannot trust the certificates.
====

You can do any of the following tasks:

* Upgrade all secured clusters to {product-title-short} 4.9.
* Re-register any secured clusters that you cannot upgrade.

Secured clusters for {product-title-short} 4.9 and later versions automatically trust the new CA if the old CA is still valid.
