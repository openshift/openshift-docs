= TLS security and rotation in the monitoring stack

[role="_abstract"]
Learn how TLS profiles and certificate rotation work in the {product-title} monitoring stack to keep communication secure.

TLS security profiles for monitoring components::
All components of the monitoring stack use the TLS security profile settings that are centrally configured by a cluster administrator.
If you configure a monitoring stack component that uses TLS security settings, the component uses the TLS security profile settings that already exist in the `tlsSecurityProfile` field in the global {product-title} `apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster` resource.

TLS certificate rotation and automatic restarts::
The {cmo-full} manages the TLS certificate lifecycle for monitoring components. During certificate rotation, the {cmo-short} updates secrets and config maps, which triggers automatic restarts of affected pods. This is an expected behavior and the pods recover automatically.

The following example shows events that occur during certificate rotation:
