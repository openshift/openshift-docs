= Transforming replies

You can configure an `EventTransform` resource to modify both incoming requests and the responses returned from a sink in `requestâ€“reply` scenarios.

[NOTE]
====
You must use the same type of transformation for both the request and the reply. For example, JSONata with JSONata.

The following example shows how to transform both request and reply events:
