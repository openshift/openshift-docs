= Configuration for a routed topology

The routed (layer 3) topology networks are a simplified topology for the cluster default network without egress or ingress. In this topology, there is one logical switch per node, each with a different subnet, and a router interconnecting all logical switches.

This configuration can be used for IPv6 and dual-stack deployments.

[NOTE]
====
* Layer 3 routed topology networks only allow for the transfer of data packets between pods within a cluster.
* Creating a secondary network with an IPv6 subnet or dual-stack subnets fails on a single-stack {product-title} cluster. This is a known limitation and will be fixed a future version of {product-title}.
====

The following `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resource definition (CRD) YAML describes the fields needed to configure a routed secondary network.
