[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Argument | Description

| `disable-ht`
a|Disable hyperthreading.

Possible values: `true` or `false`.

Default: `false`.

[WARNING]
====
If this argument is set to `true` you should not disable hyperthreading in the BIOS. Disabling hyperthreading is accomplished with a kernel command line argument.
====

| --enable-hardware-tuning 
a|Enable the setting of maximum CPU frequencies. 
This parameter is optional.

To enable this feature, set the maximum frequency for applications running on isolated and reserved CPUs for both of the following:

* `spec.hardwareTuning.isolatedCpuFreq` 
* `spec.hardwareTuning.reservedCpuFreq`

| `info`
a| This captures cluster information and is used in discovery mode only. Discovery mode also requires the `must-gather-dir-path` argument. If any other arguments are set they are ignored.

Possible values:

* `log`
* `JSON`

+
[NOTE]
====
These options define the output format with the JSON format being reserved for debugging.
====

Default: `log`.

| `mcp-name`
|MCP name for example `worker-cnf` corresponding to the target machines. This parameter is required.

| `must-gather-dir-path`
| Must gather directory path. This parameter is required.

When the user runs the tool with the wrapper script `must-gather` is supplied by the script itself and the user must not specify it.

| `offlined-cpu-count`
a| Number of offlined CPUs.

[NOTE]
====
This must be a natural number greater than 0. If not enough logical processors are offlined then error messages are logged. The messages are:
[source,terminal]
----
Error: failed to compute the reserved and isolated CPUs: please ensure that reserved-cpu-count plus offlined-cpu-count should be in the range [0,1]
----
[source,terminal]
----
Error: failed to compute the reserved and isolated CPUs: please specify the offlined CPU count in the range [0,1]
----
====

| `power-consumption-mode`
a|The power consumption mode.

Possible values:

* `default`: CPU partitioning with enabled power management and basic low-latency.
* `low-latency`: Enhanced measures to improve latency figures.
* `ultra-low-latency`: Priority given to optimal latency, at the expense of power management.

Default: `default`.

| `per-pod-power-management`
a|Enable per pod power management. You cannot use this argument if you configured `ultra-low-latency` as the power consumption mode.

Possible values: `true` or `false`.

Default: `false`.

| `profile-name`
| Name of the performance profile to create.
Default: `performance`.

| `reserved-cpu-count`
a| Number of reserved CPUs. This parameter is required.

[NOTE]
====
This must be a natural number. A value of 0 is not allowed.
====

| `rt-kernel`
| Enable real-time kernel. This parameter is required.

Possible values: `true` or `false`.

| `split-reserved-cpus-across-numa`
| Split the reserved CPUs across NUMA nodes.

Possible values: `true` or `false`.

Default: `false`.

| `topology-manager-policy`
a| Kubelet Topology Manager policy of the performance profile to be created.

Possible values:

* `single-numa-node`
* `best-effort`
* `restricted`

Default: `restricted`.

| `user-level-networking`
| Run with user level networking (DPDK) enabled.

Possible values: `true` or `false`.

Default: `false`.
