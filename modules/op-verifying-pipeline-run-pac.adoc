= Verifying a pipeline run

You can verify that the {pac} resolver correctly processes the pipeline run definition that you created.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the `tkn` command line utility.
* You are logged into your {OCP} cluster using {oc-first}.
* You cloned your Git repository locally.

.Procedure

* From the root of your cloned Git repository, run the following command, specifying your pipeline run definition file name:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ tkn pac resolve .tekton/pipeline-run-definition.yaml
----
+
This command processes the pipeline run definition using the {pac} resolver. If the resolver fails to find any referenced resource, the output displays an error message. If the resolver completes successfully, the output displays the definition of a `PipelineRun` custom resource (CR) that includes all referenced resources, such as remote task definitions.
