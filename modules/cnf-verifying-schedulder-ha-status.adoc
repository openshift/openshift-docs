[id="verifying-scheduler-ha-status_{context}"]
= Verifying scheduler high availability (HA) status

Verify the status of the NUMA-aware scheduler to ensure it is running with the expected number of replicas based on your configuration.

.Procedure

. List only the scheduler pods by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-numaresources -l app=secondary-scheduler
----
+
.Expected output

Using the default HA mode, the number of pods equals the number of control-plane nodes. A standard HA {product-title} cluster typically has three control-plane nodes, and therefore displays three pods: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
secondary-scheduler-5b8c9d479d-2r4p5   1/1     Running   0          5m
secondary-scheduler-5b8c9d479d-k2f3p   1/1     Running   0          5m
secondary-scheduler-5b8c9d479d-q8c7b   1/1     Running   0          5m
----
+
* If you **customized the replicas**, the number of pods matches the value you set.
* If you **disabled the scheduler**, there are no running pods with this label.
+
[NOTE]
====
A limit of 3 replicas is enforced for the NUMA-aware scheduler. On a hosted control planes cluster, the scheduler pods run on the worker nodes of the hosted-cluster.
====

. Verify the number of replicas and their status by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment secondary-scheduler -n openshift-numaresources
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
secondary-scheduler   3/3     3            3           5m
----
+
In this output, 3/3 means 3 replicas are ready out of an expected 3 replicas.

. For more detailed information run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe deployment secondary-scheduler -n openshift-numaresources
----
+
.Example output

The `Replicas` line shows a deployment configured for 3 replicas, with all 3 updated and available.
