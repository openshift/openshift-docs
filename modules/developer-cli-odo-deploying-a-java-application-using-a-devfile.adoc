= Deploying a Java application using a devfile

In this section, you will learn how to deploy a sample Java project that uses Maven and Java 8 JDK using a devfile.

.Procedure

. Create a directory to store the source code of your component:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir <directory-name>
----

. Create a component configuration of Spring Boot component type named `myspring` and download its sample project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo create java-spring-boot myspring --starter
----
+
The previous command produces the following output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
Validation
✓  Checking devfile compatibility [195728ns]
✓  Creating a devfile component from registry: DefaultDevfileRegistry [170275ns]
✓  Validating devfile component [281940ns]

Please use `odo push` command to create the component with source deployed
----
+
The `odo create` command downloads the associated `devfile.yaml` file from the recorded devfile registries.

. List the contents of the directory to confirm that the devfile and the sample Java application were downloaded:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls
----
+
The previous command produces the following output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
README.md    devfile.yaml    pom.xml        src
----

. Create a URL to access the deployed component:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo url create --host apps-crc.testing
----
+
The previous command produces the following output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
✓  URL myspring-8080.apps-crc.testing created for component: myspring

To apply the URL configuration changes, please use odo push
----
+
NOTE: You must use your cluster host domain name when creating the URL.

. Push the component to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo push
----
+
The previous command produces the following output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
Validation
 ✓  Validating the devfile [81808ns]

Creating Kubernetes resources for component myspring
 ✓  Waiting for component to start [5s]

Applying URL changes
 ✓  URL myspring-8080: http://myspring-8080.apps-crc.testing created

Syncing to component myspring
 ✓  Checking files for pushing [2ms]
 ✓  Syncing files to the component [1s]

Executing devfile commands for component myspring
 ✓  Executing devbuild command "/artifacts/bin/build-container-full.sh" [1m]
 ✓  Executing devrun command "/artifacts/bin/start-server.sh" [2s]

Pushing devfile component myspring
 ✓  Changes successfully pushed to component
----

. List the URLs of the component to verify that the component was pushed successfully:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo url list
----
+
The previous command produces the following output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
Found the following URLs for component myspring
NAME              URL                                       PORT     SECURE
myspring-8080     http://myspring-8080.apps-crc.testing     8080     false
----

. View your deployed application by using the generated URL:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl http://myspring-8080.apps-crc.testing
----
