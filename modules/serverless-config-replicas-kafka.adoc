= Configuring high availability replicas for the Knative broker implementation for Apache Kafka

High availability (HA) is available by default for the Knative broker implementation for Apache Kafka components `kafka-controller` and `kafka-webhook-eventing`, which are configured to have two each replicas by default. You can change the number of replicas for these components by modifying the `spec.high-availability.replicas` value in the `KnativeKafka` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative broker for Apache Kafka are installed on your cluster.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp-product-title} web console, navigate to *OperatorHub* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Select the `knative-eventing` namespace.

. Click *Knative Kafka* in the list of *Provided APIs* for the {ServerlessOperatorName} to go to the *Knative Kafka* tab.

. Click *knative-kafka*, then go to the *YAML* tab in the *knative-kafka* page.

. Modify the number of replicas in the `KnativeKafka` CR:
