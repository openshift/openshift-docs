= Using Data Mover for CSI snapshots

:FeatureName: Data Mover for CSI snapshots

The OADP Data Mover enables customers to back up Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store.

When Data Mover is enabled, you can restore stateful applications, using CSI volume snapshots pulled from the object store if a failure, accidental deletion, or corruption of the cluster occurs.

The Data Mover solution uses the Restic option of VolSync.

Data Mover supports backup and restore of CSI volume snapshots only.

In OADP 1.2 Data Mover `VolumeSnapshotBackups` (VSBs) and `VolumeSnapshotRestores` (VSRs) are queued using the VolumeSnapshotMover (VSM). The VSM's performance is improved by specifying a concurrent number of VSBs and VSRs simultaneously `InProgress`. After all async plugin operations are complete, the backup is marked as complete.


[NOTE]
====
The OADP 1.1 Data Mover is a Technology Preview feature.

The OADP 1.2 Data Mover has significantly improved features and performances, but is still a Technology Preview feature.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends that customers who use OADP 1.2 Data Mover in order to back up and restore ODF CephFS volumes, upgrade or install {product-title} version 4.12 or later for improved performance. OADP Data Mover can leverage CephFS shallow volumes in {product-title} version 4.12 or later, which based on our testing, can improve the performance of backup times.

.Prerequisites

* You have verified that the `StorageClass` and `VolumeSnapshotClass` custom resources (CRs) support CSI.

* You have verified that only one `volumeSnapshotClass` CR has the annotation `snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: true`.
+
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} version 4.12 or later, verify that this is the only default `volumeSnapshotClass`.
====

* You have verified that `deletionPolicy` of the `VolumeSnapshotClass` CR is set to `Retain`.

* You have verified that only one `storageClass` CR has the annotation `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: true`.

* You have included the label `{velero-domain}/csi-volumesnapshot-class: 'true'` in your `VolumeSnapshotClass` CR.

* You have verified that the `OADP namespace` has the annotation `oc annotate --overwrite namespace/openshift-adp volsync.backube/privileged-movers='true'`.
+
[NOTE]
====
In OADP 1.1 the above setting is mandatory.
====

* You have installed the VolSync Operator by using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
+
[NOTE]
====
The VolSync Operator is required for using OADP Data Mover.
====

* You have installed the OADP operator by using OLM.

.Procedure

. Configure a Restic secret by creating a `.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <secret_name>
type: Opaque
stringData:
# The repository encryption key
  RESTIC_PASSWORD: my-secure-restic-password
----
+
. Create a DPA CR similar to the following example. The default plugins include CSI.
. Add the restic secret name from the step above to your DPA CR as `spec.features.dataMover.credentialName`. If this step is not completed, then it will default to the secret name `dm-credential`.
+
[NOTE]
====
In this DPA, the `CSI` and `VSM` are included as `defaultPlugins`. Also included is the `dataMover.enable` flag.

----
<1> OADP 1.2 only. Optional: Specify the upper limit of the number of snapshots allowed to be queued for backup. The default value is 10.
<2> OADP 1.2 only. Optional: Specify the upper limit of the number of snapshots allowed to be queued for restore. The default value is 10.
<3> OADP 1.2 only. Optional: Specify the number of days, between running Restic pruning on the repository. The prune operation repacks the data to free space, but it can also generate significant I/O traffic as a part of the process. Setting this option allows a trade-off between storage consumption, from no longer referenced data, and access costs.
<4> OADP 1.2 only. Optional: Specify VolumeSync volume options for backup and restore.
<5> OADP 1.2 only.

+
The OADP Operator installs two custom resource definitions (CRDs), `VolumeSnapshotBackup` and `VolumeSnapshotRestore`.

<1> Specify the namespace where the volume snapshot exists.
<2> Specify the namespace where the Operator is installed. The default is `openshift-adp`.

. You can back up a volume snapshot by performing the following steps:

.. Create a backup CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: <backup_name>
  namespace: <protected_ns> <1>
spec:
  includedNamespaces:
  - <app_ns>
  storageLocation: velero-sample-1
----
<1> Specify the namespace where the Operator is installed. The default namespace is `openshift-adp`.

.. Wait up to 10 minutes and check whether the `VolumeSnapshotBackup` CR status is `Completed` by entering the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vsb -n <app_ns>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vsb <vsb_name> -n <app_ns> -o jsonpath="{.status.phase}"
----
+
A snapshot is created in the object store was configured in the DPA.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the status of the `VolumeSnapshotBackup` CR becomes `Failed`, refer to the Velero logs for troubleshooting.
====

. You can restore a volume snapshot by performing the following steps:

.. Delete the application namespace and the `volumeSnapshotContent` that was created by the Velero CSI plugin.

.. Create a `Restore` CR and set `restorePVs` to `true`.
+
.Example `Restore` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: <restore_name>
  namespace: <protected_ns>
spec:
  backupName: <previous_backup_name>
  restorePVs: true
----

.. Wait up to 10 minutes and check whether the `VolumeSnapshotRestore` CR status is `Completed` by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vsr -n <app_ns>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vsr <vsr_name> -n <app_ns> -o jsonpath="{.status.phase}"
