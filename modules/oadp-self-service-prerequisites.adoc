= {oadp-short} Self-Service prerequisites

Before you start using {oadp-short} Self-Service as a namespace `admin` user, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

* The cluster administrator has configured the {oadp-short} `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) CR to enable Self-Service. 
* The cluster administrator has completed the following tasks:
** Created a namespace `admin` user account.
** Created a namespace for the namespace `admin` user.
** Assigned appropriate privileges for the namespace admin user's namespace. This ensures that the namespace admin user is authorized to access and perform backup and restore operations in their assigned namespace.
* Optionally, the cluster administrator can create a `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` (NABSL) CR for the namespace `admin` user.
