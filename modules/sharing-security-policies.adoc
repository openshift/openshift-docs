= Sharing security policies

[role="_abstract"]

You can share your security policies between different Central instances in the {product-title-short} portal by exporting and importing policies.
Sharing policies helps you enforce the same standards for all your clusters.
To share policies, you export them as JSON files, and then import them back into another Central instance.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, you cannot export multiple security policies at the same time by using the {product-title-short} portal.
However, you can use the API for exporting multiple security policies.
In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Help* -> *API reference* to see the API reference.
