= Reissuing internal certificates for Central services

The Central services contain the Central, Central DB, Scanner, and Scanner V4 components.
The Central services use a built-in server certificate for authentication when communicating with other {rh-rhacs-first} services.
This certificate is unique to your Central service installation.
The {product-title-short} portal shows an informational banner when a Central service certificate is about to expire.

[NOTE]
====
The informational banner only appears 15 days before the certificate expiration date.
====

Beginning with {product-title-short} 4.3.4, the Operator automatically rotates the service transport layer security (TLS) certificates for all of the Central components 6 months before they expire.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The automated rotation of the TLS certificates applies only to Operator-based installations. For all other installation methods, you must manually rotate the TLS certificates.

* The rotation of the TLS certificates within the secrets does not automatically trigger the components to reload them. If the corresponding pods are not restarted at least every 6 months, you must manually restart the pods to load the new certificates before the old ones expire.

ifeval::["{rhacs-version}" < "4.9.0"]
* Certificate authority (CA) certificates are not updated. They are valid for 5 years.
