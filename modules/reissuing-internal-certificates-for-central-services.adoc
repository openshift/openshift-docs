= Reissuing internal certificates for Central services

Central uses a built-in server certificate for authentication when communicating with other {rh-rhacs-first} services.
This certificate is unique to your Central installation.
The {product-title-short} portal shows an information banner when the Central certificate is about to expire.

[NOTE]
====
The information banner only appears 15 days before the certificate expiration date.
====

Beginning with {product-title-short} 4.3.4, the Operator automatically rotates the service transport layer security (TLS) certificates for all the Central components 6 months before they expire.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The automated rotation of the TLS certificates applies only to Operator-based installations. For all other installation methods, you must manually rotate the TLS certificates.

* The rotation of the TLS certificates within the secrets does not automatically trigger the components to reload them. If the corresponding pods are not restarted at least every 6 months, you must manually restart the pods to load the new certificates before the old ones expire.

* The internal certificate authority (CA) certificates are not automatically rotated. They remain valid for 5 years.
====

.Prerequisites

* To reissue, or rotate, certificates, you must have `write` permission for the `Administration` resource.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, click on the link in the banner that announces the certificate expiration to download a YAML configuration file, which contains a new secret. The secret includes the certificate and key values.
. Apply the new YAML configuration file to the cluster where you have installed Central by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <secret_file.yaml>
----

. Restart Central to apply the changes.
