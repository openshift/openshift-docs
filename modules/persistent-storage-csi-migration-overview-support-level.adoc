= Automatic migration of in-tree volumes to CSI

{product-title} supports automatic and seamless migration of following in-tree volume types to their CSI counterpart since {product-title} 4.11. CSI migration for volume types listed below are considered *Generally Available(GA)* and should require no user intervention. Upgrading from {product-title} versions earlier than 4.11 to 4.11 will result in existing in-tree volumes to be now managed by CSI driver.



If you are installing a new {product-title} 4.11 cluster, similarly for volume types listed below - CSI will be the new default.

If you are upgrading from a version earlier than 4.11, your new default storageclass will be set to CSI one. Existing in-tree storageclass is still there and may be necessary for certain features such as volume expansion to work for existing in-tree persistent volumes(PVs). If you are installing a new 4.11 {product-title} cluster, CSI storageclass is the new default and hence all volumes provisioned using this storageclass will be CSI persistent volumes(PVs).


Enabling CSI automatic migration for in-tree persistent volumes (PVs) or persistent volume claims (PVCs) does not enable any new CSI driver features, such as snapshots or expansion if the original in-tree storage plug-in did not support it.


CSI automatic migration will be enabled by default for all storage in-tree plug-ins in a future {product-title} release, so it is highly recommended that you test it now and report any issues.
