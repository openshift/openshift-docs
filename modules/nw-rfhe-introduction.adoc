= How Redfish hardware events work

The Baremetal Hardware Event Proxy enables applications running on bare-metal clusters to respond quickly to Redfish hardware changes and failures such as breaches of temperature thresholds, fan failure, disk loss, power outages, and memory failure. These hardware events are delivered over a reliable low-latency transport channel based on Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The latency of the messaging service is between 10 to 20 milliseconds.

The hardware event proxy provides a publish-subscribe service for the hardware events, where multiple applications can use REST APIs to subscribe and consume the events. The hardware event proxy supports hardware that complies with Redfish OpenAPI v1.8 or higher.

== Redfish hardware events data flow

The following figure illustrates an example Redfish hardware events data flow. vDU is used as an example of an application interacting with Redfish events:

=== Operator-managed pod

The Operator uses custom resources to manage the pod containing the hardware event proxy and its components using the `HardwareEvent` CR.

=== Hardware event proxy

At startup, the hardware event proxy queries the Redfish API and downloads all the message registries, including custom registries. The hardware event proxy then begins to receive subscribed events from the Redfish hardware.

The proxy enables applications running on bare-metal clusters to respond quickly to Redfish hardware changes and failures such as breaches of temperature thresholds, fan failure, disk loss, power outages, and memory failure. The events are reported using the `HardwareEvent` CR.

=== Cloud native event

Cloud native events (CNE) is a REST API specification for defining the format of event data.

=== CNCF CloudEvents

link:https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] is a vendor-neutral specification developed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) for defining the format of event data.

=== AMQP dispatch router

The dispatch router is responsible for the message delivery service between publisher and subscriber. AMQP 1.0 qpid is an open standard that supports reliable, high-performance, fully-symmetrical messaging over the internet.

=== Cloud event proxy sidecar

The cloud event proxy sidecar container image is based on the ORAN API specification and provides a publish-subscribe event framework for hardware events.

== Redfish message parsing service

In addition to handling Redfish events, the Redfish hardware event proxy provides message parsing for events without a `Message` property. The proxy downloads all the Redfish message registries including vendor specific registries from the hardware when it starts. If an event does not contain a `Message` property, the proxy uses the Redfish message registries to construct the `Message` and `Resolution` properties and add them to the event before passing the event to the cloud events framework. This service allows Redfish events to have smaller message size and lower transmission latency.
