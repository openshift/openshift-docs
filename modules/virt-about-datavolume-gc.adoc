= About data volume garbage collection

Before {VirtProductName} release 4.12, you used an `oc` command to remove a data volume. This command removes the connection between the data volume and the persistent volume claim (PVC). However, using this command does not always provide the expected result. For example, Kubevirt might attempt to recreate a data volume that you removed if it had initially created the volume.

For {VirtProductName} release 4.12 and later, an automated process removes data volumes that are no longer associated with the PVC. This frees you from performing manual clean-up or garbage collection and enables you to manage your data volumes by working with the PVC, instead of the associated data volumes.
