= About adding OLM-based Operators to a disconnected node

[role="_abstract"]
You must mirror remote registries to a highly available container registry for Operators that are installed on a disconnected node.

By default, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) requires full internet connectivity to access remote registries such as Red{nbsp}Hat-provided Operator catalogs. For a disconnected node, you must mirror remote registries to a highly available container registry.

The following steps are required to use OLM to install, manage, and lifecycle Operators in disconnected situations:

* Include OLM in the container image list for your mirror registry.
* Configure the system to use your mirror registry by updating your CRI-O configuration directly. `ImageContentSourcePolicy` is not supported in {microshift-short}.
* Add a `CatalogSource` object to the node so that the OLM catalog Operator can use the local catalog on the mirror registry.
* Ensure that {microshift-short} is installed to run in a disconnected capacity.
* Ensure that the network settings are configured to run in disconnected mode.

After enabling OLM in a disconnected node, you can continue to use your internet-connected workstation to keep your local catalog sources updated as newer versions of Operators are released.
