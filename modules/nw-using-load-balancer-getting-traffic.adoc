= Using a load balancer to get traffic into the cluster

[role="_abstract"]
If you do not need a specific external IP address, you can configure a load balancer service to allow external access to an {product-title} cluster.

A load balancer service allocates a unique IP. The load balancer has a single edge router IP, which can be a virtual IP (VIP), but is still a single machine for initial load balancing.

[NOTE]
====
A pool gets configured at the infrastructure level and not the cluster administrator level.
