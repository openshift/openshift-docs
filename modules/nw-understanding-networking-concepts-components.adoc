= Networking concepts and components

Networking in {product-title} uses several key components and concepts.

* Pods and services are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, and services provide stable IP addresses and DNS names for sets of pods. Each pod in a cluster is assigned a unique IP address. Pods use IP addresses to communicate directly with other pods, regardless of which node they are on. The pod IP addresses will change when pods are destroyed and created. Services are also assigned unique IP addresses. A service is associated with the pods that can provide the service. When accessed, the service IP address provides a stable way to access pods by sending traffic to one of the pods that backs the service.

* Route and Ingress APIs define rules that route HTTP, HTTPS, and TLS traffic to services within the cluster. {product-title} provides both Route and Ingress APIs as part of the default installation, but you can add third-party Ingress Controllers to the cluster.

* The Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin manages the pod network to enable pod-to-pod communication.

* The Cluster Network Operator (CNO)  CNO manages the networking plugin components of a cluster. Using the CNO, you can set the network configuration, such as the pod network CIDR and service network CIDR.

* DNS operators manage DNS services within the cluster to ensure that services are reachable by their DNS names.

* Network controls define how pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints. These policies help secure the cluster by controlling traffic flow and enforcing rules for pod communication.

* Load balancing distributes network traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance.

* Service discovery is a mechanism for services to find and communicate with each other within the cluster.

* The Ingress Operator uses {product-title} Route to manage the router and enable external access to cluster services.
