= Configuring persistent storage

Run cluster monitoring with persistent storage to gain the following benefits:

* Protect your metrics and alerting data from data loss by storing them in a persistent volume (PV). As a result, they can survive pods being restarted or recreated.
* Avoid getting duplicate notifications and losing silences for alerts when the Alertmanager pods are restarted.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In multi-node clusters, you must configure persistent storage for Prometheus and Alertmanager to ensure high availability.

[NOTE]
====
For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage.

* Use the block type of storage.

* Dedicate sufficient persistent storage to ensure that the disk does not become full.

* Use `Filesystem` as the storage type value for the `volumeMode` parameter when you configure the persistent volume.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* Do not use a raw block volume, which is described with `volumeMode: Block` in the `PersistentVolume` resource. Prometheus cannot use raw block volumes.

* Prometheus does not support file systems that are not POSIX compliant.
For example, some NFS file system implementations are not POSIX compliant.
If you want to use an NFS file system for storage, verify with the vendor that their NFS implementation is fully POSIX compliant.
