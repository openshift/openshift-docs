= Configuring persistent storage

Run cluster monitoring with persistent storage to gain the following benefits:

* Protect your metrics and alerting data from data loss by storing them in a persistent volume (PV). As a result, they can survive pods being restarted or recreated.
* Avoid getting duplicate notifications and losing silences for alerts when the Alertmanager pods are restarted.

For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage. Because of the high IO demands, it is advantageous to use local storage.

* Use the block type of storage.

* Dedicate sufficient local persistent storage to ensure that the disk does not become full. How much storage you need depends on the number of pods.

* Verify that you have a persistent volume (PV) ready to be claimed by the persistent volume claim (PVC), one PV for each replica. Because Prometheus and Alertmanager both have two replicas, you need four PVs to support the entire monitoring stack. The PVs are available from the Local Storage Operator, but not if you have enabled dynamically provisioned storage.

* Use `Filesystem` as the storage type value for the `volumeMode` parameter when you configure the persistent volume.

[NOTE]
====
If you use a local volume for persistent storage, do not use a raw block volume, which is described with `volumeMode: Block` in the `LocalVolume` object. Prometheus cannot use raw block volumes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Prometheus does not support file systems that are not POSIX compliant.
For example, some NFS file system implementations are not POSIX compliant.
If you want to use an NFS file system for storage, verify with the vendor that their NFS implementation is fully POSIX compliant.
