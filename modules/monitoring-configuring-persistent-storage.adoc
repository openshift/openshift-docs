= Configuring persistent storage

Running cluster monitoring with persistent storage means that your metrics are stored to a persistent volume (PV) and can survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal if you require your metrics or alerting data to be guarded from data loss. For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage. Because of the high IO demands, it is advantageous to use local storage.

* Use the block type of storage.

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* Dedicate sufficient local persistent storage to ensure that the disk does not become full. How much storage you need depends on the number of pods.

* Verify that you have a persistent volume (PV) ready to be claimed by the persistent volume claim (PVC), one PV for each replica. Because Prometheus and Alertmanager both have two replicas, you need four PVs to support the entire monitoring stack. The PVs are available from the Local Storage Operator, but not if you have enabled dynamically provisioned storage.

* Use `Filesystem` as the storage type value for the `volumeMode` parameter when you configure the persistent volume.

[NOTE]
====
If you use a local volume for persistent storage, do not use a raw block volume, which is described with `volumeMode: Block` in the `LocalVolume` object. Prometheus cannot use raw block volumes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Prometheus does not support file systems that are not POSIX compliant.
For example, some NFS file system implementations are not POSIX compliant.
If you want to use an NFS file system for storage, verify with the vendor that their NFS implementation is fully POSIX compliant.
