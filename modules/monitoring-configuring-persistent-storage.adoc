= Configuring persistent storage

Running cluster monitoring with persistent storage means that your metrics are stored to a persistent volume (PV) and can survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal if you require your metrics or alerting data to be guarded from data loss. For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage. Because of the high IO demands, it is advantageous to use local storage.

== Persistent storage prerequisites

* Dedicate sufficient local persistent storage to ensure that the disk does not become full. How much storage you need depends on the number of pods.

* Verify that you have a persistent volume (PV) ready to be claimed by the persistent volume claim (PVC), one PV for each replica. Because Prometheus and Alertmanager both have two replicas, you need four PVs to support the entire monitoring stack. The PVs are available from the Local Storage Operator, but not if you have enabled dynamically provisioned storage.

* Use the block type of storage.

[NOTE]
====
If you use a local volume for persistent storage, do not use a raw block volume, which is described with `volumeMode: block` in the `LocalVolume` object. Prometheus cannot use raw block volumes.
