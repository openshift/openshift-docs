Deprecation of AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization::

The use of Confidential Computing with AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (AMD SEV) on {gcp-first} has been deprecated and might be removed in a future release.

Support for Docker v2 registries is deprecated and is planned for removal in a future release. A registry that supports the Open Container Initiative (OCI) specification will be required for all mirroring operations in a future release. Additionally, `oc-mirror` v2 now only generates custom catalog images in the OCI format, whereas the deprecated `oc-mirror` v1 still supports the Docker v2 format.

The Red{nbsp}Hat Marketplace is deprecated. Customers who use the partner software from the Marketplace should contact the software vendor about how to migrate from the Marketplace Operator to an Operator in the Red{nbsp}Hat Ecosystem Catalog.
