= Scheduling workloads with the NUMA-aware scheduler

Now that `topo-aware-scheduler` is installed, the `NUMAResourcesOperator` and `NUMAResourcesScheduler` CRs are applied and your cluster has a matching performance profile or `kubeletconfig`, you can schedule workloads with the NUMA-aware scheduler using deployment CRs that specify the minimum required resources to process the workload.

The following example deployment uses NUMA-aware scheduling for a sample workload.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Get the name of the NUMA-aware scheduler that is deployed in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get numaresourcesschedulers.nodetopology.openshift.io numaresourcesscheduler -o json | jq '.status.schedulerName'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
"topo-aware-scheduler"
----

. Create a `Deployment` CR that uses scheduler named `topo-aware-scheduler`, for example:

.. Save the following YAML in the `nro-deployment.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]

        args: [ "while true; do sleep 1h; done;" ]
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "100Mi"
            cpu: "8"
          requests:
            memory: "100Mi"
            cpu: "8"
----
<1> `schedulerName` must match the name of the NUMA-aware scheduler that is deployed in your cluster, for example `topo-aware-scheduler`.

.. Create the `Deployment` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f nro-deployment.yaml
----

.Verification

. Verify that the deployment was successful:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-numaresources

[NOTE]
====
Deployments that request more resources than is available for scheduling will fail with a `MinimumReplicasUnavailable` error. The deployment succeeds when the required resources become available. Pods remain in the `Pending` state until the required resources are available.
====

. Verify that the expected allocated resources are listed for the node.

.. Identify the node that is running the deployment pod by running the following command:

[source,terminal]

$ oc get pods -n openshift-numaresources -o wide

<1> The `Available` capacity is reduced because of the resources that have been allocated to the guaranteed pod.
+
Resources consumed by guaranteed pods are subtracted from the available node resources listed under `noderesourcetopologies.topology.node.k8s.io`.

. Resource allocations for pods with a `Best-effort` or `Burstable` quality of service (`qosClass`) are not reflected in the NUMA node resources under `noderesourcetopologies.topology.node.k8s.io`. If a pod's consumed resources are not reflected in the node resource calculation, verify that the pod has `qosClass` of `Guaranteed` and the CPU request is an integer value, not a decimal value. You can verify the that the pod has a  `qosClass` of `Guaranteed` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod numa-deployment-1-6c4f5bdb84-wgn6g -n openshift-numaresources -o jsonpath="{ .status.qosClass }"
