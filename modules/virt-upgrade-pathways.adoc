= Upgrade pathways for minor releases

The upgrade pathway is different depending on the 2.4.z version of {VirtProductName} that you have installed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must upgrade your {product-title} to 4.8 before upgrading the minor release of {VirtProductName}.
====

[id="virt-upgrade-pathways-2.4.3_{context}"]
== Upgrading from 2.4.3 to 2.5.2

You must first upgrade to 2.5.0 before you can upgrade the z-stream. You can then upgrade from 2.5.0 to 2.5.1 and then to 2.5.2.

If your *Approval Strategy* is *Automatic*, which is the default, {VirtProductName} upgrades the z-stream automatically once you have upgraded to 2.5.0.

[id="virt-upgrade-pathways-2.4.4_{context}"]
== Upgrading from 2.4.4 to 2.5.2

You can upgrade from 2.4.4 directly to 2.5.2.
