== Upgrading from 2.4.3 to {HCOVersion}

You must first upgrade to 2.5.0 before you can upgrade the z-stream. You can then upgrade from 2.5.0 to 2.5.1 and then to 2.5.2 and so on.

If your *Approval Strategy* is *Automatic*, which is the default, {VirtProductName} upgrades the z-stream automatically after you have upgraded to 2.5.0.

[id="virt-upgrade-pathways-2.4.4_{context}"]
== Upgrading from 2.4.4 or 2.4.5 to {HCOVersion}

You can upgrade from 2.4.4 or 2.4.5 directly to 2.5.2. You can then upgrade from 2.5.2 to 2.5.3 and so on.

If your *Approval Strategy* is *Automatic*, which is the default, {VirtProductName} upgrades the z-stream automatically after you have upgraded to 2.5.2.
