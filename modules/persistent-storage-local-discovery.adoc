= Automating discovery and provisioning for local storage devices

The Local Storage Operator automates local storage discovery and provisioning. With this feature, you can simplify installation when dynamic provisioning is not available during deployment, such as with bare metal, VMware, or AWS store instances with attached devices.

:FeatureName: Automatic discovery and provisioning
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Automatic discovery and provisioning is fully supported when used to deploy {rh-storage-first} on-premise or with platform-agnostic deployment.
====

Use the following procedure to automatically discover local devices, and to automatically provision local volumes for selected devices.

[WARNING]
====
Use the `LocalVolumeSet` object with caution. When you automatically provision persistent volumes (PVs) from local disks, the local PVs might claim all devices that match. If you are using a `LocalVolumeSet` object, make sure the Local Storage Operator is the only entity managing local devices on the node. Creating multiple instances of a `LocalVolumeSet` that target a node more than once is not supported.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have cluster administrator permissions.

* You have installed the Local Storage Operator.

* You have attached local disks to {product-title} nodes.

* You have access to the {product-title} web console and the `oc` command-line interface (CLI).

.Procedure

. To enable automatic discovery of local devices from the web console:

.. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

.. In the `openshift-local-storage` namespace, click *Local Storage*.

.. Click the *Local Volume Discovery* tab.

.. Click *Create Local Volume Discovery* and then select either *Form view* or *YAML view*.

.. Configure the `LocalVolumeDiscovery` object parameters.

.. Click *Create*.
+
The Local Storage Operator creates a local volume discovery instance named `auto-discover-devices`.

. To display a continuous list of available devices on a node:

.. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

.. Navigate to *Compute* -> *Nodes*.

.. Click the node name that you want to open. The "Node Details" page is displayed.

.. Select the *Disks* tab to display the list of the selected devices.
+
The device list updates continuously as local disks are added or removed. You can filter the devices by name, status, type, model, capacity, and mode.

. To automatically provision local volumes for the discovered devices from the web console:

.. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* and select *Local Storage* from the list of Operators.

.. Select *Local Volume Set* -> *Create Local Volume Set*.

.. Enter a volume set name and a storage class name.

.. Choose *All nodes* or *Select nodes* to apply filters accordingly.
+
[NOTE]
====
Only worker nodes are available, regardless of whether you filter using *All nodes* or *Select nodes*.
====
+
.. Select the disk type, mode, size, and limit you want to apply to the local volume set, and click *Create*.
+
A message displays after several minutes, indicating that the "Operator reconciled successfully."

. Alternatively, to provision local volumes for the discovered devices from the CLI:

.. Create an object YAML file to define the local volume set, such as `local-volume-set.yaml`, as shown in the following example:
+

<1> Determines the storage class that is created for persistent volumes that are provisioned from discovered devices. The Local Storage Operator automatically creates the storage class if it does not exist. Be sure to use a storage class that uniquely identifies this set of local volumes.
+
<2> When using the local volume set feature, the Local Storage Operator does not support the use of logical volume management (LVM) devices.

.. Create the local volume set object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f local-volume-set.yaml
----

.. Verify that the local persistent volumes were dynamically provisioned based on the storage class:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pv
