= AWS SQS with IntegrationSink

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Queue Service (SQS) Kamelet allows you to send CloudEvents from Knative Eventing into an SQS queue. This integration is useful when you need reliable, decoupled message delivery between event producers and consumers, or when downstream systems process events asynchronously from a queue.

To configure an `IntegrationSink` API resource for AWS SQS, you must reference a Kubernetes Secret with valid AWS credentials, specify the queue Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and region, and configure the event source that produces the CloudEvents.
