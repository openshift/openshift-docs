= Managing CPU and memory resources for monitoring components

[role="_abstract"]
You can ensure that the containers that run monitoring components have enough CPU and memory resources by specifying values for resource limits and requests for those components.

// tag::CPM[]
You can configure these limits and requests for core platform monitoring components in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.
// end::CPM[]

// tag::UWM[]
You can configure these limits and requests for monitoring components that monitor user-defined projects in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.
// end::UWM[]
