ifdef::aws[= Non-guaranteed Spot Instances and hourly cost limits]

ifdef::aws[]
You can deploy machines as non-guaranteed Spot Instances on {aws-first}. 
Spot Instances use spare AWS EC2 capacity and are less expensive than On-Demand Instances. 
You can use Spot Instances for workloads that can tolerate interruptions, such as batch or stateless, horizontally scalable workloads.

[IMPORTANT]
====
AWS EC2 can reclaim the capacity for a Spot Instance at any time.

.Sample Spot Instance configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: AWSMachineTemplate
# ...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      spotMarketOptions: <1> 
        maxPrice: <price_per_hour> <2>
# ...
----
<1> Specifies the use of Spot Instances.
<2> Optional: Specifies an hourly cost limit in US dollars for the Spot Instance. 
For example, setting the `<price_per_hour>` value to `2.50` limits the cost of the Spot Instance to USD 2.50 per hour.
When this value is not set, the maximum price charges up to the On-Demand Instance price.
+
[WARNING]
====
Setting a specific `maxPrice: <price_per_hour>` value might increase the frequency of interruptions compared to using the default On-Demand Instance price.
It is strongly recommended to use the default On-Demand Instance price and to not set the maximum price for Spot Instances.
====

Interruptions can occur when using Spot Instances for the following reasons:

* The instance price exceeds your maximum price
* The demand for Spot Instances increases
* The supply of Spot Instances decreases

AWS gives a two-minute warning to the user when an interruption occurs. 
{product-title} begins to remove the workloads from the affected instances when AWS issues the termination warning.

When AWS terminates an instance, a termination handler running on the Spot Instance node deletes the machine resource. 
To satisfy the compute machine set `replicas` quantity, the compute machine set creates a machine that requests a Spot Instance.
