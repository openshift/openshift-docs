= Overview of Gateway API

[role="_abstract"]
To optimize network traffic management and implement routing policies in {product-title}, use the Gateway API. By adopting this community-managed Kubernetes mechanism, you can configure advanced routing at both the transport (L4) and application (L7) layers while leveraging various vendor-supported implementations to meet your specific networking requirements

A variety of vendors offer many link:https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/[implementations of Gateway API].

The project is an effort to provide a standardized ecosystem by using a portable API with broad community support. By integrating Gateway API functionality into the Ingress Operator, it enables a networking solution that aligns with existing community and upstream development efforts.

Gateway API extends the functionality of the Ingress Operator to handle more granular cluster traffic and routing configurations. With these capabilities, you can create instances of Gateway API custom resource definitions (CRDs). For {product-title} clusters, the Ingress Operator creates the following resources:

Gateway:: This resource describes how traffic can be translated to services within the cluster. For example, a specific load balancer configuration.
GatewayClass:: This resource defines a set of `Gateway` objects that share a common configuration and behavior. For example, two separate `GatewayClass` objects might be created to distinguish a set of `Gateway` resources used for public or private applications.
HTTPRoute:: This resource specifies the routing behavior of HTTP requests from a Gateway to a service, and is especially useful for multiplexing HTTP or terminated HTTPS connections.
GRPCRoute:: This resource specifies the routing behavior of gRPC requests.
ReferenceGrant:: This resource enables cross-namespace references. For example, it enables routes to forward traffic to backends that are in a different namespace.

In {product-title}, the implementation of Gateway API is based on `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1`, and all fields in this version are supported.

== Benefits of Gateway API
Gateway API provides the following benefits:

* Portability: While {product-title} uses HAProxy to improve Ingress performance, Gateway API does not rely on vendor-specific annotations to provide certain behavior. To get comparable performance as HAProxy, the `Gateway` objects need to be horizontally scaled or their associated nodes need to be vertically scaled.
* Separation of concerns: Gateway API uses a role-based approach to its resources, and more neatly fits into how a large organization structures its responsibilities and teams. Platform engineers might focus on `GatewayClass` resources, cluster administrators might focus on configuring `Gateway` resources, and application developers might focus on routing their services with `HTTPRoute` resources.
* Extensibility: Additional functionality is developed as a standardized CRD.

[id="gateway-api-limitations_{context}"]
== Limitations of Gateway API
Gateway API has the following limitations:

* Version incompatibilities: Gateway API ecosystem changes rapidly, and some implementations do not work with others because their featureset is based on differing versions of Gateway API.
* Resource overhead: While more flexible, Gateway API uses multiple resource types to achieve an outcome. For smaller applications, the simplicity of traditional Ingress might be a better fit.
