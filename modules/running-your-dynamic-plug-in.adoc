= Running your dynamic plug-in

You can run the plug-in using a local development environment. The {product-title} web console runs in a container connected to the cluster you have logged into.

.Prerequisites
* You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed.
* You must have an OpenShift cluster running.
* You must have link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker] or at least v3.2.0 of link:https://podman.io/[Podman] installed.

.Procedure

. Build a plug-in and generate the output to the `dist` directory by running
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ yarn build
----

. Start an HTTP server by running
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ yarn http-server
----

. The HTTP server, which runs on port 9001, generates the following assets with `caching` disabled and `CORS` enabled.
+
[source,terminal]
----
Starting up http-server, serving ./dist
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:9001
  http://192.168.1.190:9001
  http://10.40.192.80:9001
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
----

. Optional: Add additional server options to the script by running
+
----
$ yarn http-server -a <server name>
----

.  Direct `bridge` to proxy requests to your local plug-in asset server by running
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./bin/bridge -plugins console-demo-plugin=http://localhost:9001/
----

.Verification
* Visit link:http://localhost:9000/example[local host] to view the running plug-in. Inspect the value of `window.SERVER_FLAGS.consolePlugins` to see the list of plug-ins which load at runtime.
