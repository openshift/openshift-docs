= Creating a namespace for user-defined networks by using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can create a namespace to be used with primary user-defined networks (UDNs) by using the {oc-first}.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Create a `Namespace` object as a YAML file similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: my-namespace
  labels:
    k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network: "" # <1>
# ...
----
<1> This label is required for the namespace to be associated with a UDN. If the namespace is to be used with an existing cluster UDN, you must also add the appropriate labels that are defined in the `spec.namespaceSelector` field of the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource.

. Apply the `Namespace` manifest by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----
