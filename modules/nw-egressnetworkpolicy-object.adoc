[id="nw-egressnetworkpolicy-object_{context}"]
= {kind} custom resource (CR) object

You can define one or more rules for an egress firewall. A rule is either an `Allow` rule or a `Deny` rule, with a specification for the traffic that the rule applies to.

The following YAML describes an {kind} CR object:

.{kind} object
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]

ifdef::openshift-sdn[]

    ...
----
ifdef::openshift-sdn[]
<1> A name for your egress firewall policy.
<2> A collection of one or more egress network policy rules as described in the following section.
endif::openshift-sdn[]
ifdef::ovn[]
<1> The name for the object must be `default`.
<2> A collection of one or more egress network policy rules as described in the following section.
endif::ovn[]

[id="egressnetworkpolicy-rules_{context}"]
== {kind} rules

The following YAML describes an egress firewall rule object. The user can select either an IP address range in CIDR format, a domain name, or use the `nodeSelector` to allow or deny egress traffic. The `egress` stanza expects an array of one or more objects.

// - OVN-Kubernetes does not support DNS
// - OpenShift SDN does not support port and protocol specification

----
<1> The type of rule. The value must be either `Allow` or `Deny`.
<2> A stanza describing an egress traffic match rule. A value for either the `cidrSelector` field or the `dnsName` field for the rule. You cannot use both fields in the same rule.
<3> An IP address range in CIDR format.

<3> An IP address range in CIDR format.
<4> A DNS domain name.
<5> Labels are key/value pairs that the user defines. Labels are attached to objects, such as pods. The `nodeSelector` allows for one or more node labels to be selected and attached to pods.
<6> Optional: A stanza describing a collection of network ports and protocols for the rule.

ports:

----
<1> A network port, such as `80` or `443`. If you specify a value for this field, you must also specify a value for `protocol`.
<2> A network protocol. The value must be either `TCP`, `UDP`, or `SCTP`.

[id="egressnetworkpolicy-example_{context}"]
== Example {kind} CR objects

The following example defines several egress firewall policy rules:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {api}
kind: {kind}
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  egress: <1>
  - type: Allow
    to:
      cidrSelector: 1.2.3.0/24
ifdef::openshift-sdn[]
  - type: Allow
    to:
      dnsName: www.example.com
endif::openshift-sdn[]
  - type: Deny
    to:
      cidrSelector: 0.0.0.0/0
----
<1> A collection of egress firewall policy rule objects.

ifdef::ovn[]
The following example defines a policy rule that denies traffic to the host at the `172.16.1.1` IP address, if the traffic is using either the TCP protocol and destination port `80` or any protocol and destination port `443`.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {api}
kind: {kind}
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  egress:
  - type: Deny
    to:
      cidrSelector: 172.16.1.1
    ports:
    - port: 80
      protocol: TCP
    - port: 443
----

[id="configuringNodeSelector-example_{context}"]
== Example nodeSelector for {kind}

As a cluster administrator, you can allow or deny egress traffic to nodes in your cluster by specifying a label using `nodeSelector`. Labels can be applied to one or more nodes. The following is an example with the `region=east` label:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {api}
kind: EgressFirewall
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
    egress:
    - to:
        nodeSelector:
          matchLabels:
            region: east
      type: Allow
----

[TIP]
====
Instead of adding manual rules per node IP address, use node selectors to create a label that allows pods behind an egress firewall to access host network pods.
