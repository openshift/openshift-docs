= Adding or updating {aws-short} tags for a hosted cluster

As a cluster instance administrator, you can add or update {aws-first} tags without needing to re-create your hosted cluster. _Tags_ are key-value pairs that are attached to {aws-short} resources for management and automation.

You might want to use tags for the following purposes:

* Managing access controls.
* Tracking chargeback or showback.
* Managing cloud IAM conditional permissions.
* Aggregating resources based on tags. For example, you can query tags to calculate resource usage and billing costs.

You can add or update tags for several different types of resources, including EFS access points, load balancer resources, Amazon EBS volumes, IAM users, and {aws-short} S3.

[IMPORTANT]
====
On network load balancers, tags cannot be added or updated. The {aws-short} load balancer reconciles whatever tags are in the `HostedCluster` resource. If you try to add or update a tag, the load balancer overwrites the tag.

In addition, tags cannot be updated on the default security group resource that is created directly by {hcp}.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must have cluster administrator permissions for your hosted cluster on {aws-short}.

.Procedure

. If you want to add or update tags for EFS access points, complete steps 1 and 2. If you are adding or updating tags for other types of resources, complete only step 2.

.. In the `aws-efs-csi-driver-operator` service account, add two annotations, as shown in the following example. These annotations are required so that the {aws-short} EKS pod identity webhook that runs on the cluster can correctly assign {aws-short} roles to the pods that the EFS Operator uses.

.. Delete the Operator pod or roll out a restart of the `aws-efs-csi-driver-operator` deployment.

. In the `HostedCluster` resource, enter information in the `resourceTags` fields, as shown in the following example:
