= About the AMD GPU Operator

The hardware acceleration capabilities of the AMD GPU Operator provide enhanced performance and cost efficiency for data scientists and developers using Red Hat OpenShift AI for creating artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) applications. Accelerating specific areas of GPU functions can minimize CPU processing and memory usage, improving overall application speed, memory consumption, and bandwdith retrictions.
