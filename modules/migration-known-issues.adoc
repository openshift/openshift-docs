= Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* During migration, the Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool preserves the following namespace annotations:

** `openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs`
** `openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups`
** `openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range`
+
These annotations preserve the UID range, ensuring that the containers retain their file system permissions on the target cluster. There is a risk that the migrated UIDs could duplicate UIDs within an existing or future namespace on the target cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1748440[*BZ#1748440*])

* If an AWS bucket is added to the CAM web console and then deleted, its status remains `True` because the MigStorage CR is not updated. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1738564[*BZ#1738564*])

* Most cluster-scoped resources are not yet handled by the CAM tool. If your applications require cluster-scoped resources, you may have to create them manually on the target cluster.

* If a migration fails, the migration plan does not retain custom PV settings for quiesced pods. You must manually roll back the migration, delete the migration plan, and create a new migration plan with your PV settings. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1784899[*BZ#1784899*])

* If a large migration fails because Restic times out, you can increase the `restic_timeout` parameter value (default: `1h`) in the Migration Controller CR.

* If you select the data verification option for PVs that are migrated with the filesystem copy method, performance is significantly slower. Velero generates a checksum for each file and checks it when the file is restored.

ifdef::migrating-3-4[]
* Migrating workloads from {product-title} 3.7 to {product-version} requires extra steps because certain API `GroupVersionKinds` (GVKs) are deprecated. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1817251[*BZ#1817251*])

* Upgrading the {mtc-short} on an {product-title} 3.7 cluster requires a manual workaround to delete the Velero and Restic resources. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1861971[*BZ#1861971*])

ifdef::migrating-4-2-4[]
* You cannot migrate a namespace that contains imagestreams from {product-title} 4.4 or later. The following error message is displayed in the Velero Pod log: `Error restoring nametags`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1848561[*BZ#1848561*])
