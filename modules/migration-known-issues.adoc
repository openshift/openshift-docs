= Known issues

The following issues will be addressed in a future release:

* When an application is migrated, the CAM preserves the following namespace annotations:

** `openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs`
** `openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups`
** `openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range`
+
These annotations preserve the UID range, ensuring that the containers retain their file system permissions on the target cluster. There is a risk that the migrated UIDs could duplicate UIDs within an existing or future namespace on the target cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1748440[BZ1748440])

* Restic times out when staging a migration of more than 50 projects. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1749831[BZ1749831])
* Currently, when adding an S3 endpoint to the CAM, `https://` is supported only for AWS. For other S3 providers, use `http://`.
