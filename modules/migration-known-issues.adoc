= Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* During migration, the Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool preserves the following namespace annotations:

** `openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs`
** `openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups`
** `openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range`
+
These annotations preserve the UID range, ensuring that the containers retain their file system permissions on the target cluster. There is a risk that the migrated UIDs could duplicate UIDs within an existing or future namespace on the target cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1748440[*BZ#1748440*])

* If an AWS bucket is added to the CAM web console and then deleted, its status remains `True` because the MigStorage CR is not updated. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1738564[*BZ#1738564*])
* Most cluster-scoped resources are not yet handled by the CAM tool. If your applications require cluster-scoped resources, you may have to create them manually on the target cluster.
* If a migration fails, the migration plan does not retain custom PV settings for quiesced pods. You must manually roll back the migration, delete the migration plan, and create a new migration plan with your PV settings. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1784899[*BZ#1784899*])

ifdef::migrating-3-4[]
* In the current release (CAM 1.1.2), you cannot migrate from {product-title} 3.7 to 4.4 because certain APIs, for example, `apps.v1beta1.Deployment`, that are used by the source cluster are deprecated. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1817251[*BZ#1817251*])
