= Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* During migration, the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) preserves the following namespace annotations:

** `openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs`
** `openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups`
** `openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range`
+
These annotations preserve the UID range, ensuring that the containers retain their file system permissions on the target cluster. There is a risk that the migrated UIDs could duplicate UIDs within an existing or future namespace on the target cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1748440[*BZ#1748440*])

* Most cluster-scoped resources are not yet handled by {mtc-short}. If your applications require cluster-scoped resources, you might have to create them manually on the target cluster.
* If a migration fails, the migration plan does not retain custom PV settings for quiesced pods. You must manually roll back the migration, delete the migration plan, and create a new migration plan with your PV settings. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1784899[*BZ#1784899*])

* If a large migration fails because Restic times out, you can increase the `restic_timeout` parameter value (default: `1h`) in the `MigrationController` custom resource (CR) manifest.

* If you select the data verification option for PVs that are migrated with the file system copy method, performance is significantly slower.

* If you are migrating data from NFS storage and `root_squash` is enabled, `Restic` maps to `nfsnobody`. The migration fails and a permission error is displayed in the `Restic` pod log. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1873641[*BZ#1873641*])
+
You can resolve this issue by adding supplemental groups for `Restic` to the `MigrationController` CR manifest:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
...
  restic_supplemental_groups:
  - 5555
  - 6666
----

* If you perform direct volume migration with nodes that are in different availability zones, the migration might fail because the migrated pods cannot access the PVC. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1947487[*BZ#1947487*])
