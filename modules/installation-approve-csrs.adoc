= Approving the CSRs for your machines

When you add machines to a cluster, two pending certificates signing request
(CSRs) are generated for each machine that you added. You must confirm that
these CSRs are approved or, if necessary, approve them yourself.

.Prerequisites

* You added machines to your cluster.
* Install the `jq` package.

.Procedure

. Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:

The output lists all of the machines that you created.

. Review the pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) and ensure that the
you see a client and server request with `Pending` or `Approved` status for
each machine that you added to the cluster:

$ oc get csr

...
----
<1> A client request CSR.
<2> A server request CSR.
+
In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more
approved CSRs in the list.

. If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines
you added are in `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:
+
[NOTE]
====
Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour
of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an
hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be
present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After you
approve the initial CSRs, the subsequent node client CSRs are automatically
approved by the cluster `kube-controller-manager`. You must implement a method
of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests.
====

** To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid
CSR:
+
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

** If all the CSRs are valid, approve them all by running the following
command:
+
----
$ oc get csr -ojson | jq -r '.items[] | select(.status == {} ) | .metadata.name' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
