= About Security Context Constraints

Similar to the way that RBAC resources control user access, administrators can
use _Security Context Constraints_ (SCCs) to control permissions for pods. These
permissions include actions that a _pod_, a collection of containers, can
perform and what resources it can access. You can use SCCs to define a set of
conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
SCCs allow an administrator to control:

- Whether a pod can run privileged containers.
- The capabilities that a container can request.
- The use of host directories as volumes.
- The SELinux context of the container.
- The container user ID.
- The use of host namespaces and networking.
- The allocation of an `FSGroup` that owns the pod's volumes.
- The configuration of allowable supplemental groups.
- Whether a container requires the use of a read only root file system.
- The usage of volume types.
- The configuration of allowable `seccomp` profiles.

////
If you have `cluster-admin` privileges, you can adjust the default SCC policies to
be more permissive.

Docker has a
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities[default list of capabilities]
that are allowed for each container of a pod. The
containers use the capabilities from this default list, but pod manifest authors
can alter it by requesting additional capabilities or removing some of the
default behaviors. Use the `allowedCapabilities`, `defaultAddCapabilities`, and
`requiredDropCapabilities` parameters to control such requests from the
pods and to dictate which capabilities can be requested, which ones must be
added to each container, and which ones must be forbidden.

The cluster contains eight default SCCs:

* `anyuid`
* `hostaccess`
* `hostmount-anyuid`
* `hostnetwork`
+
[WARNING]
====
If additional workloads are run on master hosts, use caution when providing
access to `hostnetwork`. A workload that runs `hostnetwork` on a master host is
effectively root on the cluster and must be trusted accordingly.
====
* `node-exporter`
* `nonroot`
* `privileged`
* `restricted`


[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not modify the default SCCs. Customizing the default SCCs can lead to issues
when {product-title} is upgraded.
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale[]
Instead, create new SCCs.
endif::[]
====

The `privileged` SCC allows:

* Users to run privileged pods
* Pods to mount host directories as volumes
* Pods to run as any user
* Pods to run with any MCS label
* Pods to use the host's IPC namespace
* Pods to use the host's PID namespace
* Pods to use any FSGroup
* Pods to use any supplemental group
* Pods to use any seccomp profiles
* Pods to request any capabilities

The `restricted` SCC:

* Ensures that pods cannot run as privileged.
* Ensures that pods cannot mount host directory volumes.
* Requires that a pod run as a user in a pre-allocated range of UIDs.
* Requires that a pod run with a pre-allocated MCS label.
* Allows pods to use any FSGroup.
* Allows pods to use any supplemental group.

[NOTE]
====
For more information about each SCC, see the `kubernetes.io/description`
annotation available on the SCC.
====

SCCs are composed of settings and strategies that control the security features
a pod has access to. These settings fall into three categories:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|*Controlled by a boolean*
|Fields of this type default to the most restrictive value. For example,
`AllowPrivilegedContainer` is always set to `false` if unspecified.

|*Controlled by an allowable set*
|Fields of this type are checked against the set to ensure their value is
allowed.

|*Controlled by a strategy*
a|Items that have a strategy to generate a value provide:

* A mechanism to generate the value, and
* A mechanism to ensure that a specified value falls into the set of allowable
values.

== SCC Strategies

.RunAsUser

. `MustRunAs` - Requires a `runAsUser` to be configured. Uses the configured
`runAsUser` as the default. Validates against the configured `runAsUser`.
. `MustRunAsRange` - Requires minimum and maximum values to be defined if not
using pre-allocated values. Uses the minimum as the default. Validates against
the entire allowable range.
. `MustRunAsNonRoot` - Requires that the pod be submitted with a non-zero
`runAsUser` or have the `USER` directive defined in the image. No default
provided.
. `RunAsAny` - No default provided. Allows any `runAsUser` to be specified.

.SELinuxContext

. `MustRunAs` - Requires `seLinuxOptions` to be configured if not using
pre-allocated values. Uses `seLinuxOptions` as the default. Validates against
`seLinuxOptions`.
. `RunAsAny` - No default provided. Allows any `seLinuxOptions` to be
specified.

.SupplementalGroups

. `MustRunAs` - Requires at least one range to be specified if not using
pre-allocated values. Uses the minimum value of the first range as the default.
Validates against all ranges.
. `RunAsAny` - No default provided. Allows any `supplementalGroups` to be
specified.

.FSGroup

. `MustRunAs` - Requires at least one range to be specified if not using
pre-allocated values. Uses the minimum value of the first range as the default.
Validates against the first ID in the first range.
. `RunAsAny` - No default provided. Allows any `fsGroup` ID to be specified.

[id="authorization-controlling-volumes_{context}"]
== Controlling volumes

The usage of specific volume types can be controlled by setting the `volumes`
field of the SCC. The allowable values of this field correspond to the volume
sources that are defined when creating a volume:

* *** (a special value to allow the use of all volume types)
* `none` (a special value to disallow the use of all volumes types. Exist only for backwards compatibility)

The recommended minimum set of allowed volumes for new SCCs are `configMap`,
`downwardAPI`, `emptyDir`, `persistentVolumeClaim`, `secret`, and `projected`.

[NOTE]
====
The list of allowable volume types is not exhaustive because new types are
added with each release of {product-title}.
====

[NOTE]
====
For backwards compatibility, the usage of `allowHostDirVolumePlugin` overrides
settings in the `volumes` field. For example, if `allowHostDirVolumePlugin`
is set to false but allowed in the `volumes` field, then the `hostPath`
value will be removed from `volumes`.
====


[id="admission_{context}"]
== Admission
_Admission control_ with SCCs allows for control over the creation of resources
based on the capabilities granted to a user.

In terms of the SCCs, this means that an admission controller can inspect the
user information made available in the context to retrieve an appropriate set of
SCCs. Doing so ensures the pod is authorized to make requests about its
operating environment or to generate a set of constraints to apply to the pod.

The set of SCCs that admission uses to authorize a pod are determined by the
user identity and groups that the user belongs to. Additionally, if the pod
specifies a service account, the set of allowable SCCs includes any constraints
accessible to the service account.

Admission uses the following approach to create the final security context for
the pod:

. Retrieve all SCCs available for use.
. Generate field values for security context settings that were not specified
on the request.
. Validate the final settings against the available constraints.

If a matching set of constraints is found, then the pod is accepted. If the
request cannot be matched to an SCC, the pod is rejected.

A pod must validate every field against the SCC. The following are examples for
just two of the fields that must be validated:

[NOTE]
====
These examples are in the context of a strategy using the preallocated values.
====

*A FSGroup SCC strategy of `MustRunAs`*

If the pod defines a `fsGroup` ID, then that ID must equal the default
`fsGroup` ID. Otherwise, the pod is not validated by that SCC and the next SCC
is evaluated.

If the `SecurityContextConstraints.fsGroup` field has value `RunAsAny`
and the pod specification omits the `Pod.spec.securityContext.fsGroup`,
then this field is considered valid. Note that it is possible that during
validation, other SCC settings will reject other pod fields and thus cause the
pod to fail.

*A `SupplementalGroups` SCC strategy of `MustRunAs`*

If the pod specification defines one or more `supplementalGroups` IDs, then
the pod's IDs must equal one of the IDs in the namespace's
`openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups` annotation. Otherwise, the pod is not
validated by that SCC and the next SCC is evaluated.

If the `SecurityContextConstraints.supplementalGroups` field has value `RunAsAny`
and the pod specification omits the `Pod.spec.securityContext.supplementalGroups`,
then this field is considered valid. Note that it is possible that during
validation, other SCC settings will reject other pod fields and thus cause the
pod to fail.

[id="scc-prioritization_{context}"]
== SCC prioritization

SCCs have a priority field that affects the ordering when attempting to
validate a request by the admission controller. A higher priority
SCC is moved to the front of the set when sorting. When the complete set
of available SCCs are determined they are ordered by:

. Highest priority first, nil is considered a 0 priority
. If priorities are equal, the SCCs will be sorted from most restrictive to least restrictive
. If both priorities and restrictions are equal the SCCs will be sorted by name

By default, the `anyuid` SCC granted to cluster administrators is given priority
in their SCC set. This allows cluster administrators to run pods as any
user by without specifying a `RunAsUser` on the pod's `SecurityContext`. The
administrator may still specify a `RunAsUser` if they wish.
