= Finally tasks

The `finally` tasks are the final set of tasks specified using the `finally` field in the pipeline YAML file. A `finally` task always executes the tasks within the pipeline, irrespective of whether the pipeline runs are executed successfully. The `finally` tasks are executed in parallel after all the pipeline tasks are run, before the corresponding pipeline exits.

You can configure a `finally` task to consume the results of any task within the same pipeline. This approach does not change the order in which this final task is run. It is executed in parallel with other final tasks after all the non-final tasks are executed.

The following example shows a code snippet of the `clone-cleanup-workspace` pipeline. This code clones the repository into a shared workspace and cleans up the workspace. After executing the pipeline tasks, the `cleanup` task specified in the `finally` section of the pipeline YAML file cleans up the workspace.

<2> The shared workspace where the git repository is cloned.
<3> The task to clone the application repository to the shared workspace.
<4> The task to clean-up the shared workspace.
<5> A reference to the task that is to be executed in the task run.
<6> A shared storage volume that a task in a pipeline needs at runtime to receive input or provide output.
<7> A list of parameters required for a task. If a parameter does not have an implicit default value, you must explicitly set its value.
