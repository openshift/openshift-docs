= Generating your own OpenID Connect configuration

You can create your own OpenID Connect (OIDC) configuration before you create your cluster by using the `rosa create oidc-config --mode=auto` command. This command produces an OIDC configuration that is hosted under Red Hat's AWS account. The `rosa` CLI provides some additional options for creating your OIDC configuration.

You can generate managed or unmanaged OIDC configurations. Customer-hosted, or unmanaged, OIDC configurations are stored within your AWS account with the configurations also being flagged for use with {cluster-manager-first}. This process also provides you with a private key to have access to and take ownership of the configurations. Red-Hat hosted, or managed, OIDC configurations are stored within Red Hat's AWS account. This process provides you with private keys for accessing the configuration. 

[NOTE]
====
When using the `--managed` parameter, you can only create a new managed OIDC configuration if there are no unused configurations; all existing OIDC configurations must be attached to a cluster. If you delete all of your clusters with attached managed OIDC configurations, you cannot create a new configuration until the unused one is reused or deleted.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the AWS prerequisites for {hcp} for ROSA.
* You have installed and configured the latest ROSA CLI (`rosa`) on your installation host.

.Procedure

* To create your OIDC configuration alongside the AWS resources, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create oidc-config --mode=auto
----
+
This command returns the following information.
+
.Sample output
+
[source,terminal]
----
I: This command will create a S3 bucket populating it with documents to be compliant with OIDC protocol. It will also create a Secret in Secrets Manager containing the private key
I: Using arn:aws:iam::242819244:role/ManagedOpenShift-Installer-Role for the Installer role
? Prefix for OIDC (optional): 
I: Setting up unmanaged OIDC configuration 'oidc-r7u1'
I: Please run the following command to create a cluster with this oidc config
rosa create cluster --sts --oidc-config-id 233hvnrjoqu14jltk6lhbhf2tj11f8un
I: Creating OIDC provider using 'arn:aws:iam::242819244:user/userName'
? Create the OIDC provider? Yes
I: Created OIDC provider with ARN 'arn:aws:iam::242819244:oidc-provider/oidc-r7u1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'
----

When creating your cluster, you must supply the OIDC config ID. The CLI output provides this value for `--mode auto`, otherwise you must to determine these values based on `aws` CLI output for `--mode manual`.

.Verification

. You can list the possible OIDC configurations available for your clusters that are associated with your user organization. Run the following command:
+ 
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list oidc-config
