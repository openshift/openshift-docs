= Automating virtual machine creation

You can use the `kubevirt_vm` Ansible Playbook to create virtual machines in
your {product-title} cluster using Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

.Prerequisites

* link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-ansible-engine[Red Hat Ansible Engine]
version 2.8 or newer

.Procedure

. Edit an Ansible Playbook YAML file so that it includes the `kubevirt_vm` task:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  kubevirt_vm:
    namespace:
    name:
    cpu_cores:
    memory:
    disks:
      - name:
        volume:
          containerDisk:
            image:
        disk:
          bus:
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This snippet only includes the `kubevirt_vm` portion of the playbook.
====

. Edit the values to reflect the virtual machine you want to create, including the
`namespace`, the number of `cpu_cores`, the `memory`, and the `disks`. For
example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  kubevirt_vm:
    namespace: default
    name: vm1
    cpu_cores: 1
    memory: 64Mi
    disks:
      - name: containerdisk
        volume:
          containerDisk:
            image: kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:latest
        disk:
          bus: virtio
----

. If you want the virtual machine to boot immediately after creation, add
`state: running` to the YAML file. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  kubevirt_vm:
    namespace: default
    name: vm1
    state: running <1>
    cpu_cores: 1
----
<1> Changing this value to `state: absent` deletes the virtual machine, if it
already exists.

.  Run the `ansible-playbook` command, using your playbook's file name as the
only argument:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook create-vm.yaml
----

. Review the output to determine if the play was successful:
+
----
(...)
TASK [Create my first VM] ************************************************************************
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
----

. If you did not include `state: running` in your playbook file and you want to
boot the VM now, edit the file so that it includes `state: running` and run the
playbook again:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook create-vm.yaml
----
