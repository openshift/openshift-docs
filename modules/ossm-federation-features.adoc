= Federation features

[role="_abstract"]
Features of the {ProductName} federated approach to joining meshes include the following:

* Supports common root certificates for each mesh.
* Supports different root certificates for each mesh.
* Mesh administrators manually configure certificate chains, service discovery endpoints, trust domains, and gateways used for interacting with each mesh in the federation.
* Only export/import the services that you want to share between meshes.
** Details about deployed workloads are not visible to other meshes in the federation.
** A service can be *exported* to make it visible to other meshes, allowing requests from workloads in other meshes in the federation.
** A service that has been exported by one mesh in the federation can be *imported* by another mesh, enabling its workloads to send requests to the imported service.
* All communication between meshes is encrypted and utilizes mutual TLS for client verification.
//* Supports configuring failover for a service to a workload that is deployed in another mesh within the federation.
* Supports configuring load balancing across workloads deployed locally and workloads that are deployed in another mesh in the federation.

When a mesh is joined to another mesh it can do the following:

* Provides information to peers in the federated mesh about its own exported services.
* Discover information about services exported by peers in the federated mesh.
