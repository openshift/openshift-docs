= Federation features

[role="_abstract"]
Features of the {ProductName} federated approach to joining meshes include the following:

* Supports common root certificates for each mesh.
* Supports different root certificates for each mesh.
//* Supports rotating any mesh’s intermediate certificate while preserving the federation connection.
* Mesh administrators must manually configure certificate chains, service discovery endpoints, trust domains, etc for meshes outside of the Federated mesh.
* Only export/import the services that you want to share between meshes.
** Defaults to not sharing information about deployed workloads with other meshes in the federation. A service can be *exported* to make it visible to other meshes and allow requests from workloads outside of its own mesh.
** A service that has been exported can be *imported* to another mesh, enabling workloads on that mesh to send requests to the imported service.
* Encrypts communication between meshes at all times.
//* Supports configuring failover from a service that is locally deployed to a service that is deployed in another mesh in the federation.
* Supports configuring load balancing across workloads deployed locally and workloads that are deployed in another mesh in the federation.

When a mesh is joined to another mesh it can do the following:

* Provide trust details about itself to the federated mesh.
* Discover trust details about the federated mesh.
* Provide information to the federated mesh about its own exported services.
* Discover information about services exported by the federated mesh.
