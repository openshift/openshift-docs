= Installing a cluster on a single node
:context: installing-single-node-aws

[role="_abstract"]
Installing {product-title} on a single node alleviates some of the requirements for high availability and large scale clusters. However, you must address requirements for installing on a single node, and the additional requirements for installing {sno} on a cloud provider.

After addressing the requirements for single node installation, use the installing a customized cluster on AWS procedure to install the cluster. The installing single-node OpenShift manually section contains an exemplary `install-config.yaml` file when installing an {product-title} cluster on a single node.
