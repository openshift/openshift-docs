= Hub cluster resource utilization

Resource utilization was measured for deploying hub clusters in the following scenario:

* Under reference load managing 3500 {sno} clusters.
* 3-node compact cluster for management hub running on dual socket bare-metal servers.
* Network impairment of 50 ms round-trip latency, 100 Mbps bandwidth limit and 0.02% packet loss.
* Observability was not enabled.
* Only local storage was used.
