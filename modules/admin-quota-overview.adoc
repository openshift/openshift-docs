= Resources managed by quota

A resource quota, defined by a `ResourceQuota` object, provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per project. It can limit the quantity
of objects that can be created in a project by type, as well as the total amount of compute resources and storage that may be consumed by resources in that project.

The following describes the set of compute resources and object types that may be managed by a quota.

[NOTE]
====
A pod is in a terminal state if `status.phase` is `Failed` or `Succeeded`.

You can configure an object count quota for these standard namespaced resource types using the `count/<resource>.<group>` syntax.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create quota <name> --hard=count/<resource>.<group>=<quota> <1>
----

<1> `<resource>` is the name of the resource, and `<group>` is the API group, if applicable.
Use the `kubectl api-resources` command for a list of resources and their associated API groups.

== Setting resource quota for extended resources

Overcommitment of resources is not allowed for extended resources, so you must specify `requests` and `limits` for the same extended resource in a quota. Currently, only quota items with the prefix `requests.` are allowed for extended resources. The following is an example scenario of how to set resource quota for the GPU resource `nvidia.com/gpu`.

.Procedure

. To determine how many GPUs are available on a node in your cluster, use the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node ip-172-31-27-209.us-west-2.compute.internal | egrep 'Capacity|Allocatable|gpu'
----
+
.Example output

[source,terminal]
----

                    openshift.com/gpu-accelerator=true
Capacity:
 nvidia.com/gpu:  2
Allocatable:
 nvidia.com/gpu:  2
 nvidia.com/gpu:  0           0
----
+
In this example, 2 GPUs are available.

. Use this command to set a quota in the namespace `nvidia`. In this example, the quota is `1`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat gpu-quota.yaml
----
+
.Example output

[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: gpu-quota
  namespace: nvidia
spec:
  hard:
    requests.nvidia.com/gpu: 1

----
. Create the quota with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f gpu-quota.yaml
----
+
.Example output

[source,terminal]
----
resourcequota/gpu-quota created
----
. Verify that the namespace has the correct quota set using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe quota gpu-quota -n nvidia
----
+
.Example output

[source,terminal]
----
Name:                    gpu-quota
Namespace:               nvidia
Resource                 Used  Hard
--------                 ----  ----
requests.nvidia.com/gpu  0     1
----

. Run a pod that asks for a single GPU with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create pod gpu-pod.yaml
----
+
.Example output

[source, terminal]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: gpu-pod-s46h7
  namespace: nvidia
spec:
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
  containers:
  - name: rhel7-gpu-pod
    image: rhel7
    env:
      - name: NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
        value: all
      - name: NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES
        value: "compute,utility"
      - name: NVIDIA_REQUIRE_CUDA
        value: "cuda>=5.0"

    command: ["sleep"]
    args: ["infinity"]

    resources:
      limits:
        nvidia.com/gpu: 1
----

. Verify that the pod is running bwith the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----
+
.Example output

[source, terminal]
----
NAME              READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
gpu-pod-s46h7     1/1       Running     0          1m
----

. Verify that the quota `Used` counter is correct by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe quota gpu-quota -n nvidia
----
+
.Example output

[source, terminal]
----
Name:                    gpu-quota
Namespace:               nvidia
Resource                 Used  Hard
--------                 ----  ----
requests.nvidia.com/gpu  1     1
----

. Using the following command, attempt to create a second GPU pod in the `nvidia` namespace. This is technically available on the node because it has 2 GPUs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f gpu-pod.yaml
----
+
.Example output

[source, terminal]
----
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "gpu-pod.yaml": pods "gpu-pod-f7z2w" is forbidden: exceeded quota: gpu-quota, requested: requests.nvidia.com/gpu=1, used: requests.nvidia.com/gpu=1, limited: requests.nvidia.com/gpu=1
----
+
This `Forbidden` error message occurs because you have a quota of 1 GPU and this pod tried to allocate a second GPU, which exceeds its quota.

== Quota scopes

Each quota can have an associated set of _scopes_. A quota only measures usage for a resource if it matches the intersection of enumerated scopes.

Adding a scope to a quota restricts the set of resources to which that quota can apply. Specifying a resource outside of the allowed set results in a validation error.

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Scope |Description

|`Terminating`
|Match pods where `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds >= 0`.

|`NotTerminating`
|Match pods where `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` is `nil`.

|`BestEffort`
|Match pods that have best effort quality of service for either `cpu` or `memory`.

|`otBestEffort`
|Match pods that do not have best effort quality of service for `cpu` and `memory`.
|===

A `BestEffort` scope restricts a quota to limiting the following resources:

- `pods`

A `Terminating`, `NotTerminating`, and `NotBestEffort` scope restricts a quota to tracking the following resources:

* `pods`
* `memory`
* `requests.memory`
* `limits.memory`
* `cpu`
* `requests.cpu`
* `limits.cpu`
* `ephemeral-storage`
* `requests.ephemeral-storage`
* `limits.ephemeral-storage`

[NOTE]
====
Ephemeral storage requests and limits apply only if you enabled the ephemeral storage technology preview. This feature is disabled by default.
