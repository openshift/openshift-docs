[id="virt-creating-localnet-nad-cli_{context}"]
= Creating a NAD for localnet topology using the CLI

You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) which describes how to attach a pod to the underlying physical network.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have installed the Kubernetes NMState Operator.

.Procedure

. Create a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` object to map the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network to an Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: mapping # <1>
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: '' # <2>
  desiredState:
    ovn:
      bridge-mappings:
      - localnet: localnet-network # <3>
        bridge: br-ex # <4>
        state: present # <5>
----
<1> The name of the configuration object.
<2> Specifies the nodes to which the node network configuration policy is to be applied. The recommended node selector value is `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ''`.
<3> The name of the additional network from which traffic is forwarded to the OVS bridge. This attribute must match the value of the `spec.config.name` field of the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object that defines the OVN-Kubernetes additional network.
<4> The name of the OVS bridge on the node. This value is required if the `state` attribute is `present`.
<5> The state of the mapping. Must be either `present` to add the mapping or `absent` to remove the mapping. The default value is `present`.

[NOTE]
====
{VirtProductName} does not support Linux bridge bonding modes 0, 5, and 6. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/67546[Which bonding modes work when used with a bridge that virtual machine guests or containers connect to?].
====

. Create a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: localnet-network
  namespace: default
spec:
  config: |-
    {
            "cniVersion": "0.3.1", <1>
            "name": "localnet-network", <2>
            "type": "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay", <3>
            "topology": "localnet", <4>
            "netAttachDefName": "default/localnet-network" <5>
    }
----
<1> The CNI specification version. The required value is `0.3.1`.
<2> The name of the network. This attribute must match the value of the `spec.desiredState.ovn.bridge-mappings.localnet` field of the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` object that defines the OVS bridge mapping.
<3> The name of the CNI plug-in to be configured. The required value is `ovn-k8s-cni-overlay`.
<4> The topological configuration for the network. The required value is `localnet`.
<5> The value of the `namespace` and `name` fields in the `metadata` stanza of the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object.

. Apply the manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
