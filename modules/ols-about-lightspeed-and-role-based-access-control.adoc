= About Lightspeed and Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a system security approach to restricting system access to authorized users who have defined roles and permissions. 

{ols-long} RBAC is binary. By default, not all cluster users have access to the {ols-long} interface. Access must be granted by a user who can grant permissions. All users of an {ocp-short-name} cluster with {ols-long} installed can see the {ols-short} button; however, only users with permissions can submit questions to {ols-short}. 

If you want to evaluate the RBAC features of {ols-long}, your cluster will need users other than the `kubeadmin` account. The `kubeadmin` account always has access to {ols-long}.
