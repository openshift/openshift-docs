= Launching an {ibm-title} Secure Execution VM on {ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title}

[role="_abstract"]
Before launching an {ibm-name} Secure Execution VM on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}, you must add the `launchSecurity` parameter to the VM manifest. Otherwise, the VM does not start correctly because it does not have access to the devices.
