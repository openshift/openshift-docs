= Installing the MetalLB Operator from the OperatorHub using the web console

As a cluster administrator, you can install the MetalLB Operator by using the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Optional: Create the required namespace for the MetalLB Operator:
+
[NOTE]
====
You can choose to create the namespace at this stage or you can create it when you start the MetalLB Operator install. From the **Installed Namespace** list you can create the project. 
====


.. Navigate to *Administration* -> *Namespaces* and click *Create Namespace*.

.. Enter `metallb-system` in the *Name* field, and click *Create*.

. Install the MetalLB Operator:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Type `metallb` into the *Filter by keyword* field to find the MetalLB Operator, and then click *Install*.
+
You can also filter options by *Infrastructure Features*. For example, select *Disconnected* if you want to see Operators that work in disconnected environments, also known as restricted network environments.

.. On the *Install Operator* page, select *a specific namespace on the cluster*. Select the namespace created in the earlier section or choose to create the `metallb-system` project, and then click *Install*.

.Verification

To verify that the MetalLB Operator installed successfully:

. Navigate to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.
. Ensure that *MetalLB Operator* is listed in the *metallb-system* project with a *Status* of *Succeeded*.
+
[NOTE]
====
During installation, an Operator might display a *Failed* status. If the installation later succeeds with an *Succeeded* message, you can ignore the *Failed* message.
====
+
. If the Operator installation does not succeed, you can troubleshoot further:
+
.. Navigate to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page and inspect the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors under *Status*.
.. Navigate to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page and check the logs for pods in the `metallb-system` project.
