= Checking the status of Greenboot health checks

Check the status of Greenboot health checks before making changes to the system or during troubleshooting. You can use any of the following commands to help you ensure that Greenboot scripts have finished running.

.Procedure

* To see a report of health check status, use the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ systemctl show --property=SubState --value greenboot-healthcheck.service
----
+
** An output of `start` means that Greenboot checks are still running.
** An output of `exited` means that checks have passed and Greenboot has exited. Greenboot runs the scripts in the `green.d` directory when the system is a healthy state.
** An output of `failed` means that checks have not passed. Greenboot runs the scripts in `red.d` directory when the system is in this state and might restart the system.

* To see a report showing the numerical exit code of the service where `0` means success and non-zero values mean a failure occurred, use the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ systemctl show --property=ExecMainStatus --value greenboot-healthcheck.service
----

* To see a report showing a message about boot status, such as `Boot Status is GREEN - Health Check SUCCESS`, use the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat /run/motd.d/boot-status
----
