= Deleting the community {external-secrets-operator-short}

[role="_abstract"]
Delete the configuration resource for the community Operator so that the legacy application is fully removed. This action prevents conflicts before installing the {external-secrets-operator}.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You must have the `oc` command-line tool installed and configured.

.Procedure

. Find your community Operator's `namespace` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get operatorconfigs.operator.external-secrets.io -A
----
+
The following is an example of finding the `namespace`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE             NAME        AGE
external-secrets      cluster     9m18s
----

. Delete the `operatorconfig` custom resrouce (CR) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete operatorconfig <config_name> -n <operator_namespace>
----

.Verification

. To verify that the `operatorconfig` CR is deleted, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get operatorconfig -n <operator_namespace>
----
+
The command must return `no resource found`.

. To verify that the old webhooks are deleted, run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get validatingwebhookconfigurations | grep external-secrets
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mutatingwebhookconfigurations | grep external-secrets
----
+
The commands must return no results.
