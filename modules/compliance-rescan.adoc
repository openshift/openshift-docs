= Performing a rescan
Typically you will want to re-run a scan on a defined schedule, like every Monday or daily. It can also be useful to re-run a scan once after fixing a problem on a node. To perform a single scan, annotate the scan with the `compliance.openshift.io/rescan=` option:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate compliancescans/<scan_name> compliance.openshift.io/rescan=
----
