= Configuring crun as the default container runtime

The following `ContainerRuntimeConfig` custom resources (CRs) configure crun as the default OCI container runtime for control plane and worker nodes.
The crun container runtime is fast and lightweight and has a low memory footprint.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For optimal performance, enable crun for master and worker nodes in {sno}, {3no}, and standard clusters.
To avoid the cluster rebooting when the CR is applied, apply the change as a {ztp} additional day-0 install-time manifest.
