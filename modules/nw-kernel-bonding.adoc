= Kernel bonding

Kernel bonding is a built-in Linux kernel function where link aggregation can exist among many Ethernet interfaces to create a single logical physical interface. This bonding type does not give the same level of customization as supported OVS bonding.

For `kernel-bonding` mode, the bond interfaces exist outside, which means they are not in the data path, of the bridge interface. Network traffic in this mode is not sent or received on the bond interface port but instead requires additional bridging capabilities for MAC address assignment at the kernel level. 

If you enabled `kernel-bonding` mode on network controller interfaces (NICs) for your nodes, you must specify a Media Access Control (MAC) address failover. This configuration prevents node communication issues with the bond interfaces, such as `eno1f0` and `eno2f0`.
