= AWS SQS with IntegrationSource

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Queue Service (SQS) Kamelet enables you to consume messages from an Amazon SQS queue and forward them into Knative Eventing. This integration allows {ServerlessProductName} applications to react to queued messages, supporting event-driven architectures that decouple producers and consumers.

To configure an `IntegrationSource` for SQS, you must provide valid AWS credentials, specify the Amazon SQS queue Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and its region, and define the event sink, such as a Knative broker. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) uniquely identifies the SQS queue across all AWS accounts and regions.
