= Configuring the distributed units (DUs)

This section describes a set of configurations for an {product-title} cluster so that it meets the feature and performance requirements necessary for running a distributed unit (DU) application. Some of this content must be applied during installation and other configurations can be applied post-install.

After you have installed the {sno} DU, further configuration is needed to enable the platform to carry a DU workload.

The configurations in this section are applied to the cluster after installation in order to configure the cluster for DU workloads.
