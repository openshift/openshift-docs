= Configuring the distributed units (DUs)

This section describes what a DU configuration looks like.

After you have installed the single node distributed unit (DU), further configuration
is needed to enable the platform to carry a DU workload.

The configurations in this section are applied to the cluster after installation in order to
configure the cluster for DU workloads.
