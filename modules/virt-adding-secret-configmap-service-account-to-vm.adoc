= Adding a secret, config map, or service account to a virtual machine

Add a secret, config map, or service account to a virtual machine by using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* The secret, config map, or service account that you want to add must exist in the same namespace as the target virtual machine.

.Procedure

. Click *Workloads* -> *Virtualization* from the side menu.

. Click the *Virtual Machines* tab.

. Select a virtual machine to open the *Virtual Machine Overview* screen.

. Click the *Environment* tab.

. Click *Select a resource* and select a secret, config map, or service account from the list. A six character serial number is automatically
generated for the selected resource.

. Click *Save*.

. Optional. Add another object by clicking *Add Config Map, Secret or Service Account*.

[NOTE]
====
.. You can reset the form to the last saved state by clicking *Reload*.

.. The *Environment* resources are added to the virtual machine as disks. You can mount the secret, config map, or service account as you would mount any other disk.

.. If the virtual machine is running, changes will not take effect until you restart the virtual machine. The newly added resources are marked as pending changes
for both the *Environment* and *Disks* tab in the *Pending Changes* banner at the top of the page.

====

.Verification

. From the *Virtual Machine Overview* page, click the *Disks* tab.

. Check to ensure that the secret, config map, or service account is included in the list of disks.

. Optional. Choose the appropriate method to apply your changes:

.. If the virtual machine is running, restart the virtual machine by clicking *Actions* -> *Restart Virtual Machine*.

.. If the virtual machine is stopped, start the virtual machine by clicking *Actions* -> *Start Virtual Machine*.

You can now mount the secret, config map, or service account as you would mount any other disk.
