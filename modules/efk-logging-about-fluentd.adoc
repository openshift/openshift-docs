= About Fluentd in {product-title}

{product-title} uses Fluentd to collect data about your cluster.

Fluentd is deployed as a DaemonSet in {product-title} that deploys nodes to each OpenShift node.

Fluentd uses `journald` as the system log source. These are log messages from
the operating system, the container runtime, and OpenShift.

The Docker and CRI-O runtimes provide minimal information to identify the source of log messages: namespace, pod name, and container id.
This is not sufficient to uniquely identify the source of the logs. If a pod with a given name and project is deleted before the log collector 
begins processing its logs, there might not be a way to distinguish the log messages from a similarly named pod and project or trace the logs
to their source. 

If you delete a pod before log process is complete, information from the API server (such as labels and annotations) is not be available. This limitation 
means log collection and normalization is considered *best effort*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the available container runtimes provide minimal information to identify the
source of log messages, logs can be written to an index that is not owned by the user who deployed the pod.
