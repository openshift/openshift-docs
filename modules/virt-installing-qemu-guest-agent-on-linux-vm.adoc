[id="virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent-on-linux-vm_{context}"]
= Installing QEMU guest agent on a Linux virtual machine

The `qemu-guest-agent` is widely available and available by default in Red Hat
virtual machines. Install the agent and start the service.

To check if your virtual machine (VM) has the QEMU guest agent installed and running, verify that `AgentConnected` is listed in the VM spec.

[NOTE]
====
To create snapshots of an online (Running state) VM with the highest integrity, install the QEMU guest agent.

The QEMU guest agent takes a consistent snapshot by attempting to quiesce the VMâ€™s file system as much as possible, depending on the system workload. This ensures that in-flight I/O is written to the disk before the snapshot is taken. If the guest agent is not present, quiescing is not possible and a best-effort snapshot is taken. The conditions under which the snapshot was taken are reflected in the snapshot indications that are displayed in the web console or CLI.
====
