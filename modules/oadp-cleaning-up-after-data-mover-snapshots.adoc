= Deleting snapshots in a bucket

Data Mover might leave one or more snapshots in a bucket after a backup. You can either delete all the snapshots or delete individual snapshots.

.Procedure

* To delete all snapshots in your bucket, delete the `/<protected-ns>` folder that is specified in the Data Protection Application (DPA) `.spec.backupLocation.objectStorage.bucket` resource.
*  To delete an individual snapshot:
. Browse to the `/<protected-ns>` folder that is specified in the DPA `.spec.backupLocation.objectStorage.bucket` resource.
. Delete the appropriate folders that are prefixed with `/<volumeSnapshotContent name>-pvc` where `<VolumeSnapshotContent_name>` is the `VolumeSnapshotContent` created by Data Mover per PVC.
