= Extended SELinux policies for virt-launcher pods

The `container_t` SELinux policy for `virt-launcher` pods is extended to enable essential functions of {VirtProductName}.

* The following policy is required for network multi-queue, which enables network performance to scale as the number of available vCPUs increases:

** `allow process self (tun_socket (relabelfrom relabelto attach_queue))` 

* The following policy allows `virt-launcher` to read files under the `/proc` directory, including `/proc/cpuinfo` and `/proc/uptime`:

** `allow process proc_type (file (getattr open read))`

* The following policy allows `libvirtd` to relay network-related debug messages.

** `allow process self (netlink_audit_socket (nlmsg_relay))`
+
[NOTE]
====
Without this policy, any attempt to relay network debug messages is blocked. This might fill the node's audit logs with SELinux denials.
====

* The following policies allow `libvirtd` to access `hugetblfs`, which is required to support huge pages:

** `allow process hugetlbfs_t (dir (add_name create write remove_name rmdir setattr))` 
** `allow process hugetlbfs_t (file (create unlink))`

* The following policies allow `virtiofs` to mount filesystems and access NFS:

** `allow process nfs_t (dir (mounton))`
** `allow process proc_t (dir (mounton))`
** `allow process proc_t (filesystem (mount unmount))`
