= Extended SELinux policies for virt-launcher pods

The `container_t` SELinux policy for virt-launcher pods is extended with the following rules:

* `allow process self (tun_socket (relabelfrom relabelto attach_queue))`
* `allow process sysfs_t (file (write))`
* `allow process hugetlbfs_t (dir (add_name create write remove_name rmdir setattr))`
* `allow process hugetlbfs_t (file (create unlink))`

These rules enable the following virtualization features:

* Relabel and attach queues to its own TUN sockets, which is required to support network multi-queue. Multi-queue enables network performance to scale as the number of available vCPUs increases.

* Allows virt-launcher pods to write information to sysfs (`/sys`) files, which is required to enable Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV).

* Read/write `hugetlbfs` entries, which is required to support huge pages. Huge pages are a method of managing large amounts of memory by increasing the memory page size.
