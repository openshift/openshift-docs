= Access the default Argo CD instance

After analyzing the default Argo CD instance details, you can access it through the Argo CD UI to check whether it is available for use.

.Prerequisite

* You have your login credentials to access the {OCP} cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.


.Procedure

. Click the **Application Launcher** menu in the top right corner of the {OCP} web console.
. Select **Cluster Argo CD** from the dropdown list. The Argo CD login page opens.
. Click the **LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT** button. The {OCP} login page opens.
. Enter your {OCP} credentials. The **Authorize Access** page opens.
. Click **Allow selected permissions** to provide requested permission. The Argo CD UI page opens.

At this point, the UI is empty as you have not created any Argo CD applications. You can check the **User Info** page to view the user details.
