= Removing a local volume or local volume set

Occasionally, you need to delete local volumes (LVs) and local volume sets (LVSs). 

.Prerequisites

* The persistent volume (PV) must be in a `Released` or `Available` state.
+
[WARNING]
====
Deleting a persistent volume that is still in use can result in data loss or corruption.
====

.Procedure

To delete LVs or LVSs, complete the following steps:

. If there are any bound PVs owned by the LV or LVS that is being deleted, delete the corresponding persistent volume claims (PVCs) to release the PVs:

.. To find bound PVs owned by a particular LV or LVS, run the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get pv --selector storage.openshift.com/owner-name=<LV_LVS_name> <1>
----
<1> `<LV_LVS_name>` is the name of the LV or LVS.
+

Bound PVs have a status of `Bound` and their corresponding PVCs appear in the `CLAIM` column. In the preceding example, PV `local-pv-1cec77cf` is bound, and its PVC is `openshift/storage`.

.. Delete corresponding PVCs of bound PVs owned by the LV or LVS being deleted by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc delete pvc <name>
----
+ 
In this example, you would delete PVC `openshift/storage`.

. Delete the LVs or LVSs by running the applicable following command:
+
.Command for deleting LV
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete lv <name>
----
+
or
+
.Command for deleting LVS
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete lvs <name>
----

. If any PV owned by the LV or LVS has a `Retain` reclaim policy, back up any important data, and then delete the PV:
+
[NOTE]
====
PVs with a `Delete` policy are automatically deleted when you delete the LVs or LVS.
====
+
.. To find PVs with `Retain` reclaim policy, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pv

----
+
In this example,  PV `local-pv-1cec77cf` has a `Retain` reclaim policy and needs to be manually deleted.

.. Back up any important data on this volume.

.. Delete the PV by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pv <name>

In this example, delete PV `local-pv-1cec77cf`.
