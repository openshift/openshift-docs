= Removing a local volume

Occasionally, local volumes must be deleted. While removing the entry in the LocalVolume resource and deleting the PersistentVolume is typically enough, if you want to re-use the same device path or have it managed by a different StorageClass, then additional steps are needed.

[WARNING]
====
The following procedure involves accessing a node as the root user. Modifying the state of the node beyond the steps in this procedure could result in cluster instability.
====

.Prerequisite

* The PersistentVolume must be in a `Released` or `Available` state.
+
[WARNING]
====
Deleting a PersistentVolume that is still in use can result in data loss or corruption.
====

.Procedure

. Edit the previously created LocalVolume to remove any unwanted disks.

.. Edit the cluster resource:
+
----
$ oc edit localvolume <name> -n local-storage
----

.. Navigate to the lines under `devicePaths`, and delete any representing unwanted disks.

. Delete any PersistentVolumes created.
+
----
$ oc delete pv <pv-name>
----

. Delete any symlinks on the node.
.. Create a debug pod on the node:
+
----
$ oc debug node/<node-name>
----

.. Change your root directory to the host:
+
----
$ chroot /host
----

.. Navigate to the directory containing the local volume symlinks.
+
----
$ cd /mnt/local-storage/<sc-name> <1>
----
<1> The name of the StorageClass used to create the local volumes.

.. Delete the symlink belonging to the removed device.
+
----
$ rm <symlink>
----
