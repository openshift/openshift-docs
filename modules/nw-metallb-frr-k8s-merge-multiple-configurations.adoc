= How FRR-K8s merges multiple configurations

[role="_abstract"]
FRR-K8s uses an additive merge strategy when multiple users configure the same node. By using FRR-K8s, you can extend existing configurations, such as adding neighbors or prefixes, but prevent the removal of components defined by other sources.

Configuration conflicts::

Certain configurations can cause conflicts, leading to errors, for example:

* different ASN for the same router (in the same VRF)
* different ASN for the same neighbor (with the same IP / port)
* multiple BFD profiles with the same name but different values

When the daemon finds an invalid configuration for a node, it reports the configuration as invalid and reverts to the previous valid `FRR` configuration.

Merging::

When merging, iyou can complete the following actions:

* Extend the set of IP addresses that you want to advertise to a neighbor.
* Add an extra neighbor with its set of IP addresses.
* Extend the set of IP addresses to which you want to associate a community.
* Allow incoming routes for a neighbor.

Each configuration must be self contained. This means, for example, that you cannot allow prefixes that are not defined in the router section by leveraging prefixes coming from another configuration.

If the configurations to be applied are compatible, merging works as follows:

* `FRR-K8s` combines all the routers.
* `FRR-K8s` merges all prefixes and neighbors for each router.
* `FRR-K8s` merges all filters for each neighbor.

[NOTE]
====
A less restrictive filter has precedence over a stricter one. For example, a filter accepting some prefixes has precedence over a filter not accepting any, and a filter accepting all prefixes has precedence over one that accepts some.
