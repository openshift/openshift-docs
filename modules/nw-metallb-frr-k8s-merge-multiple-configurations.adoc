= How FRR-K8s merges multiple configurations

In a case where multiple users add configurations that select the same node, `FRR-K8s` merges the configurations.
Each configuration can only extend others. 
This means that it is possible to add a new neighbor to a router, or to advertise an additional prefix to a neighbor, but not possible to remove a component added by another configuration.

== Configuration conflicts

Certain configurations can cause conflicts, leading to errors, for example:

* different ASN for the same router (in the same VRF)
* different ASN for the same neighbor (with the same IP / port)
* multiple BFD profiles with the same name but different values

When the daemon finds an invalid configuration for a node, it reports the configuration as invalid and reverts to the previous valid `FRR` configuration.

== Merging

When merging, it is possible to do the following actions:

* Extend the set of IPs that you want to advertise to a neighbor.
* Add an extra neighbor with its set of IPs.
* Extend the set of IPs to which you want to associate a community.
* Allow incoming routes for a neighbor.

Each configuration must be self contained. This means, for example, that it is not possible to allow prefixes that are not defined in the router section by leveraging prefixes coming from another configuration.

If the configurations to be applied are compatible, merging works as follows:

* `FRR-K8s` combines all the routers.
* `FRR-K8s` merges all prefixes and neighbors for each router.
* `FRR-K8s` merges all filters for each neighbor.

[NOTE]
====
A less restrictive filter has precedence over a stricter one. For example, a filter accepting some prefixes has precedence over a filter not accepting any, and a filter accepting all prefixes has precedence over one that accepts some.
