= Reference specifications for the image-based-config.yaml manifest

The following content describes the specifications for the `image-based-config.yaml` manifest. 

The `openshift-install` program uses the `image-based-config.yaml` manifest to create a site-specific configuration ISO for image-based deployments of {sno}. 

.Required specifications

        state: up
        ...

If you require static networking, you must install the `nmstatectl` library on the host that creates the live installation ISO. For further information about defining network configurations by using `nmstate`, see link:https://nmstate.io/[nmstate.io].
[IMPORTANT]

The name of the interface must match the actual NIC name as shown in the operating system.
