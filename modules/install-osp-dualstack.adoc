= Optional: Configuring a cluster with dual-stack networking

:FeatureName: Dual-stack configuration for OpenStack

You can create a dual-stack cluster on {rh-openstack}. However, the dual-stack configuration is enabled only if you are using an {rh-openstack} network with IPv4 and IPv6 subnets.

[NOTE]
====
{rh-openstack} does not support the conversion of an IPv4 single-stack cluster to a dual-stack cluster network.
