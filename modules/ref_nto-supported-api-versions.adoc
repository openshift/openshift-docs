= Supported performance profile API versions

[role="_abstract"]
The Node Tuning Operator supports v2, v1, and v1alpha1 API versions for performance profiles, with v2 adding the globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing field for IRQ management.

The Node Tuning Operator supports `v2`, `v1`, and `v1alpha1` for the performance profile `apiVersion` field. The v1 and v1alpha1 APIs are identical. The v2 API includes an optional boolean field `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` with a default value of `false`.
