= Collecting {logging} data

You can use the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command to collect information about {logging}.

.Procedure

To collect {logging} information with `must-gather`:

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` information.

. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command against the {logging} image:
+
If you are using OKD:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=quay.io/openshift/origin-cluster-logging-operator
----
+
Otherwise:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=$(oc -n openshift-logging get deployment.apps/cluster-logging-operator -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name == "cluster-logging-operator")].image}')
----
+
The `must-gather` tool creates a new directory that starts with `must-gather.local` within the current directory. For example:
`must-gather.local.4157245944708210408`.

. Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory that was just created. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar -cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather.local.4157245944708210408
----

. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].
