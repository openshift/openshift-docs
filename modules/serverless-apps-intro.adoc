= Serverless applications using Knative services

To deploy a serverless application using {ServerlessProductName}, you must create a _Knative service_.
Knative services are Kubernetes services, defined by a route and a configuration, and contained in a YAML file.

.Example Knative service YAML
[source,yaml]

  name: hello <1>
  namespace: default <2>

  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: docker.io/openshift/hello-openshift <3>
          env:
            - name: RESPONSE <4>
              value: "Hello Serverless!"
----

<1> The name of the application.
<2> The namespace the application will use.

You can create a serverless application by using one of the following methods:

* Create a Knative service from the {product-title} web console.
* Create a Knative service using the `kn` CLI.
