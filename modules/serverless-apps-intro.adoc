= Serverless applications using Knative Services

To deploy a serverless application using {ServerlessProductName}, you must create a _Knative Service_.
Knative Services are Kubernetes Services, defined by a Route and a Configuration contained in a YAML file.

    spec:
      containers:
        - image: docker.io/openshift/hello-openshift <3>
          env:
            - name: RESPONSE <4>
              value: "Hello Serverless!"

<1> The name of the application.
<2> The namespace the application will use.

You can create a serverless application by using one of the following methods:
