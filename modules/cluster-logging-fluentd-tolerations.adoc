= Using tolerations to control the log collector pod placement

You can ensure which nodes the logging collector pods run on
using tolerations on the pods.

You apply tolerations to logging collector pods through the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR)
and apply taints to a node through the node specification. A taint on a node 
instructs the node to repel all pods that do not tolerate the taint.

By default, the logging collector pods have the following toleration:

[source, yaml]
----
tolerations:
- effect: "NoExecute"
  key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
  operator: "Exists"
----

.Prerequisites

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

.Procedure

. Use the following command to add a taint to a node where you want logging collector pods scheduled:
+
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoExecute
----
+
This example places a taint on `node1` that has key `key1`, value `value1`, and taint effect `NoExecute`.
Nodes with the `NoExecute` taint schedule only pods that match the taint and removes existing pods
that do not match.

. Edit the `collection` section of the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) to configure a toleration for the logging collector pods:
+
[source, yaml]
----
  collection:
    logs:
      type: "rsyslog"
      rsyslog:
        tolerations: 
        - key: "logging"  <1>
          operator: "Exists"  <2>
          effect: "NoExecute"  <3>
          tolerationSeconds: 6000  <4>
----
<1> Specify the key you added to the node.
<2> Specify the `Exists` operator to require the `key`/`value`/`effect` parameters to match. 
<3> Specify the `NoExecute` effect.
<4> Optionally, specify the `tolerationSeconds` parameter to set how long a pod can remain bound to a node before being evicted.

This toleration matches the taint created by the `oc adm taint` command above. A pod this toleration would be able to schedule onto `node1`.
