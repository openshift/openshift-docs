= Allowing insecure registries

You can add insecure registries, and optionally an individual repository within a registry, by editing the `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` custom resource (CR). {product-title} applies the changes to this CR to all nodes in the cluster.

Registries that do not use valid SSL certificates or do not require HTTPS connections are considered insecure.

[WARNING]
====
Insecure external registries should be avoided to reduce possible security risks.
====

.Procedure

* Edit the `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` custom resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit image.config.openshift.io/cluster
----
+
The following is an example `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` CR with an insecure registries list:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Image
metadata:
  annotations:
    release.openshift.io/create-only: "true"
  creationTimestamp: "2019-05-17T13:44:26Z"
  generation: 1
  name: cluster
  resourceVersion: "8302"
  selfLink: /apis/config.openshift.io/v1/images/cluster
  uid: e34555da-78a9-11e9-b92b-06d6c7da38dc
spec:
  registrySources: <1>
    insecureRegistries: <2>
    - insecure.com
    - reg4.io/myrepo/myapp:latest
    allowedRegistries:
    - example.com
    - quay.io
    - registry.redhat.io
    - insecure.com <3>
    - reg4.io/myrepo/myapp:latest
    - image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000
status:
  internalRegistryHostname: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000
----
<1> Contains configurations that determine how the container runtime should treat individual registries when accessing images for builds and pods. It does not contain configuration for the internal cluster registry.
<2> Specify an insecure registry. You can specify a repository in that registry.
<3> Ensure that any insecure registries are included in the `allowedRegistries` list.
+
[NOTE]
====
When the `allowedRegistries` parameter is defined, all registries, including the registry.redhat.io and quay.io registries and the default {product-registry}, are blocked unless explicitly listed. If you use the parameter, to prevent pod failure, add all registries including the `registry.redhat.io` and `quay.io` registries and the `internalRegistryHostname` to the `allowedRegistries` list, as they are required by payload images within your environment. For disconnected clusters, mirror registries should also be added.
====
+
The Machine Config Operator (MCO) watches the `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` CR for any changes to the registries, then drains and uncordons the nodes when it detects changes. After the nodes return to the `Ready` state, changes to the insecure and blocked registries appear in the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file on each node.

.Verification

* To check that the registries have been added to the policy file, use the following command on a node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat /etc/containers/registries.conf
----
+
The following example indicates that images from the `insecure.com` registry is insecure and is allowed for image pulls and pushes.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]

[[registry]]
  prefix = ""
  location = "insecure.com"
  insecure = true
----
