= Creating the ClusterGroupUpgrade CR

You can control cluster updates with the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CRs. 

.Prerequisites

* Install the Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator.
* Provision one or more managed clusters.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Create RHACM policies in the Hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Save the following YAML file in the `cgu-upgrade-complete.yaml` file.

== About the auto-created ClusterGroupUpgrade CR for ZTP

TALO has a controller called `ManagedClusterForCGU` that monitors the `Ready` state of the `ManagedCluster` CRs on the Hub cluster and creates the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CRs for ZTP (zero touch provisioning).

For any managed cluster in the `Ready` state without a "ztp-done" label applied, the `ManagedClusterForCGU` controller automatically creates a `ClusterGroupCluster` CR in the `ztp-install` namespace with its associated {rh-rhacm} policies that are created during the ZTP process. TALO then remediates the set of configuration policies that are listed in the auto-created `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR to push the configuration CRs to the managed cluster.

[NOTE]
====
If the managed cluster has no bound policies when the cluster becomes `Ready`, no `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is created.
