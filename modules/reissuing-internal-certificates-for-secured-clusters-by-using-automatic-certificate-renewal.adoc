= Reissuing internal certificates for secured clusters by using automatic certificate renewal

Secured clusters contain the Collector, Sensor, Admission Control, and local Scanner components. You can reissue internal certificates for these components by using automatic certificate renewal.

TLS certificates are automatically renewed several months in advance but are only loaded when {product-title-short} pods restart, for example, during an upgrade.
