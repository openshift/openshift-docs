= About setting limits on audit log files

Controlling the rotation and retention of the audit log file by using configuration values helps keep the limited storage capacities of far-edge devices from being exceeded. On such devices, logging data accumulation can limit host system or cluster workloads, potentially causing the device stop working. Setting audit log policies can help ensure that critical processing space is continually available.

The values you set to limit audit logs enable you to enforce the size, number, and age limits of audit log backups. Field values are processed independently of one another and without prioritization.

You can set fields in combination to define a maximum storage limit for retained logs. For example:

* Set both `maxFileSize` and `maxFiles` to create a log storage upper limit.
* Set a `maxFileAge` value to automatically delete files older than the timestamp in the file name, regardless of the `maxFiles` value.

[id="Default-audit-log-values_{context}"]
== Default audit log values

{microshift-short} includes the following default audit log rotation values:

* `maxFileSize`: 200Mb
* `maxFiles`: 10 files
* `maxFileAge`: 0, This value means that no default age limit is set.
* `profile`: Default, This profile logs only metadata for read and write requests.

The maximum default storage usage for audit log retention is 2000Mb, provided that there are 10 or fewer files.

If you do not specify a value for a field, the default value is used. If you remove a previously set field value, the default value is restored after the next {microshift-short} service restart.
