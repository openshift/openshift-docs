= Configuring MetalLB with secondary networks

From {product-title} 4.14 the default network behavior is to not allow forwarding of IP packets between network interfaces. Therefore, when MetalLB is configured on a secondary interface, you need to add a machine configuration to enable IP forwarding for only the required interfaces. 
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} clusters upgraded from 4.13 are not affected because a global parameter is set during upgrade to enable global IP forwarding. 
====

To enable IP forwarding for the secondary interface, you have two options: 

* Enable IP forwarding for all interfaces.
* Enable IP forwarding for a specific interface. 
+
[NOTE]
====
Enabling IP forwarding for a specific interface provides more granular control, while enabling it for all interfaces applies a global setting.
====

.Procedure

. Enable forwarding for a specific secondary interface, such as `bridge-net` by creating and applying a `MachineConfig` CR. 

.. Create the `MachineConfig` CR to enable IP forwarding for the specified secondary interface named `bridge-net`.

.. Save the following YAML in the `enable-ip-forward.yaml` file:
