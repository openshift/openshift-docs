= Downloading the RHCOS cluster image

Prism Central requires access to the {op-system-first} image to install the cluster. You can use the installation program to locate and download the {op-system} image and make it available through an internal HTTP server or Nutanix Objects.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} installation program and the pull secret for your cluster. For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host.

.Procedure

. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install coreos print-stream-json
----

. Use the output of the command to find the location of the Nutanix image, and click the link to download it.
