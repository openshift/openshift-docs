== Purpose

The Prometheus Operator for Kubernetes provides easy monitoring definitions for
Kubernetes services and deployment and management of Prometheus instances.

Once installed, the Prometheus Operator provides the following features:

* Create and Destroy: Easily launch a Prometheus instance for your Kubernetes
namespace, a specific application or team easily using the Operator.

* Simple Configuration: Configure the fundamentals of Prometheus like versions,
persistence, retention policies, and replicas from a native Kubernetes resource.

* Target Services via Labels: Automatically generate monitoring target
configurations based on familiar Kubernetes label queries; no need to learn a
Prometheus specific configuration language.
