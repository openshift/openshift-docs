= Failure domains for Nutanix clusters

To add or update the failure domain configuration on a Nutanix cluster, you must make coordinated changes to several resources.
The following actions are required:

. Modify the cluster infrastructure custom resource (CR).

. Modify the cluster control plane machine set CR.

. Modify or replace the compute machine set CRs.

For more information, see "Adding failure domains to an existing Nutanix cluster" in the _Post-installation configuration_ content.
