= Understanding managing application memory

It is recommended to fully read the overview of how {product-title} manages
Compute Resources before proceeding.

For each kind of resource (memory, CPU, storage), {product-title} allows
optional *request* and *limit* values to be placed on each container in a
pod.

Note the following about memory requests and memory limits:

* *Memory request*

  - The memory request value, if specified, influences the {product-title}
    scheduler. The scheduler considers the memory request when scheduling a
    container to a node, then fences off the requested memory on the chosen node
    for the use of the container.

  - If a node's memory is exhausted, {product-title} prioritizes evicting its
    containers whose memory usage most exceeds their memory request. In serious
    cases of memory exhaustion, the node OOM killer may select and kill a
    process in a container based on a similar metric.

  - The cluster administrator can assign quota or assign default values for the memory request value.

  - The cluster administrator can override the memory request values that a developer specifies, to manage cluster overcommit.

* *Memory limit*

  - The memory limit value, if specified, provides a hard limit on the memory
    that can be allocated across all the processes in a container.

  - If the memory allocated by all of the processes in a container exceeds the
    memory limit, the node Out of Memory (OOM) killer will immediately select and kill a
    process in the container.

  - If both memory request and limit are specified, the memory limit value must
    be greater than or equal to the memory request.

  - The cluster administrator can assign quota or assign default values for the memory limit value.

  - The minimum memory limit is 12 MB. If a container fails to start due to a `Cannot allocate memory` pod event, the memory limit is too low.
Either increase or remove the memory limit. Removing the limit allows pods to consume unbounded node resources.

== Managing application memory strategy

The steps for sizing application memory on {product-title} are as follows:

. *Determine expected container memory usage*
+
Determine expected mean and peak container memory usage, empirically if
necessary (for example, by separate load testing). Remember to consider all the
processes that may potentially run in parallel in the container: for example,
does the main application spawn any ancillary scripts?

. *Determine risk appetite*
+
Determine risk appetite for eviction. If the risk appetite is low, the
container should request memory according to the expected peak usage plus a
percentage safety margin. If the risk appetite is higher, it may be more
appropriate to request memory according to the expected mean usage.

. *Set container memory request*
+
Set container memory request based on the above. The more accurately the
request represents the application memory usage, the better. If the request is
too high, cluster and quota usage will be inefficient. If the request is too
low, the chances of application eviction increase.

. *Set container memory limit, if required*
+
Set container memory limit, if required. Setting a limit has the effect of
immediately killing a container process if the combined memory usage of all
processes in the container exceeds the limit, and is therefore a mixed blessing.
On the one hand, it may make unanticipated excess memory usage obvious early
("fail fast"); on the other hand it also terminates processes abruptly.
+
Note that some {product-title} clusters may require a limit value to be set;
some may override the request based on the limit; and some application images
rely on a limit value being set as this is easier to detect than a request
value.
+
If the memory limit is set, it should not be set to less than the expected peak
container memory usage plus a percentage safety margin.

. *Ensure application is tuned*
+
Ensure application is tuned with respect to configured request and limit values,
if appropriate. This step is particularly relevant to applications which pool
memory, such as the JVM. The rest of this page discusses this.
