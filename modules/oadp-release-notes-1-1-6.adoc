== Resolved issues

.Restic restore partially failing due to Pod Security standard

OCP 4.14 introduced pod security standards that meant the `privileged` profile is `enforced`. In previous releases of OADP, this profile caused the pod to receive `permission denied` errors. This issue was caused because of the restore order. The pod was created before the security context constraints (SCC) resource. As this pod violated the pod security standard, the pod was denied and subsequently failed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2420[OADP-2420]


.Restore partially failing for job resource

In previous releases of OADP, the restore of job resource was partially failing in OCP 4.14. This issue was not seen in older OCP versions. The issue was caused by an additional label being to the job resource, which was not present in older OCP versions. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2530[OADP-2530]
