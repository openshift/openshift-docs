[id="kmm-building-and-signing-a-moduleloader-container-image_{context}"]
= Building and signing a ModuleLoader container image

Use this procedure if you have source code and must build your image first.

The following YAML file builds a new container image using the source code from the repository. The image produced is saved back in the registry with a temporary name, and this temporary image is then signed using the parameters in the `sign` section.

The temporary image name is based on the final image name and is set to be `<containerImage>:<tag>-<namespace>_<module name>_kmm_unsigned`.

For example, using the following YAML file, Kernel Module Management (KMM) builds an image named `example.org/repository/minimal-driver:final-default_example-module_kmm_unsigned` containing the build with unsigned kmods and push it to the registry. Then it creates a second image named `example.org/repository/minimal-driver:final` that contains the signed kmods. It is this second image that is loaded by the `DaemonSet` object and deploys the kmods to the cluster nodes.

After it is signed, the temporary image can be safely deleted from the registry. It will be rebuilt, if needed.

.Prerequisites

* The `keySecret` and `certSecret` secrets have been created.

.Procedure

. Apply the YAML file:

<1> `namespace` - Replace `default` with a valid namespace.

<2> `serviceAccountName` - The default `serviceAccountName` does not have the required permissions to run a module that is privileged. For information on creating a service account, see "Creating service accounts" in the "Additional resources" of this section.

<3> `imageRepoSecret` - Used as `imagePullSecrets` in the `DaemonSet` object and to pull and push for the build and sign features.
