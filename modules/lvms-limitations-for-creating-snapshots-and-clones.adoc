= Limitations for creating volume snapshots and volume clones

{lvms} has the following limitations for creating volume snapshots and volume clones in multi-node topology:

* Creating volume snapshots and volume clones is based on the LVM thin pool capabilities.
* The node must have additional storage after creating a volume snapshot and volume clone for further updating the original data source.
* You can create volume snapshots and volume clones only on the node where you have deployed the original data source.
* Pods relying on the persistent volume claim (PVC) that uses the snapshot data and clone data can be scheduled only on the node where you have deployed the original data source.
* If the PVC is not present and available before creating a volume snapshot or volume clone, then the scheduler in multi-node {product-title} clusters does not provision the volume snapshots and volume clones on the node where you have deployed the original data source.
