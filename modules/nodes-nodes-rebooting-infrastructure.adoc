= About rebooting nodes running critical infrastructure

When rebooting nodes that host critical {product-title} infrastructure components, such as router pods, registry pods, and monitoring pods, ensure that there are at least three nodes available to run these components.

The following scenario demonstrates how service interruptions can occur with applications running on {product-title} when only two nodes are available:

- Node A is marked unschedulable and all pods are evacuated.
- The registry pod running on that node is now redeployed on node B. Node B is now running both registry pods.
- Node B is now marked unschedulable and is evacuated.
- The service exposing the two pod endpoints on node B loses all endpoints, for a brief period of time, until they are redeployed to node A.

When using three nodes for infrastructure components, this process does not result in a service disruption. However, due to pod scheduling, the last node that is evacuated and brought back into rotation does not have a registry pod. One of the other nodes has two registry pods. To schedule the third registry pod on the last node, use pod anti-affinity to prevent the scheduler from locating two registry pods on the same node.
