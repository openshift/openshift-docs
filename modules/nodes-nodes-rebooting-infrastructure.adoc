= About master node rebooting

Master nodes are nodes that are labeled to run pieces of the
{product-title} environment. Currently, the easiest way to manage master node reboots
is to ensure that there are at least three master nodes available.

The scenario below demonstrates a common mistake that can lead
to service interruptions for the applications running on {product-title} when
only two master nodes are available.

- Node A is marked unschedulable and all pods are evacuated.
- The registry pod running on that node is now redeployed on node B. This means
node B is now running both registry pods.
- Node B is now marked unschedulable and is evacuated.
- The service exposing the two pod endpoints on node B, for a brief period of
   time, loses all endpoints until they are redeployed to node A.

The same process using three master nodes does not result in a service
disruption. However, due to pod scheduling, the last node that is evacuated and
brought back in to rotation is left running zero registries. The other two nodes
will run two and one registries respectively. The best solution is to rely on
pod anti-affinity.
