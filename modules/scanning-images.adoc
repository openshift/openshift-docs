= Scanning images

[role="_abstract"]
Central submits image scanning requests to Scanner.
Upon receiving these requests, Scanner pulls the image layers from the relevant registry, checks the images, and identifies installed packages in each layer.
Then it compares the identified packages and programming language-specific dependencies with the vulnerability lists and sends information back to Central.

You can also integrate {product-title} with another vulnerability scanner.

Scanner identifies the vulnerabilities in the:

* base image operating system
* packages that are installed by the package managers
* programming language specific dependencies
* programming runtimes and frameworks

[discrete]
== Supported package formats

Scanner can check for vulnerabilities in images that use the following package formats:

* yum
* microdnf
* apt
* apk
* dpkg
* rpm

[discrete]
== Supported programming languages

Scanner can check for vulnerabilities in depnendencies for the following programming languages:

* Java
* JavaScript
* Python
* Ruby

[discrete]
== Supported runtimes and frameworks

Beginning from {product-title} 3.0.50 (Scanner version 2.5.0), Scanner identifies vulnerabilities in the following developer platforms:

* .NET Core
* ASP.NET Core

[discrete]
== Supported operating systems

The supported platforms listed in this section are the distributions in which Scanner identifies vulnerabilities, and it is different from the supported platforms on which you can install {product-title}.

Scanner identifies vulnerabilities in images that contain the following Linux distributions:

[NOTE]
====
* Scanner does not support the Fedora operating system because Fedora does not maintain a vulnerability database.
However, Scanner still detects language-specific vulnerabilities in Fedora-based images.
* Scanner also identifies vulnerabilities in the following images.
However, the vulnerability sources are not updated anymore by their vendor:
