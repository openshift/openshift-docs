= Scanning images

[role="_abstract"]

Scanner V4 is the default scanner for {product-title-short}. When scanning, it performs the following actions:

* Central requests the Scanner V4 Indexer to download and index (analyze) given images.
* Scanner V4 Indexer pulls image metadata from registries to determine the layers of the image, and downloads each previously unindexed layer.
* Scanner V4 Indexer requests mapping files from Central that assist the indexing process. Scanner V4 Indexer produces in an index report.
* Central requests that Scanner V4 Matcher match given images to known vulnerabilities. This process results in the final scan result: a vulnerability report. Scanner V4 Matcher requests the latest vulnerabilities from Central.
* Scanner V4 Matcher requests the results of the image indexing, the index report, from Scanner V4 Indexer. It then uses the report to determine relevant vulnerabilities. This interaction occurs only when the image is indexed in the Central cluster. This interaction does not occur when Scanner V4 is matching vulnerabilities for images indexed in secured clusters.
* The Indexer stores data in the Scanner V4 DB that is related to the indexing results to ensure that image layers are only downloaded and indexed once. This prevents unnecessary network traffic and other resource utilization.
* When secured cluster scanning is enabled, Sensor requests Scanner V4 to index images. Scanner V4 Indexer requests mapping files from Sensor that assist the indexing process unless Central exists in the same namespace. In that case, Central is contacted instead.

[id="common-scanner-warning-messages_{context}"]
== Understanding and addressing common Scanner warning messages

When scanning images with {rh-rhacs-first}, you might see the `CVE DATA MAY BE INACCURATE` warning message.
Scanner displays this message when it cannot retrieve complete information about the operating system or other packages in the image.

The following table shows some common Scanner warning messages:

.Warning messages
[%autowidth]
|===
| *Message* | *Description*

|`Unable to retrieve the OS CVE data, only Language CVE data is available`
|Indicates that Scanner does not officially support the base operating system of the image; therefore, it cannot retrieve CVE data for the operating system-level packages.

|`Stale OS CVE data`
|Indicates that the base operating system of the image has reached end-of-life, which means the vulnerability data is outdated. For example, Debian 8 and 9.

For more information about the files needed to identify the components in the images, see xref:../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.adoc#examine-images-for-vulnerabilities[Examining images for vulnerabilities].


|`Failed to get the base OS information`
|Indicates that Scanner scanned the image, but was unable to determine the base operating system used for the image.

|`Failed to retrieve metadata from the registry`
|Indicates that the target registry is unreachable on the network. The cause could be a firewall blocking `docker.io`, or an authentication issue preventing access.

To analyze the root cause, create a special registry integration for private registries or repositories to get the pod logs for {product-title-short} Central. For instructions on how to do this, see xref:../integration/integrate-with-image-registries.adoc[Integrating with image registries].

|`Image out of scope for Red{nbsp}Hat Vulnerability Scanner Certification`
a|Indicates that Scanner scanned the image, but the image is old and does not fall within the scope of Red{nbsp}Hat Scanner Certification. For more information, see https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/partner-guide-red-hat-vulnerability-scanner-cert/[Partner Guide for Red{nbsp}Hat Vulnerability Scanner Certification].

IMPORTANT: If you are using a Red{nbsp}Hat link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/explore[container image], consider using a base image newer than June 2020.

. Only supported in the StackRox Scanner.
. Only supported in Scanner V4.
. Images older than June 2020 are not supported in Scanner V4.

[NOTE]
====
Scanner does not support the Fedora operating system because Fedora does not maintain a vulnerability database.
However, Scanner still detects language-specific vulnerabilities in Fedora-based images.
