= Scanning images

[role="_abstract"]
Central submits image scanning requests to Scanner.
Upon receiving these requests, Scanner pulls the image layers from the relevant registry, checks the images, and identifies installed packages in each layer.
Then it compares the identified packages and programming language-specific dependencies with the vulnerability lists and sends information back to Central.

You can also integrate {product-title} with another vulnerability scanner.
//Add link to integration topics

Scanner identifies the vulnerabilities in the:

* base image operating system
* packages that are installed by the package managers
* programming language specific dependencies
* programming runtimes and frameworks

== Understanding and addressing common Scanner warning messages

When scanning images with {rh-rhacscs-first}, you might see the `CVE DATA MAY BE INACCURATE` warning message.
Scanner displays this message when it cannot retrieve complete information about the operating system or other packages in the image.


The following table shows some common Scanner warning messages:

.Warning messages
[%autowidth]
|===
| *Message* | *Description*

|`Unable to retrieve the OS CVE data, only Language CVE data is available`
|Indicates that Scanner does not officially support the base operating system of the image; therefore, it cannot retrieve CVE data for the operating system-level packages.

|`Stale OS CVE data`
|Indicates that the base operating system of the image has reached end-of-life, which means the vulnerability data is outdated. For example, Debian 8 and 9.

For more information about the files needed to identify the components in the images, see xref:../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.adoc#examine-images-for-vulnerabilities[Examining images for vulnerabilities].


|`Failed to get the base OS information`
|Indicates that Scanner scanned the image, but was unable to determine the base operating system used for the image.

|`Failed to retrieve metadata from the registry`
|Indicates that the target registry is unreachable on the network. The cause could be a firewall blocking `docker.io`, or an authentication issue preventing access.

To analyze the root cause, create a special registry integration for private registries or repositories to get the pod logs for {product-title-short} Central. For instructions on how to do this, see xref:../integration/integrate-with-image-registries.adoc[Integrating with image registries].

|`Image out of scope for Red Hat Vulnerability Scanner Certification`
a|Indicates that Scanner scanned the image, but the image is old and does not fall within the scope of Red Hat Scanner Certification. For more information, see https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/partner-guide-red-hat-vulnerability-scanner-cert/[Partner Guide for Red Hat Vulnerability Scanner Certification].

IMPORTANT: If you are using a Red Hat link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/explore[container image], consider using a base image newer than June 2020.

[discrete]
== Supported runtimes and frameworks

Beginning from {product-title} 3.0.50 (Scanner version 2.5.0), Scanner identifies vulnerabilities in the following developer platforms:

* .NET Core
* ASP.NET Core

[discrete]
== Supported operating systems

The supported platforms listed in this section are the distributions in which Scanner identifies vulnerabilities, and it is different from the supported platforms on which you can install {product-title}.

Scanner identifies vulnerabilities in images that contain the following Linux distributions:

[NOTE]
====
* Scanner does not support the Fedora operating system because Fedora does not maintain a vulnerability database.
However, Scanner still detects language-specific vulnerabilities in Fedora-based images.
* Scanner also identifies vulnerabilities in the following images.
However, the vulnerability sources are not updated anymore by their vendor:
