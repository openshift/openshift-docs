The OADP operator is automatically installed and managed by ACM when the backup feature is enabled.

OpenShift APIs for Data Protection (OADP) is an operator that facilitates the backup and restore of workloads in Red Hat OpenShift clusters.
Based on the upstream open source project Velero, it allows you to backup and restore all Kubernetes resources for a given project, including persistent volumes.

While it is not mandatory to have it on the hub cluster, it is highly recommended for cluster backup , disaster recovery and High availability architecture for the hub cluster.
The backup operator must be enabled to use the disaster recovery solutions for {rh-rhacm} for Kubernetes.
The reference configuration enables backup (OADP) through the MultiClusterHub CR provided by the RHACM Operator.

Limits and requirements::

* Only one version of OADP can be installed on a cluster.
The version installed by ACM must be used for ACM disaster recovery features.
