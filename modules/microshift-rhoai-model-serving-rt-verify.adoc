[id="microshift-rhoai-model-serving-rt-verify_{context}"]
= Verifying that the model-serving runtime is ready

Verify that your model-serving runtime is ready for use by checking that the downstream generation activities are complete.

.Prerequisites

* You configured the `ServingRuntimes` CR.
* You created the `InferenceService` CR.
* You have root user access to your machine.
* The {oc-first} is installed.

.Procedure

. Check that the AI model is deployed in your custom namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n ai-demo deployment
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ovms-resnet50-predictor   1/1     1            1           72s
----

. Confirm that your deployment is in progress by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout status -n ai-demo deployment ovms-resnet50-predictor
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
deployment "ovms-resnet50-predictor" successfully rolled out
----

. Check that the AI model workload pod is deployed in your custom namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n ai-demo pod
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
ovms-resnet50-predictor-6fdb566b7f-bc9k5   2/2     Running   1 (72s ago)   74s
----

. Check for the service KServe created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get svc -n ai-demo
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
ovms-resnet50-predictor   ClusterIP   None         <none>        80/TCP    119s
----

.Next step

* Create a `Route` object so that your applications can reach the {microshift-short} cluster.
