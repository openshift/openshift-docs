[id="ipi-install-configuring-host-network-interfaces-for-subnets_{context}"]
= Configuring host network interfaces for subnets

For edge computing scenarios, it can be beneficial to locate compute nodes closer to the edge. To locate remote nodes in subnets, you might use different network segments or subnets for the remote nodes than you used for the control plane subnet and local compute nodes. You can reduce latency for the edge and allow for enhanced scalability by setting up subnets for edge computing scenarios.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using the default load balancer, `OpenShiftManagedDefault` and adding remote nodes to your {product-title} cluster, all control plane nodes must run in the same subnet. When using more than one subnet, you can also configure the Ingress VIP to run on the control plane nodes by using a manifest. See "Configuring network components to run on the control plane" for details.
====

If you have established different network segments or subnets for remote nodes as described in the section on "Establishing communication between subnets", you must specify the subnets in the `machineNetwork` configuration setting if the workers are using static IP addresses, bonds or other advanced networking. When setting the node IP address in the `networkConfig` parameter for each remote node, you must also specify the gateway and the DNS server for the subnet containing the control plane nodes when using static IP addresses. This ensures the remote nodes can reach the subnet containing the control plane nodes and that they can receive network traffic from the control plane.

[NOTE]
====
Deploying a cluster with multiple subnets requires using virtual media, such as `redfish-virtualmedia` and `idrac-virtualmedia`, because remote nodes cannot access the local provisioning network.

.Procedure

. Add the subnets to the `machineNetwork` in the `install-config.yaml` file when using static IP addresses:
+
[source,yaml]
----
networking:
  machineNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
  - cidr: 192.168.0.0/24
  networkType: OVNKubernetes
----

. Add the gateway and DNS configuration to the `networkConfig` parameter of each edge compute node using NMState syntax when using a static IP address or advanced networking such as bonds:
+
[source,yaml]
----
networkConfig:
  interfaces:
  - name: <interface_name> <1>
    type: ethernet
    state: up
    ipv4:
      enabled: true
      dhcp: false
      address:
      - ip: <node_ip> <2>
        prefix-length: 24
      gateway: <gateway_ip> <3>
      dns-resolver:
        config:
          server:
          - <dns_ip> <4>
----
+
<1> Replace `<interface_name>` with the interface name.
<2> Replace `<node_ip>` with the IP address of the node.
<3> Replace `<gateway_ip>` with the IP address of the gateway.
<4> Replace `<dns_ip>` with the IP address of the DNS server.
