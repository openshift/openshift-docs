.Invalid `subnets` and `ipam` scenarios types for the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR
[cols="2a,2a,3a,3a",options="header"]
|===

|Condition type
3+|Reason, Message, Resolution

.11+|`LocalnetInvalidSubnets`
3+|One of the following messages is returned when either the `spec.network.localnet.subnets` or `spec.network.localnet.ipam` is set incorrect:
h|Reason
h|Message
h|Resolution

|The optional fields, `subnets` and `ipam.mode`, have to be set together.
|`Subnets is required with ipam.mode is Enabled or unset, and forbidden otherwise`
|You must set the `subnets` field unless the `spec.network.localnet.ipam.mode` is explicitly disabled.

|The `spec.network.localnet.subnets` must have an acceptable value when using this optional field.
|`The ClusterUserDefinedNetwork "localnet-empty-subnets-fail" is invalid: spec.network.localnet.subnets: Invalid value: 0: spec.network.localnet.subnets in body should have at least 1 items`
|You must set an acceptable value for `spec.network.localnet.subnets`. Acceptable values are IPv4 and IPv6 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) ranges that do not overlap with any CIDR ranges used by {product-title}.

|The `subnet` field must be set when using the optional `spec.network.localnet.excludeSubnets` field.
|`excludeSubnets must be unset when subnets is unset`
|You must set the `spec.network.localnet.subnets` field when using the `spec.network.localnet.excludeSubnet` field.

|The `excludeSubnets` must be a value within the `subnets` field.
|`excludeSubnets must be subnetworks of the networks specified in the subnets field`
|You must set the value for the `excludeSubnets` field to be within the `subnets` field. For example, a `subnets` value of `192.168.100.0/24` and an `excludeSubnets` value of `192.168.200.1/32` is invalid.

|The CIDR range is invalid.
|`The ClusterUserDefinedNetwork "localnet-subnets-invalid-ipv4-cidr-fail" is invalid: spec.network.localnet.subnets[0]: Invalid value: "string": CIDR is invalid`
|You must set an acceptable CIDR range for `spec.network.localnet.subnets` field. Acceptable values are IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges which are not in use or reserved by {product-title}.

|You must set the `subnets` field when the `ipam.mode` is `Enabled` or when the IPAM mode is unset because the default value is `Enabled`.
|`Subnets is required with ipam.mode is Enabled or unset, and forbidden otherwise`.
|You must set the `spec.network.localnet.subnets` field unless the `spec.network.localnet.ipam.mode` is explicitly disabled.

|Setting two CIDR ranges for `spec.network.localnet.subnets` field requires that one be IPv4 and the other be IPv6.
|`Invalid value...When 2 CIDRs are set, they must be from different IP families`.
|You must change one of your CIDR ranges to a different IP family.

|The `spec.network.localnet.ipam.mode` is `Disabled` but the `spec.network.localnet.lifecycle` has a value of `Persistent`.
|`lifecycle Persistent is only supported when ipam.mode is Enabled`
|You must set the `ipam.mode` to `Enabled` when the optional field `lifecycle` has a value of `Persistent`.
|===

.Invalid `vlan` scenarios types for the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR
[cols="4a,2a,3a,3a",options="header"]
|===

|Condition type
3+|Reason, Message, Resolution

.8+|`invalid vlan` or `invalid mode`
3+|One of the following messages is returned when the `spec.network.localnet.vlan` is set incorrect:
h|Reason
h|Message
h|Resolution

|The `spec.network.localnet.vlan.mode` field must be set.
|`spec.network.localnet.vlan.mode: Unsupported value: "Disabled": supported values: "Access`
|You must set the `spec.network.localnet.vlan.mode` field to `Access` mode.

|The `spec.network.localnet.vlan` field must be set when `spec.network.localnet.vlan.mode` is set to `Access` mode.
|`vlan access config is required when vlan mode is 'Access', and forbidden otherwise`.
|You must set `spec.network.localnet.vlan.mode.access` field when using `Access` mode.

|The `spec.network.localnet.vlan.access.id` value must be set when using `Access` mode.
|`spec.network.localnet.vlan.access.id: Required value`
|You must set a value for `spec.network.localnet.mode.access.id`.

|Acceptable values for `access.id` are greater than or equal to 1.
|`spec.network.localnet.vlan.access.id in body should be greater than or equal to 1`
|You must set a value of 1 or greater for `access.id` field.

|Acceptable values for `access.id` are less than or equal to 4094.
|`spec.network.localnet.vlan.access.id in body should be less than or equal to 4094`
|You must set a value of 4094 or less for `access.id` field.
