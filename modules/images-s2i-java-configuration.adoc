[id="images-s2i-java-configuration_{context}"]
= Configuring source-to-image for Java

By default, the Java source-to-image (S2I) builder image uses Maven to build the project with the following goals and options:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=/tmp/artifacts/m2 -s /tmp/artifacts/configuration/settings.xml -e -Popenshift -DskipTests -Dcom.redhat.xpaas.repo.redhatga -Dfabric8.skip=true package -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
----

Based on these defaults, the builder image compiles the project and copies all the transitive dependencies into the output directory without running tests. If the project has a profile named `openshift`, then it is activated for the build.

You can override these default goals and options by specifying the following environment variables:
