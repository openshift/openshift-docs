= Referencing the intended objects when using the CLI

For clusters that use the Cluster API, {oc-first} commands prioritize Cluster API objects over Machine API objects.

This behavior impacts any `oc` command that acts upon any object that is represented in both the Cluster API and the Machine API.
This explanation uses the `oc delete machine` command, which deletes a machine, as an example.

=== Cause

When you run an `oc` command, `oc` communicates with the Kube API server to determine which objects to act upon.
The Kube API server uses the first installed custom resource definition (CRD) it encounters alphabetically when an `oc` command is run.

CRDs for Cluster API objects are in the `cluster.x-k8s.io` group, while CRDs for Machine API objects are in the `machine.openshift.io` group.
Because the letter `c` precedes the letter `m` alphabetically, the Kube API server matches on the Cluster API object CRD.
As a result, the `oc` command acts upon Cluster API objects.

[discrete]
=== Consequences

Due to this behavior, the following unintended outcomes can occur on a cluster that uses the Cluster API:

* For namespaces that contain both types of objects, commands such as `oc get machine` return only Cluster API objects.

* For namespaces that contain only Machine API objects, commands such as `oc get machine` return no results.

[discrete]
=== Workaround

You can ensure that `oc` commands act on the type of objects you intend by using the corresponding fully qualified name.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

* To delete a Machine API machine, use the fully qualified name `machine.machine.openshift.io` when running the `oc delete machine` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete machine.machine.openshift.io <machine_name>
----

* To delete a Cluster API machine, use the fully qualified name `machine.cluster.x-k8s.io` when running the `oc delete machine` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete machine.cluster.x-k8s.io <machine_name>
----
