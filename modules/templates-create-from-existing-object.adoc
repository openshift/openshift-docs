= Creating a template from existing objects

Rather than writing an entire template from scratch, you can export existing
objects from your project in YAML form, and then modify the YAML from there by
adding parameters and other customizations as template form.

.Procedure

. Export objects in a project in YAML form:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -o yaml --export all > <yaml_filename>
----
+
You can also substitute a particular resource type or multiple resources instead of `all`.
Run `oc get -h` for more examples.
+
The object types included in `oc get --export all` are:
+
* BuildConfig
* Build
* DeploymentConfig
* ImageStream
* Pod
* ReplicationController
* Route
* Service
