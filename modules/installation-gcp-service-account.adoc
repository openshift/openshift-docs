= Creating a service account in GCP

{product-title} requires a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account that provides authentication and authorization to access data in the Google APIs. If you do not have an existing IAM service account that contains the required roles in your project, you must create one.

.Prerequisites

* You created a project to host your cluster.

.Procedure

. Create a service account in the project that you use to host your
{product-title} cluster. See
link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[Creating a service account]
in the GCP documentation.

. Grant the service account the appropriate permissions. You can either
grant the individual permissions that follow or assign the `Owner` role to it.
See link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource[Granting roles to a service account for specific resources].
+
[NOTE]
====
While making the service account an owner of the project is the easiest way to gain the required permissions, it means that service account has complete control over the project. You must determine if the risk that comes from offering that power is acceptable.
====

. You can create the service account key in JSON format, or attach the service account to a GCP virtual machine.
See link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys[Creating service account keys] and link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances[Creating and enabling service accounts for instances] in the GCP documentation.
+
You must have a service account key or a virtual machine with an attached service account to create the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use a virtual machine with an attached service account to create your cluster, you must set `credentialsMode: Manual` in the `install-config.yaml` file before installation.
