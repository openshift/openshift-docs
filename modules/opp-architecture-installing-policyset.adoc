= Installing {product-title} by using policy sets

The {ocp} installation uses two policy sets to install additional products.

[NOTE]
====
Edit the `policyGenerator.yaml` file to remove any products that you do not want to install. You can delete the product entries or comment out the lines.
====

To install the policy sets using gitops, follow the steps in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.8/html/governance/governance#deploying-policies-using-gitops[Deploying policies using gitops]. Use the actual path to the policy set instead of the path in the example path `policygenerator/policy-sets/stable/openshift-plus`.

Use the following procedure to install the policy sets by using CLI:

.Procedure
. Install the `PolicyGenerator` plugin by following the instructions in _Installing and using the PolicyGenerator Kustomize plug-in_.
. Clone the `policy-collection` repository:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/stolostron/policy-collection
----
. Navigate to the policy set directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd policy-collection/policygenerator/policy-sets/stable/openshift-plus
----
. Generate and apply the policies by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kustomize build --enable-alpha-plugins | oc apply -f -
----
+
The policy sets install the remaining products on the {ocp} cluster.
