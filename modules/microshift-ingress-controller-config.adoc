= Configuring ingress control in {microshift-short}

You can use detailed ingress control settings by updating the {microshift-short} service configuration file.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {oc-first}.
* You have root access to the cluster.
* Your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin.

.Procedure

. Apply ingress control settings in one of the two following ways:

.. Update the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` configuration file by making a copy of the provided `config.yaml.default` file in the `/etc/microshift/` directory, naming it `config.yaml` and keeping it in the source directory.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
After you create the `config.yaml`, the configuration file takes precedence over built-in settings. The `config.yaml` file is read every time the {microshift-short} service starts.
====

.. Use a configuration snippet to apply the ingress control settings you want. To do this, create a configuration snippet YAML file and put it in the `/etc/microshift/config.d/` configuration directory.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Configuration snippet YAMLs take precedence over both built-in settings and the `config.yaml` configuration file.
====

. Replace the default values in the `ingress` section of the {microshift-short} YAML with your valid values, or create a configuration snippet file with the sections you need.

.Ingress controller configuration fields definitions table
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`ingress`
|The `ingress` section of the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file defines the configurable parameters for the implemented portions of the {OCP} Ingress Control Operator. All parameters in the rest of this table are subsections in the `ingress` section of the `config.yaml`.

|`certificateSecret`
|A reference to a `kubernetes.io/tls` type of secret that contains the default certificate that is served by the {microshift-short} ingress controller. When routes do not specify their own certificate, the `certificateSecret` parameter is used. All secrets used must contain `tls.key` key file contents and `tls.crt` certificate file contents.

* When the `certificateSecret` parameter is not set, a wildcard certificate is automatically generated and used. The wildcard certificate is valid for the ingress controller default `domain` and its `subdomains`. The generated certificate authority (CA) is automatically integrated with the truststore of the cluster.

* In-use generated and user-specified certificates are automatically integrated with the {microshift-short} built-in OAuth server.

|`clientTLS`
|Authenticates client access to the cluster and services. As a result, mutual TLS authentication is enabled. If not set, then client TLS is not enabled. You must set the `spec.clientTLS.clientCertificatePolicy` and `spec.clientTLS.ClientCA` parameters to use client TLS.
//Does this mean we can only use ASP if we are also using the other two? it is dependent?

|`clientTLS.AllowedSubjectPatterns`
|Optional subfield that specifies a list of regular expressions that are matched against the distinguished name on a valid client certificate to filter requests. Use this parameter to cause the ingress controller to reject certificates based on the distinguished name. The Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) syntax is required.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When configured, this field must contain a valid expression or the {microshift-short} service fails. At least one pattern must match a client certificate's distinguished name; otherwise, the ingress controller rejects the certificate and denies the connection.
====

|`clientTLS.ClientCA`
|Specifies a required config map that is in the `openshift-ingress` namespace. Required to enable client TLS. The config map must contain a certificate authority (CA) bundle.

|`clientTLS.ClientCA.name`
|The `metadata.name` of the config map referenced in the `clientTLS.ClientCA` value.

|`clientTLS.ClientCertificatePolicy`
|`Required` or `Optional` are valid values. Set to `Required` to enable client TLS. The ingress controller only checks client certificates for edge-terminated and re-encrypted TLS routes. The ingress controller cannot check certificates for plain text HTTP or passthrough TLS routes.

|`defaultHTTPVersion`
|Sets the HTTP version for the ingress controller. Default value is `1` for HTTP 1.1.
//Q: do we need to configure a load balancer for 2 and 3?

|`forwardedHeaderPolicy`
|Specifies when and how the ingress controller sets the `Forwarded`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Port`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and `X-Forwarded-Proto-Version` HTTP headers. The following values are valid:

* `Append` preserves any existing headers by specifying that the ingress controller appends them. 'Append` is the default value.
* `Replace` removes any existing headers by specifying that the ingress controller sets the headers.
* `IfNone` sets the headers set by specifying that the ingress controller sets the headers if they are not already set.
* `Never` preserves any existing headers by specifying that the ingress controller never sets the headers.

|`httpCompression`
|Defines the policy for HTTP traffic compression.

|`httpCompression.mimeTypes`
|Defines a list of MIME types to which compression should be applied.

* For example, `text/css; charset=utf-8`, `text/html`, `text/*`, `image/svg+xml`, `application/octet-stream`, `X-custom/customsub`, in the, `type/subtype; [;attribute=value]` format.
* Valid `types` are: application, image, message, multipart, text, video, or a custom type prefaced by `X-`. To see the full notation for MIME types and subtypes, see link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1341#page-7[RFC1341] (IETF Datatracker documentation).

|`httpEmptyRequestsPolicy`
|Describes how HTTP connections are handled if the connection times out before a request is received. Allowed values for this field are `Respond` and `Ignore`. The default value is `Respond`. Empty requests typically come from load-balancer health probes or preconnects and can often be safely ignored. However, these requests can also be caused by network errors and port scans. Therefore, setting this field to `Ignore` can impede detection or diagnosis of network problems and detecting intrusion attempts.

* When the policy is set to `Respond`, the ingress controller sends an HTTP `400` or `408` response, logs the connection if access logging is enabled, and counts the connection in the appropriate metrics.

* When the policy is set to `Ignore`, the `http-ignore-probes` parameter is added to the `HAproxy` process configuration. After this parameter is added, the ingress controller closes the connection without sending a response, then either logs the connection or incrementing metrics.
//Q: are the incrementing metrics in this case config'd by the admin, or are they automatic to our config?

|`logEmptyRequests`
|Specifies connections for which no request is received and logged. `Log` and `Ignore` are valid values. Empty requests typically come from load-balancer health probes or preconnects and can often be safely ignored. However, these requests can also be caused by network errors and port scans. Therefore, setting this field to `Ignore` can impede detection or diagnosis of network problems and detecting intrusion attempts. The default value is `Log`.

* Setting this value to `Log` indicates that an event should be logged.
* Setting this value to `Ignore` sets the `dontlognull` option in the `HAproxy` configuration.

|`ports`
|Defines default router ports.

|`ports.http`
|Default router http port. Must be in range 1-65535. Default value is `80`.

|`ports.https`
|Default router https port. Must be in range 1-65535. Default value is `443`.

|`routeAdmission`
|Defines a policy for handling new route claims, such as allowing or denying claims across namespaces.

|`routeAdmission.namespaceOwnership`
|Describes how hostname claims across namespaces should be handled. The default is `InterNamespaceAllowed`. The following are valid values:

* `Strict` does not allow routes to claim the same hostname across namespaces.
* `InterNamespaceAllowed` allows routes to claim different paths of the same hostname across namespaces.

|`routeAdmission.wildcardPolicy`
|Controls how routes with configured wildcard policies are handled by the ingress controller. `WildcardsAllowed` and `WildcardsDisallowed` are valid values. Default value is `WildcardsDisallowed`.

* `WildcardPolicyAllowed` means that routes with any wildcard policy are admitted by the ingress controller.

* `WildcardPolicyDisallowed` means that only routes with a wildcard policy of `None` are admitted by the ingress controller.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the wildcard policy from `WildcardsAllowed` to `WildcardsDisallowed` causes admitted routes with a wildcard policy of `subdomain` to stop working. These routes must be recreated to a wildcard policy of `None` to be readmitted by the ingress controller.
====

|`status`
|Default router status. `Managed` or `Removed` are valid values.

|`tlsSecurityProfile`
|`tlsSecurityProfile` specifies settings for TLS connections for ingress controllers. If not set, the default value is based on the `apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster` resource. The TLS `1.0` version of an `Old` or `Custom` profile is automatically converted to `1.1` by the ingress controller. `Intermediate` is the default setting.

* The minimum TLS version for ingress controllers is `1.1`. The maximum TLS version is `1.3`.

[NOTE]
====
Ciphers and the minimum TLS version of the configured security profile are reflected in the `TLSProfile` status. Profiles are intent-based and change over time when new ciphers are developed and existing ciphers are found to be insecure. The usable list can be reduced depending on which ciphers are available to a specific process.
====

|`tlsSecurityProfile.custom`
|User-defined TLS security profile. If you configure this parameter and related parameters, use extreme caution.

|`tlsSecurityProfile.custom.ciphers`
|Specifies the cipher algorithms that are negotiated during the TLS handshake. Operators might remove entries their operands do not support.

|`tlsSecurityProfile.custom.minTLSVersion`
|Specifies the minimal version of the TLS protocol that is negotiated during the TLS handshake. For example, to use TLS versions 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, set the value to `VersionTLS11`. The highest valid value for `minTLSVersion` is `VersionTLS12`.

|`tlsSecurityProfile.intermediate`
|This TLS profile can be used for a majority of services. link:https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Intermediate_compatibility_.28recommended.29[Intermediate compatibility (recommended)].

|`tlsSecurityProfile.old`
|Used for backward compatibility. link:https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Old_backward_compatibility[Old backward compatibility].

|`tlsSecurityProfile.type`
|Valid values are `Intermediate`, `Old`, or `Custom`. The `Modern` value is not supported.

|`tuningOptions`
|Specifies options for tuning the performance of ingress controller pods.

|`tuningOptions.clientFinTimeout`
|Specifies how long a connection is held open while waiting for the client response to the server closing the connection. The default timeout is `1s`.

|`tuningOptions.clientTimeout`
|Specifies how long a connection is held open while waiting for a client response. The default timeout is `30s`.

|`tuningOptions.headerBufferBytes`
|Specifies how much memory is reserved, in bytes, for ingress controller connection sessions. This value must be at least `16384` if HTTP/2 is enabled for the ingress controller. If not set, the default value is `32768` bytes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting this field not recommended because `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` parameter values that are too small can break the ingress controller. Conversely, values for `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` that are too large could cause the ingress controller to use significantly more memory than necessary.
====

|`tuningOptions.headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes`
|Specifies how much memory should be reserved, in bytes, from `headerBufferBytes` for HTTP header rewriting and appending for ingress controller connection sessions. The minimum value for `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` is `4096`. `headerBufferBytes` must be greater than the `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` value for incoming HTTP requests. If not set, the default value is `8192` bytes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting this field is not recommended because `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` values that are too small can break the ingress controller and `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` that are too large could cause the ingress controller to use significantly more memory than necessary.
====

|`tuningOptions.healthCheckInterval`
|Specifies how long the router waits between health checks, set in seconds. The default is `5s`.

|`tuningOptions.maxConnections`
|Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be established for each `HAProxy` process. Increasing this value allows each ingress controller pod to handle more connections at the cost of additional system resources. Permitted values are `0`, `-1`, any value within the range `2000` and `2000000`, or the field can be left empty.

* If this field is left empty or has the value `0`, the ingress controller uses the default value of `50000`.

* If the field has the value of `-1`, then the `HAProxy` process dynamically computes a maximum value based on the available `ulimits` in the running container. This process results in a large computed value that incurs significant memory usage compared to the current default value of `50000`.

* If the field has a value that is greater than the current operating system limit, the `HAProxy` processes do not start.

* If you choose a discrete value and the router pod is migrated to a new node, it is possible that the new node does not have an identical `ulimit` configured. In such cases, the pod fails to start.

* If you have nodes with different `ulimits` configured, and you choose a discrete value, you can use the value of `-1` for this field so that the maximum number of connections is calculated at runtime.

* You can monitor memory usage for router containers with the `container_memory_working_set_bytes{container="router",namespace="openshift-ingress"}` metric.

* You can monitor memory usage of individual `HAProxy` processes in router containers with the `container_memory_working_set_bytes{container="router",namespace="openshift-ingress"}/container_processes{container="router",namespace="openshift-ingress"}` metric.

|`tuningOptions.serverFinTimeout`
|Specifies how long a connection is held open while waiting for the server response to the client that is closing the connection. The default timeout is `1s`.

|`tuningOptions.serverTimeout`
|Specifies how long a connection is held open while waiting for a server response. The default timeout is `30s`.

|`tuningOptions.threadCount`
|Specifies the number of threads to create per `HAProxy` process. Creating more threads allows each ingress controller pod to handle more connections, at the cost of more system resources being used. The `HAProxy` load balancer supports up to `64` threads. If this field is empty, the ingress controller uses the default value of `4` threads.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting this field is not recommended because increasing the number of `HAProxy` threads allows ingress controller pods to use more CPU time under load, and prevent other pods from receiving the CPU resources they need to perform. Reducing the number of threads can cause the ingress controller to perform poorly.
====

|`tuningOptions.tlsInspectDelay`
|Specifies how long the router can hold data to find a matching route. Setting this value too low can cause the router to fall back to the default certificate for edge-terminated, re-encrypted, or passthrough routes, even when using a better-matched certificate. The default inspect delay is `5s`.

|`tuningOptions.tunnelTimeout`
|Specifies how long a tunnel connection, including websockets, remains open while the tunnel is idle. The default timeout is `1h`.
