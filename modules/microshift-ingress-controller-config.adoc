= Configuring ingress control in {microshift-short}

You can use detailed ingress control settings by updating the {microshift-short} service configuration file.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have root access to the cluster.
* Your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.

.Procedure

. Apply ingress control settings in one of the two following ways:

.. Update the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` configuration file by making a copy of the provided `config.yaml.default` file in the `/etc/microshift/` directory, naming it `config.yaml` and keeping it in the source directory.
* After you create it, the `config.yaml` file takes precedence over built-in settings. The configuration file is read every time the {microshift-short} service starts.

.. Use a configuration snippet to apply the ingress control settings you want. To do this, create a configuration snippet YAML file and put it in the `/etc/microshift/config.d/` configuration directory.
* Configuration snippet YAMLs take precedence over both built-in settings and a `config.yaml` configuration file. See the Additional resources links for more information.

. Replace the default values in the `network` section of the {microshift-short} YAML with your valid values, or create a configuration snippet file with the sections you need.

.Ingress controller configuration fields definitions table
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`clientTLS`
|`clientTLS` authenticates client access to the cluster and services; as a result, mutual TLS authentication is enabled. If not set, then client TLS is not enabled.

`clientTLS` has the required subfields, `spec.clientTLS.clientCertificatePolicy` and `spec.clientTLS.ClientCA`.

The `ClientCertificatePolicy` subfield accepts one of the two values: `Required` or `Optional`. The `ClientCA` subfield specifies a config map that is in the openshift-config namespace. The config map should contain a CA certificate bundle.

The `AllowedSubjectPatterns` is an optional value that specifies a list of regular expressions, which are matched against the distinguished name on a valid client certificate to filter requests. The regular expressions must use PCRE syntax. At least one pattern must match a client certificate's distinguished name; otherwise, the Ingress Controller rejects the certificate and denies the connection. If not specified, the Ingress Controller does not reject certificates based on the distinguished name.

|`defaultCertificate`
|The `defaultCertificate` value is a reference to a secret that contains the default certificate that is served by the Ingress Controller. When Routes do not specify their own certificate, `defaultCertificate` is used.

The secret must contain the following keys and data:
* `tls.crt`: certificate file contents
* `tls.key`: key file contents|`clientTLS`
|`clientTLS` authenticates client access to the cluster and services; as a result, mutual TLS authentication is enabled. If not set, then client TLS is not enabled.

`clientTLS` has the required subfields, `spec.clientTLS.clientCertificatePolicy` and `spec.clientTLS.ClientCA`.

The `ClientCertificatePolicy` subfield accepts one of the two values: `Required` or `Optional`. The `ClientCA` subfield specifies a config map that is in the openshift-config namespace. The config map should contain a CA certificate bundle.

The `AllowedSubjectPatterns` is an optional value that specifies a list of regular expressions, which are matched against the distinguished name on a valid client certificate to filter requests. The regular expressions must use PCRE syntax. At least one pattern must match a client certificate's distinguished name; otherwise, the Ingress Controller rejects the certificate and denies the connection. If not specified, the Ingress Controller does not reject certificates based on the distinguished name.

If not set, a wildcard certificate is automatically generated and used. The certificate is valid for the Ingress Controller `domain` and `subdomains`, and
the generated certificate's CA is automatically integrated with the
cluster's trust store.

The in-use certificate, whether generated or user-specified, is automatically integrated with {product-title} built-in OAuth server.

|`defaultHTTPVersion`
|Sets the HTTP version for the ingress controller. Default value is `1` for HTTP 1.1.
//Q: do we need to configure a load balancer for 2 and 3?

|`forwardedHeaderPolicy`
|Specifies when and how the ingress controller sets the `Forwarded`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Port`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and `X-Forwarded-Proto-Version` HTTP headers. The following values are valid:

* `Append`, preserves any existing headers by specifying that the ingress controller appends them.
* `Replace`, removes any existing headers by specifying that the ingress controller sets the headers.
* `IfNone` sets the headers set by specifying that the ingress controller sets the headers if they are not already set.
* `Never`, preserves any existing headers by specifying that the ingress controller never sets the headers.

|`httpCaptureCookies`
|`httpCaptureCookies` specifies HTTP cookies that you want to capture in access logs. If the `httpCaptureCookies` field is empty, the access logs do not capture the cookies.

For any cookie that you want to capture, the following parameters must be in your `IngressController` configuration:

* `name` specifies the name of the cookie.
* `maxLength` specifies tha maximum length of the cookie.
* `matchType` specifies if the field `name` of the cookie exactly matches the capture cookie setting or is a prefix of the capture cookie setting. The `matchType` field uses the `Exact` and `Prefix` parameters.

For example:
[source,yaml]
----
  httpCaptureCookies:
  - matchType: Exact
    maxLength: 128
    name: MYCOOKIE
----

|`httpCaptureHeaders`
|`httpCaptureHeaders` specifies the HTTP headers that you want to capture in the access logs. If the `httpCaptureHeaders` field is empty, the access logs do not capture the headers.

`httpCaptureHeaders` contains two lists of headers to capture in the access logs. The two lists of header fields are `request` and `response`. In both lists, the `name` field must specify the header name and the `maxlength` field must specify the maximum length of the header. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
  httpCaptureHeaders:
    request:
    - maxLength: 256
      name: Connection
    - maxLength: 128
      name: User-Agent
    response:
    - maxLength: 256
      name: Content-Type
    - maxLength: 256
      name: Content-Length
----

|`httpCompression`
|Defines the policy for HTTP traffic compression.

* `httpCompression.mimeTypes` defines a list of or a single MIME type to which compression is applied. For example, `text/css; charset=utf-8`, `text/html`, `text/*`, `image/svg+xml`, `application/octet-stream`, `X-custom/customsub`, using the format pattern, `type/subtype; [;attribute=value]`. The `types` are: application, image, message, multipart, text, video, or a custom type prefaced by `X-`. To see the full notation for MIME types and subtypes, see link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1341#page-7[RFC1341] (IETF Datatracker documentation).

|`httpEmptyRequestsPolicy`
|Describes how HTTP connections are handled if the connection times out before a request is received. Allowed values for this field are `Respond` and `Ignore`. The default value is `Respond`. The following are valid values:

* `Respond`, causes the ingress controller to send an HTTP `400` or `408` response, logs the connection if access logging is enabled, and counts the connection in the appropriate metrics.
* `Ignore`, adds the `http-ignore-probes` parameter in the `HAproxy` configuration. If the field is set to `Ignore`, the ingress controller closes the connection without sending a response, then logs the connection or incrementing metrics.

Usually, empty request connections come from load balancer health probes or web browser preconnects and can be safely ignored. However, network errors and port scans can also create these empty requests, so setting this field to `Ignore` can impede detecting or diagnosing problems and also impede the detection of intrusion attempts.

|`httpErrorCodePages`
|`httpErrorCodePages` specifies custom HTTP error code response pages. By default, an IngressController uses error pages built into the IngressController image.

|`IngressControllerLogging`
|`logging` defines parameters for what is logged where. If this field is empty, operational logs are enabled but access logs are disabled.

* `access` describes how client requests are logged. If this field is empty, access logging is disabled.
** `destination` describes a destination for log messages.
*** `type` is the type of destination for logs:
**** `Container` specifies that logs should go to a sidecar container. The Ingress Operator configures the container, named *logs*, on the Ingress Controller pod and configures the Ingress Controller to write logs to the container. The expectation is that the administrator configures a custom logging solution that reads logs from this container. Using container logs means that logs may be dropped if the rate of logs exceeds the container runtime capacity or the custom logging solution capacity.
**** `Syslog` specifies that logs are sent to a Syslog endpoint. The administrator must specify an endpoint that can receive Syslog messages. The expectation is that the administrator has configured a custom Syslog instance.
*** `container` describes parameters for the `Container` logging destination type. Currently there are no parameters for container logging, so this field must be empty.
*** `syslog` describes parameters for the `Syslog` logging destination type:
**** `address` is the IP address of the syslog endpoint that receives log messages.
**** `port` is the UDP port number of the syslog endpoint that receives log messages.
**** `maxLength` is the maximum length of the syslog message. It must be between `480` and `4096` bytes. If this field is empty, the maximum length is set to the default value of `1024` bytes.
**** `facility` specifies the syslog facility of log messages. If this field is empty, the facility is `local1`. Otherwise, it must specify a valid syslog facility: `kern`, `user`, `mail`, `daemon`, `auth`, `syslog`, `lpr`, `news`, `uucp`, `cron`, `auth2`, `ftp`, `ntp`, `audit`, `alert`, `cron2`, `local0`, `local1`, `local2`, `local3`. `local4`, `local5`, `local6`, or `local7`.
** `httpLogFormat` specifies the format of the log message for an HTTP request. If this field is empty, log messages use the implementation's default HTTP log format. For HAProxy's default HTTP log format, see link:http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/2.0/configuration.html#8.2.3[the HAProxy documentation].

|`logEmptyRequests`
|Specifies connections for which no request is received and logged. Usually, these empty requests come from load balancer health probes or web browser speculative connections such as preconnects. Logging these types of empty requests can be undesirable. However, network errors and port scans can also create empty requests, so setting this field to `Ignore` can impede detecting or diagnosing problems and also impede the detection of intrusion attempts.

The following are valid values:

* `Log`, which indicates that an event should be logged.
* `Ignore`, which sets the `dontlognull` option in the `HAproxy` configuration.

|`routeAdmission` defines a policy for handling new route claims, such as allowing or denying claims across namespaces.

`namespaceOwnership` describes how hostname claims across namespaces should be handled. The default is `Strict`.

* `Strict`: does not allow routes to claim the same hostname across namespaces.
* `InterNamespaceAllowed`: allows routes to claim different paths of the same hostname across namespaces.

`wildcardPolicy` describes how routes with wildcard policies are handled by the Ingress Controller.

* `WildcardsAllowed`: Indicates routes with any wildcard policy are admitted by the Ingress Controller.

* `WildcardsDisallowed`: Indicates only routes with a wildcard policy of `None` are admitted by the Ingress Controller. Updating `wildcardPolicy` from `WildcardsAllowed` to `WildcardsDisallowed` causes admitted routes with a wildcard policy of `Subdomain` to stop working. These routes must be recreated to a wildcard policy of `None` to be readmitted by the Ingress Controller. `WildcardsDisallowed` is the default setting.

|`tlsSecurityProfile`
|`tlsSecurityProfile` specifies settings for TLS connections for Ingress Controllers.

If not set, the default value is based on the `apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster` resource.

When using the `Old`, `Intermediate`, and `Modern` profile types, the effective profile configuration is subject to change between releases. For example, given a specification to use the `Intermediate` profile deployed on release `X.Y.Z`, an upgrade to release `X.Y.Z+1` may cause a new profile configuration to be applied to the Ingress Controller, resulting in a rollout.

The minimum TLS version for Ingress Controllers is `1.1`, and the maximum TLS version is `1.3`.

[NOTE]
====
Ciphers and the minimum TLS version of the configured security profile are reflected in the `TLSProfile` status.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Ingress Operator converts the TLS `1.0` of an `Old` or `Custom` profile to `1.1`.
====

|`tuningOptions`
|Specifies options for tuning the performance of ingress controller pods.

* The `tuningOptions.clientFinTimeout` parameter specifies how long a connection is held open while waiting for the client response to the server closing the connection. The default timeout is `1s`.

* The `tuningOptions.clientTimeout` parameter specifies how long a connection is held open while waiting for a client response. The default timeout is `30s`.

* The `tuningOptions.headerBufferBytes` parameter specifies how much memory is reserved, in bytes, for Ingress Controller connection sessions. This value must be at least `16384` if HTTP/2 is enabled for the Ingress Controller. If not set, the default value is `32768` bytes.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting this field not recommended because `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` parameter values that are too small can break the ingress controller. Conversely, values for `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` that are too large could cause the ingress controller to use significantly more memory than necessary.
====

* The `tuningOptions.headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` parameter specifies how much memory should be reserved, in bytes, from `headerBufferBytes` for HTTP header rewriting and appending for Ingress Controller connection sessions. The minimum value for `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` is `4096`. The `headerBufferBytes` value must be greater than the `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` value for incoming HTTP requests.
* If not set, the default value is `8192` bytes.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting this field is not recommended because `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` parameter values that are too small can break the ingress controller. Conversely, values for `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes` that are too large could cause the ingress controller to use significantly more memory than necessary.
====

* The `tuningOptions.healthCheckInterval` parameter specifies how long the router waits between health checks. The default is `5s`.

* The `tuningOptions.serverFinTimeout` parameter specifies how long a connection is held open while waiting for the server response to the client that is closing the connection. The default timeout is `1s`.

* The `tuningOptions.serverTimeout` parameter specifies how long a connection is held open while waiting for a server response. The default timeout is `30s`.

* The `tuningOptions.threadCount` parameter specifies the number of threads to create per HAProxy process. Creating more threads allows each ingress controller pod to handle more connections, at the cost of more system resources being used. `HAProxy` supports up to `64` threads. If this field is empty, default value is `4` threads.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting this field is not recommended because increasing the number of `HAProxy` threads allows ingress controller pods to use more CPU time under load, and prevent other pods from receiving the CPU resources they need to perform.
====

* The `tuningOptions.tlsInspectDelay` parameter specifies how long the router can hold data to find a matching route. Setting this value too short can cause the router to fall back to the default certificate for edge-terminated, re-encrypted, or passthrough routes, even when using a better-matched certificate. The default inspect delay is `5s`.

* The `tuningOptions.tunnelTimeout` parameter specifies how long a tunnel connection, including websockets, remains open while the tunnel is idle. The default timeout is `1h`.
