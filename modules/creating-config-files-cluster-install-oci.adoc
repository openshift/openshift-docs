= Creating configuration files for installing a cluster on {oci}

You need to create the `install-config.yaml` and the `agent-config.yaml` configuration files so that you can use the Agent-based Installer to generate a bootable ISO image. The Agent-based installation comprises a bootable ISO that has the Assisted discovery agent and the Assisted Service. Both of these components are required to perform the cluster installation, but the latter component runs on only one of the hosts.

At a later stage, you must follow the steps in the Oracle documentation for uploading your generated agent ISO image to Oracle’s default Object Storage bucket, which is the initial step for integrating your {product-title} cluster on {oci-first}.

[NOTE]
====
You can also use the Agent-based Installer to generate or accept Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) custom resources.
====

.Prerequisites
* You reviewed details about the {product-title} installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing the method for users.
* You have read the "Preparing to install with the Agent-based Installer" documentation.
* You downloaded the Agent-Based Installer and the command-line interface (CLI) from the {hybrid-console}.
* You have logged in to the {product-title} with administrator privileges.

.Procedure

. For a disconnected environment, mirror the {product-mirror-registry} to your local container image registry.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Check that your `openshift-install` binary version relates to your local image container registry and not a shared registry, such as {quay}.

. Configure the `install-config.yaml` configuration file to meet the needs of your organization.

# ...
----
<1> The base domain of your cloud provider.
<2> The IP address from the  virtual cloud network (VCN) that the CIDR allocates to resources and components that operate on your network.
<3> Depending on your infrastructure, you can select either `x86_64`, or `amd64`.
<4> Set `OCI` as the external platform, so that {product-title} can integrate with {oci}.
<5> Specify your SSH public key.
<6> The pull secret that you need for authenticate purposes when downloading container images for {product-title} components and services, such as Quay.io. See link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Install {product-title} 4] from the {hybrid-console}.

. Create a directory on your local system named `openshift`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not move the `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` configuration files to the `openshift` directory.
====

. Complete the steps in the link:https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/openshift-on-oci/install-prereq.htm#install-configuration-files["Configuration Files"] section of the _Oracle_ documentation to download {oci-ccm-full} and {oci-csi-full} manifests as an archive file and save the archive file in your `openshift` directory. You need the {oci-ccm} manifests for deploying the {oci-ccm} during cluster installation so that {product-title} can connect to the external {oci} platform. You need the {oci-csi} custom manifests for deploying the {oci-csi} driver during cluster installation so that {product-title} can claim required objects from {oci}.

. Access the custom manifest files that are provided in the link:https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/openshift-on-oci/install-prereq.htm#install-configuration-files["Configuration Files"] section of the _Oracle_ documentation.
+
.. Change the `oci-cloud-controller-manager` secret that is defined in the `oci-ccm.yml` configuration file to match your organization's region, compartment {ocid}, VCN {ocid}, and the subnet {ocid} from the load balancer.

. Use the Agent-based Installer to generate a minimal ISO image, which excludes the rootfs image, by entering the following command in your {product-title} CLI. You can use this image later in the process to boot all your cluster’s nodes.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install agent create image --log-level debug
----
+
The command also completes the following actions:
+
* Creates a subdirectory, `./<installation_directory>/auth directory:`, and places `kubeadmin-password` and `kubeconfig` files in the subdirectory.
* Creates a `rendezvousIP` file based on the IP address that you specified in the `agent-config.yaml` configuration file.
* Optional: Any modifications you made to `agent-config.yaml` and `install-config.yaml` configuration files get imported to the Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) custom resources.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Agent-based Installer uses {op-system-first}. The rootfs image, which is mentioned in a later listed item,  is required for booting, recovering, and repairing your operating system.
====

. Configure the `agent-config.yaml` configuration file to meet your organization’s requirements.
+
.Example `agent-config.yaml` configuration file that sets values for an IPv4 formatted network.
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name> // <1>
  namespace: <cluster_namespace> <2>
rendezvousIP: <ip_address_from_CIDR> <3>
bootArtifactsBaseURL: <server_URL> <4>
# ...
----
<1> The cluster name that you specified in your DNS record.
<2> The namespace of your cluster on {product-title}.
<3> If you use IPv4 as the network IP address format, ensure that you set the `rendezvousIP` parameter to an IPv4 address that the VCN’s Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) method allocates on your network. Also ensure that at least one instance from the pool of instances that you booted with the ISO matches the IP address value you set for `rendezvousIP`.
<4> The URL of the server where you want to upload the rootfs image.

. Apply one of the following two updates to your `agent-config.yaml` configuration file:
+
* For a disconnected network:  After you run the command to generate a minimal ISO Image, the Agent-based installer saves the rootfs image into the `./<installation_directory>/boot-artifacts` directory on your local system. Use your preferred web server, such as any Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon (`httpd`), to upload rootfs to the location stated in the `bootArtifactsBaseURL` parameter in the `agent-config.yaml` configuration file.
+
For example, if the `bootArtifactsBaseURL` parameter states `\http://192.168.122.20`, you would upload the generated rootfs image to this location, so that the Agent-based installer can access the image from `\http://192.168.122.20/agent.x86_64-rootfs.img`. After the Agent-based installer boots the minimal ISO for the external platform, the Agent-based Installer downloads the rootfs image from the `\http://192.168.122.20/agent.x86_64-rootfs.img` location into the system memory.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Agent-based Installer also adds the value of the `bootArtifactsBaseURL` to the minimal ISO Image’s configuration, so that when the Operator boots a cluster’s node, the Agent-based Installer downloads the rootfs image into system memory.
====
+
* For a connected network: You do not need to specify the `bootArtifactsBaseURL` parameter in the `agent-config.yaml` configuration file. The default behavior of the Agent-based Installer reads the rootfs URL location from `\https://rhcos.mirror.openshift.com`. After the Agent-based Installer boots the minimal ISO for the external platform, the Agent-based Installer then downloads the rootfs file into your system’s memory from the default {op-system} URL.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Consider that the full ISO image, which is in excess of `1` GB, includes the rootfs image. The image is larger than the minimal ISO Image, which is typically less than `150` MB.
