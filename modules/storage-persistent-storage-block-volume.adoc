= Block volume support

{product-title} can statically provision raw block volumes. These volumes
do not have a file system, and can provide performance benefits for
applications that either write to the disk directly or implement their own
storage service.

Raw block volumes are provisioned by specifying `volumeMode: Block` in the
PV and PVC specification.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Pods using raw block volumes must be configured to allow privileged containers.

The following table displays which volume plug-ins support block volumes.

[NOTE]
====
Any of the block volumes that can be provisioned manually, but are not provided
as fully supported, are included as a Technology Preview feature only. Technology
Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level
agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not
recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process. For more information about the
support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview
features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.
