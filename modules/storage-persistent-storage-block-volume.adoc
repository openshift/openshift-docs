= Block volume support

{product-title} can statically provision raw block volumes. These volumes
do not have a file system, and can provide performance benefits for
applications that either write to the disk directly or implement their own
storage service.

Raw block volumes are provisioned by specifying `volumeMode: Block` in the
PV and PVC specification.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Pods using raw block volumes must be configured to allow privileged containers.
