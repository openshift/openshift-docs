= Example: Bond interface node network configuration policy

[role="_abstract"]
You can create a bond interface on nodes in the cluster by applying a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest to the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
{VirtProductName} only supports the following bond modes:

* `active-backup`
* `balance-xor`
* `802.3ad`

Other bond modes are not supported.
====

The `balance-xor` and `802.3ad` bond modes require switch configuration to establish an "EtherChannel" or similar port grouping. Those two modes also require additional load-balancing configuration, depending on the source and destination of traffic being passed through the interface. The `active-backup` bond mode does not require any switch configuration. Other bond modes are not supported.

The following YAML file is an example of a manifest for a bond interface.
It includes samples values that you must replace with your own information.

----
<1> Name of the policy.
<2> Optional: If you do not include the `nodeSelector` parameter, the policy applies to all nodes in the cluster.
<3> This example uses a `hostname` node selector.
<4> Name of the interface.
<5> Optional: Human-readable description of the interface.
<6> The type of interface. This example creates a bond.
<7> The requested state for the interface after creation.
<8> Optional: If you do not use `dhcp`, you can either set a static IP or leave the interface without an IP address.
<9> Enables `ipv4` in this example.
<10> The driver mode for the bond. This example uses `active backup`. 
<11> Optional: This example uses miimon to inspect the bond link every 140ms.
<12> The subordinate node NICs in the bond.
<13> Optional: The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the bond. If not specified, this value is set to `1500` by default.
