= Example: Bond interface node network configuration policy

Create a bond interface on nodes in the cluster by applying a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest to the cluster. 

[NOTE]
====
{VirtProductName} supports only the following bond modes.

* `mode=1 active-backup` does not require a switch configuration but might cause loss of connectivity for a guest network.
* `mode=2 balance-xor` or similar typically requires a switch configuration to establish a port grouping and additional load-balancing configurations. If you set `xmit_hash_policy` to `vlan+srcmac` and `balance-slb: 1`, no switch configuration is needed as the network configuration bahaves similar to balance-slb` mode on an Open vSwitch (OVS) bonding interface.
* `mode=4 802.3ad` or similar does require a switch configuration to establish a port grouping and additional load-balancing configurations.

Other modes are not supported on {VirtProductName} .

The following YAML file is an example of a manifest for a bond interface. The file includes samples values that you must replace with your own information.

----
<1> Name of the policy.
<2> Optional: If you do not include the `nodeSelector` parameter, the policy applies to all nodes in the cluster.
<3> This example uses a `hostname` node selector.
<4> Name of the interface.
<5> Optional: Human-readable description of the interface.
<6> The type of interface. This example creates a bond.
<7> The requested state for the interface after creation.
<8> Optional: If you do not use `dhcp`, you can either set a static IP or leave the interface without an IP address.
<9> Enables `ipv4` in this example.
<10> The driver mode for the bond. This example uses an active backup mode.
<11> Optional: This example uses miimon to inspect the bond link every 140ms.
<12> The subordinate node NICs in the bond.
<13> Optional: The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the bond. If not specified, this value is set to `1500` by default.
