= BundleDeployment

[WARNING]
====
A `BundleDeployment` object changes the state of a Kubernetes cluster by installing and removing objects. It is important to verify and trust the content that is being installed and limit access, by using RBAC, to the `BundleDeployment` API to only those who require those permissions.
====

The RukPak `BundleDeployment` API points to a `Bundle` object and indicates that it should be active. This includes pivoting from older versions of an active bundle. A `BundleDeployment` object might also include an embedded spec for a desired bundle.

Much like pods generate instances of container images, a bundle deployment generates a deployed version of a bundle. A bundle deployment can be seen as a generalization of the pod concept.

The specifics of how a bundle deployment makes changes to a cluster based on a referenced bundle is defined by the provisioner that is configured to watch that bundle deployment.
