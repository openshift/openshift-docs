= About ZTP and distributed units on OpenShift clusters

You can install a distributed unit (DU) on {product-title} clusters at scale with {rh-rhacm-first} using the assisted installer (AI) and the policy generator with core-reduction technology enabled. The DU installation is done using zero touch provisioning (ZTP) in a disconnected environment.

{rh-rhacm} manages clusters in a hub-and-spoke architecture, where a single hub cluster manages many spoke clusters. {rh-rhacm} applies radio access network (RAN) policies from predefined custom resources (CRs). Hub clusters running ACM provision and deploy the spoke clusters using ZTP and AI. DU installation follows the AI installation of {product-title} on each cluster.

The AI service handles provisioning of {product-title} on single node clusters, three-node clusters, or standard clusters running on bare metal. ACM ships with and deploys the AI when the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource is installed.

With ZTP and AI, you can provision {product-title} clusters to run your DUs at scale. A high-level overview of ZTP for distributed units in a disconnected environment is as follows:

* A hub cluster running {rh-rhacm-first} manages a disconnected internal registry that mirrors the {product-title} release images. The internal registry is used to provision the spoke clusters.

* You manage the bare metal host machines for your DUs in an inventory file that uses YAML for formatting. You store the inventory file in a Git repository.

* You install the DU bare metal host machines on site, and make the hosts ready for provisioning. To be ready for provisioning, the following is required for each bare metal host:

** Network connectivity - including DNS for your network. Hosts should be reachable through the hub and managed spoke clusters. Ensure there is layer 3 connectivity between the hub and the host where you want to install your hub cluster.

** Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) details for each host - ZTP uses BMC details to connect the URL and credentials for accessing the BMC. ZTP manages the spoke cluster definition CRs, with the exception of the `BMCSecret` CR, which you create manually. These define the relevant elements for the managed clusters.
