[id="pod-short-term-auth-gcp-deploy-pod_{context}"]
= Deploying customer workloads that authenticate with {gcp-wid-short}

To use short-term authentication in your application, you must configure its related pods to use the {product-title} service account.
Use of the {product-title} service account triggers the webhook to mutate the pods so they can impersonate the {gcp-short} service account.

The following example demonstrates how to deploy a pod that uses the {product-title} service account and verify the configuration.

.Prerequisites

* Your {gcp-short} cluster uses {gcp-wid-short}.

* You have created a federated {gcp-short} service account.

* You have created an {product-title} service account for {gcp-short}.

.Procedure

. To create a pod that authenticates with {gcp-wid-short}, create a deployment YAML file similar to the following example:
+
.Sample deployment
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ubi9
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ubi9
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ubi9
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: "<service_account_name>" <1>
      containers:
        - name: ubi
          image: 'registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-micro:latest'
          command:
            - /bin/sh
            - '-c'
            - |
              sleep infinity
----
<1> Specify the name of the {product-title} service account.

. Apply the deployment file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f deployment.yaml
----

.Verification

* To verify that a pod is using short-term authentication, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -o json | jq -r '.items[0].spec.containers[0].env[] | select(.name=="GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS")'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{   "name": "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS",   "value": "/var/run/secrets/workload-identity/federation.json" } 
----
+
The presence of the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable indicates a pod that authenticates with {gcp-wid-short}.

* To verify additional configuration details, examine the pod specification.
The following example pod specifications show the environment variables and volume fields that the webhook mutates.
