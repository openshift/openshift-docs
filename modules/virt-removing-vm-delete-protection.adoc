= Removing the VM delete protection option

[role="_abstract"]
When you enable delete protection on a virtual machine (VM), you ensure that the VM cannot be inadvertently deleted. You can also disable the protection for a VM.

As a cluster administrator, you can choose not to make the VM delete protection option available. VMs with delete protection already enabled retain that setting; for any new VMs that are created, enabling the option is not allowed.

You can remove the delete protection option by establishing a validation admission policy for the cluster and then creating the necessary binding to use the policy in the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You must have cluster administrator privileges.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Create the validation admission policy, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: "disable-vm-delete-protection"
spec:
  failurePolicy: Fail
  matchConstraints:
    resourceRules:
    - apiGroups:   ["kubevirt.io"]
      apiVersions: ["*"]
      operations:  ["UPDATE", "CREATE"]
      resources:   ["virtualmachines"]
  variables:
    - expression: string('kubevirt.io/vm-delete-protection')
      name: vmDeleteProtectionLabel
  validations:
  - expression: >-
      !has(object.metadata.labels) ||
      !object.metadata.labels.exists(label, label == variables.vmDeleteProtectionLabel) ||
      has(oldObject.metadata.labels) &&
      oldObject.metadata.labels.exists(label, label == variables.vmDeleteProtectionLabel)
    message: "Virtual Machine delete protection feature is disabled"
----

. Apply the validation admission policy to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f disable-vm-delete-protection.yaml
----

. Create the validation admission policy binding, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding
metadata:
  name: "disable-vm-delete-protection-binding"
spec:
  policyName: "disable-vm-delete-protection"
  validationActions: [Deny]
  matchResources:
----

. Apply the validation admission policy binding to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f disable-vm-delete-protection-binding.yaml
