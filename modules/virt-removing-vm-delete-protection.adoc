= Removing the VM delete protection option

When you enable delete protection on a virtual machine (VM), you ensure that the VM cannot be inadvertently deleted. You can also disable the protection for a VM.

As a cluster administrator, you can choose not to make the VM delete protection option available. VMs with delete protection already enabled retain that setting; for any new VMs that are created, enabling the option is not allowed.

You can remove the delete protection option by establishing a validation admission policy for the cluster and then creating the necessary binding to use the policy in the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You must have cluster administrator privileges.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Create the validation admission policy, as shown in the following example:
+
.Example validation admission policy file
[source,yaml]

      oldObject.metadata.labels.exists(label, label == variables.vmDeleteProtectionLabel)
    message: "Virtual Machine delete protection feature is disabled"

. Apply the validation admission policy to the cluster:

$ oc apply -f disable-vm-delete-protection.yaml

. Create the validation admission policy binding, as shown in the following example:
