= Viewing the topology of your application

You can navigate to the *Topology* view using the left navigation panel in the *Developer* perspective. After you deploy an application, you are directed automatically to the *Graph view* where you can see the status of the application pods, quickly access the application on a public URL, access the source code to modify it, and see the status of your last build. You can zoom in and out to see more details for a particular application.

The *Topology* view provides you the option to monitor your applications using the *List* view. Use the *List view* icon (image:odc_list_view_icon.png[title="List view icon"]) to see a list of all your applications and use the *Graph view* icon (image:odc_topology_view_icon.png[title="Topology view icon"]) to switch back to the graph view.

You can customize the views as required using the following:

* Use the *Find by name* field to find the required components. Search results may appear outside of the visible area; click *Fit to Screen* from the lower-left toolbar to resize the *Topology* view to show all components.
* Use the *Display Options* drop-down list to configure the *Topology* view of the various application groupings. The options are available depending on the types of components deployed in the project:

** *Mode* (*Connectivity* or *Consumption*)
*** Connectivity: Select to show all the connections between the different nodes in the topology.
*** Consumption: Select to show the resource consumption for all nodes in the topology.
** *Expand* group
*** Virtual Machines: Toggle to show or hide the virtual machines.
*** Application Groupings: Clear to condense the application groups into cards with an overview of an application group and alerts associated with it.
*** Helm Releases: Clear to condense the components deployed as Helm Release into cards with an overview of a given release.
*** Knative Services: Clear to condense the Knative Service components into cards with an overview of a given component.
*** Operator Groupings: Clear to condense the components deployed with an Operator into cards with an overview of the given group.
** *Show* elements based on *Pod Count* or *Labels*
*** Pod Count: Select to show the number of pods of a component in the component icon.
*** Labels: Toggle to show or hide the component labels.

The *Topology* view also provides you the *Export application* option to download your application in the ZIP file format. You can then import the downloaded application to another project or cluster. For more details, see _Exporting an application to another project or cluster_ in the _Additional resources_ section.
