= Viewing the topology of your application

You can navigate to the *Topology* view using the left navigation panel in the *Developer* perspective. After you create an application, you are directed automatically to the *Topology* view where you can see the status of the application Pods, quickly access the application on a public URL, access the source code to modify it, and see the status of your last build.

A serverless application is visually indicated with the Knative symbol (image:odc_serverless_app.png[title="Serverless Application"]). You can zoom in and out to see more details for a particular application.

The status or phase of the Pod is indicated by different colors and tooltips as *Running* (image:odc_pod_running.png[title="Pod Running"]), *Not Ready* (image:odc_pod_not_ready.png[title="Pod Not Ready"]), *Warning*(image:odc_pod_warning.png[title="Pod Warning"]), *Failed*(image:odc_pod_failed.png[title="Pod Failed"]), *Pending*(image:odc_pod_pending.png[title="Pod Pending"]), *Succeeded*(image:odc_pod_succeeded.png[title="Pod Succeeded"]), *Terminating*(image:odc_pod_terminating.png[title="Pod Terminating"]), or *Unknown*(image:odc_pod_unknown.png[title="Pod Unknown"]).
For more information about pod status, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-phase[Kubernetes documentation].

After you create an application and an image is deployed, the status is shown as *Pending*. After the application is built, it is displayed as *Running*.
