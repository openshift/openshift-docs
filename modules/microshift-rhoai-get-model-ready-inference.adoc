= Getting your AI model ready for inference

Before querying your AI model through the API, get the model ready to provide answers based on the training data. The following examples continue with the OVMS model.

.Prerequisites

* {microshift-short} is running.
* You have the `xxd` utility, which is part of the `vim-common` package.
* You configured the model-serving runtime.
* You uploaded your AI model to {microshift-short}.

.Procedure

. Download an image of a bee from the {ovms} examples by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/main/demos/common/static/images/bee.jpeg
----

. Create the request data by running the following script:
+
[source,bash]
----
IMAGE=./bee.jpeg
REQ=./request.json

# Add an inference header
echo -n '{"inputs" : [{"name": "0", "shape": [1], "datatype": "BYTES"}]}' > "${REQ}"
# Get the size of the inference header <1>
HEADER_LEN="$(stat -c %s "${REQ}")"
# Add size of the data (image) in binary format (4 bytes, little endian) <2>
printf "%08X" $(stat --format=%s "${IMAGE}") | sed 's/\(..\)/\1\n/g' | tac | tr -d '\n' | xxd -r -p >> "${REQ}"
# Add the data, that is, append the image to the request file
cat "${IMAGE}" >> "${REQ}"
----
<1> The inference header size must be passed to {ovms} later in the form of an HTTP header.
<2> The {ovms} requires 4 bytes in little endian byte order.
