= The 3scale WebAssembly module lookup queries

The `lookup query` object is part of any of the fields in the `credentials` object. It specifies how a given credential field should be found and processed. When evaluated, a successful resolution means that one or more values were found. A failed resolution means that no values were found.

Arrays of `lookup queries` describe a short-circuit or relationship: a successful resolution of one of the queries stops the evaluation of any remaining queries and assigns the value or values to the specified credential-type. Each query in the array is independent of each other.

A `lookup query` is made up of a single field, a source object, which can be one of a number of source types. See the following example:
