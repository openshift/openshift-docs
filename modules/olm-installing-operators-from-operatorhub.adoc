= Installing Operators from the OperatorHub

As a cluster administrator, you can install an Operator from the OperatorHub
using the {product-title}
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
web console or the CLI. You can then subscribe the Operator to one or more
namespaces to make it available for developers on your cluster.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
web console. You can then subscribe the Operator to the default
`openshift-operators` namespace to make it available for developers on your
cluster.

In {product-title} clusters, a curated list of Operators is made available for
installation from the OperatorHub. Administrators can only install Operators to
the default `openshift-operators` namespace, except for the Logging Operator,
which requires the `openshift-logging` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
Privileged and custom Operators cannot be installed.

During installation, you must determine the following initial settings for the
Operator:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
Installation Mode:: Choose *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* to have the
Operator installed on all namespaces or choose individual namespaces, if
available, to only install the Operator on selected namespaces. This example
chooses *All namespaces...* to make the Operator available to all users and
projects.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
Installation Mode:: In {product-title} clusters, you can choose *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*
to have the Operator installed on all namespaces. This makes the Operator
available to all users and projects.
endif::[]

Update Channel:: If an Operator is available through multiple channels, you can
choose which channel you want to subscribe to. For example, to deploy from the
*stable* channel, if available, select it from the list.

Approval Strategy:: You can choose Automatic or Manual updates. If you choose
Automatic updates for an installed Operator, when a new version of that Operator
is available, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the
running instance of your Operator without human intervention. If you select
Manual updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, the OLM
creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually
approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.
