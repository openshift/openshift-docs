= Installing Operators from OperatorHub

ifndef::olm-user[]
As a cluster administrator, you can install an Operator from OperatorHub using the {product-title}
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
web console or CLI. You can then subscribe the Operator to one or more namespaces to make it available for developers on your cluster.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
web console. You can then subscribe the Operator to the default `openshift-operators` namespace to make it available for developers on your cluster. When you subscribe the Operator to all namespaces, the Operator is installed in the `openshift-operators` namespace; this installation method is not supported by all Operators.

In {product-title} clusters, a curated list of Operators is made available for installation from OperatorHub. Administrators can only install Operators to the default `openshift-operators` namespace, except for the Logging Operator, which requires the `openshift-logging` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
Privileged and custom Operators cannot be installed.

ifdef::olm-user[]
As a user with the proper permissions, you can install an Operator from OperatorHub using the {product-title} web console or CLI.

During installation, you must determine the following initial settings for the Operator:

ifndef::olm-user[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
Installation Mode:: Choose *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* to have the Operator installed on all namespaces or choose individual namespaces, if available, to only install the Operator on selected namespaces. This example chooses *All namespaces...* to make the Operator available to all users and projects.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
Installation Mode:: In {product-title} clusters, you can choose *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* to have the Operator installed on all namespaces. This makes the Operator available to all users and projects.
endif::[]
endif::[]
ifdef::olm-user[]
Installation Mode:: Choose a specific namespace in which to install the Operator.
endif::[]

Update Channel:: If an Operator is available through multiple channels, you can choose which channel you want to subscribe to. For example, to deploy from the *stable* channel, if available, select it from the list.

Approval Strategy:: You can choose automatic or manual updates. If you choose automatic updates for an installed Operator, when a new version of that Operator is available in the selected channel, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention. If you select manual updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.
