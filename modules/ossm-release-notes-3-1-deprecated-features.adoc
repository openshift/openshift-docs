= {SMProductName} version 3.1 deprecated features

Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed.

Deprecated functionality is still included in {ocp-product-title} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of {SMProductName} 3 and is not recommended for new deployments.

Removed functionality no longer exists in the product.

[id="dns-auto-auto-allocation-proxymetadata_{context}"]
== DNS auto-allocation in ProxyMetadata

This release removes the use of `ISTIO_META_DNS_AUTO_ALLOCATE` option in the `proxyMetadata` configuration. You can use the DNS auto-allocation label in the `ServiceEntry` resource instead. A future release will remove support for the `ISTIO_META_DNS_AUTO_ALLOCATE` option.

For more information about using the DNS auto-allocation label in the `ServiceEntry` resource, see the "Address auto-collection" section in the {istio} documentation.
