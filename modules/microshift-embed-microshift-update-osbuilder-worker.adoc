= Updating osbuilder worker configuration to prepare for image building

After you have updated the blueprint, you must update the osbuilder worker configuration to prepare for building the image with embedded {microshift-short} containers.

.Prerequisites

* You have root-user access to your build host.
* Your build host meets the Image Builder system requirements.
* You have installed and set up Image Builder and the `composer-cli` tool.

[NOTE]
====
You can create an `/etc/osbuild-worker/osbuild-worker.toml` directory and configuration file if they do not exist.
====

.Procedure

. Add a pull secret for authenticating to the registry by setting the `auth_file_path` in the `[containers]` section of the `/etc/osbuild-worker/osbuild-worker.toml` osbuilder worker configuration file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[containers]
auth_file_path = "/etc/osbuild-worker/pull-secret.json"
----

. Restart the `osbuild-worker` to apply configuration changes by restarting the host. Restarting the host ensures that all `osbuild-worker` services currently running are restarted.
