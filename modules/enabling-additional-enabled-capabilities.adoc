= Enabling the cluster capabilities by setting additional enabled capabilities

As a cluster administrator, you can enable cluster capabilities any time after a {product-title} installation by setting the `additionalEnabledCapabilities` configuration parameter.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. View the additional enabled capabilities by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion version -o jsonpath='{.spec.capabilities.additionalEnabledCapabilities}{"\n"}'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
["openshift-samples"]
----

. To set the `additionalEnabledCapabilities` configuration parameter, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch clusterversion/version --type merge -p '{"spec":{"capabilities":{"additionalEnabledCapabilities":["openshift-samples", "marketplace"]}}}'
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not possible to disable a capability which is already enabled in a cluster. The cluster version Operator (CVO) continues to reconcile the capability which is already enabled in the cluster.
====


If you try to disable a capability, then CVO shows the divergent spec:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion version -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="ImplicitlyEnabledCapabilities")]}{"\n"}'
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{"lastTransitionTime":"2022-07-22T03:14:35Z","message":"The following capabilities could not be disabled: openshift-samples","reason":"CapabilitiesImplicitlyEnabled","status":"True","type":"ImplicitlyEnabledCapabilities"}
----

[NOTE]
====
During the cluster upgrades, it is possible that a given capability could be implicitly enabled. If a resource was already running on the cluster before the upgrade, then any capabilities that is part of the resource will be enabled. For example, during a cluster upgrade, a resource that is already running on the cluster has been changed to be part of the `marketplace` capability by the system. Even if a cluster administrator does not explicitly enabled the `marketplace` capability, it is implicitly enabled by the system.
