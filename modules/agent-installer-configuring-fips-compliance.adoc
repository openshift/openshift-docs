= Configuring FIPS through the Agent-based Installer

During a cluster deployment, the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) change is applied when the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines are deployed in your cluster. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machines, you must enable FIPS mode when you install the operating system on the machines that you plan to use as worker machines.

You can enable FIPS mode through the preferred method of `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml`:

. You must set value of the `fips` field to `True` in the `install-config.yaml` file:
+
.Sample install-config.yaml.file

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: test.example.com
metadata:
  name: sno-cluster
fips: True
----

. Optional: If you are using the {ztp} manifests, you must set the value of `fips` as `True` in the `Agent-install.openshift.io/install-config-overrides` field in the `agent-cluster-install.yaml` file:

+
.Sample agent-cluster-install.yaml file
[source,yaml]
