== Auto-provisioning an Elasticsearch instance

When you deploy a Jaeger custom resource, the {JaegerName} Operator uses the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to create an Elasticsearch cluster based on the configuration provided in the `storage` section of the custom resource file. The {JaegerName} Operator will provision Elasticsearch if the following configurations are set:

* `spec.storage:type` is set to `elasticsearch`
* `spec.storage.elasticsearch.doNotProvision` set to `false`
* `spec.storage.options.es.server-urls` is not defined, that is, there is no connection to an Elasticsearch instance that was not provisioned by the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator.

When provisioning Elasticsearch, the {JaegerName} Operator sets the Elasticsearch custom resource `name` to the value of `spec.storage.elasticsearch.name` from the Jaeger custom resource.  If you do not specify a value for `spec.storage.elasticsearch.name`, the Operator uses `elasticsearch`.

.Restrictions

* You can have only one {JaegerShortName} with self-provisioned Elasticsearch instance per namespace. The Elasticsearch cluster is meant to be dedicated for a single {JaegerShortName} instance.
* There can be only one Elasticsearch per namespace.

[NOTE]
====
If you already have installed Elasticsearch as part of OpenShift Logging, the {JaegerName} Operator can use the installed OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to provision storage.
====

The following configuration parameters are for a _self-provisioned_ Elasticsearch instance, that is an instance created by the {JaegerName} Operator using the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. You specify configuration options for self-provisioned Elasticsearch under `spec:storage:elasticsearch` in your configuration file.

.Elasticsearch resource configuration parameters

[cols="l, a, a, a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Values |Default value
|elasticsearch:
  properties:
    doNotProvision:
|Use to specify whether or not an Elasticsearch instance should be provisioned by the {JaegerName} Operator.
|`true`/`false`
|`true`

|elasticsearch:
  properties:
    name:
|Name of the Elasticsearch instance. The {JaegerName} Operator uses the Elasticsearch instance specified in this parameter to connect to Elasticsearch.
|string
|`elasticsearch`

|elasticsearch:
  nodeCount:
|Number of Elasticsearch nodes. For high availability use at least 3 nodes. Do not use 2 nodes as “split brain” problem can happen.
|Integer value. For example, Proof of concept = 1,
Minimum deployment =3
|3

|elasticsearch:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu:
|Number of central processing units for requests, based on your environment's configuration.
|Specified in cores or millicores, for example, 200m, 0.5, 1. For example, Proof of concept = 500m,
Minimum deployment =1
|1

|elasticsearch:
  resources:
    requests:
      memory:
|Available memory for requests, based on your environment's configuration.
|Specified in bytes, for example, 200Ki, 50Mi, 5Gi. For example, Proof of concept = 1Gi,
Minimum deployment = 16Gi*
|16Gi

|elasticsearch:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu:
|Limit on number of central processing units, based on your environment's configuration.
|Specified in cores or millicores, for example, 200m, 0.5, 1. For example, Proof of concept = 500m,
Minimum deployment =1
|

|elasticsearch:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory:
|Available memory limit based on your environment's configuration.
|Specified in bytes, for example, 200Ki, 50Mi, 5Gi. For example, Proof of concept = 1Gi,
Minimum deployment = 16Gi*
|

|elasticsearch:
  redundancyPolicy:
|Data replication policy defines how Elasticsearch shards are replicated across data nodes in the cluster. If not specified, the {JaegerName} Operator automatically determines the most appropriate replication based on number of nodes.
|`ZeroRedundancy`(no replica shards), `SingleRedundancy`(one replica shard), `MultipleRedundancy`(each index is spread over half of the Data nodes), `FullRedundancy` (each index is fully replicated on every Data node in the cluster).
|

|elasticsearch:
  useCertManagement:
|Use to specify whether or not {JaegerShortName} should use the certificate management feature of the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator.  This feature was added to {logging-title} 5.2 in {product-title} 4.7 and is the preferred setting for new Jaeger deployments.
|`true`/`false`
|`true`

|===

Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting though this is NOT recommended for production deployments. For production use, you must have no less than 16 Gi allocated to each pod by default, but preferably allocate as much as you can, up to 64 Gi per pod.

----

<1> Persistent storage configuration. In this case AWS `gp2` with `5Gi` size. When no value is specified, {JaegerShortName} uses `emptyDir`. The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator provisions `PersistentVolumeClaim` and `PersistentVolume` which are not removed with {JaegerShortName} instance. You can mount the same volumes if you create a {JaegerShortName} instance with the same name and namespace.


[id="distributed-tracing-config-external-es_{context}"]
== Connecting to an existing Elasticsearch instance

You can use an existing Elasticsearch cluster for storage with {DTShortName}. An existing Elasticsearch cluster, also known as an _external_ Elasticsearch instance, is an instance that was not installed by the {JaegerName} Operator or by the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator.

When you deploy a Jaeger custom resource, the {JaegerName} Operator will not provision Elasticsearch if the following configurations are set:

* `spec.storage.elasticsearch.doNotProvision` set to `true`
* `spec.storage.options.es.server-urls` has a value
* `spec.storage.elasticsearch.name` has a value, or if the Elasticsearch instance name is `elasticsearch`.

The {JaegerName} Operator uses the Elasticsearch instance specified in `spec.storage.elasticsearch.name` to connect to Elasticsearch.

.Restrictions

* You cannot share or reuse a {product-title} logging Elasticsearch instance with {JaegerShortName}. The Elasticsearch cluster is meant to be dedicated for a single {JaegerShortName} instance.

The following configuration parameters are for an already existing Elasticsearch instance, also known as an _external_ Elasticsearch instance. In this case, you specify configuration options for Elasticsearch under `spec:storage:options:es` in your custom resource file.

= Managing certificates with Elasticsearch

You can create and manage certificates using the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator. Managing certificates using the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator also lets you use a single Elasticsearch cluster with multiple Jaeger Collectors.

:FeatureName: Managing certificates with Elasticsearch
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

Starting with version 2.4, the {JaegerName} Operator delegates certificate creation to the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator by using the following annotations in the Elasticsearch custom resource:

* `logging.openshift.io/elasticsearch-cert-management: "true"`
* `logging.openshift.io/elasticsearch-cert.jaeger-<shared-es-node-name>: "user.jaeger"`
* `logging.openshift.io/elasticsearch-cert.curator-<shared-es-node-name>: "system.logging.curator"`

Where the `<shared-es-node-name>` is the name of the Elasticsearch node. For example, if you create an Elasticsearch node named `custom-es`, your custom resource might look like the following example.

.Prerequisites

* {product-title} 4.7
* {logging-title} 5.2
* The Elasticsearch node and the Jaeger instances must be deployed in the same namespace.  For example, `tracing-system`.

You enable certificate management by setting `spec.storage.elasticsearch.useCertManagement` to `true` in the Jaeger custom resource.
