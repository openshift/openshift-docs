= Creating a primary namespace-scoped user-defined network by using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can create an isolated primary network in your project namespace by creating a `UserDefinedNetwork` custom resource in the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have created a namespace and applied the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label. For more information, see "Creating a namespace for user-defined networks by using the web console".

.Procedure
. From the *Administrator* perspective, click *Networking* -> *UserDefinedNetworks*.

. Click *Create UserDefinedNetwork*.

. From the *Project name* list, select the namespace that you previously created.

. Specify a value in the *Subnet* field.

. Click *Create*. The user-defined network serves as the default primary network for pods and virtual machines that you create in this namespace.
