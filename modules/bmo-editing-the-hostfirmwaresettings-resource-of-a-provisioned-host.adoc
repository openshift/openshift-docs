= Editing the HostFirmwareSettings resource of a provisioned host

To make changes to the `HostFirmwareSettings` spec for a provisioned host, perform the following actions:

* Edit the host `HostFirmwareSettings` resource.
* Delete the host from the machine set.
* Scale down the machine set.
* Scale up the machine set to make the changes take effect.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only edit hosts when they are in the `provisioned` state, excluding read-only values. You cannot edit hosts in the `externally provisioned` state.
====

.Procedure

. Get the list of `HostFirmwareSettings` resources by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get hfs -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Edit the host `HostFirmwareSettings` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit hfs <hostname> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Where `<hostname>` is the name of a provisioned host. The `HostFirmwareSettings` resource will open in the default editor for your terminal.

. Add name and value pairs to the `spec.settings` section by running the following command:
+
.Example
[source,terminal]
----
spec:
  settings:
    name: value <1>
----
<1> Use the `FirmwareSchema` resource to identify the available settings for the host. You cannot set values that are read-only.

. Save the changes and exit the editor.

. Get the host machine name by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 $ oc get bmh <hostname> -n openshift-machine name
----
+
Where `<hostname>` is the name of the host. The terminal displays the machine name under the `CONSUMER` field.

. Annotate the machine to delete it from the machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate machine <machine_name> machine.openshift.io/delete-machine=true -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Where `<machine_name>` is the name of the machine to delete.

. Get a list of nodes and count the number of worker nodes by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----

. Get the machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Scale the machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale machineset <machineset_name> -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=<n-1>
----
+
Where `<machineset_name>` is the name of the machine set and `<n-1>` is the decremented number of worker nodes.

. When the host enters the `Available` state, scale up the machine set to make the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource changes take effect by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale machineset <machineset_name> -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=<n>
----
+
Where `<machineset_name>` is the name of the machine set and `<n>` is the number of worker nodes.
