= Creating an application from source code

With the `new-app` command you can create applications from source code in a
local or remote Git repository.

The `new-app` command creates a build configuration, which itself creates a new
application image from your source code. The `new-app` command typically also
creates a deployment configuration to deploy the new image, and a service to
provide load-balanced access to the deployment running your image.

{product-title} automatically detects whether the `Pipeline` or `Source`
build strategy should be used, and in the case of `Source` builds,
detects an appropriate language builder image.

== Local

To create an application from a Git repository in a local directory:

----
$ oc new-app /<path to source code>
----

[NOTE]
====
If you use a local Git repository, the repository must have a remote named
`origin` that points to a URL that is accessible by the {product-title} cluster. If
there is no recognized remote,  running the `new-app` command will create a binary build.
====

== Remote

To create an application from a remote Git repository:

----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/sclorg/cakephp-ex
----

To create an application from a private remote Git repository:

----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/youruser/yourprivaterepo --source-secret=yoursecret
----

[NOTE]
====
If you use a private remote Git repository, you can use the `--source-secret` flag
to specify an existing source clone secret that will get injected into your
`BuildConfig` to access the repository.
====

You can use a subdirectory of your source code repository by specifying a
`--context-dir` flag. To create an application from a remote Git repository and
a context subdirectory:

----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-ruby-container.git \
    --context-dir=2.0/test/puma-test-app
----

Also, when specifying a remote URL, you can specify a Git branch to use by
appending `#<branch_name>` to the end of the URL:

----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git#beta4
----

== Build strategy detection

If a `Jenkinsfile` exists in the root or specified context directory of the
source repository when creating a new application, {product-title} generates a
Pipeline build strategy.

Otherwise, it generates a Source build strategy.

Override the build strategy by setting the `--strategy` flag to either
`pipeline` or `source`.

----
$ oc new-app /home/user/code/myapp --strategy=docker
----

[NOTE]
====
The `oc` command requires that files containing build sources are available in a
remote Git repository. For all source builds, you must use `git remote -v`.
====

== Language Detection

If you use the `Source` build strategy, `new-app` attempts to determine the
language builder to use by the presence of certain files in the root or
specified context directory of the repository:

.Languages Detected by `new-app`
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Language |Files
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-dedicated,openshift-aro,openshift-online[]
|`dotnet`
|`project.json`, `pass:[*.csproj]`
endif::[]
|`jee`
|`pom.xml`

|`nodejs`
|`app.json`, `package.json`

|`perl`
|`cpanfile`, `index.pl`

|`php`
|`composer.json`, `index.php`

|`python`
|`requirements.txt`, `setup.py`

|`ruby`
|`Gemfile`, `Rakefile`, `config.ru`

|`scala`
|`build.sbt`

|`golang`
|`Godeps`, `main.go`
|===

After a language is detected, `new-app` searches the {product-title} server for
imagestreamtags that have a `supports` annotation matching the detected language,
or an imagestream that matches the name of the detected language. If a match is
not found, `new-app` searches the link:https://registry.hub.docker.com[Docker Hub
registry] for an image that matches the detected language based on name.

You can override the image the builder uses for a particular source
repository by specifying the image, either an imagestream or container
specification, and the repository with a `~` as a separator. Note that if this
is done, build strategy detection and language detection are not carried out.

For example, to use the `myproject/my-ruby` imagestream with the source in a
remote repository:

----
$ oc new-app myproject/my-ruby~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git
----

To use the `openshift/ruby-20-centos7:latest` container imagestream with
the source in a local repository:

----
$ oc new-app openshift/ruby-20-centos7:latest~/home/user/code/my-ruby-app
----

[NOTE]
====
Language detection requires the Git client to be locally installed so that your
repository can be cloned and inspected. If Git is not available, you can avoid
the language detection step by specifying the builder image to use with your
repository with the `<image>~<repository>` syntax.

The `-i <image> <repository>` invocation requires that `new-app` attempt
to clone `repository` in order to determine what type of artifact it is, so this
will fail if Git is not available.

The `-i <image> --code <repository>` invocation requires
`new-app` clone `repository` in order to determine whether `image` should be
used as a builder for the source code, or deployed separately, as in the case of
a database image.
