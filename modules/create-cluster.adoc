= Creating a cluster


You can quickly create a standard {product-title} cluster, which deploys in cloud provider accounts owned by Red Hat.

.Procedure

. Log in to {cloud-redhat-com}.

. Click *Create Cluster* -> *Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated* -> *Create Clusters*.

. Select a cloud infrastructure provider.

. Select *Standard* for the billing model.

. Enter a *Cluster name*.

. Select a *Region* and choose either a *Single zone* or *Multizone* availability.

. Select your *Compute node instance type* and the *Compute node count*. The number and types of nodes available to you depend on your {product-title} subscription.

. Optional: Expand *Edit node labels* to add labels to your nodes. Click *Add label* to add more node labels.

. Select the amount of *Persistent storage* and *Load balancers* you want set on the deployed cluster or accept the defaults.

. The *Basic* Network configuration is selected by default. This setting creates a new VPC for your cluster using the default values.

. Select your cluster update method. *Manual* is selected by default. If you want your clusters to be automatically upgraded when new versions are available, select the *Automatic* option. If you opt for automatic upgrades, you must specify the preferred day of the week and the time (UTC) for the upgrade to start.

. Optional: You can set a grace period for *Node Draining* during cluster upgrades. A *1 hour* grace period is set by default.

. Click *Create cluster*. The cluster creation process begins and takes about 30-40 minutes to complete.

.Verification

* The *Installing cluster* heading, under the *Overview* tab, indicates that the cluster is installing and you can view the installation logs from this heading. The *Status* indicator under the *Details* heading indicates when your cluster is *Ready* for use.
