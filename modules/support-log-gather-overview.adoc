= About {support-log-gather}

{support-log-gather} Operator builds on the functionality of the traditional `must-gather` tool to automate the collection of debugging data. It streamlines troubleshooting by packaging the collected information into a single `.tar` file and automatically uploading it to the specified Red{nbsp}Hat Support case.

include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The key features of {support-log-gather} include the following:

* **No administrator privileges required**: Enables you to collect and upload logs without needing elevated permissions, making it easier for non-administrators to gather data securely.

* **Simplified log collection**: Collects debugging data from the cluster, such as resource definitions and service logs.

* **Configurable data upload**: Provides configuration options to either automatically upload the `.tar` file to a support case, or store it locally for manual upload.
