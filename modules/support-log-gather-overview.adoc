= About {support-log-gather}

{support-log-gather} Operator builds on the functionality of the traditional must-gather tool to automate the collection of debugging data. It streamlines troubleshooting by packaging the collected information into a single .tar file and automatically uploading it to the specified Red{nbsp}Hat support case.

The key features of {support-log-gather} include the following:

* **No administrator privileges required**: Enables you to collect and upload logs without needing elevated permissions, making it easier for non-administrators to gather data securely.

* **Simplified log collection**: Collects debugging data from the cluster, such as resource definitions and service logs.

* **Automated upload**: Automatically attaches the collected `.tar` file to the corresponding Red{nbsp}Hat support case.
