= Creating metrics from nested or array fields in the Traffic flows table

:FeatureName: OVN Observability / Viewing `NetworkEvents`
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
OVN Observability and the ability to view and track network events is available only in {product-title} 4.17 and 4.18. 
====
You can create a `FlowMetric` resource to generate metrics for nested or array fields in the *Traffic flows* table, such as *Network events* or *Interfaces*. The following example shows how to generate metrics from the *Network events* field for network policy events. 

.Prerequsities
* Enable `NetworkEvents feature`. See the Additional resources for how to do this. 
* A network policy specified. 

.Procedure
. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. In the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *FlowMetric*.
. In the *Project*  dropdown list, select the project of the Network Observability Operator instance. 
. Click *Create FlowMetric*.
. Create `FlowMetric` resources to add the following configurations: 
+
.Configuration counting network policy events per policy name and namespace
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1alpha1
kind: FlowMetric
metadata:
  name: network-policy-events
  namespace: netobserv
spec:
  metricName: network_policy_events_total
  type: Counter
  labels: [NetworkEvents>Type, NetworkEvents>Namespace, NetworkEvents>Name, NetworkEvents>Action, NetworkEvents>Direction]       <1>
  filters:
  - field: NetworkEvents>Feature
    value: acl
  flatten: [NetworkEvents]       <2>
  remap:                         <3>
    "NetworkEvents>Type": type
    "NetworkEvents>Namespace": namespace
    "NetworkEvents>Name": name
    "NetworkEvents>Direction": direction
----
<1> These labels represent the nested fields for *Network Events* from the *Traffic flows* table. Each network event has a specific type, namespace, name, action, and direction. You can alternatively specify the `Interfaces` if `NetworkEvents` is unavailable in your {product-title} version.
<2> Optional: You can choose to represent a field that contains a list of items as distinct items.
<3> Optional: You can rename the fields in Prometheus.  

.Verification
. In the web console, navigate to *Observe* -> *Dashboards* and scroll down to see the *Network Policy* tab. 
. You should begin seeing metrics filter in based on the metric you created along with the network policy specifications.
