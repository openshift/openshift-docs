. Installation is only supported by using the {SMProduct} 3 Operator, which uses the Istio Helm chart values for managing configuration.
. The `ProxyConfig` API is supported with the exception of the image field, which is not supported.
. Dual-Stack IPv4/IPv6 is supported on x86 environments only. On non-x86 environments, this feature remains a Technology Preview.
