[role="_abstract"]
The following items were added during the third quarter of 2025.

* **Updates to Workload Identity Federation (WIF) permissions and roles.**
The default IAM permissions for WIF in the link:https://github.com/openshift/managed-cluster-config/blob/master/resources/wif/4.19/vanilla.yaml[managed-cluster-config] template have been updated. This means newly created WIF configurations will have fewer, less overly permissive permissions by default.
** The `sd-sre-platform-gcp-access@redhat.com` principal no longer needs the `compute.firewalls.create` permission. If Red{nbsp}Hat SREs ever need this permission, they will reach out through a support case.
** The `osd-deployer` service account no longer requires the `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy` permission, which has been removed.
** The `osd-deployer` service account no longer uses the `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` permission. This has been replaced with the `iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role, which is now specifically assigned to the service accounts that require it.
** The `osd-deployer` service account no longer uses the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission. This has been replaced with the `iam.serviceAccountUser` role, which is now specifically assigned to the service accounts that require it.

If you have existing `wif-config` instances, you can get these new, less permissive permissions by running the `ocm gcp update wif-config` command.

* **Workload Identify Federation (WIF) is now the default authentication type for {product-title} clusters on {GCP}.**
In alignment with the principle of least privilege as well as {gcp-full}'s preferred method of credential authentication, WIF is now the default authentication type when creating an {product-title} cluster on {GCP}. WIF greatly improves an {product-title} cluster's resilience against unauthorized access by using short-lived, least-privilege credentials and eliminating the need for static service account keys. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_dedicated/4/html/openshift_dedicated_clusters_on_google_cloud/osd-creating-a-cluster-on-gcp-with-workload-identity-federation[Creating a cluster on {gcp-short} with Workload Identity Federation authentication].

* **Support for managing workload identity pools and providers in a dedicated {GCP} project.**
{product-title} on {GCP} now supports the option of creating and managing workload identity pools and providers in a specified dedicated project during the creation of a WIF configuration. Red{nbsp}Hat plans on offering this option for existing WIF configurations in an upcoming release.
