= Uploading an Insights Operator archive

You can manually upload an Insights Operator archive to link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com] to diagnose potential issues.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to {product-title} as `cluster-admin`.
* You have a workstation with unrestricted internet access.
* You have created a copy of the Insights Operator archive.

.Procedure

. Download the `dockerconfig.json` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --to=.
----
. Copy your `"cloud.openshift.com"` `"auth"` token from the `dockerconfig.json` file:
+
[source,json,subs="+quotes"]
----
{    
  "auths": {        
    "cloud.openshift.com": {            
      "auth": "_<your_token>_",
      "email": "asd@redhat.com"
    }
}
----


. Upload the archive to link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com]:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ curl -v -H "User-Agent: insights-operator/one10time200gather184a34f6a168926d93c330 cluster/_<cluster_id>_" -H "Authorization: Bearer _<your_token>_" -F "upload=@_<path_to_archive>_; type=application/vnd.redhat.openshift.periodic+tar" https://console.redhat.com/api/ingress/v1/upload
----
where `_<cluster_id>_` is your cluster ID, `_<your_token>_` is the token from your pull secret, and `_<path_to_archive>_` is the path to the Insights Operator archive. 
+
If the operation is successful, the command returns a `"request_id"` and `"account_number"`:
+
.Example output

[source,terminal]
----
* Connection #0 to host console.redhat.com left intact
{"request_id":"393a7cf1093e434ea8dd4ab3eb28884c","upload":{"account_number":"6274079"}}%
----
