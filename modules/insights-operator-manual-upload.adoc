* You are logged in to {product-title} as `cluster-admin`.
* You have a workstation with unrestricted internet access.
* You have created a copy of the {insights-operator} archive.

. Download the `dockerconfig.json` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --to=.

{
  "auths": {
    "cloud.openshift.com": {
      "auth": "_<your_token>_",
