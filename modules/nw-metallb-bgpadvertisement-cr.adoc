= About the BGPAdvertisement custom resource

The fields for the `BGPAdvertisements` object are defined in the following table:

.BGPAdvertisements configuration
[cols="1,1,3a", options="header"]
|===

|Field
|Type
|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|Specifies the name for the BGP advertisement.

|`metadata.namespace`
|`string`
|Specifies the namespace for the BGP advertisement.
Specify the same namespace that the MetalLB Operator uses.

|`spec.aggregationLength`
|`integer`
|Optional: Specifies the number of bits to include in a 32-bit CIDR mask.
To aggregate the routes that the speaker advertises to BGP peers, the mask is applied to the routes for several service IP addresses and the speaker advertises the aggregated route.
For example, with an aggregation length of `24`, the speaker can aggregate several `10.0.1.x/32` service IP addresses and advertise a single `10.0.1.0/24` route.

|`spec.aggregationLengthV6`
|`integer`
|Optional: Specifies the number of bits to include in a 128-bit CIDR mask.
For example, with an aggregation length of `124`, the speaker can aggregate several `fc00:f853:0ccd:e799::x/128` service IP addresses and advertise a single `fc00:f853:0ccd:e799::0/124` route.

|`spec.communities`
|`string`
|Optional: Specifies one or more BGP communities.
Each community is specified as two 16-bit values separated by the colon character.
Well-known communities must be specified as 16-bit values:

* `NO_EXPORT`: `65535:65281`
* `NO_ADVERTISE`: `65535:65282`
* `NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED`: `65535:65283`

[NOTE]
====
You can also use community objects that are created along with the strings.

|`spec.localPref`
|`integer`
|Optional: Specifies the local preference for this advertisement.
This BGP attribute applies to BGP sessions within the Autonomous System.

|`spec.ipAddressPools`
|`string`
|Optional: The list of `IPAddressPools` to advertise with this advertisement, selected by name.

|`spec.ipAddressPoolSelectors`
|`string`
|Optional: A selector for the `IPAddressPools` that gets advertised with this advertisement. This is for associating the `IPAddressPool` to the advertisement based on the label assigned to the `IPAddressPool` instead of the name itself. If no `IPAddressPool` is selected by this or by the list, the advertisement is applied to all the `IPAddressPools`.

|`spec.nodeSelectors`
|`string`
|Optional: `NodeSelectors` allows to limit the nodes to announce as next hops for the load balancer IP. When empty, all the nodes are announced as next hops.

|`spec.peers`
|`string`
|Optional: Peers limits the BGP peer to advertise the IPs of the selected pools to. When empty, the load balancer IP is announced to all the BGP peers configured.
