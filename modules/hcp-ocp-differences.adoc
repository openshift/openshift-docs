[id="hcp-ocp-differences_{context}"]
= Differences between {hcp} and {product-title}

{hcp-capital} is a form factor of {product-title}. Hosted clusters and the stand-alone {product-title} clusters are configured and managed differently. See the following tables to understand the differences between {product-title} and {hcp}:


[id="cluster-creation_{context}"]
== Cluster creation and lifecycle

[cols="2a,2a",options="header"]
|===

|{product-title} |{hcp-capital}

|You install a standalone {product-title} cluster by using the `openshift-install` binary or the Assisted Installer.
|You install a hosted cluster by using the `hypershift.openshift.io` API resources such as `HostedCluster` and `NodePool`, on an existing {product-title} cluster.

|===

[id="cluster-configuration_{context}"]
== Cluster configuration

[cols="2a,2a",options="header"]
|===

|{product-title} |{hcp-capital}

|You configure cluster-scoped resources such as authentication, API server, and proxy by using the `config.openshift.io` API group.
|You configure resources that impact the control plane in the `HostedCluster` resource.

|===

[id="etcd-encryption_{context}"]
== etcd encryption

[cols="2a,2a",options="header"]
|===

|{product-title} |{hcp-capital}

|You configure etcd encryption by using the `APIServer` resource with AES-GCM or AES-CBC. For more information, see "Enabling etcd encryption".
|You configure etcd encryption by using the `HostedCluster` resource in the `SecretEncryption` field with AES-CBC or KMS for {aws-full}.

|===

[id="operators-and-control-plane_{context}"]
== Operators and control plane

[cols="2a,4a",options="header"]
|===

|{product-title} |{hcp-capital}

|A standalone {product-title} cluster contains separate Operators for each control plane component.
|A hosted cluster contains a single Operator named Control Plane Operator that runs in the hosted control plane namespace on the management cluster.

|etcd uses storage that is mounted on the control plane nodes. The etcd cluster Operator manages etcd.
|etcd uses a persistent volume claim for storage and is managed by the Control Plane Operator.

|The Ingress Operator, network related Operators, and {olm-first} run on the cluster.
|The Ingress Operator, network related Operators, and {olm-first} run in the hosted control plane namespace on the management cluster.

|The OAuth server runs inside the cluster and is exposed through a route in the cluster.
|The OAuth server runs inside the control plane and is exposed through a route, node port, or load balancer on the management cluster.

|===

[id="upgrades_{context}"]
== Updates

[cols="2a,2a",options="header"]
|===

|{product-title} |{hcp-capital}

|The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) orchestrates the update process and monitors the `ClusterVersion` resource. Administrators and OpenShift components can interact with the CVO through the `ClusterVersion` resource. The `oc adm upgrade` command results in a change to the `ClusterVersion.Spec.DesiredUpdate` field in the `ClusterVersion` resource.
|The {hcp} update results in a change to the `.spec.release.image` field in the `HostedCluster` and `NodePools` resources. Any changes to the `ClusterVersion` resource are ignored.

|After you update an {product-title} cluster, both the control plane and compute machines are updated.
|After you update the hosted cluster, only the control plane is updated. You perform node pool updates separately.

|===

[id="machine-config-manage_{context}"]
== Machine configuration and management

[cols="2a,2a",options="header"]
|===

|{product-title} |{hcp-capital}

|The `MachineSets` resource manages machines in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace.
|The `NodePool` resource manages machines on the management cluster.

|A set of control plane machines are available.
|A set of control plane machines do not exist.

|You enable a machine health check by using the `MachineHealthCheck` resource.
|You enable a machine health check through the `.spec.management.autoRepair` field in the `NodePool` resource.

|You enable autoscaling by using the `ClusterAutoscaler` and `MachineAutoscaler` resources.
|You enable autoscaling through the `spec.autoScaling` field in the `NodePool` resource.

|Machines and machine sets are exposed in the cluster.
|Machines, machine sets, and machine deployments from upstream {cluster-capi-operator} are used to manage machines but are not exposed to the user.

|All machine sets are upgraded automatically when you update the cluster.
|You update your node pools independently from the hosted cluster updates.

|Only an in-place upgrade is supported in the cluster.
|Both replace and in-place upgrades are supported in the hosted cluster.

|The Machine Config Operator manages configurations for machines.
|The Machine Config Operator does not exist in {hcp}.

|You configure machine Ignition by using the `MachineConfig`, `KubeletConfig`, and `ContainerRuntimeConfig` resources that are selected from a `MachineConfigPool` selector.
|You configure the `MachineConfig`, `KubeletConfig`, and `ContainerRuntimeConfig` resources through the config map referenced in the `spec.config` field of the `NodePool` resource.

|The Machine Config Daemon (MCD) manages configuration changes and updates on each of the nodes.
|For an in-place upgrade, the node pool controller creates a run-once pod that updates a machine based on your configuration.

|You can modify the machine configuration resources such as the SR-IOV Operator.
|You cannot modify the machine configuration resources.

[id="netowrking_{context}"]
== Networking

[cols="2a,2a",options="header"]
|===

|{product-title} |{hcp-capital}

|The Kube API server communicates with nodes directly, because the Kube API server and nodes exist in the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
|The Kube API server communicates with nodes through Konnectivity. The Kube API server and nodes exist in a different Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

|Nodes communicate with the Kube API server through the internal load balancer.
|Nodes communicate with the Kube API server through an external load balancer or a node port.

|===

[id="web-console_{context}"]
== Web console

[cols="2a,2a",options="header"]
|===

|{product-title} |{hcp-capital}

|The web console shows the status of a control plane.
|The web console does not show the status of a control plane.

|You can update your cluster by using the web console.
|You cannot update the hosted cluster by using the web console.

|The web console displays the infrastructure resources such as machines.
|The web console does not display the infrastructure resources.

|You can configure machines through the `MachineConfig` resource by using the web console.
|You cannot configure machines by using the web console.
