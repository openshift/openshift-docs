[id="configuring-firewall_{context}"]
= Configuring your firewall for {product-title}

Before you install {product-title}, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the sites that {product-title} requires.

There are no special configuration considerations for services running on only controller nodes compared to worker nodes.

[NOTE]
====
If your environment has a dedicated load balancer in front of your {product-title} cluster, review the allowlists between your firewall and load balancer to prevent unwanted network restrictions to your cluster.

.Procedure

. Allowlist the following registry URLs:
+
[cols="3,2,4",options="header"]
|===
|URL | Port | Function

|`registry.redhat.io`
|443, 80
|Provides core container images

|`access.redhat.com`
|443, 80
|Provides core container images

|`quay.io`
|443, 80
|Provides core container images

|`cdn.quay.io`
|443, 80
|Provides core container images

|`cdn01.quay.io`
|443, 80
|Provides core container images

|`cdn02.quay.io`
|443, 80
|Provides core container images

|`cdn03.quay.io`
|443, 80
|Provides core container images

|`sso.redhat.com`
|443, 80
|The `https://console.redhat.com/openshift` site uses authentication from `sso.redhat.com`

|===
+
You can use the wildcards `\*.quay.io` and `*.openshiftapps.com` instead of `cdn0[1-3].quay.io` in your allowlist. When you add a site, such as `quay.io`, to your allowlist, do not add a wildcard entry, such as `*.quay.io`, to your denylist. In most cases, image registries use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve images. If a firewall blocks access, image downloads are denied when the initial download request redirects to a hostname such as `cdn01.quay.io`.

. Allowlist any site that provides resources for a language or framework that your builds require.

. If you do not disable Telemetry, you must grant access to the following URLs to access Red Hat Insights:

Operators require route access to perform health checks. Specifically, the
authentication and web console Operators connect to two routes to verify that
the routes work. If you are the cluster administrator and do not want to allow
`*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, then allow these routes:
+
* `oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`
* `console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, or the hostname
that is specified in the `spec.route.hostname` field of the
`consoles.operator/cluster` object if the field is not empty.
