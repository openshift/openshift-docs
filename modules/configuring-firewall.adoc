Operators require route access to perform health checks. Specifically, the
authentication and web console Operators connect to two routes to verify that
the routes work. If you are the cluster administrator and do not want to allow
`*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, then allow these routes:
+
* `oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`
* `console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, or the host name
that is specified in the `spec.route.hostname` field of the
`consoles.operator/cluster` object if the field is not empty.
