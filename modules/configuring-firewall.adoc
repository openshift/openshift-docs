= Configuring your firewall for {product-title}

Before you install {product-title}, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the sites that {product-title} requires.

There are no special configuration considerations for services running on only controller nodes compared to worker nodes.

[NOTE]
====
If your environment has a dedicated load balancer in front of your {product-title} cluster, review the allowlists between your firewall and load balancer to prevent unwanted network restrictions to your cluster.

.Procedure

. Allowlist the following registry URLs:
+
[cols="3,2,4",options="header"]
|===
|URL | Port | Function

|`registry.redhat.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`access.redhat.com` ^[1]^
|443
|Hosts all the container images that are stored on the Red Hat Ecosytem Catalog, including core container images.

|`quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`cdn.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`cdn01.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`cdn02.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`cdn03.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`sso.redhat.com`
|443
|The `https://console.redhat.com` site uses authentication from `sso.redhat.com`

1. In a firewall environment, ensure that the `access.redhat.com` resource is on the allowlist. This resource hosts a signature store that a container client requires for verifying images when pulling them from `registry.access.redhat.com`.
--
+
You can use the wildcards `\*.quay.io` and `*.openshiftapps.com` instead of `cdn0[1-3].quay.io` in your allowlist. When you add a site, such as `quay.io`, to your allowlist, do not add a wildcard entry, such as `*.quay.io`, to your denylist. In most cases, image registries use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve images. If a firewall blocks access, image downloads are denied when the initial download request redirects to a hostname such as `cdn01.quay.io`.

. Allowlist any site that provides resources for a language or framework that your builds require.

. If you do not disable Telemetry, you must grant access to the following URLs to access Red Hat Insights:

the routes work. If you are the cluster administrator and do not want to allow
`*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, then allow these routes:

that is specified in the `spec.route.hostname` field of the
`consoles.operator/cluster` object if the field is not empty.
