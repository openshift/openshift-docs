= Configuring your firewall for {product-title}

Before you install {product-title}, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the sites that {product-title} requires. When using a firewall, make additional configurations to the firewall so that {product-title} can access the sites that it requires to function.

ifndef::oci-agent[]
There are no special configuration considerations for services running on only controller nodes compared to worker nodes.
endif::oci-agent[]

ifdef::oci-agent[]
For a disconnected environment, you must mirror content from both Red{nbsp}Hat and Oracle. This environment requires that you create firewall rules to expose your firewall to specific ports and registries.
endif::oci-agent[]

[NOTE]
====
If your environment has a dedicated load balancer in front of your {product-title} cluster, review the allowlists between your firewall and load balancer to prevent unwanted network restrictions to your cluster.

.Procedure

. Set the following registry URLs for your firewall's allowlist:
+
[cols="3,2,4",options="header"]
|===
|URL | Port | Function

|`registry.redhat.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`access.redhat.com`
|443
|Hosts a signature store that a container client requires for verifying images pulled from `registry.access.redhat.com`. In a firewall environment, ensure that this resource is on the allowlist.

|`registry.access.redhat.com` 
|443
|Hosts all the container images that are stored on the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog, including core container images. 

|`quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`cdn.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`cdn01.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`cdn02.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`cdn03.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`cdn04.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`cdn05.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`cdn06.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images

|`sso.redhat.com`
|443
|The `https://console.redhat.com` site uses authentication from `sso.redhat.com`
|===
+
* You can use the wildcards `\*.quay.io` and `*.openshiftapps.com` instead of `cdn.quay.io` and `cdn0[1-6].quay.io` in your allowlist.
* You can use the wildcard `*.access.redhat.com` to simplify the configuration and ensure that all subdomains, including `registry.access.redhat.com`, are allowed.
* When you add a site, such as `quay.io`, to your allowlist, do not add a wildcard entry, such as `*.quay.io`, to your denylist. In most cases, image registries use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve images. If a firewall blocks access, image downloads are denied when the initial download request redirects to a hostname such as `cdn01.quay.io`.

. Set your firewall's allowlist to include any site that provides resources for a language or framework that your builds require.

. If you do not disable Telemetry, you must grant access to the following URLs to access Red Hat Insights:
+
[cols="3,2,4",options="header"]
|===
|URL | Port | Function

|443
|Required for Telemetry

|`api.access.redhat.com`
|443
|Required for Telemetry

|`infogw.api.openshift.com`

|===

ifdef::oci-agent[]
. Set your firewall's allowlist to include the following registry URLs:
+
[cols="3,2,4",options="header"]
|===
|URL | Port | Function

|`api.openshift.com`
|443
|Required both for your cluster token and to check if updates are available for the cluster.

|`rhcos.mirror.openshift.com`
|443
|Required to download {op-system-first} images.
|===

. Set your firewall's allowlist to include the following external URLs. Each repository URL hosts {oci} containers. Consider mirroring images to as few repositories as possible to reduce any performance issues.
+
[cols="3,2,4",options="header"]
|===
|URL | Port | Function

|`k8s.gcr.io`
|port
|A Kubernetes registry that hosts container images for a community-based image registry. This image registry is hosted on a custom Google Container Registry (GCR) domain.

|`ghcr.io`
|port
|A GitHub image registry where you can store and manage Open Container Initiative images. Requires an access token to publish, install, and delete private, internal, and public packages.

|`storage.googleapis.com`
|443
|A source of release image signatures, although the Cluster Version Operator needs only a single functioning source.

|`registry.k8s.io`
|port
|Replaces the `k8s.gcr.io` image registry because the `k8s.gcr.io` image registry does not support other platforms and vendors.
