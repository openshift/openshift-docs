= Generating the cosign key pair by using the TektonConfig CR

To use the `cosign` signing scheme for {tekton-chains} secrets, you can generate a `cosign` key pair that uses ECDSA encryption by setting the `generateSigningSecret` field in the `TektonConfig` custom resource (CR) to `true`.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {oc-first} utility.
* You are logged in to your {OCP} cluster with administrative rights for the `openshift-pipelines` namespace.

.Procedure

. Edit the `TektonConfig` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit TektonConfig config
----

. In the `TektonConfig` CR, set the `generateSigningSecret` value to `true`:

    generateSigningSecret: true # <1>
# ...
----
<1> The default value is `false`. Setting the value to `true` generates the `ecdsa` key pair.

. After a few minutes, extract the public key from the secret and store it, so that you can use it to verify artifact attestations. Run the following command to extract the key:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract -n openshift-pipelines secret/signing-secrets --keys=cosign.pub
----

.Result

The {pipelines-shortname} Operator generates an `ecdsa` type `cosign` key pair and stores it in the `signing-secrets` secret in the `openshift-pipelines` namespace. The secret includes the following files:

* `cosign.key`: The private key
* `cosign.password`: The password for decrypting the private key
* `cosign.pub` The public key

If a `signing-secrets` secret already exists, the Operator does not overwrite the secret.

The `cosign.pub` file in your current directory contains the public key that is extracted from the secret.

[WARNING]
====
If you set the `generateSigningSecret` field from `true` to `false`, the {pipelines-title} Operator overrides and empties any value in the `signing-secrets` secret.
====

The {pipelines-title} Operator does not provide the following security functions:

* Key rotation
* Auditing key usage
* Proper access control to the key
