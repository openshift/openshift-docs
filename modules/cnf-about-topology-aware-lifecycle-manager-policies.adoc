= About managed policies used with {cgu-operator-full}

The {cgu-operator-first} uses {rh-rhacm} policies for cluster updates.

{cgu-operator} can be used to manage the rollout of any policy CR where the `remediationAction` field is set to `inform`.
Supported use cases include the following:

* Manual user creation of policy CRs
* Automatically generated policies from the `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` custom resource definition (CRD)

For policies that update an Operator subscription with manual approval, {cgu-operator} provides additional functionality that approves the installation of the updated Operator.

For more information about managed policies, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/{rh-rhacm-version}/html-single/governance/index#policy-overview[Policy Overview] in the {rh-rhacm} documentation.
