= Granting access to a user group

This procedure explains how to grant access to a user group. If your cluster has more advanced identity management configured, including user groups, you can grant all users of a specific group access to the {ols-long} service. 

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. Alternatively, you are logged in as a user with the ability to grant permissions.

* You have deployed the {ols-long} service.

* You have access to the {ocp-short-name} CLI (oc).

.Procedure

. Run the following command at the command line:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group \
lightspeed-operator-query-access <group_name>
----
+
Alternatively, you can use a YAML file when granting access to a user group by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group lightspeed-operator-query-access <group_name> -o yaml --dry-run
----
+
The terminal returns the following output:
+
[source,yaml, subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: lightspeed-operator-query-access
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: lightspeed-operator-query-access
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: <user_group> <1>
----
<1> Enter the actual user group in place of `<user_group>` before creating the object.
+
Save the output as a YAML file, and run the following command to grant access to the user group:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <yaml_filename>
----
