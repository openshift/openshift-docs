= Viewing Elasticsearch status

You can view the status of your Elasticsearch cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

.Procedure

. Change to the `openshift-logging` project.
+
----
$ oc project openshift-logging
----

. To view the Elasticsearch cluster status:

.. Get the name of the Elasticsearch instance:
+
----
$ oc get Elasticsearch

NAME            AGE
elasticsearch   5h9m
----

.. Get the Elasticsearch status:
+
----
$ oc get Elasticsearch <Elasticsearch-instance> -o yaml
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc get Elasticsearch elasticsearch -n openshift-logging -o yaml
----
+
The output includes information similar to the following:
+

<1> In the output, the cluster status fields appear in the `status` stanza.
<2> The status of the Elasticsearch cluster: 
+
* The number of active primary shards.
* The number of active shards. 
* The number of shards that are initializing.
* The number of Elasticsearch data nodes.
* The total number of Elasticsearch nodes.
* The number of pending tasks.
* The Elasticsearch status: `green`, `red`, `yellow`.
* The number of unassigned shards.
<3> Any status conditions, if present. The Elasticsearch cluster status indicates the reasons from the scheduler if a pod could not be placed. Any events related to the following conditions are shown:
* Container Waiting for both the Elasticsearch and proxy containers.
* Container Terminated for both the Elasticsearch and proxy containers.
* Pod unschedulable.
Also, a condition is shown for a number of issues, see *Example condition messages*.
<4> The Elasticsearch nodes in the cluster, with `upgradeStatus`.  
<5> The Elasticsearch client, data, and master pods in the cluster, listed under 'failed`, `notReady` or `ready` state.

== Example condition messages

The following are examples of some condition messages from the `Status` section of the Elasticsearch instance.

// https://github.com/openshift/elasticsearch-operator/pull/92

This status message indicates a node has exceeded the configured low watermark and no shard will be allocated to this node.

----
status:
  nodes:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2019-03-15T15:57:22Z
      message: Disk storage usage for node is 27.5gb (36.74%). Shards will be not
        be allocated on this node.
      reason: Disk Watermark Low
      status: "True"
      type: NodeStorage
    deploymentName: example-elasticsearch-cdm-0-1
    upgradeStatus: {}
----

This status message indicates a node has exceeded the configured high watermark and shards will be relocated to other nodes.

----
status:
  nodes:
  - conditions:

      status: "True"
      type: NodeStorage
    deploymentName: example-elasticsearch-cdm-0-1
    upgradeStatus: {}
----

This status message indicates the Elasticsearch node selector in the CR does not match any nodes in the cluster:

----
status:
    nodes:
    - conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: 2019-04-10T02:26:24Z
        message: '0/8 nodes are available: 8 node(s) didn''t match node selector.'
        reason: Unschedulable
        status: "True"
        type: Unschedulable
----

This status message indicates that the Elasticsearch CR uses a non-existent PVC.

----
status:

       type:                  Unschedulable
----

This status message indicates that your Elasticsearch cluster does not have enough nodes to support your Elasticsearch redundancy policy.

----
status:
  clusterHealth: ""
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: 2019-04-17T20:01:31Z
    message: Wrong RedundancyPolicy selected. Choose different RedundancyPolicy or
      add more nodes with data roles
    reason: Invalid Settings
    status: "True"
    type: InvalidRedundancy
----

This status message indicates your cluster has too many master nodes:

----
status:
  clusterHealth: green
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: '2019-04-17T20:12:34Z'
      message: >-
