= About logging curation

In {product-title} {product-version}, log curation is performed by Elasticsearch based on a xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-log-store.html#cluster-logging-elasticsearch-retention_cluster-logging-store[retention policy] that you define. The Elasticsearch Curator tool removes Elasticsearch indices that use the data model prior to {product-title} 4.5.
