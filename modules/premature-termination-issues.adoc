= Premature termination issues

Extending a timeout allows complex or resource-intensive processes to complete successfully without premature termination. This configuration can reduce the likelihood of errors, retries, or failures.

NOTE: Ensure that you balance timeout extensions in a logical manner so that you do not configure excessively long timeouts that might hide underlying issues in the process. Carefully consider and monitor an appropriate timeout value that meets the needs of the process and the overall system performance.

The following are various OADP timeouts, with instructions of how and when to implement these parameters:
