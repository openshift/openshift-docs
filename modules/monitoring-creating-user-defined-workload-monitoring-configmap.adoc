= Creating a user-defined workload monitoring ConfigMap

To configure the components that monitor user-defined projects, you must create the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.

[NOTE]
====
When you save your changes to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap, some or all of the pods in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project might be redeployed. It can sometimes take a while for these components to redeploy. You can create and configure the ConfigMap before you first enable monitoring for user-defined projects, to prevent having to redeploy the pods often.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Check whether the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object exists:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

. If the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap does not exist:
.. Create the following YAML manifest. In this example the file is called `user-workload-monitoring-config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
----
+
.. Apply the configuration to create the ConfigMap:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f user-workload-monitoring-config.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Configurations applied to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap are not activated unless a cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
