= NVIDIA GPU architecture

NVIDIA supports the use of graphics processing unit (GPU) resources on {product-title}. {product-title} is a security-focused and hardened Kubernetes platform developed and supported by Red Hat for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters at scale. {product-title} includes enhancements to Kubernetes so that users can easily configure and use NVIDIA GPU resources to accelerate workloads.

The NVIDIA GPU Operator leverages the Operator framework within {product-title} to manage the full lifecycle of NVIDIA software components required to run GPU-accelerated workloads.

These components include the NVIDIA drivers (to enable CUDA), the Kubernetes device plugin for GPUs, the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, automatic node tagging using GPU feature discovery (GFD), DCGM-based monitoring, and others.

[NOTE]
====
The NVIDIA GPU Operator is only supported by NVIDIA. For more information about obtaining support from NVIDIA, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5174941[Obtaining Support from NVIDIA].
