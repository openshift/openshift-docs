= Expanding local volumes

You can manually expand persistent volumes (PVs) and persistent volume claims (PVCs) created by using the local storage operator (LSO).

.Procedure

. Expand the underlying devices, and ensure that appropriate capacity is available on theses devices.

. Update the corresponding PV objects to match the new device sizes by editing the `.spec.capacity` field of the PV.

. For the storage class that is used for binding the PVC to PVet, set `allowVolumeExpansion:true`.

. For the PVC, set `.spec.resources.requests.storage` to match the new size.

Kubelet should automatically expand the underlying file system on the volume, if necessary, and update the status field of the PVC to reflect the new size.
