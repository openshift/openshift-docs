= Scaling a MachineSet manually

If you must add or remove an instance of a machine in a MachineSet, you can manually scale the MachineSet.

.Prerequisites

* Install an {product-title} cluster and the `oc` command line.
* Log in to  `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. View the MachineSets that are in the cluster:
+
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
The MachineSets are listed in the form of `<clusterid>-worker-<aws-region-az>`.

. Scale the MachineSet:
+
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
Or:
+
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
You can scale the MachineSet up or down. It takes several minutes for the new
machines to be available.

= The MachineSet delete policy

`Random`, `Newest`, and `Oldest` are the three supported options. The default is `Random`, meaning  that random machines are chosen and deleted when scaling MachineSets down. The delete policy can be set according to the use case by modifying the particular MachineSet:

----

spec:
  deletePolicy: <delete policy>
  replicas: <desired replica count>

----

Specific machines can also be priortized for deletion by adding the annotation `machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-delete-machine` to the machine of interest, regardless of the delete policy.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, the {product-title} router pods are deployed on workers. Because the router is required to access some cluster resources, including the web console, do not scale the worker MachineSet to `0` unless you first relocate the router pods.
====

[NOTE]
====
Custom MachineSets can be used for use cases requiring that services run on specific nodes and that those services are ignored by the controller when the worker MachineSets are scaling down. This prevents service disruption.
