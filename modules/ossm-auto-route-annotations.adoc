= {SMProductName} route labels and annotations

Sometimes specific labels or annotations are needed in an OpenShift Route.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
For example, some advanced features in OpenShift Routes are managed using special annotations. See "Route-specific annotations" in the following "Additional resources" section.
endif::[]

For this and other use cases, {SMProductName} will copy all labels and annotations present in the Istio Gateway resource (with the exception of annotations starting with `kubectl.kubernetes.io`) into the managed OpenShift Route resource.

If you need specific labels or annotations in the OpenShift Routes created by {SMProductShortName}, create them in the Istio Gateway resource and they will be copied into the OpenShift Route resources managed by the {SMProductShortName}.
