= Deploying functions

You can deploy a function to your cluster as a Knative service by using the `kn func deploy` command.

If the targeted function is already deployed, it is updated with a new container image that is pushed to a container image registry, and the Knative service is updated.

.Prerequisites

* You must have already initialized the function that you want to deploy.

.Procedure

* Deploy a function:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn func deploy [-n <namespace> -p <path> -i <image> -r <registry>]
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Function deployed at: http://func.example.com
----
** If no `namespace` is specified, the function is deployed in the current namespace.
** The function is deployed from the current directory, unless a `path` is specified.
** The Knative service name is derived from the project name, and cannot be changed using this command.
