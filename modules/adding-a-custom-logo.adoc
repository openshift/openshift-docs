= Adding a custom logo and product name

You can create custom branding by adding a custom logo or custom product name.
You can set both or one without the other, as these settings are independent of
each other.

.Prerequisites

* You must have administrator privileges.
* Create a file of the logo that you want to use. The logo can be a file in any
common image format, including GIF, JPG, PNG, or SVG, and is constrained to a
`max-height` of `60px`.

.Procedure

. Import your logo file into a ConfigMap in the `openshift-config` namespace:
+
----
$ oc create configmap console-custom-logo --from-file /path/to/console-custom-logo.png -n openshift-config
----

. Edit the web console's Operator configuration to include `customLogoFile` and `customProductName`:
+
----
$ oc edit console.operator.openshift.io cluster
----
+
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  customization:
    customLogoFile:
      key: console-custom-logo.png
      name: console-custom-logo
    customProductName: My Console
----
+
Once the Operator configuration is updated, it will sync the custom logo
ConfigMap into the console namespace, mount it to the console pod, and redeploy.

. Check for success. If there are any issues, the console cluster operator will
report `Degraded`, and the console Operator configuration will also report
`CustomLogoDegraded`, but with reasons like `KeyOrFilenameInvalid` or
`NoImageProvided`.
+
To check the `clusteroperator`, run:
+
----
$ oc get clusteroperator console -o yaml
----
+
To check the console Operator configuration, run:
+
----
$ oc get console.operator.openshift.io -o yaml
