= AWS account limits


The {product-title} cluster uses a number of Amazon Web Services (AWS) components, and the default link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html[service limits] affect your ability to install {product-title} clusters. If you use certain cluster configurations, deploy your cluster in certain AWS regions, or run multiple clusters from your account, you might need to request additional resources for your AWS account.

The following table summarizes the AWS components whose limits can impact your ability to install and run {product-title} clusters.


[cols="3a,3a,3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Component |Number of clusters available by default| Default AWS limit |Description

|Instance Limits
|Varies
|Varies
|By default, each cluster creates the following instances:

* One bootstrap machine, which is removed after installation
* Three master nodes
* Three worker nodes

These instance type counts are within a new account's default limit. To deploy more worker nodes, enable autoscaling, deploy large workloads, or use a different instance type, review your account limits to ensure that your cluster can deploy the machines that you need.

In most regions, the bootstrap and worker machines uses an `m4.large` machines and the master machines use `m4.xlarge` instances. In some regions, including all regions that do not support these instance types, `m5.large` and `m5.xlarge` instances are used instead.

|Elastic IPs (EIPs)
|0 to 1
|5 EIPs per account
|To provision the cluster in a highly available configuration, the installation program creates a public and private subnet for each link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html[availability zone within a region]. Each private subnet requires a link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT Gateway], and each NAT gateway requires a separate
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ipaddresses-eip.html[elastic IP]. Review the link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[AWS region map] to determine how many availability zones are in each region. To take advantage of the default high availability, install the cluster in a region with at least three availability zones. To install a cluster in a region with more than five availability zones, you must increase the EIP limit.

// TODO: The above elastic IP link is redirected. Find new link. Is it https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html ?

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use the `us-east-1` region, you must increase the EIP limit for your account.

|Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)
|5
|5 VPCs per region
|Each cluster creates its own VPC.

|Elastic Load Balancing (ELB/NLB)
|3
|20 per region
|By default, each cluster creates internal and external network load balancers for the master API server and a single classic elastic load balancer for the router. Deploying more Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service objects will create additional link:https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/[load balancers].


|NAT Gateways
|5
|5 per availability zone
|The cluster deploys one NAT gateway in each availability zone.

|Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)
|At least 12
|350 per region
|The default installation creates 21 ENIs and an ENI for each availability zone in your region. For example, the `us-east-1` region contains six availability zones, so a cluster that is deployed in that zone uses 27 ENIs. Review the link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[AWS region map] to determine how many availability zones are in each region.

Additional ENIs are created for additional machines and elastic load balancers that are created by cluster usage and deployed workloads.

|VPC Gateway
|20
|20 per account
|Each cluster creates a single VPC Gateway for S3 access.


|S3 buckets
|99
|100 buckets per account
|Because the installation process creates a temporary bucket and the registry component in each cluster creates a bucket, you can create only 99 {product-title} clusters per AWS account.

|Security Groups
|250
|2,500 per account
|Each cluster creates 10 distinct security groups.
                                                                                                                                        | Fail, optionally surfacing response body to the user
