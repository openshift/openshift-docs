= Upgrading to {SMProductName} 2.2

To upgrade {SMProductName}, you must update the version field of the {SMProductName} `ServiceMeshControlPlane` v2 resource. Then, once it's configured and applied, restart the application pods to update each sidecar proxy and its configuration.

.Prerequisites

* You are running {product-title} 4.9 or later.
* You have the {SMProductName} version 2.2.x operator.
* You cannot upgrade your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` from 1.1 to 2.2 directly.  Because of possibly breaking changes at each stage, you must migrate from 1.1 to 2.0, then upgrade from 2.0 to 2.1, then upgrade 2.1 to 2.2.

.Procedure

. Switch to the project that contains your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the control plane project.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project istio-system
----

. Check your v2 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource configuration to make sure it is valid.
+
.. Run the following command to view your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource as a v2 resource.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get smcp -o yaml
----
+
[TIP]
====
Back up your control plane configuration.
====

. Update the `.spec.version` field from v2.1 to v2.2, and apply the configuration.
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  version: v2.2
----
+
Alternatively, instead of using the command line, you can use the web console to edit the control plane. In the {product-title} web console, click *Project* and select the project name you just entered.
+
.. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
.. Find your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` instance.
.. Select *YAML view* and update text of the YAML file, as shown in the previous example.
.. Click *Save*.
