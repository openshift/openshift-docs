= Configuring descriptions for the output

Each part, component, or template can include descriptions to provide additional context, instructions, or documentation links. These descriptions are helpful to convey why a specific template or structure is required.

.Procedure

* Create a `metadata.yaml` file to match your use case. Use the following structure as an example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v2
parts:
  - name: Part1
    description: |-
      General text for every template under this part, unless overridden.
    components:
      - name: Component1
        # With no description set, this inherits the description from the part above.
        OneOf:
          - path: Template1.yaml
            # This inherits the component description, if set.
          - path: Template2.yaml
          - path: Template3.yaml
            description: |-
              This template has special instructions that don't apply to the others.
      - name: Component2
        description: |-
          This overrides the part text with something more specific.
          Multi-line text is supported, at all levels.
        allOf:
          - path: RequiredTemplate1.yaml
          - path: RequiredTemplate2.yaml
            description: |-
              Required for important reasons.
          - path: RequiredTemplate3.yaml
