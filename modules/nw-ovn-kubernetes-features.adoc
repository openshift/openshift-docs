= OVN-Kubernetes purpose

The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin is an open-source, fully-featured Kubernetes CNI plugin that uses Open Virtual Network (OVN) to manage network traffic flows. OVN is a community developed, vendor-agnostic network virtualization solution. The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin uses the following technologies:

* OVN to manage network traffic flows.
* Kubernetes network policy support and logs, including ingress and egress rules.
* The Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve) protocol, rather than Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN), to create an overlay network between nodes.

The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin supports the following capabilities:

* Hybrid clusters that can run both Linux and Microsoft Windows workloads. This environment is known as _hybrid networking_.
* Offloading of network data processing from the host central processing unit (CPU) to compatible network cards and data processing units (DPUs). This is known as _hardware offloading_.
* IPv4-primary dual-stack networking on bare-metal, {vmw-full}, {ibm-power-name}, {ibm-z-name}, and {rh-openstack-first} platforms.
* IPv6 single-stack networking on {rh-openstack} and bare metal platforms.
* IPv6-primary dual-stack networking for a cluster running on a bare-metal, a {vmw-full}, or an {rh-openstack} platform.
* Egress firewall devices and egress IP addresses.
* Egress router devices that operate in redirect mode.
* IPsec encryption of intracluster communications.

Red{nbsp}Hat does not support the following postinstallation configurations that use the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin:

* Configuring the primary network interface, including using the NMState Operator to configure bonding for the interface.
* Configuring a sub-interface or additional network interface on a network device that uses the Open vSwitch (OVS) or an OVN-Kubernetes `br-ex` bridge network.
* Creating additional virtual local area networks (VLANs) on the primary network interface.
* Using the primary network interface, such as `eth0` or `bond0`, that you created for a node during cluster installation to create additional secondary networks.

Red{nbsp}Hat does support the following postinstallation configurations that use the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin:

* Creating additional VLANs from the base physical interface, such as `eth0.100`, where you configured the primary network interface as a VLAN for a node during cluster installation. This works because the Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge attaches to the initial VLAN sub-interface, such as `eth0.100`, leaving the base physical interface available for new configurations.
* Creating an additional OVN secondary network with a `localnet` topology network requires that you define the secondary network in a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) object. After you create the network, pods or virtual machines (VMs) can then attach to the network. These secondary networks give a dedicated connection to the physical network, which might or might not use VLAN tagging. You cannot access these networks from the host network of a node where the host does not have the required setup, such as the required network settings.
* Defining additional VLANs in the `vlanID` parameter of the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) custom resource (CR). By mapping the `br-ex` bridge to a physical interface, the interface acts as a trunk port that can carry multiple VLANs. OVN-Kubernetes can then manage tagging and untagging of network packets, also known as _Ethernet frames_. To ensure strong connectivity, configure the physical switch ports as trunks and configure the ``bridgeMappings` ` parameter in the coniguration for the Cluster Network Operator configures to correctly associate the physical network with the `br-ex` interface.
