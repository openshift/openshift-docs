= OVN-Kubernetes purpose

The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin is an open-source, fully-featured Kubernetes CNI plugin that uses Open Virtual Network (OVN) to manage network traffic flows. OVN is a community developed, vendor-agnostic network virtualization solution. The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin uses the following technologies:

* OVN to manage network traffic flows.
* Kubernetes network policy support and logs, including ingress and egress rules.
* The Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve) protocol, rather than Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN), to create an overlay network between nodes.

The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin supports the following capabilities:

* Hybrid clusters that can run both Linux and Microsoft Windows workloads. This environment is known as _hybrid networking_.
* Offloading of network data processing from the host central processing unit (CPU) to compatible network cards and data processing units (DPUs). This is known as _hardware offloading_.
* IPv4-primary dual-stack networking on bare-metal, {vmw-full}, {ibm-power-name}, {ibm-z-name}, and {rh-openstack} platforms.
* IPv6 single-stack networking on a bare-metal platform.
* IPv6-primary dual-stack networking for a cluster running on a bare-metal, a {vmw-full}, or an {rh-openstack} platform.
* Egress firewall devices and egress IP addresses.
* Egress router devices that operate in redirect mode.
* IPsec encryption of intracluster communications.
