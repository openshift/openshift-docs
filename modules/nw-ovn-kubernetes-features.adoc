The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin is an open-source, fully-featured Kubernetes CNI plugin that uses Open Virtual Network (OVN) to manage network traffic flows. OVN is a community developed, vendor-agnostic network virtualization solution. The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin:

// OVN (Open Virtual Network) is consistent with upstream usage.

* Uses OVN (Open Virtual Network) to manage network traffic flows. OVN is a community developed, vendor-agnostic network virtualization solution.
* Implements Kubernetes network policy support, including ingress and egress rules.
* Uses the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) protocol rather than VXLAN to create an overlay network between nodes.

The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin provides the following advantages over OpenShift SDN.

* Full support for IPv6 single-stack and IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking on supported platforms
* Support for hybrid clusters with both Linux and Microsoft Windows workloads
* Optional IPsec encryption of intra-cluster communications
* Offload of network data processing from host CPU to compatible network cards and data processing units (DPUs)
