= Customizing and automating your compliance scans

By creating a compliance scan schedule, you can customize and automate your compliance scans to align with your operational requirements.

[NOTE]
====
You can only have one schedule that scans the same profile on the same cluster. This means that you cannot create multiple scan schedules for the same profile on a single cluster.
====


.Prerequisites

* You have installed the Compliance Operator.
+
For more information about how to install the Compliance Operator, see "Using the Compliance Operator with {product-title}".

[NOTE]
====
** Currently, the compliance feature and the Compliance Operator evaluate only infrastructure and platform compliance.

** The compliance feature requires the Compliance Operator to be running and does _not_ support Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
