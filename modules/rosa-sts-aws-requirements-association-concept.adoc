= Requirements for using {cluster-manager}

[role="_abstract"]
The following configuration details are required only if you use {cluster-manager-url} to manage your clusters. If you use the CLI tools exclusively, then you can disregard these requirements.

[id="rosa-associating-concept_{context}"]
== AWS account association

When you provision {product-title} using {cluster-manager} (`console.redhat.com`), you must associate the `ocm-role` and `user-role` IAM roles with your AWS account using your Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This association process is also known as _account linking_.

The `ocm-role` ARN is stored as a label in your Red{nbsp}Hat organization while the `user-role` ARN is stored as a label inside your Red{nbsp}Hat user account. Red{nbsp}Hat uses these ARN labels to confirm that the user is a valid account holder and that the correct permissions are available to perform provisioning tasks in the AWS account.
