= AWS account association

When you provision {product-title} (ROSA) using {cluster-manager}, you must associate the `ocm-role` and `user-role` IAM roles with your AWS account using your Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This association process is also known as _account linking_.

The `ocm-role` ARN is stored as a label in your Red{nbsp}Hat organization while the `user-role` ARN is stored as a label inside your Red{nbsp}Hat user account. Red{nbsp}Hat uses these ARN labels to confirm that the user is a valid account holder and that the correct permissions are available to perform provisioning tasks in the AWS account.
