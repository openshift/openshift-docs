= Mirroring a Package Manifest Format catalog image

Cluster administrators can mirror a custom Operator catalog image based on the
Package Manifest Format into a registry and use a CatalogSource to load the
content onto their cluster. For this example, the procedure uses a custom
`redhat-operators` catalog image previously built and pushed to a supported
registry.

.Prerequisites

* Workstation with unrestricted network access
* A custom Operator catalog image based on the Package Manifest Format pushed to a supported registry
* `oc` version 4.3.5+
* `podman` version 1.4.4+
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]
* If you are working with private registries, set the `REG_CREDS` environment
variable to the file path of your registry credentials for use in later steps.
For example, for the `podman` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REG_CREDS=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json
----

.Procedure

. The `oc adm catalog mirror` command extracts the contents of your custom
Operator catalog image to generate the manifests required for mirroring. You can
choose to either:
+
--
* Allow the default behavior of the command to automatically mirror all of the
image content to your mirror registry after generating manifests, or
* Add the `--manifests-only` flag to only generate the manifests required for
mirroring, but do not actually mirror the image content to a registry yet. This
can be useful for reviewing what will be mirrored, and it allows you to make any
changes to the mapping list if you only require a subset of the content. You can
then use that file with the `oc image mirror` command to mirror the modified
list of images in a later step.
--
+
On your workstation with unrestricted network access, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror \
    <registry_host_name>:<port>/olm/redhat-operators:v1 \//<1>
    <registry_host_name>:<port> \
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \//<2>
    [--insecure] \//<3>
    [--filter-by-os="<os>/<arch>"] \//<4>
    [--manifests-only] <5>
----
<1> Specify your Operator catalog image.
<2> Optional: If required, specify the location of your registry credentials
file.
<3> Optional: If you do not want to configure trust for the target registry, add
the `--insecure` flag.
<4> Optional: Because the catalog might reference images that support multiple
architectures and operating systems, you can filter by architecture and
operating system to mirror only the images that match. Valid values are
`linux/amd64`, `linux/ppc64le`, and `linux/s390x`.
<5> Optional: Only generate the manifests required for mirroring and do not actually
mirror the image content to a registry.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
using database path mapping: /:/tmp/190214037
wrote database to /tmp/190214037
using database at: /tmp/190214037/bundles.db <1>
...
----
<1> Temporary database generated by the command.
+
After running the command, a `<image_name>-manifests/` directory is created in
the current directory and generates the following files:
+
--
* The `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file defines an ImageContentSourcePolicy
object that can configure nodes to translate between the image references stored
in Operator manifests and the mirrored registry.
* The `mapping.txt` file contains all of the source images and where to map them
in the target registry. This file is compatible with the `oc image mirror`
command and can be used to further customize the mirroring configuration.
--

. If you used the `--manifests-only` flag in the previous step and want to mirror
only a subset of the content:

.. Modify the list of images in your `mapping.txt` file to your specifications. If
you are unsure of the exact names and versions of the subset of images you want
to mirror, use the following steps to find them:

... Run the `sqlite3` tool against the temporary database that was generated by the
`oc adm catalog mirror` command to retrieve a list of images matching a general
search query. The output helps inform how you will later edit your `mapping.txt`
file.
+
For example, to retrieve a list of images that are similar to the string
`clusterlogging.4.3`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo "select * from related_image \
    where operatorbundle_name like 'clusterlogging.4.3%';" \
    | sqlite3 -line /tmp/190214037/bundles.db <1>
----
<1> Refer to the previous output of the `oc adm catalog mirror` command to find the
path of the database file.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
image = registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-logging-kibana5@sha256:aa4a8b2a00836d0e28aa6497ad90a3c116f135f382d8211e3c55f34fb36dfe61
operatorbundle_name = clusterlogging.4.3.33-202008111029.p0

image = registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-oauth-proxy@sha256:6b4db07f6e6c962fc96473d86c44532c93b146bbefe311d0c348117bf759c506
operatorbundle_name = clusterlogging.4.3.33-202008111029.p0
...
----

... Use the results from the previous step to edit the `mapping.txt` file to only
include the subset of images you want to mirror.
+
For example, you can use the `image` values from the previous example output to
find that the following matching lines exist in your `mapping.txt` file:
+
.Matching image mappings in `mapping.txt`
[source,txt]
----
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-logging-kibana5@sha256:aa4a8b2a00836d0e28aa6497ad90a3c116f135f382d8211e3c55f34fb36dfe61=<registry_host_name>:<port>/openshift4-ose-logging-kibana5:a767c8f0
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-oauth-proxy@sha256:6b4db07f6e6c962fc96473d86c44532c93b146bbefe311d0c348117bf759c506=<registry_host_name>:<port>/openshift4-ose-oauth-proxy:3754ea2b
----
+
In this example, if you only want to mirror these images, you would then remove
all other entries in the `mapping.txt` file and leave only the above two lines.

.. Still on your workstation with unrestricted network access, use your modified
`mapping.txt` file to mirror the images to your registry using the `oc image
mirror` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror \
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \
    -f ./redhat-operators-manifests/mapping.txt
----

. Apply the ImageContentSourcePolicy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ./redhat-operators-manifests/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----

You can now create a CatalogSource to reference your mirrored content.
