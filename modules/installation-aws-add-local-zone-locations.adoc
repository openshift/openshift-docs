= Opting into AWS Local Zones

If you plan to create the subnets in AWS Local Zones, you must opt in to each zone group separately.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the AWS CLI.
* You have determined into which region you will deploy your {product-title} cluster.
* You attached a permissive IAM policy to a user or role account whom wants to opt in to the zone group. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:ModifyAvailabilityZoneGroup"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
----

.Procedure

. List the zones that are available in your region by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws --region "<value_of_AWS_Region>" ec2 describe-availability-zones \
    --query 'AvailabilityZones[].{ZoneName: ZoneName, GroupName: GroupName, Status: OptInStatus}' \
    --filters Name=zone-type,Values=local-zone \
    --all-availability-zones
----
+
Depending on the region, the list of available zones can be long. The command will return the following fields:
+
`ZoneName`:: The name of the Local Zone.
`GroupName`:: The group that the zone is part of. You need to save this name to opt in.
`Status`:: The status of the Local Zone group. If the status is `not-opted-in`, you must opt in the `GroupName` by running the commands that follow.

. Opt in to the zone group on your AWS account by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws ec2 modify-availability-zone-group \
    --group-name "<value_of_GroupName>" \
    --opt-in-status opted-in
----

where:

<value_of_GroupName>:: Specifies the name of the group of the Local Zone you want to create subnets on. For example, specify `us-east-1-nyc-1` to use the zone `us-east-1-nyc-1a`, US East (New York).
