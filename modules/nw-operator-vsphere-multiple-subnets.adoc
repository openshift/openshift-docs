= Specifying multiple subnets for your network

Before you install an {product-title} cluster on a {vmw-short} host, you can specify multiple subnets for a networking implementation so that the {vmw-short} cloud controller manager (CCM) can select the appropriate subnet for a given networking situation. {vmw-short} can use the subnet for managing pods and services on your cluster.

For this configuration, you must specify internal and external Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) implementations in the {vmw-short} CCM configuration. Each CIDR implementation lists an IP address range that the CCM uses to decide what subnets interact with traffic from internal and external networks.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Failure to configure internal and external CIDR implementations in the {vmw-short} CCM configuration can cause the {vmw-short} CCM to select the wrong subnet. This situation causes the following error:

----
ERROR Bootstrap failed to complete: timed out waiting for the condition
ERROR Failed to wait for bootstrapping to complete. This error usually happens when there is a problem with control plane hosts that prevents the control plane operators from creating the control plane.
----

This configuration can cause new nodes that associate with a `MachineSet` object with a single subnet to become unusable as each new node receives the `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized` taint. These situations can cause communication issues with the Kubernetes API server that can cause installation of the cluster to fail.
====

.Prerequisites

* You created Kubernetes manifest files for your {product-title} cluster.

.Procedure

. From the directory where you store your {product-title} cluster manifest files, open the `manifests/cluster-infrastructure-02-config.yml` manifest file.

. Add a `nodeNetworking` object to the file and specify internal and external network subnet CIDR implementations for the object.
+
[TIP]
====
For most networking situations, consider setting the standard multiple-subnet configuration. This configuration requires that you set the same IP address ranges in the `nodeNetworking.internal.networkSubnetCidr` and `nodeNetworking.external.networkSubnetCidr` parameters.
