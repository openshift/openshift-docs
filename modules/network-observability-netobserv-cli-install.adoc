= Installing the Network Observability CLI

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability CLI gives you a lightweight way to quickly debug and troubleshoot network observability. It must be installed separately.

Installing the Network Observability CLI (`oc netobserv`) is a separate procedure from the Network Observability Operator installation. This means that, even if the Operator is installed from the software catalog, the `CLI` must be installed separately.

[NOTE]
====
Users can optionally use Krew to install the `netobserv` CLI plugin. For more information, see "Installing a CLI plugin with Krew".
====

.Prerequisites
* You must install the {oc-first}.
* You must have a macOS or Linux operating system.
* You must install either `docker` or `podman`.

[NOTE]
====
You can use `podman` or `docker` to run the installation commands. This procedure uses `podman`.

.Procedure

. Log in to the *Red Hat registry* by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----

. Extract the `oc-netobserv` file from the image by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman create --name netobserv-cli registry.redhat.io/network-observability/network-observability-cli-rhel9:1.10
$ podman cp netobserv-cli:/oc-netobserv .
$ podman rm netobserv-cli
----

. Move the extracted file to a directory that is on the system's `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin/`, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mv oc-netobserv /usr/local/bin/
----

.Verification

. Verify that `oc netobserv` is available:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc netobserv version
----
+
This command should produce an outcome similar to the following example:
[source,terminal]
----
Netobserv CLI version <version>
----
