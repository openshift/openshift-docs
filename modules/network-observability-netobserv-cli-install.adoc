= Installing the netobserv CLI
Installing the Network Observablity CLI (`netobserv`) is a separate procedure from the Operator installation. This means that, even if you have the Network Observability Operator installed from the Operator Hub, you need to install the CLI separately. 

[NOTE]
====
You can optionally use Krew to install the `netobserv` CLI plugin. See the additional resources of this section for more information.
