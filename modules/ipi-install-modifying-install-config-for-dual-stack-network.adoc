= Modifying the `install-config.yaml` file for dual-stack network (optional)

To deploy an {product-title} cluster with dual-stack networking, make the following changes to the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
machineNetwork:
- cidr: {{ extcidrnet }}
- cidr: {{ extcidrnet6 }}
clusterNetwork:
- cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
  hostPrefix: 23
- cidr: fd02::/48
  hostPrefix: 64
serviceNetwork:
- 172.30.0.0/16
- fd03::/112
----

NOTE: In the above snippet, the network settings must match the settings for the cluster's network environment. The `machineNetwork`, `clusterNetwork`, and `serviceNetwork` configuration settings must have two CIDR entries each. The first CIDR entry is the IPv4 setting and the second CIDR entry is the IPv6 setting.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The IPv4 entries must go *before* the IPv6 entries.

ifeval::[{product-version} < 4.8]
To deploy an {product-title} cluster with dual-stack, create an additional manifest to enable the `FeatureGate` with the following contents:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  featureSet: IPv6DualStackNoUpgrade
