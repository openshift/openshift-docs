The following flags are available for the _mirror registry for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift_:

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| Flags | Description
| `--autoApprove` | A boolean value that disables interactive prompts. If set to `true`, the `quayRoot` directory is automatically deleted when uninstalling the mirror registry. Defaults to `false` if left unspecified.
| `--initPassword` | The password of the init user created during Quay installation. Must be at least eight characters and contain no whitespace.
|`--initUser string` | Shows the username of the initial user. Defaults to `init` if left unspecified.
| `--no-color`, `-c` | Allows users to disable color sequences and propagate that to Ansible when running install, uninstall, and upgrade commands.
| `--quayHostname` | The fully-qualified domain name of the mirror registry that clients will use to contact the registry. Equivalent to `SERVER_HOSTNAME` in the Quay `config.yaml`. Must resolve by DNS. Defaults to `<targetHostname>:8443` if left unspecified. ^[1]^
| `--quayStorage` | The folder where Quay persistent storage data is saved. Defaults to the `quay-storage` Podman volume. Root privileges are required to uninstall.  
| `--quayRoot`, `-r` | The directory where container image layer and configuration data is saved, including `rootCA.key`, `rootCA.pem`, and `rootCA.srl` certificates. Defaults to `$HOME/quay-install` if left unspecified.
| `--sqliteStorage` | The folder where SQLite database data is saved. Defaults to `sqlite-storage` Podman volume if not specified. Root is required to uninstall.
| `--ssh-key`, `-k` | The path of your SSH identity key. Defaults to `~/.ssh/quay_installer` if left unspecified.
| `--sslCert` | The path to the SSL/TLS public key / certificate. Defaults to `{quayRoot}/quay-config` and is auto-generated if left unspecified.
| `--sslCheckSkip` | Skips the check for the certificate hostname against the `SERVER_HOSTNAME` in the `config.yaml` file. ^[2]^
| `--sslKey` | The path to the SSL/TLS private key used for HTTPS communication. Defaults to `{quayRoot}/quay-config` and is auto-generated if left unspecified.
| `--targetHostname`, `-H` | The hostname of the target you want to install Quay to. Defaults to `$HOST`, for example, a local host, if left unspecified.
| `--targetUsername`, `-u` | The user on the target host which will be used for SSH. Defaults to `$USER`, for example, the current user if left unspecified.
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Shows debug logs and Ansible Playbook outputs.
| `--version` | Shows the version for the _mirror registry for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift_.

[.small]
1. `--quayHostname` must be modified if the public DNS name of your system is different from the local hostname. Additionally, the `--quayHostname` flag does not support installation with an IP address. Installation with a hostname is required. 
2. `--sslCheckSkip` is used in cases when the mirror registry is set behind a proxy and the exposed hostname is different from the internal Quay hostname. It can also be used when users do not want the certificates to be validated against the provided Quay hostname during installation.
