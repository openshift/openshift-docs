= Understanding update channels of the {cert-manager-operator}

Update channels are the mechanism by which you can declare the version of your {cert-manager-operator} in your cluster. The {cert-manager-operator} offers the following update channels:

* `stable-v1`
* `stable-v1.y`

[id="stable-v1-channel_{context}"]
== stable-v1 channel

The `stable-v1` channel is the default and suggested channel while installing the {cert-manager-operator}. The `stable-v1` channel installs and updates the latest release version of the {cert-manager-operator}. Select the `stable-v1` channel if you want to use the latest stable release of the {cert-manager-operator}.

The `stable-v1` channel offers the following update approval strategies:

Automatic:: If you choose automatic updates for an installed {cert-manager-operator}, a new version of the {cert-manager-operator} is available in the `stable-v1` channel. The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention.

Manual:: If you select manual updates, when a newer version of the {cert-manager-operator} is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the {cert-manager-operator} updated to the new version.

[id="stable-v1-y-channel_{context}"]
== stable-v1.y channel

The y-stream version of the {cert-manager-operator} installs updates from the `stable-v1.y` channels such as `stable-v1.10`, `stable-v1.11`, and `stable-v1.12`. Select the `stable-v1.y` channel if you want to use the y-stream version and stay updated to the z-stream version of the {cert-manager-operator}.

The `stable-v1.y` channel offers the following update approval strategies:

Automatic:: If you choose automatic updates for an installed {cert-manager-operator}, a new z-stream version of the {cert-manager-operator} is available in the `stable-v1.y` channel. OLM automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention.

Manual:: If you select manual updates, when a newer version of the {cert-manager-operator} is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the {cert-manager-operator} updated to the new version of the z-stream releases.
