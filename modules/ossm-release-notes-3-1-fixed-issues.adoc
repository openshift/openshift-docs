== Kiali fixed issue

* Before this update, the {KialiProduct} used the `k8s_cluster_info` Ansible module from the `kubernetes.core` collection, which caused failures in certain environments during the `Get API version information from the cluster` task. As a result, Kiali deployment failure occurred, affecting service visibility and management. With this update, the {KialiProduct} avoids the `k8s_cluster_info` module, resolving the issue and ensuring smooth Kiali installation for users.
