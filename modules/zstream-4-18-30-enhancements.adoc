* The KubeVirt Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver now supports volume expansion. This means that users can now dynamically increase the size of their persistent volumes in their tenant cluster. This capability greatly simplifies storage management, allowing for a more flexible and scalable infrastructure. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61700[OCPBUGS-61700])
