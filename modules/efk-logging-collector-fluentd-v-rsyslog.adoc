= About Fluentd and Rsyslog

You can choose between Fluentd and Rsyslog as the logging collector. 

Some of the noteable differences between the two collectors are:

* No throttling in Rsyslog. With Fluentd, an administrator can reduce the rate at which the logs are read in by Fluentd before being processed. This feature is not currently available with Rsyslog.

* No _built-in_ support for remote syslog forwarding in rsyslog. With Fluentd, you can use the `secure-forward` plug-in to send a copy of its logs to an external log aggregator. This feature is not currently available with Rsyslog.

For Rsyslog, you can edit the Rsyslog configmap to add support for Syslog log forwarding using the *omfwd* module, see link:https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/omfwd.html[]. To send logs to a different Rsyslog instance, you can the *omrelp* module, see link:https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/omrelp.html[]

* The Event Router is not supported for the Rsyslog log collector.

* remote syslog

When switching between the two collectors can result in:

* A gap in messages between scale down of one collector and scale up of the other when reading from the tail.

* Duplicate messages between scale down of one collector and scale up of the other when reading from the head.
