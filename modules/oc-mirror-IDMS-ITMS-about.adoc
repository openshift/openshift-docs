= About custom resources generated by v2

With oc-mirror v2, ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS) is generated by default, and ImageTagMirrorSet (ITMS) is generated if at least one image referenced by tag is found. These sets contain mirrors for images referenced by digest or tag in releases, operator catalogs, and additional images.

The ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS) resource associates the mirror registry with the source registry and redirects image pull requests using digest specifications. Whereas, the ImagetagMirrorSet (ITMS) redirects the image pull requests using image tags. 

The CatalogSource resource is used by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to retrieve information about the available Operators in the mirror registry. 

The UpdateService resource is used by the OSUS service to provide Cincinnati graph to the disconnected environment.
