= About custom resources generated by v2

With oc-mirror plugin v2, `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS) and `ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS) are generated by default if at least one image is found to which a tag refers. These sets contain mirrors for images referenced by digest or tag in releases, Operator catalogs and additional images.

The `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS) links the mirror registry to the source registry and forwards image pull requests using digest specifications. The `ImagetagMirrorSet` (ITMS) resource, however, redirects image pull requests by using image tags.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) uses the `CatalogSource` resource to retrieve information about the available Operators in the mirror registry.

The OSUS service uses the `UpdateService` resource to provide Cincinnati graph to the disconnected environment.
