= Service-to-pod communication

Service-to-pod communication ensures that services can reliably route traffic to the appropriate pods. Services are objects that define a logical set of pods and provide a stable endpoint, such as IP addresses and DNS names. Pod IP addresses can change. Services abstract pod IP addresses to provide a consistent way to access the application components even as IP addresses change.

Key concepts of service-to-pod communication include:

* Endpoints: Endpoints define the IP addresses and ports of the pods that are associated with a service.

* Selectors: Selectors use labels, such as key-value pairs, to define the criteria for selecting a set of objects that a service should target.

* Services: Services provide a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of pods. This abstraction allows other components to communicate with the service rather than individual pods.

* Service discovery: DNS makes services discoverable. When a service is created, it is assigned a DNS name. Other pods discover this DNS name and use it to communicate with the service.

* Service Types: Service types control how services are exposed within or outside the cluster.

** ClusterIP exposes the service on an internal cluster IP. It is the default service type and makes the service only reachable from within the cluster.

** NodePort allows external traffic to access the service by exposing the service on each node's IP at a static port.

** LoadBalancer uses a cloud provider's load balancer to expose the service externally.

Services use selectors to identify the pods that should receive the traffic. The selectors match labels on the pods to determine which pods are part of the service. Example: A service with the selector `app: myapp` will route traffic to all pods with the label `app: myapp`.

Endpoints are dynamically updated to reflect the current IP addresses of the pods that match the service selector. {product-name} maintains these endpoints and ensures that the service routes traffic to the correct pods.

The communication flow refers to the sequence of steps and interactions that occur when a service in Kubernetes routes traffic to the appropriate pods. The typical communication flow for service-to-pod communication is as follows:

* Service creation: When you create a service, you define the service type, the port on which the service listens, and the selector labels.

* DNS resolution: Each pod has a DNS name that other pods can use to communicate with the service. For example, if the service is named `my-service` in the `my-app` namespace, its DNS name is `my-service.my-app.svc.cluster.local`.

* Traffic routing: When a pod sends a request to the service’s DNS name, {product-title} resolves the name to the service’s ClusterIP. The service then uses the endpoints to route the traffic to one of the pods that match its selector.

* Load balancing: Services also provide basic load balancing. They distribute incoming traffic across all the pods that match the selector. This ensures that no single pod is overwhelmed with too much traffic.
