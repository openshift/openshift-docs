= Restoring to a previous cluster state

You can use a saved etcd backup to restore a previous cluster state or restore a cluster that has lost the majority of control plane hosts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you restore your cluster, you must use an etcd backup that was taken from the same z-stream release. For example, an {product-title} 4.7.2 cluster must use an etcd backup that was taken from 4.7.2.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* A healthy control plane host to use as the recovery host.
* SSH access to control plane hosts.
* A backup directory containing both the etcd snapshot and the resources for the static pods, which were from the same backup. The file names in the directory must be in the following formats: `snapshot_<datetimestamp>.db` and `static_kuberesources_<datetimestamp>.tar.gz`.

.Procedure

. Select a control plane host to use as the recovery host. This is the host that you will run the restore operation on.

. Establish SSH connectivity to each of the control plane nodes, including the recovery host.
+
The Kubernetes API server becomes inaccessible after the restore process starts, so you cannot access the control plane nodes. For this reason, it is recommended to establish SSH connectivity to each control plane host in a separate terminal.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not complete this step, you will not be able to access the control plane hosts to complete the restore procedure, and you will be unable to recover your cluster from this state.
====

. Copy the etcd backup directory to the recovery control plane host.
+
This procedure assumes that you copied the `backup` directory containing the etcd snapshot and the resources for the static pods to the `/home/core/` directory of your recovery control plane host.

. Stop the static pods on any other control plane nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
It is not required to manually stop the pods on the recovery host. The recovery script will stop the pods on the recovery host.
====

.. Access a control plane host that is not the recovery host.

.. Move the existing etcd pod file out of the kubelet manifest directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[core@ip-10-0-154-194 ~]$ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd-pod.yaml /tmp
----

.. Verify that the etcd pods are stopped.
+
[source,terminal]
----
[core@ip-10-0-154-194 ~]$ sudo crictl ps | grep etcd | grep -v operator
----
+
The output of this command should be empty. If it is not empty, wait a few minutes and check again.

.. Move the existing Kubernetes API server pod file out of the kubelet manifest directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[core@ip-10-0-154-194 ~]$ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver-pod.yaml /tmp
----

.. Verify that the Kubernetes API server pods are stopped.
+
[source,terminal]
----
[core@ip-10-0-154-194 ~]$ sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v operator
----
+
The output of this command should be empty. If it is not empty, wait a few minutes and check again.

.. Move the etcd data directory to a different location:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[core@ip-10-0-154-194 ~]$ sudo mv /var/lib/etcd/ /tmp
----

.. Repeat this step on each of the other control plane hosts that is not the recovery host.

. Access the recovery control plane host.


. If the cluster-wide proxy is enabled, be sure that you have exported the `NO_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.
+
[TIP]
====
You can check whether the proxy is enabled by reviewing the output of `oc get proxy cluster -o yaml`. The proxy is enabled if the `httpProxy`, `httpsProxy`, and `noProxy` fields have values set.
====

. Run the restore script on the recovery control plane host and pass in the path to the etcd backup directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[core@ip-10-0-143-125 ~]$ sudo -E /usr/local/bin/cluster-restore.sh /home/core/backup

Review the `NodeInstallerProgressing` status condition to verify that all nodes are at the latest revision. The output shows `AllNodesAtLatestRevision` upon successful update:

[source,terminal]
----
AllNodesAtLatestRevision
3 nodes are at revision 7 <1>
----
<1> In this example, the latest revision number is `7`.

If the output includes multiple revision numbers, such as `2 nodes are at revision 6; 1 nodes are at revision 7`, this means that the update is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

. Verify that all control plane hosts have started and joined the cluster.

In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:

To ensure that all workloads return to normal operation following a recovery procedure, restart each pod that stores Kubernetes API information. This includes {product-title} components such as routers, Operators, and third-party components.

Note that it might take several minutes after completing this procedure for all services to be restored. For example, authentication by using `oc login` might not immediately work until the OAuth server pods are restarted.

= Issues and workarounds for restoring a persistent storage state

If your {product-title} cluster uses persistent storage of any form, a state of the cluster is typically stored outside etcd. It might be an Elasticsearch cluster running in a pod or a database running in a `StatefulSet` object. When you restore from an etcd backup, the status of the workloads in {product-title} is also restored. However, if the etcd snapshot is old, the status might be invalid or outdated.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The contents of persistent volumes (PVs) are never part of the etcd snapshot. When you restore an {product-title} cluster from an etcd snapshot, non-critical workloads might gain access to critical data, or vice-versa.
====

The following are some example scenarios that produce an out-of-date status:

* MySQL database is running in a pod backed up by a PV object. Restoring {product-title} from an etcd snapshot does not bring back the volume on the storage provider, and does not produce a running MySQL pod, despite the pod repeatedly attempting to start. You must manually restore this pod by restoring the volume on the storage provider, and then editing the PV to point to the new volume.

* Pod P1 is using volume A, which is attached to node X. If the etcd snapshot is taken while another pod uses the same volume on node Y, then when the etcd restore is performed, pod P1 might not be able to start correctly due to the volume still being attached to node Y. {product-title} is not aware of the attachment, and does not automatically detach it. When this occurs, the volume must be manually detached from node Y so that the volume can attach on node X, and then pod P1 can start.

* Cloud provider or storage provider credentials were updated after the etcd snapshot was taken. This causes any CSI drivers or Operators that depend on the those credentials to not work. You might have to manually update the credentials required by those drivers or Operators.

* A device is removed or renamed from {product-title} nodes after the etcd snapshot is taken. The Local Storage Operator creates symlinks for each PV that it manages from `/dev/disk/by-id` or `/dev` directories. This situation might cause the local PVs to refer to devices that no longer exist.
+
To fix this problem, an administrator must:

. Manually remove the PVs with invalid devices.
. Remove symlinks from respective nodes.
. Delete `LocalVolume` or `LocalVolumeSet` objects (see _Storage_ -> _Configuring persistent storage_ -> _Persistent storage using local volumes_ -> _Deleting the Local Storage Operator Resources_).
