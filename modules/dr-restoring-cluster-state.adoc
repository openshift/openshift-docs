= Restoring to a previous cluster state

You can use a saved etcd backup to restore back to a previous cluster state. You use the etcd backup to restore a single master host. Then the etcd cluster Operator handles scaling to the remaining master hosts.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* SSH access to master hosts.
* A backup directory containing both the etcd snapshot and the resources for the static Pods, which were from the same backup. The file names in the directory must be in the following formats: `snapshot_<datetimestamp>.db` and `static_kuberesources_<datetimestamp>.tar.gz`.

.Procedure

. Select a master host to use as the recovery host. This is the host that you will run the restore operation on.

. Establish SSH connectivity to each of the master nodes, including the recovery host.
+
The Kubernetes API server will become inaccessible once the restore process has started, so you cannot access the master nodes. For this reason, it is recommended to establish SSH connectivity to each master host in a separate terminal.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not complete this step, you will not be able to access the recovery host to complete the restore procedure, and you will be unable to recover your cluster from this state.
====

. Copy the etcd backup directory to the recovery master host.
+
This procedure assumes that you copied the `backup` directory containing the etcd snapshot and the resources for the static Pods to the `/home/core/` directory of your recovery master host.

. Stop the static Pods on all other master nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
It is not required to manually stop the Pods on the recovery host. The recovery script will stop the Pods on the recovery host.
====

.. Access a master host that is not the recovery host.

.. Move the existing etcd Pod file out of the kubelet manifest directory:
+
----
[core@ip-10-0-154-194 ~]$ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd-pod.yaml /tmp
----

.. Verify that the etcd Pods are stopped.
+
----
[core@ip-10-0-154-194 ~]$ sudo crictl ps | grep etcd
----
+
The output of this command should be empty.

.. Move the existing Kubernetes API server Pod file out of the kubelet manifest directory:
+
----
[core@ip-10-0-154-194 ~]$ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver-pod.yaml /tmp
----

.. Move the etcd data directory to a different location:
+
----
[core@ip-10-0-154-194 ~]$ sudo mv /var/lib/etcd/ /tmp
----

.. Repeat this step on each of the other master hosts that is not the recovery host.

. Access the recovery master host.

. Run the restore script on the recovery master host and pass in the path to the etcd backup directory:

. Verify that the single member control plane has started successfully.

If the status is `Pending`, wait a few minutes and try again.

. Force etcd redeployment.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
----
$ oc patch etcd cluster -p='{"spec": {"forceRedeploymentReason": "recovery-'"$( date --rfc-3339=ns )"'"}}' --type=merge <1>
----
<1> The `forceRedeploymentReason` value must be unique, which is why a timestamp is appended.
+
When the etcd cluster Operator performs a redeployment, the existing nodes are started with new Pods similar to the initial bootstrap scale up.

. Verify all nodes are updated to the latest revision.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command:
+
----
$ oc get etcd -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="NodeInstallerProgressing")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
----
+
Review the `NodeInstallerProgressing` status condition for etcd to verify that all nodes are at the latest revision. The output shows `AllNodesAtLatestRevision` upon successful update:
+
----
AllNodesAtLatestRevision
3 nodes are at revision 3
----
+
If the output shows a message such as `2 nodes are at revision 3; 1 nodes are at revision 4`, this means that the update is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

. After etcd is redeployed, force new rollouts for the control plane. The Kubernetes API server will reinstall itself on the other nodes because the kubelet is connected to API servers using an internal load balancer.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster as a `cluster-admin` user, run the following commands.

.. Update the `kubeapiserver`:

Note that it might take several minutes after completing this procedure for all services to be restored. For example, authentication by using `oc login` might not immediately work until the OAuth server Pods are restarted.
