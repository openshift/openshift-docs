[id="provisioning-a-machine_{context}"]
= Provisioning a machine for {microshift-short}

Provision a machine with your {op-system-ostree} image by using the procedures from the {op-system-ostree} documentation.

To use {microshift-short}, you must provision the system so that it meets the following requirements:

* The machine you are provisioning must meet the system requirements for installing {microshift-short}.
* The file system must have a logical volume manager (LVM) volume group (VG) with sufficient capacity for the persistent volumes (PVs) of your workload.
* A pull secret from the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console] must be present as `/etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret` and have root user-only read/write permissions.
* The firewall must be configured with the required settings.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using a Kickstart such as the {op-system-ostree} Installer (ISO) image, you can update your Kickstart file to meet the provisioning requirements.
====

.Prerequisites

. You have created a {op-system-ostree} Installer (ISO) image containing your {op-system-ostree} commit with {product-title}.
.. This requirement includes the steps of composing an RFE Container image, creating the RFE Installer blueprint, starting the RFE container, and composing the RFE Installer image.
. Create a Kickstart file or use an existing one. In the Kickstart file, you must include:
.. Detailed instructions about how to create a user.
.. How to fetch and deploy the {op-system-ostree} image.

For more information, read "Additional resources."

.Procedure

. In the main section of the Kickstart file, update the setup of the filesystem such that it contains an LVM volume group called `rhel` with at least 10GB system root. Leave free space for the LVMS CSI driver to use for storing the data for your workloads.

----
# Partition disk such that it contains an LVM volume group called `rhel` with a
# 10GB+ system root but leaving free space for the LVMS CSI driver for storing data.
#
# For example, a 20GB disk would be partitioned in the following way:
#
# NAME          MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
# sda             8:0    0  20G  0 disk
# ├─sda1          8:1    0 200M  0 part /boot/efi
# ├─sda1          8:1    0 800M  0 part /boot
# └─sda2          8:2    0  19G  0 part
#  └─rhel-root  253:0    0  10G  0 lvm  /sysroot

. In the `%post` section of the Kickstart file, add your pull secret and the mandatory firewall rules.
