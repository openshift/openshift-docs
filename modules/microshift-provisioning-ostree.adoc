[id="provisioning-{product-title}_{context}"]
= Provisioning for {product-title}

Provision a machine with your {op-system-ostree} image by using the procedures from the{op-system-ostree} documentation.

To use {product-title}, you must provision the system so that it meets the following requirements:

* The machine you are provisioning must meet the system requirements for installing {product-title}.
* The file system must have a logical volume manager (LVM) volume group (VG) with sufficient capacity for the persistent volumes (PVs) of your workload.
* A pull secret from the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console must be present as `/etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret` and have root user-only read/write permissions.
* The firewall must be configured with {product-title}'s required firewall settings.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using a kickstart such as the {op-system-ostree} Installer (iso) image, you can update your kickstart file to meet the above requirements.
====

.Prerequisites

. You have created an {op-system-ostree} Installer (ISO) image containing your {op-system-ostree} commit with {product-title}.
. Create a kickstart file or use an existing one. In the kickstart file, you must include:
.. The details about how to create a user.
.. How to fetch and deploy the {op-system-ostree} image.

For more information, see "Additional resources."

.Procedure

. In the main section of the kickstart file, update the setup of the filesystem such that it contains an LVM volume group called `rhel` with at least 10GB system root. Leave free space for the LVMS CSI driver to use for storing the data for your workloads.

----
# Partition disk such that it contains an LVM volume group called `rhel` with a
# 10GB+ system root but leaving free space for the LVMS CSI driver for storing data.
#
# For example, a 20GB disk would be partitioned in the following way:
#
# NAME          MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
# sda             8:0    0  20G  0 disk
# ├─sda1          8:1    0 200M  0 part /boot/efi
# ├─sda1          8:1    0 800M  0 part /boot
# └─sda2          8:2    0  19G  0 part
#  └─rhel-root  253:0    0  10G  0 lvm  /sysroot
#

part /boot --fstype=xfs --asprimary --size=800

. In the `%post` section of the kickstart file, add your pull secret and the mandatory firewall rules.
+
.Example kickstart snippet for adding the pull secret and firewall rules

[source,terminal]
----
%post --log=/var/log/anaconda/post-install.log --erroronfail

# Add the pull secret to CRI-O and set root user-only read/write permissions
cat > /etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret << EOF
YOUR_OPENSHIFT_PULL_SECRET_HERE
EOF
chmod 600 /etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret

# Configure the firewall with the mandatory rules for MicroShift

. Install the `mkksiso` tool by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo yum install -y lorax
----

. Update the kickstart file in the ISO with your new kickstart file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mkksiso <your_kickstart>.ks <your_installer>.iso <updated_installer>.iso
