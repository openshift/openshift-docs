= Deploying the infra cluster in {product-title}

You can configure Fluentd to split logs between the main Elasticsearch cluster and another
cluster reserved for operations logs, based on the `openshift_logging_use_ops` setting in your inventory file.

.Procedure

To deploy the infra cluster:

.  Edit the Ansible inventory file, by default *_/etc/Ansible/hosts_*.

. Add or set the `openshift_logging_use_ops` to true.
