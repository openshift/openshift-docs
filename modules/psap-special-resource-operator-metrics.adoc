= Prometheus Special Resource Operator metrics


The Special Resource Operator (SRO) exposes the following Prometheus metrics through the `metrics` service:

|===
|Metric Name |Description

|`sro_used_nodes`
|Returns the nodes that are running pods created by a SRO custom resource (CR). This metric is available for `DaemonSet` and `Deployment` objects only. 

|`sro_kind_completed_info`
|Represents whether a `kind` of an object defined by the Helm Charts in a SRO CR has been successfully uploaded in the cluster (value `1`) or not (value `0`). Examples of objects are `DaemonSet`, `Deployment` or `BuildConfig`.

|`sro_states_completed_info`
|Represents whether the SRO has finished processing a CR successfully (value `1`) or the SRO has not processed the CR yet (value `0`).

|`sro_managed_resources_total`
|Returns the number of SRO CRs in the cluster, regardless of their state.
