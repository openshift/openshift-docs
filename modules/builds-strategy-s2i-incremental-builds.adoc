= Performing Source-to-Image (S2I) incremental builds

S2I can perform incremental builds, which means it reuses artifacts from previously-built images.

.Procedure

To create an incremental build, create a `BuildConfig` with the following modification to the strategy definition:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "incremental-image:latest" <1>
    incremental: true <2>
----
<1> Specify an image that supports incremental builds. Consult the documentation of the builder image to determine if it supports this behavior.
<2> This flag controls whether an incremental build is attempted. If the builder image does not support incremental builds, the build will still succeed, but you will get a log message stating the incremental build was not successful because of a missing `save-artifacts` script.

* See S2I Requirements for information on how to create a builder image supporting incremental builds.
