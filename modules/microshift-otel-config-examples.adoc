= Selecting a {microshift-short} Observability configuration

The amount and complexity of the data depends on predefined configurations. These configurations determine the number of data sources and the amount of collected data that is transmitted. These configurations are defined as small, medium, and large (default).

The `opentelemetry-collector.yaml` file includes specific parameters that are used to collect data for monitoring the system resources. All warnings for cluster events are included in the collected data. {microshift-short} Observability collects and transmits data for the following resources:

* CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics of containers, pods, and nodes
* Kubernetes events
* Host CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics
* System journals for certain {microshift-short} services, and dependencies
* Metrics exposed by pods that have the `prometheus.io/scrape`: `true` annotation

Replace the values of the `exporters.otlp.endpoint` and `services.telemetry.metrics.readers[0].endpoint` fields with the IP address or host name of the remote back end. This IP address resolves to the local node's host name. Any unreachable endpoint is reported in the {microshift-short} observability service logs.
