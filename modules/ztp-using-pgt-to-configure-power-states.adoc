= Configuring power states using PolicyGenTemplates CRs

For low latency and high-performance edge deployments, it is necessary to disable or limit C-states and P-states.
With this configuration, the CPU runs at a constant frequency, which is typically the maximum turbo frequency. This ensures that the CPU is always running at its maximum speed, which results in high performance and low latency.
This leads to the best latency for workloads.
However, this also leads to the highest power consumption, which might not be necessary for all workloads.

Workloads can be classified as critical or non-critical, with critical workloads requiring disabled C-state and P-state settings for high performance and low latency, while non-critical workloads use C-state and P-state settings for power savings at the expense of some latency and performance. You can configure the following three power states using {ztp-first}:

* High-performance mode provides ultra low latency at the highest power consumption.
* Performance mode provides low latency at a relatively high power consumption.
* Power saving balances reduced power consumption with increased latency.

The default configuration is for a low latency, performance mode.

`PolicyGenTemplate` custom resources (CRs) allow you to overlay additional configuration details onto the base source CRs provided with the GitOps plugin in the `ztp-site-generate` container.

Configure the power states by updating the `workloadHints` fields in the generated `PerformanceProfile` CR for the reference configuration, based on the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR in the `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml`.

The following common prerequisites apply to configuring all three power states.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for Argo CD.

* You have followed the procedure described in "Preparing the {ztp} site configuration repository".
