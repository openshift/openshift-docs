= Using SinkBinding with the YAML method

This guide describes the steps required to create, manage, and delete a SinkBinding instance using YAML files.

.Prerequisites

* You have Knative Serving and Eventing installed.

.Procedure

. To check that SinkBinding is set up correctly, create a Knative event display service, or event sink, that dumps incoming messages to its log.
.. Copy the following sample YAML into a file named `service.yaml`:
+
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:v0.13.2
----
.. After you have created the `service.yaml` file, apply it by entering:
+
----
$ oc apply --filename service.yaml
----

. Create a SinkBinding that directs events to the service.
.. Create a file named `sinkbinding.yaml` and copy the following sample code into it:
+
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: SinkBinding
metadata:
  name: bind-heartbeat
spec:
  subject:
    apiVersion: batch/v1
    kind: Job <1>
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: heartbeat-cron

  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
----
+
<1> In this example, any Job with the label `app: heartbeat-cron` will be bound to the event sink.
.. After you have created the `sinkbinding.yaml` file, apply it by entering:
+
----
$ oc apply --filename sinkbinding.yaml
----

. Create a CronJob.
.. Create a file named `heartbeats-cronjob.yaml` and copy the following sample code into it:
+
----
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: heartbeat-cron
spec:
spec:
  # Run every minute
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: heartbeat-cron
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          restartPolicy: Never
          containers:
            - name: single-heartbeat
              image: quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-heartbeats:v0.13.2
              args:
                - --period=1
              env:
                - name: ONE_SHOT
                  value: "true"
                - name: POD_NAME
                  valueFrom:
                    fieldRef:
                      fieldPath: metadata.name
                - name: POD_NAMESPACE
                  valueFrom:
                    fieldRef:
                      fieldPath: metadata.namespace
----
.. After you have created the `heartbeats-cronjob.yaml` file, apply it by entering:
+
----
$ oc apply --filename heartbeats-cronjob.yaml
----

. Check that the controller is mapped correctly by entering the following command and inspecting the output:
+
----
$ oc get sinkbindings.sources.knative.dev bind-heartbeat -oyaml
----
+
The output should be similar to:
+
----
spec:
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
      namespace: default
  subject:
    apiVersion: batch/v1
    kind: Job
    namespace: default
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: heartbeat-cron
----

.Verification steps

You can verify that the Kubernetes events were sent to the Knative event sink by looking at the message dumper function logs.

You can view the message dumper function logs by entering:
----
$ oc get pods
$ oc logs $(oc get pod -o name | grep event-display) -c user-container
----

The logs should contain lines similar to the following:
----
