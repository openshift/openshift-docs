.Verification
The deployment YAML file shows that we mounted link:https://github.com/openshift-cs/rosaworkshop/blob/master/rosa-workshop/ostoy/yaml/ostoy-frontend-deployment.yaml#L61[the directory] `/var/demo_files` to our persistent volume claim.

. Retrieve the name of your front-end pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----
+
. Start a secure shell (SSH) session in your container by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh <pod_name>
----
+
. Go to the directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd /var/demo_files
----
+
. *Optional:* See all the files you created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls
----
+
. Open the file to view the contents by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat test-pv.txt
----
+
. Verify that the output is the text you entered in the OSToy application console.
+
*For example*:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
