= BuildRun resource

A `BuildRun` resource invokes a build on your cluster, similar to any cluster job or Tekton task run. The `BuildRun` resource represents a workload on your cluster, which results in a running pod. A `BuildRun` is the running instance of a build. It instantiates a build for execution with specific parameters on a cluster.

A `BuildRun` resource helps you to define the following elements:

* A unique `BuildRun` name to monitor the status of the build
* A referenced `Build` instance to use during the build
* A service account to host all secrets for the build

Each `BuildRun` resource is available within a namespace.
