= Nodes

[role="_abstract"]
The following covers the various aspects about {product-title} cluster nodes, including worker node requirements, operating system, supported instances, and scaling capabilities.

== Worker nodes across multiple AWS regions
All nodes in a {product-title} cluster must be located in the same AWS region. For clusters configured for multiple availability zones, control plane nodes and worker nodes will be distributed across the availability zones.

== Minimum number of worker nodes
For a {product-title} cluster, the minimum is 2 worker nodes for single availability zone and 3 worker nodes for multiple availability zones.

== Underlying node operating system
As with all OpenShift v4.x offerings, the control plane, infra and worker nodes run Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS).

== Node hibernation or shut-down
At this time, {product-title} does not have a hibernation or shut-down feature for nodes. The shutdown and hibernation feature is an OpenShift platform feature that is not yet mature enough for widespread cloud services use.

== Supported instances for worker nodes
For a complete list of supported instances for worker nodes see the _Additional Resources_ for the AWS instance types. Spot instances are also supported.

== Node autoscaling
Autoscaling allows you to automatically adjust the size of the cluster based on the current workload.

== Maximum number of worker nodes
The maximum number of worker nodes in {product-title} clusters versions 4.14.14 and later is 249. For earlier versions, the limit is 180 nodes.
