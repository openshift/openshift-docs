= Mounting a config map as a volume

. Open the `func.yaml` file for your function.

. For each config map you want to mount as a volume, add the following YAML to the `volumes` section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: test
namespace: ""
runtime: go
...
volumes:
- configMap: myconfigmap
  path: /workspace/configmap
----
+
* Substitute `myconfigmap` with the name of the target config map.
* Substitute `/workspace/configmap` with the path where you want to mount the config map.

. Save the configuration.
