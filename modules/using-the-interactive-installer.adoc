= Using the interactive installer

[role="_abstract"]
Use the interactive installer to generate the required secrets, deployment configurations, and deployment scripts for your environment.

.Procedure
. Run the interactive install command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl central generate interactive
----
. Press *Enter* to accept the default value for a prompt or enter custom values as required.
+
[source,terminal]
----
Enter path to the backup bundle from which to restore keys and certificates (optional):
Enter PEM cert bundle file (optional): <1>
Enter administrator password (default: autogenerated):
Enter orchestrator (k8s, openshift): openshift
Enter the directory to output the deployment bundle to (default: "central-bundle"):
Enter default container images settings (stackrox.io, rhacs); it controls repositories from where to download the images, image names and tags format (default: "rhacs"):
Enter the OpenShift major version (3 or 4) to deploy on (default: "0"): 4
Enter Istio version when deploying into an Istio-enabled cluster (leave empty when not running Istio) (optional):
Enter the method of exposing Central (route, lb, np, none) (default: "none"): route <2>
Enter main image to use (if unset, the default will be used):
Enter whether to run StackRox in offline mode, which avoids reaching out to the Internet (default: "false"):
Enter whether to enable telemetry (default: "true"):
Enter the deployment tool to use (kubectl, helm, helm-values) (default: "kubectl"):
Enter Scanner DB image to use (if unset, the default will be used):
Enter Scanner image to use (if unset, the default will be used):
Enter Central volume type (hostpath, pvc): pvc <3>
Enter external volume name (default: "stackrox-db"):
Enter external volume size in Gi (default: "100"):
Enter storage class name (optional if you have a default StorageClass configured):
----
<1> If you want to add a custom TLS certificate, provide the file path for the PEM-encoded certificate. When you specify a custom certificate the interactive installer also prompts you to provide a PEM private key for the custom certificate you are using.
<2> To use the RHACS portal, you must expose Central by using a route, a load balancer or a node port.
<3> If you plan to install {product-title} on {ocp} with a hostPath volume, you must modify the SELinux policy.
+
[WARNING]
====
On {ocp}, for using a hostPath volume, you must modify the SELinux policy to allow access to the directory, which the host and the container share. It is because SELinux blocks directory sharing by default. To modify the SELinux policy, run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t <full_volume_path>
----

However, Red Hat does not recommend modifying the SELinux policy, instead use PVC when installing on {ocp}.
====

On completion, the installer creates a folder named central-bundle, which contains the necessary YAML manifests and scripts to deploy Central.
In addition, it shows on-screen instructions for the scripts you need to run to deploy additional trusted certificate authorities, Central and Scanner, and the authentication instructions for logging into the RHACS portal along with the autogenerated password if you did not provide one when answering the prompts.
