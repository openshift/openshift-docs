= Bare-metal infrastructure

Hardware requirements:: In several industries, such as telco and finance, clusters are primarily built on bare-metal hardware. This means that the (op-system-first) operating system is installed directly on the physical machines, without using virtual machines. This reduces network connectivity complexity, minimizes latency, and optimizes CPU usage for applications.

Network requirements:: Networks in these industries sometimes require much higher bandwidth compared to standard IT networks. For example, Telco networks commonly use dual-port 25 GB connections or 100 GB network interface cards (NICs) to handle massive data throughput. Security is critical, requiring encrypted connections and secure endpoints to protect sensitive personal data.
