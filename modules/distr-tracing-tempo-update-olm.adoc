= Updating the {TempoShortName} by using the OLM

For version upgrades, the {TempoOperator} uses the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which controls installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster. The OLM runs in {product-title} by default. The OLM queries for available Operators as well as upgrades for installed Operators. When the {TempoOperator} is upgraded to the new version, it scans for running TempoStack instances that it manages and upgrades them to the version corresponding to the Operator's new version.
