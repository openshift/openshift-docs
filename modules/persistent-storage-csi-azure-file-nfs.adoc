= NFS support

{product-title} supports the Azure File Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator with Network File System (NFS) with the following restrictions:

* Creating pods with Azure File NFS volumes that are scheduled to the control plane node causes the mount to be denied.
+
To work around this issue: If your control plane nodes are schedulable, and the pods can run on worker nodes, use `nodeSelector` or Affinity to schedule the pod in worker nodes.

* FS Group policy behavior:
+
[IMPORTANT]
=====
Azure File CSI with NFS does not honor the `fsGroupChangePolicy` requested by pods. Azure File CSI with NFS applies a default `OnRootMismatch` FS Group policy regardless of the policy requested by the pod.
=====

* The Azure File CSI Operator does not automatically create a storage class for NFS. You must create it manually. Use a file similar to the following:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: <storage-class-name> <1>
provisioner: file.csi.azure.com <2>
parameters:
  protocol: nfs <3>
  skuName: Premium_LRS  # available values: Premium_LRS, Premium_ZRS
mountOptions:
  - nconnect=4
----
<1> Storage class name.
<2> Specifies the Azure File CSI provider.
<3> Specifies NFS as the storage backend protocol.
