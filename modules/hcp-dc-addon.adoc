= Configuring the hypershift-addon managed cluster add-on to run on an infrastructure node

By default, no node placement preference is specified for the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on. Consider running the add-ons on the infrastructure nodes, because by doing so, you can prevent incurring billing costs against subscription counts and separate maintenance and management tasks.

.Procedure

. Log in to the hub cluster.

. Open the `hypershift-addon-deploy-config` add-on deployment configuration specification for editing by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit addondeploymentconfig hypershift-addon-deploy-config -n multicluster-engine
----

. Add the `nodePlacement` field to the specification, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: AddOnDeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: hypershift-addon-deploy-config
  namespace: multicluster-engine
spec:
  nodePlacement:
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
    tolerations:
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
      operator: Exists 
----

. Save the changes. The `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on is deployed on an infrastructure node for new and existing managed clusters.
