[id="csisnapshot-timeout_{context}"]
= CSI snapshot timeout

`CSISnapshotTimeout` specifies the time during creation to wait until  the `CSI VolumeSnapshot` status becomes `ReadyToUse`, before returning error as timeout. The default value is `10m`.

Use the `CSISnapshotTimeout`  for the following scenarios:

* With the CSI plugin.
* For very large storage volumes that may take longer than 10 minutes to snapshot. Adjust this timeout if timeouts are found in the logs.

[NOTE]
====
Typically, the default value for `CSISnapshotTimeout` does not require adjustment, because the default setting can accommodate large storage volumes.
