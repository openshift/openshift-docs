= BMC addressing for Dell iDRAC

The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the {product-title} cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

<1> The `address` configuration setting specifies the protocol.

For Dell hardware, Red Hat supports integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) virtual media, Redfish network boot, and IPMI.

== BMC address formats for Dell iDRAC
[width="100%", cols="1,3", options="header"]
|====
|Protocol|Address Format
|iDRAC virtual media| `idrac-virtualmedia://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1`
|Redfish network boot|`redfish://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1`
|IPMI|`ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>`
|====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use `idrac-virtualmedia` as the protocol for Redfish virtual media. `redfish-virtualmedia` will not work on Dell hardware. Dell's `idrac-virtualmedia` uses the Redfish standard with Dell's OEM extensions.

See the following sections for additional details.

== Redfish virtual media for Dell iDRAC

For Redfish virtual media on Dell servers, use `idrac-virtualmedia://` in the `address` setting. Using `redfish-virtualmedia://` will not work.

The following example demonstrates using iDRAC virtual media within the  `install-config.yaml` file.

platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: idrac-virtualmedia://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

While it is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the out-of-band management addresses, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, Redfish is only supported on Dell with iDRAC firmware versions `4.20.20.20` through `04.40.00.00` for installer-provisioned installations on bare metal deployments. There is a known issue with version `04.40.00.00`. With iDRAC 9 firmware version `04.40.00.00`, the Virtual Console plug-in defaults to `eHTML5`, which causes problems with the *InsertVirtualMedia* workflow. Set the plug-in to `HTML5` to avoid this issue. The menu path is: *Configuration* -> *Virtual console* -> *Plug-in Type* -> *HTML5* .

Ensure the {product-title} cluster nodes have AutoAttach Enabled through the iDRAC console. The menu path is: *Configuration* -> *Virtual Media* -> *Attach Mode* -> `AutoAttach` .

Use `idrac-virtualmedia://` as the protocol for Redfish virtual media. Using `redfish-virtualmedia://` will not work on Dell hardware, because the `idrac-virtualmedia://` protocol corresponds to the `idrac` hardware type and the Redfish protocol in Ironic. Dell's `idrac-virtualmedia://` protocol uses the Redfish standard with Dell's OEM extensions. Ironic also supports the `idrac` type with the WSMAN protocol. Therefore, you must specify `idrac-virtualmedia://` to avoid unexpected behavior when electing to use Redfish with virtual media on Dell hardware.

== Redfish network boot for iDRAC

To enable Redfish, use `redfish://` or `redfish+http://` to disable transport layer security (TLS). The installer requires both the hostname or the IP address and the path to the system ID. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.
