= About disconnected support and the oc-mirror plugin in {olmv1}

{olmv1-first} supports disconnected environments starting in {product-title} 4.18. After using the oc-mirror plugin for the {oc-first} to mirror the images required for your cluster to a mirror registry in your fully or partially disconnected environments, {olmv1} can function properly in these environments by utilizing either of the following sets of resources, depending on which oc-mirror plugin version you are using:

* `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resources, which are automatically generated by oc-mirror plugin v1, and `ClusterCatalog` resources, which must be manually created after using oc-mirror plugin v1
* `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, `ImageTagMirrorSet`, and `ClusterCatalog` resources, which are all automatically generated by oc-mirror plugin v2

[NOTE]
====
Starting in {product-title} 4.18, oc-mirror plugin v2 is the recommended version for mirroring.

For more information and procedures, see the _Disconnected environments_ guide for the oc-mirror plugin version you plan to use.
