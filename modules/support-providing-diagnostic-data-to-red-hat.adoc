= Providing diagnostic data to Red Hat Support

When investigating {product-title} issues, Red Hat Support might ask you to upload diagnostic data to a support case. Files can be uploaded to a support case through the Red Hat Customer Portal, or from an {product-title} cluster directly by using the `redhat-support-tool` command.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have SSH access to your hosts.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have a Red Hat standard or premium Subscription.
* You have a Red Hat Customer Portal account.
* You have an existing Red Hat Support case ID.

.Procedure

* Upload diagnostic data to an existing Red Hat support case through the Red Hat Customer Portal.
. Concatenate a diagnostic file contained on an {product-title} node by using the `oc debug node/<node_name>` command and redirect the output to a file. The following example copies `/host/var/tmp/my-diagnostic-data.tar.gz` from a debug container to `/var/tmp/my-diagnostic-data.tar.gz`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/my-cluster-node -- bash -c 'cat /host/var/tmp/my-diagnostic-data.tar.gz' > /var/tmp/my-diagnostic-data.tar.gz <1>
----
<1> The debug container mounts the host’s root directory at `/host`. Reference the absolute path from the debug container's root directory, including `/host`, when specifying target files for concatenation.
+
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} {product-version} cluster nodes running {op-system-first} are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Transferring files from a cluster node by using `scp` is not recommended and nodes will be tainted as _accessed_. However, if the {product-title} API is not available, or the kubelet is not properly functioning on the target node, `oc` operations will be impacted. In such situations, it is possible to copy diagnostic files from a node by running `scp core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>:<file_path> <local_path>`.
====
+
. Navigate to an existing support case within link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/[https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/].
+
. Select *Attach files* and follow the prompts to upload the file.

* Upload diagnostic data to an existing Red Hat support case directly from an {product-title} cluster.
. Obtain a list of cluster nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----

. Enter into a debug session on the target node. This step instantiates a debug pod called `<node_name>-debug`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/my-cluster-node
----
+
. Set `/host` as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host's root file system in `/host` within the pod. By changing the root directory to `/host`, you can run binaries contained in the host's executable paths:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# chroot /host
----
+

{product-title} {product-version} cluster nodes running {op-system-first} are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Accessing cluster nodes using SSH is not recommended and nodes will be tainted as _accessed_. However, if the {product-title} API is not available, or the kubelet is not properly functioning on the target node, `oc` operations will be impacted. In such situations, it is possible to access nodes using `ssh core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` instead.
====
+
. Start a `toolbox` container, which includes the required binaries to run `redhat-support-tool`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# toolbox
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If an existing `toolbox` pod is already running, the `toolbox` command outputs `'toolbox-' already exists. Trying to start...`. Remove the running toolbox container with `podman rm toolbox-` and spawn a new toolbox container, to avoid issues.
====
+
.. Run `redhat-support-tool` to attach a file from the debug pod directly to an existing Red Hat Support case. This example uses support case ID '01234567' and example file path `/host/var/tmp/my-diagnostic-data.tar.gz`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# redhat-support-tool addattachment -c 01234567 /host/var/tmp/my-diagnostic-data.tar.gz <1>
----
<1> The toolbox container mounts the host’s root directory at `/host`. Reference the absolute path from the toolbox container's root directory, including `/host/`, when specifying files to upload through the `redhat-support-tool` command.
