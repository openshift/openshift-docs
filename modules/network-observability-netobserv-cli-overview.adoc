= netobserv CLI

A lightweight version of Network Observability is available through the `netobserv` CLI as an oc plugin. The `netobserv` CLI requires no storage, compared with the Operator version of Network Observability, so you can quickly gain live insight into packets and flow data without configuration overhead.  You can filter on any resource or zone in the data to solve use cases, such as displaying RTT between two zones.
