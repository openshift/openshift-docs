|--machine-cidr <address_block>
a|Block of IP addresses (ipNet) used by ROSA while installing the cluster, for example, `10.0.0.0/16`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
OVN-Kubernetes, the default network provider in ROSA 4.11 and later, uses the `100.64.0.0/16` IP address range internally. If your cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes, do not include the `100.64.0.0/16` IP address range in any other CIDR definitions in your cluster.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
OVN-Kubernetes, the default network provider in ROSA 4.11 and later, uses the `100.64.0.0/16` IP address range internally. If your cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes, do not include the `100.64.0.0/16` IP address range in any other CIDR definitions in your cluster.
====

|--private
|Restricts primary API endpoint and application routes to direct, private connectivity.

|--private-link
|Specifies to use AWS PrivateLink to provide private connectivity between VPCs and services. The `--subnet-ids` argument is required when using `--private-link`.

|--region <region_name>
|The name of the AWS region where your worker pool will be located, for example, `us-east-1`. This argument overrides the `AWS_REGION` environment variable.

|--replicas n
|The number of worker nodes to provision per availability zone. Single-zone clusters require at least 2 nodes. Multi-zone clusters require at least 3 nodes. Default: `2` for single-zone clusters; `3` for multi-zone clusters.

|--role-arn <arn>
|The ARN of the installer role that {cluster-manager} uses to create the cluster. This is required if you have not already created account roles.

|--service-cidr <address_block>
a|Block of IP addresses (ipNet) for services, for example, `172.30.0.0/16`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
OVN-Kubernetes, the default network provider in ROSA 4.11 and later, uses the `100.64.0.0/16` IP address range internally. If your cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes, do not include the `100.64.0.0/16` IP address range in any other CIDR definitions in your cluster.
====

a|--sts \| --non-sts
|Specifies whether to use AWS Security Token Service (STS) or IAM credentials (non-STS) to deploy your cluster.

|--subnet-ids <aws_subnet_id>
|The AWS subnet IDs that are used when installing the cluster, for example, `subnet-01abc234d5678ef9a`. Subnet IDs must be in pairs with one private subnet ID and one public subnet ID per availability zone. Subnets are comma-delimited, for example, `--subnet-ids=subnet-1,subnet-2`. Leave the value empty for installer-provisioned subnet IDs.

When using `--private-link`, the `--subnet-ids` argument is required and only one private subnet is allowed per zone.

|--support-role-arn string
|The ARN of the role used by Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) to enable access to the cluster account to provide support.

|--tags
a|Tags that are used on resources created by {product-title} in AWS. Tags can help you manage, identify, organize, search for, and filter resources within AWS. Tags are comma separated, for example: "key value, foo bar".
[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} only supports custom tags to Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift resources during cluster creation. Once added, the tags cannot be removed or edited.
Tags that are added by Red{nbsp}Hat are required for clusters to stay in compliance with Red{nbsp}Hat production service level agreements (SLAs). These tags must not be removed.

{product-title} does not support adding additional tags outside of ROSA cluster-managed resources. These tags can be lost when AWS resources are managed by the ROSA cluster. In these cases, you might need custom solutions or tools to reconcile the tags and keep them intact.
====

|--version string
|The version of ROSA that will be used to install the cluster or cluster resources. For `cluster` use an `X.Y.Z` format, for example, `4.17.0`. For `account-role` use an `X.Y` format, for example, `4.17`.

|--worker-iam-role string
|The ARN of the IAM role that will be attached to compute instances.

|Option |Definition

// Note for writers: This command works the same way as rosa create --additional-compute-security-group-ids but all subsequent machinepools are compute only so we don't specify compute here yet; consistency across commands to come in OCM-3111.
|--additional-security-group-ids <sec_group_id>
|The identifier of one or more additional security groups to use along with the default security groups for this machine pool. For more information on additional security groups, see the requirements for _Security groups_ under _Additional resources_.

a|--cluster <cluster_name>\|<cluster_id>
|Required: The name or ID of the cluster to which the machine pool will be added.

|--enable-autoscaling
|Enable or disable autoscaling of compute nodes. To enable autoscaling, use this argument with the `--min-replicas` and `--max-replicas` arguments. To disable autoscaling, use `--enable-autoscaling=false` with the `--replicas` argument.

|--instance-type
|The instance type (string) that should be used. Default: `m5.xlarge`

//endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

|--labels
|The labels (string) for the machine pool. The format must be a comma-delimited list of key=value pairs. This list overwrites any modifications made to node labels on an ongoing basis.

|--max-replicas
|Specifies the maximum number of compute nodes when enabling autoscaling.

|--min-replicas
|Specifies the minimum number of compute nodes when enabling autoscaling.

//OSDOCS-11160: HCP only, but need to wait on separate HCP publishing
//ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
|--max-surge
a| For {hcp-title-first} clusters, the `max-surge` parameter defines the number of new nodes that can be provisioned in excess of the desired number of replicas for the machine pool, as configured using the `--replicas` parameter, or as determined by the autoscaler when autoscaling is enabled. This can be an absolute number (for example, `2`) or a percentage of the machine pool size (for example, `20%`), but must use the same unit as the `max-unavailable` parameter.

The default value is `1`, meaning that the maximum number of nodes in the machine pool during an upgrade is 1 plus the desired number of replicas for the machine pool. In this situation, one excess node can be provisioned before existing nodes need to be made unavailable. The number of nodes that can be provisioned simultaneously during an upgrade is `max-surge` plus `max-unavailable`.

|--max-unavailable
a|For {hcp-title-first} clusters, the `max-unavailable` parameter defines the number of nodes that can be made unavailable in a machine pool during an upgrade, before new nodes are provisioned. This can be an absolute number (for example, `2`) or a percentage of the current replica count in the machine pool (for example, `20%`), but must use the same unit as the `max-surge` parameter.

The default value is `0`, meaning that no outdated nodes are removed before new nodes are provisioned. The valid range for this value is from `0` to the current machine pool size, or from `0%` to `100%`. The total number of nodes that can be upgraded simultaneously during an upgrade is `max-surge` plus `max-unavailable`.

|--name
|Required: The name (string) for the machine pool.

|--replicas
|Required when autoscaling is not configured. The number (integer) of machines for this machine pool.

|--tags                            
|Apply user defined tags to all resources created by ROSA in AWS. Tags are comma separated, for example: `'key value, foo bar'`.

|--taints
|Taints for the machine pool. This string value should be formatted as a comma-separated list of `key=value:ScheduleType`. This list will overwrite any modifications made to Node taints on an ongoing basis.
