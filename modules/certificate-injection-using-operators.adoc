= Certificate injection using Operators

Once your custom CA certificate is added to the cluster via ConfigMap, the
Cluster Network Operator merges the user-provided and system CA certificates
into a single bundle and injects the merged bundle into the Operator requesting
the trust bundle injection.

Operators request this injection by creating an empty ConfigMap with the
following label:

[source,yaml]
----
config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle="true"
----

The Operator mounts this ConfigMap into the container's local trust store.

[NOTE]
====
Adding a trusted CA certificate is only needed if the certificate is not
included in the {op-system-first} trust bundle.
====

Certificate injection is not limited to Operators. The Cluster Network Operator
injects certificates across any namespace when an empty ConfigMap is created with the
`config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true` label.

The ConfigMap can reside in any namespace, but the ConfigMap must be mounted as
a volume to each container within a Pod that requires a custom CA. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-example-custom-ca-deployment
  namespace: my-example-custom-ca-ns
spec:
  ...
    spec:
      ...
      containers:
        - name: my-container-that-needs-custom-ca
          volumeMounts:
          - name: trusted-ca
            mountPath: /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem
            readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: trusted-ca
        configMap:
          name: trusted-ca
          items:
            - key: ca-bundle.crt <1>
              path: tls-ca-bundle.pem <2>
----
<1> `ca-bundle.crt` is required as the ConfigMap key.
<2> `tls-ca-bundle.pem` is required as the ConfigMap path.
