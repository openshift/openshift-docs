== Configuring nodes when using the `provisioning` network

Each node in the cluster requires the following configuration for proper installation.

[WARNING]
====
A mismatch between nodes will cause an installation failure.
====

While the cluster nodes can contain more than two NICs, the installation process only focuses on the first two NICs:

[options="header"]
|===
|NIC |Network |VLAN
| NIC1 | `provisioning` | `<provisioning_vlan>`
| NIC2 | `baremetal` | `<baremetal_vlan>`
|===

In the foregoing example, NIC1 is a non-routable network (`provisioning`) that is only used for the installation of the {product-title} cluster.

ifndef::openshift-origin[The {op-system-base-full} 8.x installation process on the provisioner node might vary. To install {op-system-base-full} 8.x using a local Satellite server or a PXE server, PXE-enable NIC2.]
ifdef::openshift-origin[The {op-system-first} installation process on the provisioner node might vary. To install {op-system} using a local Satellite server or a PXE server, PXE-enable NIC2.]

[options="header"]
|===
|PXE |Boot order
| NIC1 PXE-enabled `provisioning` network | 1
| NIC2 `baremetal` network. PXE-enabled is optional. | 2
|===

[NOTE]
====
Ensure PXE is disabled on all other NICs.
====

Configure the control plane and worker nodes as follows:

[options="header"]
|===
|PXE | Boot order
| NIC1 PXE-enabled (provisioning network) | 1
|===

[discrete]
== Configuring nodes without the `provisioning` network

The installation process requires one NIC:

[options="header"]
|===
|NIC |Network |VLAN
| NICx | `baremetal` | `<baremetal_vlan>`
|===

NICx is a routable network (`baremetal`) that is used for the installation of the {product-title} cluster, and routable to the internet.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `provisioning` network is optional, but it is required for PXE booting. If you deploy without a `provisioning` network, you must use a virtual media BMC addressing option such as `redfish-virtualmedia` or `idrac-virtualmedia`.

[id="configuring-nodes-for-secure-boot_{context}"]
[discrete]
== Configuring nodes for Secure Boot manually

Secure Boot prevents a node from booting unless it verifies the node is using only trusted software, such as UEFI firmware drivers, EFI applications, and the operating system.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat only supports manually configured Secure Boot when deploying with Redfish virtual media.
====

To enable Secure Boot manually, refer to the hardware guide for the node and execute the following:

. Boot the node and enter the BIOS menu.
. Set the node's boot mode to UEFI Enabled.
. Enable Secure Boot.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat does not support Secure Boot with self-generated keys.
