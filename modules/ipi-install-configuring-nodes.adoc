= Configuring nodes

Each node in the cluster requires the following configuration for proper installation.

[WARNING]
====
A mismatch between nodes will cause an installation failure.
====

While the cluster nodes can contain more than two NICs, the installation process only focuses on the first two NICs:

|===
|NIC |Network |VLAN
| NIC1 | `provisioning` | <provisioning-vlan>
| NIC2 | `baremetal` | <baremetal-vlan>
|===

The RHEL 8.1 installation process on the Provisioning node may vary. For this procedure, NIC2 is PXE-enabled to ensure easy installation using a local Satellite server.

NIC1 is a non-routable network (`provisioning`) that is only used for the installation of the {product-title} cluster.

|===
|PXE |Boot order
| NIC1 PXE-enabled (provisioning network) | 1
| NIC2 PXE-enabled (baremetal network) | 2
|===

[NOTE]
====
Ensure PXE is disabled on all other NICs.
====

Configure the control plane (master) and worker nodes as follows:

|===
|PXE | Boot order
| NIC1 PXE-enabled (provisioning network) | 1
|===
