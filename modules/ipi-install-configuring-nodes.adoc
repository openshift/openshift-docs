.Configuring nodes when using the `provisioning` network

Each node in the cluster requires the following configuration for proper installation.

[WARNING]
====
A mismatch between nodes will cause an installation failure.
====

While the cluster nodes can contain more than two NICs, the installation process only focuses on the first two NICs:

|===
|NIC |Network |VLAN
| NIC1 | `provisioning` | <provisioning-vlan>
| NIC2 | `baremetal` | <baremetal-vlan>
|===

NIC1 is a non-routable network (`provisioning`) that is only used for the installation of the {product-title} cluster.

The {op-system-base-full} 8.x installation process on the provisioner node might vary. To install {op-system-base-full} 8.x using a local Satellite server or a PXE server, PXE-enable NIC2.


|===
|PXE |Boot order
| NIC1 PXE-enabled `provisioning` network | 1
| NIC2 `baremetal` network. PXE-enabled is optional. | 2
|===

[NOTE]
====
Ensure PXE is disabled on all other NICs.
====

Configure the control plane and worker nodes as follows:

|===
|PXE | Boot order
| NIC1 PXE-enabled (provisioning network) | 1
|===

.Configuring nodes without the `provisioning` network

The installation process requires one NIC:

|===
|NIC |Network |VLAN
| NICx | `baremetal` | <baremetal-vlan>
|===

NICx is a routable network (`baremetal`) that is used for the installation of the {product-title} cluster, and routable to the internet.

.Configuring nodes for Secure Boot

Secure Boot prevents a node from booting unless it verifies the node is using only trusted software, such as UEFI firmware drivers, EFI applications and the operating system. Red Hat only supports Secure Boot when deploying with RedFish Virtual Media.

To enable Secure Boot, refer to the hardware guide for the node. To enable Secure Boot, execute the following:

. Boot the node and enter the BIOS menu.
. Set the node's boot mode to UEFI Enabled.
. Enable Secure Boot.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat does not support Secure Boot with self-generated keys.
