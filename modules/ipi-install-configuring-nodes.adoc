.Configuring nodes when using the `provisioning` network

Each node in the cluster requires the following configuration for proper installation.

[WARNING]
====
A mismatch between nodes will cause an installation failure.
====

While the cluster nodes can contain more than two NICs, the installation process only focuses on the first two NICs:

|===
|NIC |Network |VLAN
| NIC1 | `provisioning` | <provisioning-vlan>
| NIC2 | `baremetal` | <baremetal-vlan>
|===

NIC1 is a non-routable network (`provisioning`) that is only used for the installation of the {product-title} cluster.

The RHEL 8.x installation process on the provisioner node might vary. To install RHEL 8.x using a local Satellite server or a PXE server, PXE-enable NIC2.


|===
|PXE |Boot order
| NIC1 PXE-enabled `provisioning` network | 1
| NIC2 `baremetal` network. PXE-enabled is optional. | 2
|===

[NOTE]
====
Ensure PXE is disabled on all other NICs.
====

Configure the control plane and worker nodes as follows:

|===
|PXE | Boot order
| NIC1 PXE-enabled (provisioning network) | 1
|===


.Configuring nodes without the `provisioning` network

The installation process requires one NIC:

|===
|NIC |Network |VLAN
| NICx | `baremetal` | <baremetal-vlan>
|===

NICx is a routable network (`baremetal`) that is used for the installation of the {product-title} cluster, and routable to the internet.
