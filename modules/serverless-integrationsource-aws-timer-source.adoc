= Timer source with IntegrationSource

The Timer Kamelet produces periodic messages with a custom payload and forwards them into Knative Eventing. This is useful for testing event flows or generating scheduled events without relying on external systems.

To configure an `IntegrationSource` for the Timer Kamelet, you specify the interval at which messages are generated and the message content, and then define the event sink, such as a Knative broker.
