= DNS Operator

The DNS Operator implements the `dns` API from the `operator.openshift.io` API
group. The Operator deploys CoreDNS using a daemon set, creates a service for
the daemon set, and configures the kubelet to instruct pods to use the CoreDNS
service IP address for name resolution.

.Procedure

The DNS Operator is deployed during installation with a `Deployment` object.

. Use the `oc get` command to view the deployment status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n openshift-dns-operator deployment/dns-operator
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME           READY     UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
dns-operator   1/1       1            1           23h
----

. Use the `oc get` command to view the state of the DNS Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusteroperator/dns
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      VERSION     AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE
dns       4.1.0-0.11  True        False         False      92m
----
+
`AVAILABLE`, `PROGRESSING` and `DEGRADED` provide information about the status of the operator. `AVAILABLE` is `True` when at least 1 pod from the CoreDNS daemon set reports an `Available` status condition.
