= DNS Operator

The DNS Operator implements the `dns` API from the `operator.openshift.io` API
group. The operator deploys CoreDNS using a DaemonSet, creates a Service for
the DaemonSet, and configures the kubelet to instruct pods to use the CoreDNS
Service IP for name resolution.

.Procedure
The DNS Operator is deployed during installation as a Kubernetes `Deployment`.

. Use the `oc get` command to view the Deployment status:
+
----
$ oc get -n openshift-dns-operator deployment/dns-operator
NAME           READY     UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
dns-operator   1/1       1            1           23h
----
ClusterOperator is the Custom Resource object which holds the current state
of an operator. This object is used by operators to convey their state to
the rest of the cluster.

. Use the `oc get` command to view the state of the DNS Operator:
+
----
$ oc get clusteroperator/dns
NAME      VERSION     AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE
dns       4.1.0-0.11  True        False         False      92m
----
`AVAILABLE`, `PROGRESSING` and `DEGRADED` provide information about the status of
the operator. `AVAILABLE` is `True` when at least 1 pod from the CoreDNS DaemonSet
is reporting an `Available` status condition.
