= About adding RHEL compute nodes to a cluster

In {product-title} {product-version}, you have the option of using {op-system-base-full} machines as compute machines in your cluster if you use a user-provisioned or installer-provisioned infrastructure installation on the `x86_64` architecture. You must use {op-system-first} machines for the control plane machines in your cluster.

If you choose to use {op-system-base} compute machines in your cluster, you are responsible for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance. You must perform system updates, apply patches, and complete all other required tasks.

For installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, you must manually add {op-system-base} compute machines because automatic scaling in installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters adds Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) compute machines by default.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Because removing {product-title} from a machine in the cluster requires destroying the operating system, you must use dedicated hardware for any {op-system-base} machines that you add to the cluster.

* Swap memory is disabled on all {op-system-base} machines that you add to your {product-title} cluster. You cannot enable swap memory on these machines.
====

You must add any {op-system-base} compute machines to the cluster after you initialize the control plane.
