= About adding RHEL compute nodes to a cluster

In {product-title} {product-version}, you have the option of using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machines as compute machines, which are also known as worker machines, in your cluster if you use a user-provisioned infrastructure installation. You must use {op-system-first} machines for the control plane, or master, machines in your cluster.

As with all installations that use user-provisioned infrastructure, if you choose to use RHEL compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because removing {product-title} from a machine in the cluster requires destroying the operating system, you must use dedicated hardware for any RHEL machines that you add to the cluster.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Swap memory is disabled on all RHEL machines that you add to your {product-title} cluster. You cannot enable swap memory on these machines.
====

You must add any RHEL compute machines to the cluster after you initialize the control plane.
