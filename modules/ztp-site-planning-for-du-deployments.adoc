= Site planning considerations for distributed unit deployments

Site planning for distributed units (DU) deployments is complex. The following is an overview of the tasks that you complete before the DU hosts are brought online in the production environment.

* Develop a network model. The network model depends on various factors such as the size of the area of coverage, number of hosts, projected traffic load, DNS, and DHCP requirements.
* Decide how many DU radio nodes are required to provide sufficient coverage and redundancy for your network.
* Develop mechanical and electrical specifications for the DU host hardware.
* Develop a construction plan for individual DU site installations.
* Tune host BIOS settings for production, and deploy the BIOS configuration to the hosts.
* Install the equipment on-site, connect hosts to the network, and apply power.
* Configure on-site switches and routers.
* Perform basic connectivity tests for the host machines.
* Establish production network connectivity, and verify host connections to the network.
* Provision and deploy on-site DU hosts at scale.
* Test and verify on-site operations, performing load and scale testing of the DU hosts before finally bringing the DU infrastructure online in the live production environment.
