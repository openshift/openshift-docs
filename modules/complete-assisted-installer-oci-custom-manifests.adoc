Add the mandatory custom manifests provided by Oracle. For details, see link:https://github.com/dfoster-oracle/oci-openshift/blob/v1.0.0-release-preview/custom_manifests/README.md[Custom Manifests (Oracle documentation).]

.Prerequisites

* You copied the `dynamic_custom_manifest.yml` file from the Terraform stack in {oci-distributed-no-rt}. For details, see "Provisioning {oci} infrastructure for your cluster".

.Procedure

. On the *Custom manifests* page, in the *Folder* field, select `manifests`. This is the {ai-full} folder where you want to save the custom manifest file.

. In the *File name* field, enter a filename, for example, `dynamic_custom_manifest.yml`.

. Paste the contents of the `dynamic_custom_manifest.yml` file that you copied from {oci-distributed-no-rt}:

.. In the *Content* section, click the *Paste content* icon.

.. If you are using Firefox, click *OK* to close the dialog box, and then press *Ctrl+V*. Otherwise, skip this step.

. Click *Next* to save the custom manifest.

. From the *Review and create* page, click *Install cluster* to create your {product-title} cluster on {oci-distributed-no-rt}.

After the cluster installation and initialization operations, the {ai-full} indicates the completion of the cluster installation operation. For more information, see "Completing the installation" section in the {ai-full} for {product-title} document.
