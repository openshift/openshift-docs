= Getting cluster information

[role="_abstract"]
Retrieve the application domain for each of your clusters to identify the necessary connection details. Record these domains because you must use them during the deployment process.

.Prerequisites

* Access to two {product-title} 4.18+ clusters

* Must have `cluster-admin` access on both clusters

* The `oc` CLI is installed

* The `envsubst` variable is available.

.Procedure

* On each cluster, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get dns cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.baseDomain}'
----
+
The following is an example of cluster information:
 * Cluster 1: `ci-ln-abc123.gcp-2.ci.openshift.org` -> Apps domain: `apps.ci-ln-abc123.gcp-2.ci.openshift.org`

 * Cluster 2: `ci-ln-xyz789.aws-4.ci.openshift.org` -> Apps domain: `apps.ci-ln-xyz789.aws-4.ci.openshift.org`
