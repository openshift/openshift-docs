= Making Knative services privately accessible

By default, Knative services are published to a public IP address.
Being published to a public IP address means that Knative services are public applications, and have a publicly accessible URL.

Publicly accessible URLs are accessible from outside of the cluster.
However, developers may need to build back-end services that are only be accessible from inside the cluster, known as _private services_.
// Cluster administrators can configure private services for the cluster so that all services are private by default.
// Need to add additional details about editing the configmap for admins
Developers can label individual services in the cluster with the `serving.knative.dev/visibility=cluster-local` label to make them private.

.Procedure

* Set the visibility for your service by adding the `serving.knative.dev/visibility=cluster-local` label:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label ksvc <service_name> serving.knative.dev/visibility=cluster-local
----

.Verification steps

* Check that the URL for your service is now in the format `\http://<service_name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`, by entering the following command and reviewing the output:
+
[source,termina]
----
$ oc get ksvc
----
+
.Example output
