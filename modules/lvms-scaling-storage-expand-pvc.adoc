= Expanding PVCs

To leverage the new storage after adding additional capacity, you can expand existing persistent volume claims (PVCs) with LVM Storage.

.Prerequisites

* Dynamic provisioning is used.
* The controlling `StorageClass` object has `allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true`.

.Procedure

. Modify the `.spec.resources.requests.storage` field in the desired PVC resource to the new size by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc patch <pvc_name> -n <application_namespace> -p '{ "spec": { "resources": { "requests": { "storage": "<desired_size>" }}}}'
----

. Watch the `status.conditions` field of the PVC to see if the resize has completed. {product-title} adds the `Resizing` condition to the PVC during expansion, which is removed after the expansion completes.
