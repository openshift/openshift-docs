= Troubleshooting Progressive Sync

Use the following guidelines to troubleshoot issues with Progressive Sync.

== Progressive Sync section does not appear

If the **Progressive Sync** section is missing from the Application details:

* Confirm that the application is managed by an `ApplicationSet` with the `RollingSync` strategy.  
* Verify that Progressive Sync is enabled in the Argo CD CR.  
* Inspect the resources by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get applicationsets -n openshift-gitops
$ oc get applications -n openshift-gitops
----

== Application shows Unknown state

If the status of an application is `Unknown`:

* Ensure that the required labels and annotations are applied.
* Verify that the application exists in the same namespace as the Argo CD instance.
* Review the `ApplicationSet` controller logs for error messages.
