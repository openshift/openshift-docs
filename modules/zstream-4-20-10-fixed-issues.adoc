The following issues are fixed for this release:

* Before this update, when a HyperShift `HostedCluster` used external Domain Name Service (DNS) domains and endpoint access with PublicAndPrivate, the `allowedCIDRBlocks` parameters were wrongly applied only to the internal `kube-apiserver`, leaving the control plane Operator in an error state. With this release, the control plane Operator functions correctly and the `LoadBalancerSourceRanges` configuration has been added to the external router `LoadBalancer` service, ensuring that external `kube-apiserver` access is now properly restricted to the specified `allowedCIDRBlocks`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-63509[OCPBUGS-63509])

* Before this update, when domain name service (DNS) pods were deleted and recreated in {product-title} clusters using OVN-Kubernetes networking, stale User Datagram Protocol (UDP) `conntrack` entries could remain on worker nodes. This occurred because the `conntrack` cleanup logic incorrectly used the endpoint port (the port on which the DNS pod listens, typically 5353) instead of the service port (the port clients connect to, 53) when attempting to delete stale entries. With this release, when DNS pods are deleted or updated, the cleanup process correctly uses the service port (53) to match and removes the  stale `conntrack` entries, ensuring DNS resolution continues to work reliably across pod lifecycle events. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-66049[OCPBUGS-66049])

* Before this update, {product-title} 4.16 and later versions failed to respect the timeout `http-keep-alive` setting due to a known upstream HAProxy bug, preventing users from effectively managing connection persistence. This lack of control resulted in inconsistent connection behaviors, where long-lived sessions might be terminated unexpectedly or held open longer than normal. With this release, the `HTTPKeepAliveTimeout` tuning option has been integrated into the `IngressController` API, providing a formal way for customers to configure and enforce this specific timeout. As a result, cluster administrators now possess the granular control necessary to align connection persistence with specific application needs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-66135[OCPBUGS-66135])

* Before this update, changes in RHCOS image layering increased space usage on the rendezvous node’s ephemeral temporary file system to approximately 9.4 GiB during cluster bootstrapping. Because the ephemeral temporary file system is capped at 50% of available RAM, installation failed on hosts with less than 19 GiB of memory due to insufficient space for container images. With this release, the additional data has been moved to a separate temporary file system. As a result, any rendezvous host meeting the minimum RAM requirement for a control plane node now has sufficient capacity to successfully bootstrap a cluster.

* Before this update, when a HyperShift `HostedCluster` used external Domain Name Service (DNS) domains and endpoint access with PublicAndPrivate,  the `allowedCIDRBlocks` parameters were wrongly applied only to the internal `kube-apiserve`, leaving the control plane Operator in an error state. With this release, the control plane Operator functions correctly and the `LoadBalancerSourceRanges` configuration has been added to the external router `LoadBalancer` service, ensuring that external `kube-apiserver` access is now properly restricted to the specified `allowedCIDRBlocks`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-66397[OCPBUGS-66397])

* Before this update, the inventory collection and provisioning process on the Bare Metal platform included network devices using the `cdc_ncm` driver. This caused significant issues because these virtual network interface cards (NICs) often triggered errors or instability during the provisioning phase. With this release, the system has been updated to explicitly ignore any network devices using the `cdc_ncm` driver. As a result, a more stable and reliable deployment process is ensured. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-66934[OCPBUGS-66934])

* Before this update, the *Operand* details page would incorrectly show information using only half of the screen's display area in the OpenShift web console. With this release, the *Operand* details take up the full page width as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-67136[OCPBUGS-67136])

* Before this update, the Baremetal Operator defaulted to x86_64 architecture when no architecture information was available from hardware inspection or the `BareMetalHost` spec. This caused provisioning to fail on ARM-based bare-metal clusters. With this release, the Baremetal Operator now automatically detects and uses the architecture of the running controller, enabling successful bare-metal provisioning on both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures.
