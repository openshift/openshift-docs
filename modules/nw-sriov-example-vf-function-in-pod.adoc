= Example use of a virtual function in a pod

You can run a remote direct memory access (RDMA) or a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) application in a pod with SR-IOV VF attached.

This example shows a pod using a virtual function (VF) in RDMA mode:

.`Pod` spec that uses RDMA mode
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: rdma-app
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: sriov-rdma-mlnx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: testpmd
    image: <RDMA_image>
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    securityContext:
     capabilities:
        add: ["IPC_LOCK"]
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
----

The following example shows a pod with a VF in DPDK mode:

.`Pod` spec that uses DPDK mode
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dpdk-app
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: sriov-dpdk-net
spec:
  containers:
  - name: testpmd
    image: <DPDK_image>
    securityContext:
     capabilities:
        add: ["IPC_LOCK"]
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /dev/hugepages
      name: hugepage
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "2"
        hugepages-1Gi: "4Gi"
      requests:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "2"
        hugepages-1Gi: "4Gi"
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
  volumes:

An optional library is available to aid the application running in a container in gathering network information associated with a pod. This library is called 'app-netutil'. See the library's source code in the link:https://github.com/openshift/app-netutil[`app-netutil` GitHub repo]. 

This library is intended to ease the integration of the SR-IOV VFs in DPDK mode into the container. The library provides both a GO API and a C API, as well as examples of using both languages.

There is also a sample Docker image, 'dpdk-app-centos', which can run one of the following DPDK sample applications based on an environmental variable in the pod-spec: l2fwd, l3wd or testpmd. This Docker image provides an example of integrating the 'app-netutil' into the container image itself. The library can also integrate into an init-container which collects the desired data and passes the data to an existing DPDK workload.
