= Backup and Restore CR issues

You might encounter these common issues with `Backup` and `Restore` custom resources (CRs).

[id="backup-cannot-retrieve-volume_{context}"]
== Backup CR cannot retrieve volume

The `Backup` CR displays the error message, `InvalidVolume.NotFound: The volume ‘vol-xxxx’ does not exist`.

.Cause

The persistent volume (PV) and the snapshot locations are in different regions.

.Solution

. Edit the value of the `spec.snapshotLocations.velero.config.region` key in the `DataProtectionApplication` manifest so that the snapshot location is in the same region as the PV.
. Create a new `Backup` CR.

[id="backup-cr-remains-in-progress_{context}"]
== Backup CR status remains in progress

The status of a `Backup` CR remains in the `InProgress` phase and does not complete.

.Cause

If a backup is interrupted, it cannot be resumed.

.Solution

. Retrieve the details of the `Backup` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n {namespace} exec deployment/velero -c velero -- ./velero \
  backup describe <backup>
----

. Delete the `Backup` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete backup <backup> -n openshift-adp
----
+
You do not need to clean up the backup location because a `Backup` CR in progress has not uploaded  files to object storage.

. Create a new `Backup` CR.

[id="backup-cr-remains-partiallyfailed_{context}"]
== Backup CR status remains in PartiallyFailed

The status of a `Backup` CR without Restic in use remains in the `PartiallyFailed` phase and does not complete. A snapshot of the affiliated PVC is not created.

.Cause

If the backup is created based on the CSI snapshot class, but the label is missing, CSI snapshot plugin fails to create a snapshot. As a result, the `Velero` pod logs an error similar to the following:

[source,text]
----
time="2023-02-17T16:33:13Z" level=error msg="Error backing up item" backup=openshift-adp/user1-backup-check5 error="error executing custom action (groupResource=persistentvolumeclaims, namespace=busy1, name=pvc1-user1): rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to get volumesnapshotclass for storageclass ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd: failed to get volumesnapshotclass for provisioner openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com, ensure that the desired volumesnapshot class has the velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class label" logSource="/remote-source/velero/app/pkg/backup/backup.go:417" name=busybox-79799557b5-vprq
----

.Solution

. Delete the `Backup` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete backup <backup> -n openshift-adp
----

. If required, clean up the stored data on the `BackupStorageLocation` to free up space.

. Apply label `velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class=true` to the `VolumeSnapshotClass` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label volumesnapshotclass/<snapclass_name> velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class=true
----

. Create a new `Backup` CR.
