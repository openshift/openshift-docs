= Manually gathering logs without SSH access to your host(s)

Manually gather logs in situations where `must-gather` or automated collection

to investigate what is happening on your host.

* Your API service is still functional.
* You have system administrator privileges.

.Procedure

. Access `journald` unit logs under `/var/log` by running:
+
----
$ oc adm node-logs --role=master -u kubelet
----

. Access host file paths under `/var/log` by running:
+
----
$ oc adm node-logs --role=master --path=openshift-apiserver
----
