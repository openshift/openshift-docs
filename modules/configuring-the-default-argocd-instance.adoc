= Configuring the default Argo CD instance

Though the Operator creates a default Argo CD instance in the `openshift-gitops` namespace, you must configure it to make it useful for deploying applications and setting cluster configuration:

* Configure Role Based Access Control (RBAC): Argo CD uses its own RBAC configuration. The default permissions configured by the Operator might not be sufficient, depending on the {OCP} cluster groups your user has been assigned to.
* Configure permissions: The Operator configures the default instance with a default set of Kubernetes permissions. However, these permissions are insufficient when deploying applications in the real-time environment. Therefore, ensure to provide additional permissions to this default instance.
