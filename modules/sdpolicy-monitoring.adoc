= Monitoring

[id="cluster-metrics_{context}"]
== Cluster metrics

{product-title} clusters come with an integrated Prometheus/Grafana stack for cluster monitoring including CPU, memory, and network-based metrics. This is accessible through the web console and can also be used to view cluster-level status and capacity/usage through a Grafana dashboard. These metrics also allow for horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU or memory metrics provided by an {product-title} user.

[id="cluster-status-notification_{context}"]
== Cluster status notification

Red Hat communicates the health and status of {product-title} clusters through a combination of a cluster dashboard available in  {OCM}, and email notifications sent to the email address of the contact that originally deployed the cluster.
