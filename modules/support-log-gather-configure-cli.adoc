= Configuring a {support-log-gather} instance

Create a `MustGather` custom resource (CR) from the command-line interface (CLI) to automate the collection of diagnostic data from your cluster. This process also automatically uploads the data to a Red{nbsp}Hat Support case.

:FeatureName: Support Log Gather
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the oc CLI tool.

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have installed {support-log-gather} in your cluster.

* You have a Red{nbsp}Hat Support case ID.

* You have created a Kubernetes secret containing your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials. The secret must contain a username field and a password field.

* You have created a service account.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for the `MustGather` CR, such as `support-log-gather.yaml`, that contains the following basic configuration::
+
.Example `support-log-gather.yaml`
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: managed.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: MustGather
metadata:
  name: example-mg
  namespace: gathers
spec:
  caseID: "12345678"
  caseManagementAccountSecretRef:
    name: case-management-secret
  audit: true
  internalUser: false
  mustGatherTimeout: "30m"
  proxyConfig:
    httpProxy: "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
    httpsProxy: "https://proxy.example.com:8080"
    noProxy: "some-no-proxy.local.host"
  serviceAccountRef:
    name: must-gather-admin
----
+
For more information on the configuration parameters, see "Configuration parameters for {support-log-gather} custom resource".

. Create the `MustGather` object by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc create -f support-log-gather.yaml
----

.Verification

. Verify that the `MustGather` CR was created by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get mustgather
----
+
.Example output
+
[source, terminal]
----
NAME              AGE
example-mg    7s
----

. Verify the status of the pods in the Operator namespace by running the following command.
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----
+
.Example output
+
[source, terminal]
----
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
06f7e4e81edc2337e4bfd4dc0ad01497c03b5bf7f0a5b8dccd5ff88b29bxwgs   0/1     Completed   0          14m
support-log-gather-657fc74d64-2gg2w                               1/1     Running     0          13m
example-mg-gk8m8                                             2/2     Running     0          13s
----
+
A new pod with a name based on the `MustGather` CR must be created. The status of all the pods must be `Running`.

. To monitor the progress of the file upload, view the logs of the upload container in the job pod by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
oc logs -f pod/test-mustgather-gk8m8 -c upload
----
+
When successful, the process must create an archive and upload it to the Red{nbsp}Hat SFTP server for the specified case.
