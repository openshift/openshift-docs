= Quotas and limits on IBM Cloud

The {product-title} cluster uses a number of IBM Cloud components, and the default quotas and limits affect your ability to install {product-title} clusters. If you use certain cluster configurations, deploy your cluster in certain regions, or run multiple clusters from your account, you might need to request additional resources for your IBM Cloud account.

For a comprehensive list of the default IBM Cloud VPC quotas and service limits, see IBM Cloud's documentation for link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-quotas[Quotas and service limits].

[discrete]
== Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Each {product-title} cluster creates its own VPC. The default quota of VPCs per region is 10 and will allow 10 clusters. To have more than 10 clusters, you must increase this quota.

[discrete]
== Application load balancer

By default, each cluster creates three application load balancers (ALBs):

* Internal load balancer for the master API server
* External load balancer for the master API server
* Load balancer for the router

You can create additional `LoadBalancer` service objects to create additional ALBs. The default quota of VPC ALBs are 50 per region. To have more than 50 ALBs, you must increase this quota.

VPC ALBs are supported. Classic ALBs are not supported for IBM Cloud.

[discrete]
== Floating IP address

By default, the installation program distributes control plane and compute machines across all availability zones within a region to provision the cluster in a highly available configuration. In each availability zone, a public gateway is created and requires a separate floating IP address.

The default quota for a floating IP address is 20 addresses per availability zone. The default cluster configuration yields two floating IP addresses:

* One floating IP address for bootstrap in the primary zone. For example, `us-east-1`.
* One floating IP address in each secondary zone. For example, `us-east-2` and `us-east-3`.

[NOTE]
====
The floating IP address for the bootstrap is removed after cluster installation is complete.
====

IBM Cloud can support up to 19 clusters per region in an account. If you plan to have more than 19 default clusters, you must increase this quota.

[discrete]
== Virtual Server Instance (VSI)

By default, a cluster creates VSIs using `bx2-4x16` profiles, which includes the following resources by default:

* 4 vCPUs
* 16 GB RAM
* 100 GB storage

The following nodes are created:

* One `bx2-4x16` bootstrap machine, which is removed after the installation is complete
* Three `bx2-4x16` control plane nodes
* Three `bx2-4x16` compute nodes

For more information, see IBM Cloud's documentation on link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles[supported profiles].

.VSI component quotas and limits
[cols="2,2,4,2",options="header"]
|===
|VSI component |Default IBM Cloud quota |Default cluster configuration |Maximum number of clusters

|vCPU
|200 vCPUs per region
|28 vCPUs, or 24 vCPUs after bootstrap removal
|8 per region

|RAM
|1600 GB per region
|112 GB, or 96 GB after bootstrap removal
|16 per region

|Storage
|18 TB per region
|1050 GB, or 900 GB after bootstrap removal
|19 per region
|===

If you plan to exceed the resources stated in the table, you must increase your IBM Cloud account quota.

[discrete]
== Block Storage Volumes

For each VPC machine, a block storage device is attached for its boot volume. The default cluster configuration creates seven VPC machines, resulting in seven block storage volumes. Additional Kubernetes persistent volume claims (PVCs) of the IBM Cloud storage class create additional block storage volumes. The default quota of VPC block storage volumes are 300 per region. To have more than 300 volumes, you must increase this quota.
