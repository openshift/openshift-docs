= Gathering cluster update status using oc adm upgrade status (Technology Preview)

When updating your cluster, it is useful to understand how your update is progressing. While the `oc adm upgrade` command returns limited information about the status of your update, this release introduces the `oc adm upgrade status` command as a Technology Preview feature. This command decouples status information from the `oc adm upgrade` command and provides specific information regarding a cluster update, including the status of the control plane and worker node updates.

The `oc adm upgrade status` command is read-only and will never alter any state in your cluster. 

:FeatureName: The `oc adm upgrade status` command
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The `oc adm upgrade status` command can be used for clusters from version 4.12 up to the latest supported release. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
While your cluster does not need to be a Technology Preview-enabled cluster, you must enable the `OC_ENABLE_CMD_UPGRADE_STATUS` Technology Preview environment variable, otherwise the {oc-first} will not recognize the command and you will not be able to use the feature. 
====

.Procedure 

. Set the `OC_ENABLE_CMD_UPGRADE_STATUS` environmental variable to `true` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export OC_ENABLE_CMD_UPGRADE_STATUS=true
----
. Run the `oc adm upgrade status` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade status
----
+
.Example output for an update progressing successfully
