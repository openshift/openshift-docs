= Advertising an IP address pool from a subset of nodes

To advertise an IP address from an IP addresses pool, from a specific set of nodes only, use the `.spec.nodeSelector` specification in the BGPAdvertisement custom resource. This specification associates a pool of IP addresses with a set of nodes in the cluster. This is useful when you have nodes on different subnets in a cluster and you want to advertise an IP addresses from an address pool from a specific subnet, for example a public-facing subnet only.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create an IP address pool by using a custom resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: pool1
spec:
  addresses:
    - 4.4.4.100-4.4.4.200
    - 2001:100:4::200-2001:100:4::400
----

. Control which nodes in the cluster the IP address from `pool1` advertises from by defining the `.spec.nodeSelector` value in the BGPAdvertisement custom resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: BGPAdvertisement
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
  - pool1
  nodeSelector:
  - matchLabels:
      kubernetes.io/hostname: NodeA
  - matchLabels:
      kubernetes.io/hostname: NodeB
----

In this example, the IP address from `pool1` advertises from `NodeA` and `NodeB` only.
