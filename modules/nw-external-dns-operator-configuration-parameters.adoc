= External DNS Operator configuration parameters

The External DNS Operator includes the following configuration parameters:

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`spec`
|Enables the type of a cloud provider.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  provider:
    type: AWS <1>
    aws:
      credentials:
        name: aws-access-key <2>
----
<1> Defines available options such as AWS, GCP and Azure.
<2> Defines a name of the `secret` which contains credentials for your cloud provider.

|`zones`
|Enables you to specify DNS zones by their domains. If you do not specify zones, `ExternalDNS` discovers all the zones present in your cloud provider account.

[source,yaml]
----
zones:
- "myzoneid" <1>
----

<1> Specifies the IDs of DNS zones.

|`domains`
|Enables you to specify AWS zones by their domains. If you do not specify domains, `ExternalDNS` discovers all the zones present in your cloud provider account.

[source,yaml]
----
domains:
- filterType: Include <1>
  matchType: Exact <2>
  name: "myzonedomain1.com" <3>
- filterType: Include
  matchType: Pattern <4>
  pattern: ".*\\.otherzonedomain\\.com" <5>
----
<1> Instructs `ExternalDNS` to include the domain specified.
<2> Instructs `ExtrnalDNS` that the domain matching has to be exact as opposed to regular expression match.
<3> Defines the exact domain name by which `ExternalDNS` filters.
<4> Sets `regex-domain-filter` flag in `ExternalDNS`. You can limit possible domains by using a Regex filter.
<5> Defines the regex pattern to be used by `ExternalDNS` to filter the domains of the target zones.

|`source`
|Enables you to specify the source for the DNS records, `Service` or `Route`.

[source,yaml]
----
source: <1>
  type: Service <2>
  service:
    serviceType:<3>
      - LoadBalancer
      - ClusterIP
  labelFilter: <4>
    matchLabels:
      external-dns.mydomain.org/publish: "yes"
  hostnameAnnotation: "Allow" <5>
  fqdnTemplate:
  - "{{.Name}}.myzonedomain.com" <6>
----
<1> Defines the settings for the source of DNS records.
<2> The `ExternalDNS` uses `Service` type as source for creating dns records.
<3> Sets `service-type-filter` flag in `ExternalDNS`. The `serviceType` contains the following fields:
* `default`: `LoadBalancer`
* `expected`: `ClusterIP`
* `NodePort`
* `LoadBalancer`
* `ExternalName`
<4> Ensures that the controller considers only those resources which matches with label filter.
<5> The default value for `hostnameAnnotation` is `Ignore` which instructs `ExternalDNS` to generate DNS records using the templates specified in the field `fqdnTemplates`. When the value is `Allow` the DNS records get generated based on the value specified in the `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname` annotation.
<6> External DNS Operator uses a string to generate DNS names from sources that don't define a hostname, or to add a hostname suffix when paired with the fake source.

[source,yaml]
----
source:
  type: OpenShiftRoute <1>
  openshiftRouteOptions:
    routerName: default <2>
    labelFilter:
      matchLabels:
        external-dns.mydomain.org/publish: "yes"
----

<1> ExternalDNS` uses type `route` as source for creating dns records.
<2> If the source is `OpenShiftRoute`, then you can pass the Ingress Controller name. The `ExternalDNS` uses canonical name of Ingress Controller as the target for CNAME record.
