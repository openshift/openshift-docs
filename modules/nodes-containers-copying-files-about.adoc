= Understanding how to copy files

The `oc rsync` command, or remote sync, is a useful tool for copying database archives to and from your pods for backup and restore purposes.
You can also use `oc rsync` to copy source code changes into a running pod for development debugging, when the running pod supports hot reload of source files.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsync <source> <destination> [-c <container>]
----

== Requirements

Specifying the Copy Source::
The source argument of the `oc rsync` command must point to either a local
directory or a pod directory. Individual files are not supported.

When specifying a pod directory the directory name must be prefixed with the pod
name:

[source,terminal]
----
<pod name>:<dir>
----

If the directory name ends in a path separator (`/`), only the contents of the directory are copied to the destination. Otherwise, the
directory and its contents are copied to the destination.

Specifying the Copy Destination::
The destination argument of the `oc rsync` command must point to a directory. If
the directory does not exist, but `rsync` is used for copy, the directory is
created for you.

Deleting Files at the Destination::
The `--delete` flag may be used to delete any files in the remote directory that
are not in the local directory.

Continuous Syncing on File Change::
Using the `--watch` option causes the command to monitor the source path for any
file system changes, and synchronizes changes when they occur. With this
argument, the command runs forever.

Synchronization occurs after short quiet periods to ensure a
rapidly changing file system does not result in continuous synchronization
calls.

When using the `--watch` option, the behavior is effectively the same as
manually invoking `oc rsync` repeatedly, including any arguments normally passed
to `oc rsync`. Therefore, you can control the behavior via the same flags used
with manual invocations of `oc rsync`, such as `--delete`.
