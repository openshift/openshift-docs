= Advanced ComplianceScan Object
The Compliance Operator includes options for advanced users for debugging or integrating with existing tooling. While it is recommended that you not create a `ComplianceScan` object directly, you can instead manage it using a `ComplianceSuite` object.

.Example Advanced `ComplianceScan` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ComplianceScan
metadata:
  name: <name of the scan>
spec:
  scanType: Node <1>
  profile: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_moderate <2>
  content: ssg-ocp4-ds.xml
  contentImage: registry.redhat.io/compliance/openshift-compliance-content-rhel8@sha256:45dc... <3>
  rule: "xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_no_netrc_files" <4>
  nodeSelector: <5>
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
status:
  phase: DONE <6>
  result: NON-COMPLIANT <7>
----

<1> Specify either `Node` or `Platform`. Node profiles scan the cluster nodes and platform profiles scan the Kubernetes platform.
<2> Specify the XCCDF identifier of the profile that you want to run.
<3> Specify the container image that encapsulates the profile files.
<4> It is optional. Specify the scan to run a single rule. This rule has to be identified with the XCCDF ID, and has to belong to the specified profile.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you skip the `rule` parameter, then scan runs for all the available rules of the specified profile.
====
<5> If you are on the {product-title} and wants to generate a remediation, then nodeSelector label has to match the `MachineConfigPool` label.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify `nodeSelector` parameter or match the `MachineConfig` label, scan will still run, but it will not create remediation.
====
<6> Indicates the current phase of the scan.
<7> Indicates the verdict of the scan.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you delete a `ComplianceSuite` object, then all the associated scans get deleted.
====

When the scan is complete, it generates the result as Custom Resources of the `ComplianceCheckResult` object. However, the raw results are available in ARF format. These results are stored in a Persistent Volume (PV), which has a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) associated with the name of the scan.
You can programmatically fetch the `ComplianceScans` events. To generate events for the suite, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
oc get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=ComplianceScan,involvedObject.name=<name of the suite>
