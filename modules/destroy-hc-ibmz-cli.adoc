= Destroying a hosted cluster on x86 bare metal with {ibm-z-title} compute nodes

You can use the command-line interface (CLI) to destroy a hosted cluster on `x86` bare metal with {ibm-z-title} compute nodes and its managed cluster.

.Procedure

. Scale the `NodePool` object to `0` nodes by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> scale nodepool <nodepool_name> --replicas 0
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the compute nodes are not detached from the hosted cluster or are stuck in the `Notready` state, delete the compute nodes manually by running the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig <hosted_cluster_name>.kubeconfig delete node <compute_node_name>
----
====

. Verify the status of the compute nodes by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig <hosted_cluster_name>.kubeconfig get nodes
----
+
After the compute nodes are detached from the hosted cluster, the status of the agents is changed to `auto-assign`.

. Delete the agents from the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <hosted_control_plane_namespace> delete agent <agent_name>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can delete the virtual machines that you created as agents after you delete the agents from the cluster.
====

. Destroy the hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ hcp destroy cluster agent --name <hosted_cluster_name> --namespace <hosted_cluster_namespace>
----
