= Tang server key backup

The Tang server, by default, stores its keys in the `/usr/libexec/tangd-keygen` directory.
Back up the contents of this directory to enable recovery in the event of the loss of the Tang server.
The keys are sensitive and since they are able to perform the boot disk decryption of all hosts that have used them,
the keys must be protected accordingly.
