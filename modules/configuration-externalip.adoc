= Configuration for ExternalIP

Use of an external IP address in {product-title} is governed by the following parameters in the `Network.config.openshift.io` custom resource (CR) that is named `cluster`:

* `spec.externalIP.autoAssignCIDRs` defines an IP address block used by the load balancer when choosing an external IP address for the service. {product-title} supports only a single IP address block for automatic assignment. This configuration requires less steps than manually assigning ExternalIPs to services, which requires managing the port space of a limited number of shared IP addresses. If you enable automatic assignment, a `Service` object with `spec.type=LoadBalancer` is allocated an external IP address.

* `spec.externalIP.policy` defines the permissible IP address blocks when manually specifying an IP address. {product-title} does not apply policy rules to IP address blocks that you defined in the `spec.externalIP.autoAssignCIDRs` parameter.

If routed correctly, external traffic from the configured external IP address block can reach service endpoints through any TCP or UDP port that the service exposes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As a cluster administrator, you must configure routing to externalIPs. You must also ensure that the IP address block you assign terminates at one or more nodes in your cluster. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#external-ips[Kubernetes External IPs].
====

{product-title} supports both the automatic and manual assignment of IP addresses, where each address is guaranteed to be assigned to a maximum of one service. This configuration ensures that each service can expose its chosen ports regardless of the ports exposed by other services.

[NOTE]
====
To use IP address blocks defined by `autoAssignCIDRs` in {product-title}, you must configure the necessary IP address assignment and routing for your host network.

The following YAML describes a service with an external IP address configured:
