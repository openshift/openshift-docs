== General troubleshooting

Issue::
You want to troubleshoot issues with the Self Node Remediation Operator.

Resolution::
Check the Operator logs.

[id="checking-daemon-set_{context}"]
== Checking the daemon set
Issue:: The Self Node Remediation Operator is installed but the daemon set is not available.

Resolution:: Check the Operator logs for errors or warnings.

[id="unsuccessful_remediation{context}"]
== Unsuccessful remediation
Issue:: An unhealthy node was not remediated.

Resolution:: Verify that the `SelfNodeRemediation` CR was created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get snr -A
----
+
If the `MachineHealthCheck` controller did not create the `SelfNodeRemediation` CR when the node turned unhealthy, check the logs of the `MachineHealthCheck` controller. Additionally, ensure that the `MachineHealthCheck` CR includes the required specification to use the remediation template.
+
If the `SelfNodeRemediation` CR was created, ensure that its name matches the unhealthy node or the machine object.

[id="daemon-set-exists_{context}"]
== Daemon set and other Self Node Remediation Operator resources exist even after uninstalling the Operator
Issue:: The Self Node Remediation Operator resources, such as the daemon set, configuration CR, and the remediation template CR, exist even after after uninstalling the Operator.

Resolution:: To remove the Self Node Remediation Operator resources, delete the resources by running the following commands for each resource type:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete ds <self-node-remediation-ds> -n <namespace>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete snrc <self-node-remediation-config> -n <namespace>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete snrt <self-node-remediation-template> -n <namespace>
