= AWS Outposts on {product-title} requirements and limitations

You can manage the resources on your Outpost similarly to those on a cloud-based AWS cluster if you configure your {product-title} cluster to accommodate the following requirements and limitations:

* To extend an {product-title} cluster on AWS into an Outpost, you must have installed the cluster into an existing VPC.

* {product-title} clusters on AWS include the `gp3-csi` and `gp2-csi` storage classes.
These classes correspond to Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) gp3 and gp2 volumes.
{product-title} clusters use the `gp3-csi` storage class by default, but AWS Outposts does not support EBS gp3 volumes.

* An Outpost is an extension of an availability zone associated with an AWS region and has a dedicated subnet.
Edge compute machines deployed into an Outpost must use the Outpost availability zone and subnet.

* AWS Outposts does not support AWS Network Load Balancers or Classic Load Balancers.
To manages Ingress objects for your edge compute resources, you must install the AWS Load Balancer Operator so that you can use AWS Application Load Balancers in the AWS Outposts environment.
If your cluster contains both edge and cloud-based compute instances that share workloads, additional configuration is required.

* To create a volume in the Outpost, the CSI driver requires the Outpost Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
The driver uses the topology keys stored on the `CSINode` objects to determine the Outpost ARN.
To ensure that the driver uses the correct topology values, you must set the volume binding mode to `WaitForConsumer` and avoid setting allowed topologies on any new storage classes that you create.

* When you extend an AWS VPC cluster into an Outpost, you have two types of compute resources.
The Outpost has edge compute nodes, while the VPC has cloud-based compute nodes.
The cloud-based AWS Elastic Block volume cannot attach to Outpost edge compute nodes, and the Outpost volumes cannot attach to cloud-based compute nodes.
+
As a result, you cannot use CSI snapshots to migrate applications that use persistent storage from cloud-based compute nodes to edge compute nodes or directly use the original persistent volume.
To migrate persistent storage data for applications, you must perform a manual backup and restore operation.
