= About PTP and clock synchronization error events

Cloud native applications such as virtual RAN (vRAN) require access to notifications about hardware timing events that are critical to the functioning of the overall network.
PTP clock synchronization errors can negatively affect the performance and reliability of your low-latency application, for example, a vRAN application running in a distributed unit (DU).

Loss of PTP synchronization is a critical error for a RAN network.
If synchronization is lost on a node, the radio might be shut down and the network Over the Air (OTA) traffic might be shifted to another node in the wireless network.
Fast event notifications mitigate against workload errors by allowing cluster nodes to communicate PTP clock sync status to the vRAN application running in the DU.

Event notifications are available to vRAN applications running on the same DU node.
A publish/subscribe REST API passes events notifications to the messaging bus.
Publish/subscribe messaging, or pub-sub messaging, is an asynchronous service-to-service communication architecture where any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic.

The PTP Operator generates fast event notifications for every PTP-capable network interface. 
The consumer application can subscribe to PTP events by using the PTP events REST API {ptp-events-rest-api}.

[NOTE]
====
PTP fast event notifications are available for network interfaces configured to use PTP ordinary clocks, PTP grandmaster clocks, or PTP boundary clocks.
