= Creating machines on Ephemeral OS disks by using compute machine sets

You can launch machines on Ephemeral OS disks on Azure by editing your compute machine set YAML file.

.Prerequisites

* Have an existing Microsoft Azure cluster.

.Procedure

. Edit the custom resource (CR) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machine-set-name>
----
+
where `<machine-set-name>` is the compute machine set that you want to provision machines on Ephemeral OS disks.

. Add the following to the `providerSpec` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  value:
    ...
    osDisk:
       ...
       diskSettings: <1>
         ephemeralStorageLocation: Local <1>
       cachingType: ReadOnly <1>
       managedDisk:
         storageAccountType: Standard_LRS <2>
       ...
----
+
<1> These lines enable the use of Ephemeral OS disks.
<2> Ephemeral OS disks are only supported for VMs or scale set instances that use the Standard LRS storage account type.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The implementation of Ephemeral OS disk support in {product-title} only supports the `CacheDisk` placement type. Do not change the `placement` configuration setting.
====

. Create a compute machine set using the updated configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <machine-set-config>.yaml
----

.Verification

* On the Microsoft Azure portal, review the *Overview* page for a machine deployed by the compute machine set, and verify that the `Ephemeral OS disk` field is set to `OS cache placement`.
