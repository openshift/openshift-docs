= External components

{rh-rhacscs-first} interacts with the following external components:

* *Third-party systems*: You can integrate {product-title-short} with other systems such as CI/CD pipelines, event management (SIEM) systems, logging, email, and more.
* `*roxctl*`: `roxctl` is a command-line interface (CLI) for running commands on {product-title-short}.
* *Image registries*: You can integrate {product-title-short} with various image registries and use {product-title-short} to scan and view images.
{product-title-short} automatically configures registry integrations for active images by using the image pull secrets discovered in secured clusters.
However, for scanning inactive images, you must manually configure registry integrations.
* `*definitions.stackrox.io*`: {product-title-short} aggregates the data from various vulnerability feeds at the `definitions.stackrox.io` endpoint and passes this information to Central.
The feeds include general, National Vulnerability Database (NVD) data, and distribution-specific data, such as Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu.
* `*collector-modules.stackrox.io*`: Central reaches out to `collector-modules.stackrox.io` to obtain supported kernel modules and passes on these modules to Collector.
