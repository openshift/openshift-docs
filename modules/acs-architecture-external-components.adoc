In addition to the primary services, {product-title} also interacts with other entities to provide enhanced security for your clusters.

Figure 3 depicts the {product-title-short} architecture for {ocp}, but you should note the following exceptions:

- In {product-title-short} version 3.69 and older, Scanner services are only installed once with the centralized service.
- In other Kubernetes based environments, Scanner services are only installed once with the centralized service.

{product-title} uses the following external components:

* *Third-party systems*: You can integrate {product-title-short} with other systems such as CI/CD pipelines, event management (SIEM) systems, logging, email, and more.
* *Image registries*: You can integrate {product-title-short} with various image registries and use {product-title-short} to scan and view active images. By using the image pull secrets discovered in secured clusters, {product-title-short} automatically configures these registry integrations.
* *definitions.stackrox.io*: {product-title-short} aggregates the data from various vulnerability feeds at the `definitions.stackrox.io` endpoint and then passes this information to Central. The feeds include general, NVD, and distribution-specific, such as Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu.
* *collector-modules.stackrox.io*: Central reaches out to `collector-modules.stackrox.io` to obtain supported kernel modules and passes on these modules to Sensor and Collector.
