== WMCO supported installation method

The WMCO fully supports installing Windows nodes into installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters. This is the preferred {product-title} installation method.

For user-provisioned infrastructure clusters, the WMCO supports installing Windows nodes only into a UPI cluster installed with the `platform: none` field set in the `install-config.yaml` file (bare metal or provider-agnostic) and only for the xref:../../windows_containers/byoh-windows-instance.adoc#byoh-windows-instance[BYOH (Bring Your Own Host)] use case. User-provisioned infrastructure is not supported for any other platform.

== Supported networking

Hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes is the only supported networking configuration. See the additional resources below for more information on this functionality. The following tables outline the type of networking configuration and Windows Server versions to use based on your platform. You must specify the network configuration when you install the cluster. 

[NOTE]
====
* The WMCO does not support OVN-Kubernetes without hybrid networking or OpenShift SDN.
* Dual NIC is not supported on WMCO-managed Windows instances.
