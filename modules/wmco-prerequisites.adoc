Because link:https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/containers/important-update-deprecation-of-docker-virtual-machine-images/ba-p/3646272[Microsoft has stopped publishing Windows Server 2019 images with
Docker], Red Hat no longer supports Windows Azure for WMCO releases earlier than version 6.0.0. For WMCO 5.y.z and earlier, Windows Server 2019 images must have Docker pre-installed. WMCO 6.0.0 and later uses containerd as the runtime. You can upgrade to {product-title} 4.11, which uses WMCO 6.0.0.

== Supported networking

Hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes is the only supported networking configuration. See the additional resources below for more information on this functionality. The following tables outline the type of networking configuration and Windows Server versions to use based on your platform. You must specify the network configuration when you install the cluster. Be aware that OpenShift SDN networking is the default network for {product-title} clusters. However, OpenShift SDN is not supported by WMCO.
