[id="images-update-global-pull-secret_{context}"]
= Updating the global cluster pull secret

You can update the global pull secret for your cluster.

[WARNING]
====
Cluster resources must adjust to the new pull secret, which can temporarily limit the usability of the cluster.
====

Updating the global pull secret causes the Machine Config Operator to drain the nodes, apply the change, and uncordon the nodes.

[NOTE]
====
As of {product-title} 4.7, changes to the global pull secret no longer trigger a reboot.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have a new or modified pull secret file to upload.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

* Enter the following command to update the global pull secret for your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<pull-secret-location> <1>
----
<1> Provide the path to the new pull secret file.

This update is rolled out to all nodes, which can take some time depending on the size of your cluster. During this time, nodes are drained and pods are rescheduled on the remaining nodes.

//Also referred to as the cluster-wide pull secret.
