[id="images-update-global-pull-secret_{context}"]
= Updating the global cluster pull secret

You can update the global pull secret for your cluster by either replacing the current pull secret or appending a new pull secret.

If you are transferring your cluster to another owner, you must first initiate the transfer in link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/[Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager], then update the pull secret on the cluster. Updating a cluster's pull secret without also initiating the transfer in OpenShift Cluster Manager causes the cluster to stop reporting Telemetry metrics in OpenShift Cluster Manager. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_cluster_manager/2021/html/managing_clusters/assembly-managing-clusters#transferring-cluster-ownership_assembly-managing-clusters[Transferring cluster ownership] in _Managing Clusters_ for instructions.

[WARNING]
====
Cluster resources must adjust to the new pull secret, which can temporarily limit the usability of the cluster.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure
. Optional: To append a new pull secret to the existing pull secret, complete the following steps:

.. Enter the following command to download the pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --template='{{index .data ".dockerconfigjson" | base64decode}}' ><pull_secret_location> <1>
----
<1> Provide the path to the pull secret file.

.. Enter the following command to add the new pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc registry login --registry="<registry>" \ <1>
--auth-basic="<username>:<password>" \ <2>
--to=<pull_secret_location> <3>
----
<1> Provide the new registry. You can include multiple repositories within the same registry, for example: `--registry="<registry/my-namespace/my-repository>"`. 
<2> Provide the credentials of the new registry.
<3> Provide the path to the pull secret file.
+
Alternatively, you can perform a manual update to the pull secret file.

. Enter the following command to update the global pull secret for your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<pull_secret_location> <1>
----
<1> Provide the path to the new pull secret file.
+
This update is rolled out to all nodes, which can take some time depending on the size of your cluster. 
+
[NOTE]
====
As of {product-title} 4.7.4, changes to the global pull secret no longer trigger a node drain or reboot.
====
//Also referred to as the cluster-wide pull secret.
