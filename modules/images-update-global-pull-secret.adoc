= Updating the global cluster pull secret

You can update the global pull secret for your cluster by either replacing the current pull secret or appending a new pull secret.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To transfer your cluster to another owner, you must first initiate the transfer in link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/[Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager], and then update the pull secret on the cluster. Updating a cluster's pull secret without initiating the transfer in OpenShift Cluster Manager causes the cluster to stop reporting Telemetry metrics in OpenShift Cluster Manager. 

For more information link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_cluster_manager/2021/html/managing_clusters/assembly-managing-clusters#transferring-cluster-ownership_assembly-managing-clusters[about transferring cluster ownership], see "Transferring cluster ownership" in the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager documentation. 
====

[WARNING]
====
Cluster resources must adjust to the new pull secret, which can temporarily limit the usability of the cluster.
====

[WARNING]
====
Updating the global pull secret will cause node reboots while the Machine Config Operator (MCO) syncs the changes.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure
. Optional: To append a new pull secret to the existing pull secret, complete the following steps:

.. Enter the following command to download the pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --template='{{index .data ".dockerconfigjson" | base64decode}}' ><pull_secret_location> <1>
----
<1> Provide the path to the pull secret file.

.. Enter the following command to add the new pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc registry login --registry="<registry>" \ <1>
--auth-basic="<username>:<password>" \ <2>
--to=<pull_secret_location> <3>
----
<1> Provide the new registry.
<2> Provide the credentials of the new registry.
<3> Provide the path to the pull secret file.
+
Alternatively, you can perform a manual update to the pull secret file.

. Enter the following command to update the global pull secret for your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<pull_secret_location> <1>
----
<1> Provide the path to the new pull secret file.

This update is rolled out to all nodes, which can take some time depending on the size of your cluster. During this time, nodes are drained and pods are rescheduled on the remaining nodes.

//Also referred to as the cluster-wide pull secret.
