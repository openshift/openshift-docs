= Infrastructure considerations for MetalLB

[role="_abstract"]
You can use MetalLB for bare metal and on-premise installations that lack a native load balancer.

In addition to bare-metal installations, installations of {product-title} on some infrastructures might not include a native load-balancer capability. For example, the following infrastructures can benefit from adding the MetalLB Operator:

* Bare metal

* VMware vSphere

* {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}

* {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} for {op-system-base-full} KVM

* {ibm-power-name}
