= Infrastructure considerations for MetalLB

MetalLB is primarily useful for on-premise, bare metal installations because these installations do not include a native load-balancer capability.
In addition to bare metal installations, installations of {product-title} on some infrastructures might not include a native load-balancer capability.
For example, the following infrastructures can benefit from adding the MetalLB Operator:

* Bare metal

* VMware vSphere

* {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}

* {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} for {op-system-base-full} KVM

* {ibm-power-name}
