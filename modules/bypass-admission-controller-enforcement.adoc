= Bypassing admission controller enforcement

[role="_abstract"]
To bypass the admission controller, add the `admission.stackrox.io/break-glass` annotation to your configuration YAML.
Bypassing the admission controller triggers a policy violation which includes deployment details.
Red{nbsp}Hat recommends providing an issue-tracker link or some other reference as the value of this annotation so that others can understand why you bypassed the admission controller.
