= Collecting low latency tuning debugging data for Red Hat Support

When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.

The `must-gather` tool enables you to collect diagnostic information about your {product-title} cluster, including node tuning, NUMA topology, and other information needed to debug issues with low latency setup.

For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both {product-title} and low latency tuning.

== About the must-gather tool

The `oc adm must-gather` CLI command collects the information from your cluster that is most likely needed for debugging issues, such as:

* Resource definitions
* Audit logs
* Service logs

You can specify one or more images when you run the command by including the `--image` argument. When you specify an image, the tool collects data related to that feature or product. When you run `oc adm must-gather`, a new pod is created on the cluster. The data is collected on that pod and saved in a new directory that starts with `must-gather.local`. This directory is created in your current working directory.

== About collecting low latency tuning data

Use the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command to collect information about your cluster, including features and objects associated with low latency tuning, including:

* The Performance Addon Operator namespaces and child objects.
* `MachineConfigPool` and associated `MachineConfig` objects.
* The Node Tuning Operator and associated Tuned objects.
* Linux Kernel command line options.
* CPU and NUMA topology
* Basic PCI device information and NUMA locality.

To collect Performance Addon Operator debugging information with `must-gather`, you must specify the Performance Addon Operator `must-gather` image:

[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
--image=registry.redhat.io/openshift4/performance-addon-operator-must-gather-rhel8:v{product-version}.
----

[id="cnf-about-gathering-data_{context}"]
== Gathering data about specific features

You can gather debugging information about specific features by using the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command with the `--image` or `--image-stream` argument. The `must-gather` tool supports multiple images, so you can gather data about more than one feature by running a single command.

[NOTE]
====
To collect the default `must-gather` data in addition to specific feature data, add the `--image-stream=openshift/must-gather` argument.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* The {product-title} CLI (oc) installed.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.

. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command with one or more `--image` or `--image-stream` arguments. For example, the following command gathers both the default cluster data and information specific to the Performance Addon Operator:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather \
 --image-stream=openshift/must-gather \ <1>

 --image=registry.redhat.io/openshift4/performance-addon-operator-must-gather-rhel8:v{product-version} <2>
----
+
<1> The default {product-title} `must-gather` image.
<2> The `must-gather` image for low latency tuning diagnostics.

. Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory that was created in your working directory. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 $ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather.local.5421342344627712289/ <1>
----
+
<1> Replace `must-gather-local.5421342344627712289/` with the actual directory name.

. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].
