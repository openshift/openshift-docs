[id="getting-started-cli-deploying-python-app_{context}"]
= Deploying a Python application

The following procedure deploys a back-end service for the `parksmap` application. The Python application performs 2D geo-spatial queries against a MongoDB database to locate and return map coordinates of all national parks in the world.

The deployed back-end service is `nationalparks`.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have a deployed image.

.Procedure

. To create a new Python application, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app python~https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/nationalparks-py.git --name nationalparks -l 'app=national-parks-app,component=nationalparks,role=backend,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=national-parks-app,app.kubernetes.io/name=python' --allow-missing-images=true

    Python 3.9
    ----------
    Python 3.9 available as container is a base platform for building and running various Python 3.9 applications and frameworks. Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/nationalparks-py.git will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "nationalparks:latest"
      * Use 'oc start-build' to trigger a new build
