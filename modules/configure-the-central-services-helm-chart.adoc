= Configure the central-services Helm chart

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure the Helm chart parameters to customize the {rh-rhacs-first} installation for your specific environment. You must create separate configuration files to securely isolate sensitive credentials from standard settings for components like Central and Scanner. Accurately defining these values ensures successful service authentication and proper resource allocation within your cluster.

Create the following files for configuring the Helm chart for installing {product-title}:

* Public configuration file `values-public.yaml`: Use this file to save all non-sensitive configuration options.
* Private configuration file `values-private.yaml`: Use this file to save all sensitive configuration options. Ensure that you store this file securely.
//TODO: Add links to sample configuration files.
