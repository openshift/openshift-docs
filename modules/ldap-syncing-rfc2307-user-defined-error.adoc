[id="ldap-syncing-rfc2307-user-defined-error_{context}"]
= Syncing groups using RFC 2307 with user-defined error tolerances

By default, if the groups being synced contain members whose entries are outside
of the scope defined in the member query, the group sync fails with an error:

----
Error determining LDAP group membership for "<group>": membership lookup for user "<user>" in group "<group>" failed because of "search for entry with dn="<user-dn>" would search outside of the base dn specified (dn="<base-dn>")".
----

This often indicates a misconfigured `baseDN` in the `usersQuery` field.
However, in cases where the `baseDN` intentionally does not contain some of the
members of the group, setting `tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors: true` allows
the group sync to continue. Out of scope members will be ignored.

Similarly, when the group sync process fails to locate a member for a group, it
fails outright with errors:

----
Error determining LDAP group membership for "<group>": membership lookup for user "<user>" in group "<group>" failed because of "search for entry with base dn="<user-dn>" refers to a non-existent entry".
Error determining LDAP group membership for "<group>": membership lookup for user "<user>" in group "<group>" failed because of "search for entry with base dn="<user-dn>" and filter "<filter>" did not return any results".
----

This often indicates a misconfigured `usersQuery` field. However, in cases
where the group contains member entries that are known to be missing, setting
`tolerateMemberNotFoundErrors: true` allows the group sync to continue.
Problematic members will be ignored.

[WARNING]
====
Enabling error tolerances for the LDAP group sync causes the sync process to
ignore problematic member entries. If the LDAP group sync is not configured
correctly, this could result in synced {product-title} groups missing members.

<2> A member that may exist, but is not under the `baseDN` in the
user query for the sync job.

In order to tolerate the errors in the above example, the following additions to
your sync configuration file must be made:

.LDAP sync configuration that uses RFC 2307 schema tolerating errors: *_rfc2307_config_tolerating.yaml_*
[source,yaml]
----
kind: LDAPSyncConfig
apiVersion: v1
url: ldap://LDAP_SERVICE_IP:389
rfc2307:
    groupsQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
    groupUIDAttribute: dn
    groupNameAttributes: [ cn ]
    groupMembershipAttributes: [ member ]
    usersQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never

    tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors: true <3>
----
<1> The attribute that uniquely identifies a user on the LDAP server. You
cannot specify `usersQuery` filters when using DN for userUIDAttribute. For
fine-grained  filtering, use the whitelist / blacklist method.
<2> When `true`, the sync job tolerates groups for which some members were not
found, and members whose LDAP entries are not found are ignored. The
default behavior for the sync job is to fail if a member of a group is not
found.
<3> When `true`, the sync job tolerates groups for which some members are outside
the user scope given in the `usersQuery` base DN, and members outside the member
query scope are ignored. The default behavior for the sync job is to fail if a
member of a group is out of scope.

.Prerequisites

* Create the configuration file.

.Procedure

. Run the sync with the *_rfc2307_config_tolerating.yaml_* file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm groups sync --sync-config=rfc2307_config_tolerating.yaml --confirm
----
+
{product-title} creates the following group record as a result of the above sync
operation:
+
.{product-title} group created by using the *_rfc2307_config.yaml_* file
