= Allowing pods to reference images across projects

[role="_abstract"]
To allow pods in one {product-title} project to reference images from another project, you can bind a service account to the `system:image-puller` role in the target project. Use the `oc policy add-role-to-user` or `oc policy add-role-to-group` command to grant cross-project image access.

[NOTE]
====
When you create a pod service account or a namespace, wait until the service account is provisioned with a Docker pull secret. If you create a pod before its service account is fully provisioned, the pod fails to access the {product-registry}.

.Procedure

. Allow pods in `project-a` to reference images in `project-b` by entering the follow command. In this example, the service account `default` in `project-a` is bound to the `system:image-puller` role in `project-b`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user \
    system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:project-a:default \
    --namespace=project-b
----

. Optional: Allow access for any service account in `project-a` by using the `add-role-to-group` flag. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group \
    system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:project-a \
    --namespace=project-b
----
