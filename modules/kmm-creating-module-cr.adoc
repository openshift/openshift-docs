= The Module custom resource definition

The `Module` custom resource definition (CRD) represents a kernel module that can be loaded on all or select nodes in the cluster, through a kmod image. A `Module` custom resource (CR) specifies one or more kernel versions with which it is compatible, and a node selector.

The compatible versions for a `Module` resource are listed under `.spec.moduleLoader.container.kernelMappings`. A kernel mapping can either match a `literal` version, or use `regexp` to match many of them at the same time.

The reconciliation loop for the `Module` resource runs the following steps:

. List all nodes matching `.spec.selector`.
. Build a set of all kernel versions running on those nodes.
. For each kernel version:
 .. Go through `.spec.moduleLoader.container.kernelMappings` and find the appropriate container image name.
 If the kernel mapping has `build` or `sign` defined and the container image does not already exist, run the build, the signing pod, or both, as needed.
 .. Create a worker pod to pull the container image determined in the previous step and run `modprobe`.
 .. If `.spec.devicePlugin` is defined, create a device plugin daemon set using the configuration specified under `.spec.devicePlugin.container`.
. Run `garbage-collect` on:
 .. Obsolete device plugin `DaemonSets` that do not target any node.
 .. Successful build pods.
 .. Successful signing pods.
