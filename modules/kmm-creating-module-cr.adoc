= The Module custom resource definition

The `Module` custom resource definition (CRD) represents a kernel module that can be loaded on all or select nodes in the cluster, through a module loader image.
A `Module` custom resource (CR) specifies one or more kernel versions with which it is compatible, and a node selector.

The compatible versions for a `Module` resource are listed under `.spec.moduleLoader.container.kernelMappings`.
A kernel mapping can either match a `literal` version, or use `regexp` to match many of them at the same time.

The reconciliation loop for the `Module` resource runs the following steps:

. List all nodes matching `.spec.selector`.
. Build a set of all kernel versions running on those nodes.
. For each kernel version:
 .. Go through `.spec.moduleLoader.container.kernelMappings` and find the appropriate container image name. If the kernel mapping has `build` or `sign` defined and the container image does not already exist, run the build, the signing job, or both, as needed.
.. Create a module loader daemon set with the container image determined in the previous step.
.. If `.spec.devicePlugin` is defined, create a device plugin daemon set using the configuration specified under `.spec.devicePlugin.container`.
. Run `garbage-collect` on:
 .. Existing daemon set resources targeting kernel versions that are not run by any node in the cluster.
 .. Successful build jobs.
 .. Successful signing jobs.
