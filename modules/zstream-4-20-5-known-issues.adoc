This release contains the following known issues:


* When using GitLab or Google as the external OIDC identity provider for direct authentication, clicking *Log out* from the {product-title} web console does not log you out of the console. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61649[OCPBUGS-61649])

* When using Active Directory Federation Services for Windows Server as the external OIDC identity provider for direct authentication, logging into the {product-title} web console the first time produces an authentication error. As a workaround, reload the web console until it displays properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-62142[OCPBUGS-62142])

* If you configure direct authentication with an external OIDC provider and do not provide a value for `issuerCertificateAuthority` for the issuer in the OIDC provider configuration, the Machine Config Operator degrades. This can cause the Console Operator to degrade and some control plane nodes might fail to become available. As a workaround, set the `issuerCertificateAuthority` value for the issuer. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-62011[OCPBUGS-62011])
