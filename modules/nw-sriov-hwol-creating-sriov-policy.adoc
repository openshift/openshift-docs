= Configuring the SR-IOV network node policy

You can create an SR-IOV network device configuration for a node by creating an SR-IOV network node policy.
To enable hardware offloading, you must define the `.spec.eSwitchMode` field with the value `"switchdev"`.

The following procedure creates an SR-IOV interface for a network interface controller with hardware offloading.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Create a file, such as `sriov-node-policy.yaml`, with content like the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: sriov-node-policy <1>
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  deviceType: netdevice <2>
  eSwitchMode: "switchdev" <3>
  nicSelector:
    deviceID: "1019"
    rootDevices:
    - 0000:d8:00.0
    vendor: "15b3"
    pfNames:
    - ens8f0
  nodeSelector:
    feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: "true"
  numVfs: 6
  priority: 5
  resourceName: mlxnics
----
<1> The name for the custom resource object.
<2> Required. Hardware offloading is not supported with `vfio-pci`.
<3> Required.

. Apply the configuration for the policy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f sriov-node-policy.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
=====
When you apply the configuration specified in a `SriovNetworkPoolConfig` object, the SR-IOV Operator drains and restarts the nodes in the machine config pool.

It might take several minutes for a configuration change to apply.
