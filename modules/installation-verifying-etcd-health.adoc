= Verifying etcd health in a two-node OpenShift cluster with fencing

After completing node recovery or maintenance procedures, verify that both control plane nodes and etcd are operating correctly.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You can access at least one control plane node through SSH.

.Procedure

. Check the overall node status by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
This command verifies that both control plane nodes are in the `Ready` state, indicating that they can receive workloads for scheduling.

. Verify the status of the `cluster-etcd-operator` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe co/etcd
----
+
The `cluster-etcd-operator` manages and reports on the health of your etcd setup. Reviewing its status helps you identify any ongoing issues or degraded conditions.

. Review the etcd member list by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd <etcd_pod> etcdctl member list -w table
----
+
This command shows the current etcd members and their roles. Look for any nodes marked as `learner`, which indicates that they are in the process of becoming voting members.

. Review the Pacemaker resource status by running the following command on either control plane node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo pcs status --full
----
+
This command provides a detailed overview of all resources managed by Pacemaker. You must ensure that the following conditions are met:
+
** Both nodes are online.
** The `kubelet` and `etcd` resources are running.
** Fencing is correctly configured for both nodes.
