= Setting the URL scheme for external routes
// should probably be a procedure, but this is out of scope for the abstracts PR

The URL scheme of external routes defaults to HTTPS for enhanced security. This scheme is determined by the `default-external-scheme` key in the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR) spec.

.Default spec
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  config:
    network:
      default-external-scheme: "https"
...

You can override the default spec to use HTTP by modifying the `default-external-scheme` key:

.HTTP override spec
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  config:
    network:
      default-external-scheme: "http"
...
