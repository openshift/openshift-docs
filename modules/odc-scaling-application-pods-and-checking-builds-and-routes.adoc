= Scaling application pods and checking builds and routes

The *Topology* view provides the details of the deployed components in the *Overview* panel. You can use the *Overview* and *Resources* tabs to scale the application Pods, check build status, services, and routes as follows:


* Click on the component node to see the *Overview* panel to the right. Use the *Overview* tab to:

** Scale your Pods using the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the number of instances of the application manually. For serverless applications, the Pods are automatically scaled down to zero when idle and scaled up depending on the channel traffic.
** Check the *Labels*, *Annotations*, and *Status* of the application.

* Click the *Resources* tab to:

** See the list of all the Pods, view their status, access logs, and click on the Pod to see the Pod details.
** See the builds, their status, access logs, and start a new build if needed.
** See the services and routes used by the component.

For serverless applications, the *Resources* tab provides information on the revision, routes, and the configurations used for that component.
