= Creating the Azure storage class

Storage classes are used to differentiate and delineate storage levels and
usages. By defining a storage class, users can obtain dynamically provisioned
persistent volumes.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} console, click *Storage* -> *Storage Classes*.

. In the storage class overview, click *Create Storage Class*.

. Define the desired options on the page that appears.

.. Enter a name to reference the storage class.

.. Enter an optional description.

.. Select the reclaim policy.

.. Select `kubernetes.io/azure-disk` from the drop down list.

... Enter the storage account type. This corresponds to your Azure
storage account SKU tier. Valid options are `Premium_LRS`, `Standard_LRS`,
`StandardSSD_LRS`, and `UltraSSD_LRS`.

... Enter the kind of account. Valid options are `shared`, `dedicated,`
and `managed`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat only supports the use of `kind: Managed` in the storage class.

With `Shared` and `Dedicated`, Azure creates unmanaged disks, while {product-title} creates a managed disk for machine OS (root) disks. But because Azure Disk does not allow the use of both managed and unmanaged disks on a node, unmanaged disks created with `Shared` or `Dedicated` cannot be attached to {product-title} nodes.
====

.. Enter additional parameters for the storage class as desired.

. Click *Create* to create the storage class.
