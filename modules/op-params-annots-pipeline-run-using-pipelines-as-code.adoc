To run pipelines using {pac}, you can create pipeline run definitions or templates as YAML files in the `.tekton/` directory of your Git repository. You can reference YAML files in other repositories using remote URLs, but pipeline runs are triggered only by events in the repository containing the `.tekton/` directory.

The {pac} resolver bundles the pipeline runs with all tasks as a single pipeline run without external dependencies.

In addition to features that exist in all {openshift-pipelines} pipeline runs, you can use additional parameters and annotations in pipeline run files for {pac}.

[NOTE]
====
* For pipelines, use at least one pipeline run with a spec, or a separated `Pipeline` object.
* For tasks, embed the task specification inside a pipeline, or define it separately as a Task object.
