= Disabling the Log Forwarding feature

To disable the Log Forwarding feature, remove the `clusterlogging.openshift.io/logforwardingtechpreview:enabled` parameter from the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) and delete the Log Forwarding CR. The container and node logs will be forwarded to the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot disable Log Forwarding by setting the `disableDefaultForwarding` to `false` in the Log Forwarding Custom Resource. This prevents cluster logging from sending logs to the specified endpoints *and* to default internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance. 
====
