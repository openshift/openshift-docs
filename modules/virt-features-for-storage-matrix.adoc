1. PVCs must request a ReadWriteMany access mode.
2. Storage provider must support both Kubernetes and CSI snapshot APIs

[NOTE]
====
You cannot live migrate virtual machines that use:

* A storage class with ReadWriteOnce (RWO) access mode
* Passthrough features such as GPUs or SR-IOV network interfaces that have the `sriovLiveMigration` feature gate disabled

Do not set the `evictionStrategy` field to `LiveMigrate` for these virtual machines.
