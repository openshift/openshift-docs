= Imagestreamtags

An imagestreamtag is a named pointer to an image in an _imagestream_. It is
often abbreviated as _istag_. An imagestreamtag is used to reference or
retrieve an image for a given imagestream and tag.

Imagestreamtags can reference any local or externally managed image. It
contains a history of images represented as a stack of all images the tag ever
pointed to. Whenever a new or existing image is tagged under particular image
stream tag, it is placed at the first position in the history stack. The image
previously occupying the top position will be available at the second position,
and so forth. This allows for easy rollbacks to make tags point to historical
images again.

The following imagestreamtag is from an `ImageStream` object:

Imagestreamtags can be _permanent_ tags or _tracking_ tags.

* _Permanent tags_ are version-specific tags that point to a particular version of
an image, such as Python 3.5.

* _Tracking tags_ are reference tags that follow another imagestreamtag and
 could be updated in the future to change which image they follow, much like a
 symlink. Note that these new levels are not guaranteed to be
 backwards-compatible.
+
For example, the `latest` imagestreamtags that ship with {product-title} are
tracking tags. This means consumers of the `latest` imagestreamtag will be
updated to the newest level of the framework provided by the image when a new
level becomes available. A `latest` imagestreamtag to `v3.10` could be changed
to `v3.11` at any time. It is important to be aware that these `latest` image
stream tags behave differently than the Docker `latest` tag. The `latest` image
stream tag, in this case, does not point to the latest image in the Docker
repository. It points to another imagestreamtag, which might not be the latest
version of an image. For example, if the `latest` imagestreamtag points to
`v3.10` of an image, when the `3.11` version is released, the `latest` tag is
not automatically updated to `v3.11`, and remains at `v3.10` until it is
manually updated to point to a `v3.11` imagestreamtag.

[NOTE]
====
Tracking tags are limited to a single imagestream and cannot reference other
imagestreams.
====

You can create your own imagestreamtags for your own needs.

The imagestreamtag is composed of the name of the imagestream and a tag,
separated by a colon:

----
<imagestream name>:<tag>

For example, to refer to the
`sha256:47463d94eb5c049b2d23b03a9530bf944f8f967a0fe79147dd6b9135bf7dd13d` image
in the `ImageStream` object example earlier, the imagestreamtag
would be:

----
origin-ruby-sample:latest
