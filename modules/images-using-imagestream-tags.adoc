= Image stream tags

An image stream tag is a named pointer to an image in an image stream. It is abbreviated as `istag`. An image stream tag is used to reference or retrieve an image for a given image stream and tag.

Image stream tags can reference any local or externally managed image. It contains a history of images represented as a stack of all images the tag ever pointed to. Whenever a new or existing image is tagged under particular image stream tag, it is placed at the first position in the history stack. The image previously occupying the top position is available at the second position. This allows for easy rollbacks to make tags point to historical images again.

The following image stream tag is from an `ImageStream` object:

.Image stream tag with two images in its history

Image stream tags can be permanent tags or tracking tags.

* Permanent tags are version-specific tags that point to a particular version of an image, such as Python 3.5.

* Tracking tags are reference tags that follow another image stream tag and can be updated to change which image they follow, like a symlink. These new levels are not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible.

For example, the `latest` image stream tags that ship with {product-title} are tracking tags. This means consumers of the `latest` image stream tag are updated to the newest level of the framework provided by the image when a new level becomes available. A `latest` image stream tag to `v3.10` can be changed to `v3.11` at any time. It is important to be aware that these `latest` image stream tags behave differently than the Docker `latest` tag. The `latest` image stream tag, in this case, does not point to the latest image in the Docker repository. It points to another image stream tag, which might not be the latest version of an image. For example, if the `latest` image stream tag points to `v3.10` of an image, when the `3.11` version is released, the `latest` tag is not automatically updated to `v3.11`, and remains at `v3.10` until it is manually updated to point to a `v3.11` image stream tag.

[NOTE]
====
Tracking tags are limited to a single image stream and cannot reference other
image streams.
====

You can create your own image stream tags for your own needs.

The image stream tag is composed of the name of the image stream and a tag,
separated by a colon:

----
<imagestream name>:<tag>

For example, to refer to the
`sha256:47463d94eb5c049b2d23b03a9530bf944f8f967a0fe79147dd6b9135bf7dd13d` image
in the `ImageStream` object example earlier, the image stream tag
would be:

----
origin-ruby-sample:latest
