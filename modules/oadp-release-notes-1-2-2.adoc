== Resolved issues

The following highlighted issues are resolved in OADP 1.2.2:


.Restic restore partially failed due to a Pod Security standard

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, {OCP} 4.14 enforced a pod security admission (PSA) policy that hindered the readiness of pods during a Restic restore process.

This issue has been resolved in the release of OADP 1.2.2, and also OADP 1.1.6. Therefore, it is recommended that users upgrade to these releases.

For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting.html#oadp-restic-restore-failing-psa-policy_oadp-troubleshooting[Restic restore partially failing on OCP 4.14 due to changed PSA policy]. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2094[(OADP-2094)]
