== Resolved issues

The following highlighted issues are resolved in {oadp-short} 1.2.2:


.Restic restore partially failed due to a Pod Security standard

In previous releases of {oadp-short} 1.2, {OCP} 4.14 enforced a pod security admission (PSA) policy that hindered the readiness of pods during a Restic restore process.

This issue has been resolved in the release of {oadp-short} 1.2.2, and also {oadp-short} 1.1.6. Therefore, it is recommended that users upgrade to these releases.

.ACM cluster restore was not functioning as expected due to restore order

In previous releases of {oadp-short} 1.2, ACM cluster restore was not functioning as expected due to restore order. ACM applications were removed and re-created on managed clusters after restore activation. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2505[(OADP-2505)]


.VM's using filesystemOverhead failed when backing up and restoring due to volume size mismatch

In previous releases of {oadp-short} 1.2, due to storage provider implementation choices, whenever there was a difference between the application persistent volume claims (PVCs) storage request and the snapshot size of the same PVC, VM's using filesystemOverhead failed when backing up and restoring. This issue has been resolved in the Data Mover of {oadp-short} 1.2.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2144[(OADP-2144)]


.{oadp-short} did not contain an option to set VolSync replication source prune interval

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, there was no option to set the VolSync replication source `pruneInterval`. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2052[(OADP-2052)]


.Possible pod volume backup failure if Velero was installed in multiple namespaces

In previous releases of {oadp-short} 1.2, there was a possibility of pod volume backup failure if Velero was installed in multiple namespaces. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2409[(OADP-2409)]


.Backup Storage Locations moved to unavailable phase when VSL uses custom secret

In previous releases of OADP 1.2, Backup Storage Locations moved to unavailable phase when Volume Snapshot Location used custom secret. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1737[(OADP-1737)]


In previous releases of {oadp-short} 1.2, the backup configuration setting `csiSnapshotTimeout` was not functioning as expected. When attempting to modify this parameter to a custom value, the backup process still utilized the default timeout value instead of the specified one. This behavior persisted regardless of the value assigned to `csiSnapshotTimeout`. This issue has been resolved in {oadp-short} 1.2.2.
