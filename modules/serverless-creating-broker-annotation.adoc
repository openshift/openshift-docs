= Creating a broker by annotating a trigger

You can create a broker by adding the `eventing.knative.dev/injection: enabled` annotation to a `Trigger` object.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you create a broker by using the `eventing.knative.dev/injection: enabled` annotation, you cannot delete this broker without cluster administrator permissions.
If you delete the broker without having a cluster administrator remove this annotation first, the broker is created again after deletion.
====

.Prerequisites
* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing are installed on your {product-title} cluster.

.Procedure
. Create a `Trigger` object as a `.yaml` file that has the `eventing.knative.dev/injection: enabled` annotation:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  annotations:
    eventing.knative.dev/injection: enabled
  name: <trigger-name>
spec:
  broker: default
  subscriber: <1>
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: <service-name>
----
+
<1> Specify details about the event sink, or _subscriber_, that the trigger sends events to.
. Apply the `.yaml` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

.Verification

You can verify that the broker has been created successfully by using the `oc` CLI, or by observing it in the *Topology* view in the web console.

. Use the `oc` command to get the broker:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <namespace> get broker default
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      READY     REASON    URL                                                                     AGE
default   True                http://broker-ingress.knative-eventing.svc.cluster.local/test/default   3m56s
----

. Navigate to the *Topology* view in the web console, and observe that the broker exists:
