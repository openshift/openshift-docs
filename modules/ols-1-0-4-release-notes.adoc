* This release makes {ols-official} 1.0.4 generally available, and is supported on {ocp-product-title} 4.16 and later.

* The cluster interaction Technology Preview feature now uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). Using the protocol, an MCP server offers a standardized way for an LLM to increase context by requesting and receiving real-time information from external resources.
