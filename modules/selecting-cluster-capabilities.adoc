= Selecting cluster capabilities
You can select cluster capabilities by following one of the installation methods that include customizing your cluster, such as "Installing a cluster on AWS with customizations" or "Installing a cluster on GCP with customizations".

During a customized installation, you create an `install-config.yaml` file that contains the configuration parameters for your cluster. You can use the following configuration parameters to select cluster capabilities:

[source,yaml]
----
capabilities:
  baselineCapabilitySet: v4.12 <1>
  additionalEnabledCapabilities: <2>
  - CSISnapshot
  - Console
  - Storage
----
<1> Defines a baseline set of capabilities to install. Valid values are `None`, `v4.11`, `v4.12`, and `vCurrent`. If you select `None`, all optional capabilities will be disabled. The default value is `vCurrent`, which enables all optional capabilities.
<2> Defines a list of capabilities to explicitly enable. These will be enabled in addition to the capabilities specified in `baselineCapabilitySet`.
