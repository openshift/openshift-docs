= Selecting cluster capabilities
You can select cluster capabilities by following one of the installation methods that include customizing your cluster, such as "Installing a cluster on AWS with customizations" or "Installing a cluster on GCP with customizations".

During a customized installation, you create an `install-config.yaml` file that contains the configuration parameters for your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
If you customize your cluster by enabling or disabling specific cluster capabilities, you are responsible for manually maintaining your `install-config.yaml` file. New {product-title} updates might declare new capability handles for existing components, or introduce new components altogether. Users who customize their `install-config.yaml` file should consider periodically updating their `install-config.yaml` file as {product-title} is updated.
====

You can use the following configuration parameters to select cluster capabilities:

[source,yaml]
----
capabilities:
  baselineCapabilitySet: v4.11 <1>
  additionalEnabledCapabilities: <2>
  - CSISnapshot
  - Console
  - Storage
----
<1> Defines a baseline set of capabilities to install. Valid values are `None`, `vCurrent` and `v4.x`. If you select `None`, all optional capabilities will be disabled. The default value is `vCurrent`, which enables all optional capabilities.
+
[NOTE]
====
`v4.x` refers to any value up to and including the current cluster version.
For example, valid values for a {product-title} 4.12 cluster are `v4.11` and `v4.12`.
====
<2> Defines a list of capabilities to explicitly enable. These will be enabled in addition to the capabilities specified in `baselineCapabilitySet`.
+
[NOTE]
====
In this example, the default capability is set to `v4.11`. The `additionalEnabledCapabilities` field enables additional capabilities over the default `v4.11` capability set.
