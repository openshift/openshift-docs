= Configuring AWS Direct Connect


{AWS} Direct Connect requires a hosted Virtual Interface (VIF) connected to a Direct Connect Gateway (DXGateway), which is in turn associated to a Virtual Gateway (VGW) or a Transit Gateway in order to access a remote Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in the same or another account.

If you do not have an existing DXGateway, the typical process involves creating the hosted VIF, with the DXGateway and VGW being created in your AWS account.

If you have an existing DXGateway connected to one or more existing VGWs, the process involves your AWS account sending an Association Proposal to the DXGateway owner. The DXGateway owner must ensure that the proposed CIDR will not conflict with any other VGWs they have associated.

.Prerequisites

* Confirm the CIDR range of the {product-title} VPC will not conflict with any other VGWs you have associated.
* Gather the following information:
** The Direct Connect Gateway ID.
** The AWS Account ID associated with the virtual interface.
** The BGP ASN assigned for the DXGateway. Optional: the Amazon default ASN may also be used.

.Procedure

. link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/create-vif.html[Create a VIF] or link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/viewvifdetails.html[view your existing VIFs] to determine the type of direct connection you need to create.

. Create your gateway.
.. If the Direct Connect VIF type is *Private*, link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/virtualgateways.html#create-virtual-private-gateway[create a virtual private gateway].
.. If the Direct Connect VIF is *Public*, link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/direct-connect-gateways-intro.html#create-direct-connect-gateway[create a Direct Connect gateway].

. If you have an existing gateway you want to use, link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/multi-account-associate-vgw.html[create an association proposal] and send the proposal to the DXGateway owner for approval.
