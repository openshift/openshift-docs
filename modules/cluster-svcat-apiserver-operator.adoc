= Cluster SVCAT API Server Operator

[discrete]
== Purpose

The Cluster SVCAT API Server Operator installs and maintains a singleton
instance of the OpenShift Service Catalog on a cluster. Service Catalog is
comprised of an aggregated API server and a controller manager; this Operator
only deals with the API server portion of Service Catalog. See
link:https://github.com/openshift/cluster-svcat-controller-manager-operator[cluster-svcat-controller-manager-operator]
for the Operator responsible for the controller manager component of Service
Catalog.
