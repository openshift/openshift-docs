[id="nw-multus-configure-dualstack-ip-address_{context}"]
= Creating a configuration for assignment of dual-stack IP addresses dynamically

Dual-stack IP address assignment can be configured with the `ipRanges` parameter for:

* IPv4 addresses
* IPv6 addresses
* multiple IP address assignment

.Procedure

. Set `type` to `whereabouts`.

. Use `ipRanges` to allocate IP addresses as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]

cniVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
=metadata:
  name: cluster

  additionalNetworks:
  - name: whereabouts-shim
    namespace: default
    type: Raw
    rawCNIConfig: |-
      {
       "name": "whereabouts-dual-stack",
       "cniVersion": "0.3.1,
       "type": "bridge",
       "ipam": {
         "type": "whereabouts",
         "ipRanges": [
                  {"range": "192.168.10.0/24"},
                  {"range": "2001:db8::/64"}
              ]
       }
      }
