= Creating a configuration for assignment of dual-stack IP addresses dynamically

Dual-stack IP address assignment can be configured with the `ipRanges` parameter for:

* IPv4 addresses
* IPv6 addresses
* multiple IP address assignment 

.Procedure

. Set `type` to `whereabouts`.

. Use `ipRanges` to allocate IP addresses as shown in the following example:

      {
       "name": "whereabouts-dual-stack",
       "cniVersion": "0.3.1,
       "type": "bridge",
       "ipam": {
         "type": "whereabouts",
         "ipRanges": [
                  {"range": "192.168.10.0/24"},
                  {"range": "2001:db8::/64"}
              ]
       }
      }
