= Enabling an existing private cluster to be public
// TODO: These wordings of "enabling the cluster "to be public/private" could probably be improved. At the very least, these two modules should probably use "Configuring" instead of "Enabling", as it is worded now.

After a private cluster has been created, you can later enable the cluster to be public.

.Procedure

. Log in to {console-redhat-com}.

. Select the private cluster you would like to make public.

. On the *Networking* tab, deselect *Make API private* under *Control Plane API endpoint*.

. Click *Change settings*.

[NOTE]
====
Transitioning your cluster between private and public can take several minutes to complete.
