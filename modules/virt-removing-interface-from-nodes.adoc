= Removing an interface from nodes

Remove an interface from nodes by editing the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` object and set
the `state` of the interface to `absent`.

[NOTE]
====
Deleting the Policy that added an interface does not change the configuration of the network policy on the node.
Although a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` is an object in the cluster, it only represents the requested configuration. +
Similarly, removing an interface does not delete the Policy.
====

.Procedure

. Update the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest used to create the interface. The following example removes a Linux bridge:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1alpha1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: <br1-eth1-policy> <1>
spec:
  nodeSelector: <2>
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: "" <3>
  desiredState:
    interfaces:
      - name: br1
        type: linux-bridge
        state: absent <4>
----
<1> Name of the Policy.
<2> Optional. If you do not include the `nodeSelector`, the Policy applies to all nodes in the cluster.
<3> This example uses the `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""` node selector to select all worker nodes in the cluster.
<4> Changing the state to `absent` removes the interface.

. Update the  Policy on the node and remove the interface:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <br1-eth1-policy.yaml> <1>
----
<1> File name of the Policy manifest.
