= Installing the OADP Operator and providing the IAM role

AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is a global web service that provides short-term credentials for IAM or federated users. {product-title} (ROSA) with {sts-short} is the recommended credential mode for ROSA clusters. This document describes how to install {oadp-first} on ROSA with {aws-short} {sts-short}.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Restic and Kopia are not supported in the OADP on ROSA with {aws-short} {sts-short} environment. Verify that the Restic and Kopia node agent is disabled.
For backing up volumes, OADP on ROSA with {aws-short} {sts-short} supports only native snapshots and Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
In an Amazon ROSA cluster that uses STS authentication, restoring backed-up data in a different {aws-short} region is not supported.

The Data Mover feature is not currently supported in ROSA clusters. You can use native {aws-short} S3 tools for moving data.
====

.Prerequisites

* An {product-title} ROSA cluster with the required access and tokens. For instructions, see the previous procedure _Preparing AWS credentials for OADP_. If you plan to use two different clusters for backing up and restoring, you must prepare {aws-short} credentials, including `ROLE_ARN`, for each cluster.


.Procedure

. Create an {product-title} secret from your {aws-short} token file by entering the following commands:

.. Create the credentials file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF > ${SCRATCH}/credentials
  [default]
  role_arn = ${ROLE_ARN}
  web_identity_token_file = /var/run/secrets/openshift/serviceaccount/token
EOF
----

.. Create a namespace for OADP:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create namespace openshift-adp
----

.. Create the {product-title} secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-adp create secret generic cloud-credentials \
  --from-file=${SCRATCH}/credentials
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} versions 4.14 and later, the OADP Operator supports a new standardized {sts-short} workflow through the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
and Cloud Credentials Operator (CCO). In this workflow, you do not need to create the above
secret, you only need to supply the role ARN during the installation of OLM-managed operators using the {product-title} web console, for more information see _Installing from OperatorHub using the web console_.

The preceding secret is created automatically by CCO.
====

. Install the OADP Operator:
.. In the {product-title} web console, browse to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.
.. Search for the *OADP Operator*.
.. In the *role_ARN* field, paste the role_arn that you created previously and click *Install*.

. Create {aws-short} cloud storage using your {aws-short} credentials by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -
  apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: CloudStorage
  metadata:
    name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
    namespace: openshift-adp
  spec:
    creationSecret:
      key: credentials
      name: cloud-credentials
    enableSharedConfig: true
    name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
    provider: aws
    region: $REGION
EOF

. Check your application's storage default storage class by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pvc -n <namespace>

[NOTE]
====
The following storage classes will work:

  * gp3-csi
  * gp2-csi
  * gp3
  * gp2
====

If the application or applications that are being backed up are all using persistent volumes (PVs) with Container Storage Interface (CSI), it is advisable to include the CSI plugin in the OADP DPA configuration.

. Create the `DataProtectionApplication` resource to configure the connection to the storage where the backups and volume snapshots are stored:

.. If you are using only CSI volumes, deploy a Data Protection Application by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -

EOF
----
<1> See the following note.
<2> The `credentialsFile` field is the mounted location of the bucket credential on the pod.
<3> The `enableSharedConfig` field allows the `snapshotLocations` to share or reuse the credential defined for the bucket.
<4> Use the profile name set in the {aws-short} credentials file.
<5> Specify `region` as your {aws-short} region. This must be the same as the cluster region.
+
You are now ready to back up and restore {product-title} applications, as described in _Backing up applications_.

[NOTE]
====
The `enable` parameter of `restic` is set to `false` in this configuration, because OADP does not support Restic in ROSA environments.

If you use OADP 1.2, replace this configuration:
[source,terminal]

----
nodeAgent:
  enable: false
  uploaderType: restic
----
with the following configuration:

[source,terminal]
----
restic:
  enable: false
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If you want to use two different clusters for backing up and restoring, the two clusters must have the same {aws-short} S3 storage names in both the cloud storage CR and the OADP `DataProtectionApplication` configuration.
