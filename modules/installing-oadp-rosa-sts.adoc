= Installing the OADP Operator and providing the IAM role

AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is a global web service that provides short-term credentials for IAM or federated users. {product-title} (ROSA) with STS is the recommended credential mode for ROSA clusters. This document describes how to install OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) on (ROSA) with AWS STS.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Restic and Kopia are not supported in the OADP on ROSA with AWS STS environment. Verify that the Restic and Kopia node agent is disabled.
For backing up volumes, OADP on ROSA with AWS STS supports only native snapshots and Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots. See _Known Issues_ for more information.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
In an Amazon ROSA cluster that uses STS authentication, restoring backed-up data in a different AWS region is not supported.

The Data Mover feature is not currently supported in ROSA clusters. You can use native AWS S3 tools for moving data.
====

.Prerequisites

* A {openshift-rosa} cluster with the required access and tokens. For instructions, see the procedure in "Preparing AWS credentials". If you plan to use two different clusters for backing up and restoring, you need to prepare AWS credentials, including `ROLE_ARN`, for each cluster.


.Procedure

. Create an OpenShift secret from your AWS token file by entering the following commands.

.. Create the credentials file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF > ${SCRATCH}/credentials
[default]
role_arn = ${ROLE_ARN}
web_identity_token_file = /var/run/secrets/openshift/serviceaccount/token
EOF
----

.. Create a namespace for OADP:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create namespace openshift-adp
----

.. Create the OpenShift secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-adp create secret generic cloud-credentials \
  --from-file=${SCRATCH}/credentials
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} versions 4.14 and later, the OADP Operator supports a new standardized STS workflow through the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
and Cloud Credentials Operator (CCO). In this workflow, you do not need to create the above
secret, you only need to supply the role ARN during link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/operators/user-tasks#olm-installing-from-operatorhub-using-web-console_olm-installing-operators-in-namespace[the installation of OLM-managed operators using the {product-title} web console].
The preceding secret is created automatically by CCO.
====

. Install the OADP Operator.
.. In the {product-title} web console, browse to *Operators*->* *OperatorHub*.
.. Search for the *OADP Operator*, then click *Install*.

. Create AWS cloud storage using your AWS credentials:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: CloudStorage
metadata:
  name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  creationSecret:
    key: credentials
    name: cloud-credentials
  enableSharedConfig: true
  name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
  provider: aws
  region: $REGION
EOF
----
// bringing over from MOB docs
. Check your application's storage default storage class:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pvc -n <namespace>
----

+
.Example output:

+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
applog   Bound    pvc-351791ae-b6ab-4e8b-88a4-30f73caf5ef8   1Gi        RWO            gp3-csi        4d19h
mysql    Bound    pvc-16b8e009-a20a-4379-accc-bc81fedd0621   1Gi        RWO            gp3-csi        4d19h
----


. Get storage class by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get storageclass
----

+
.Example output:
+
[source,terminal]
----

gp3                 ebs.csi.aws.com         Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   4d21h
gp3-csi (default)   ebs.csi.aws.com         Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   4d21h
----

The following storage classes will work:

* gp3-csi
* gp2-csi
* gp3
* gp2

If the application or applications that are being backed up are all using PVs with CSI, it is advisable to include the CSI plugin in the OADP DPA configuration.

. Create the `DataProtectionApplication` resource, to configure the connection to the storage where the backups and volume snapshots are stored:

.. Deploy a Data Protection Application - CSI only

// Are there any callouts that you want added to the following
// Do you prefer the cat command adding or removing? I am kind of agnostic

<1> See the following note.
<2> The `credentialsFile` field is the mounted location of the bucket credential on the pod.
<3> The `enableSharedConfig` field allows the `snapshotLocations` to share or reuse the credential defined for the bucket.
<4> Use the profile name set in the AWS credentials file.
<5> Specify `region` as your AWS region. This must be the same as the cluster region.

You are now ready to back up and restore OpenShift applications, as described in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.html[OADP documentation].

[NOTE]
====
The `enable` parameter of `restic` is set to `false` in this configuration, because OADP does not support Restic in ROSA environments.

If you use OADP 1.2, replace this configuration:
[source,terminal]

----
nodeAgent:
  enable: false
  uploaderType: restic
----
with the following configuration:

[source,terminal]
----
restic:
  enable: false
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If you want to use two different clusters for backing up and restoring, the two clusters must have the same AWS S3 storage names in both the cloud storage CR and the OADP `DataProtectionApplication` configuration.
