= Deleting cluster resources following a partially successful or a failed backup and restore that used Data Mover

If your backup and restore operation that uses Data Mover either fails or only partially succeeds, you must clean up any `VolumeSnapshotBackup` (VSB) or `VolumeSnapshotRestore` custom resource definitions (CRDs) that exist in the application namespace, and clean up any extra resources created by these controllers.

.Procedure

. Clean up cluster resources that remain after a backup operation where you used Data Mover by entering the following commands:

.. Delete VSB CRDs on the application namespace, the namespace with the application PVCs to backup and restore:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete vsb -n <app_namespace> --all
----

.. Delete `VolumeSnapshot` CRs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete volumesnapshot -A --all
----

.. Delete `VolumeSnapshotContent` CRs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete volumesnapshotcontent --all
----

.. Delete any PVCs on the protected namespace, the namespace the Operator is installed on.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pvc -n <protected_namespace> --all
----

.. Delete any `ReplicationSource` resources on the namespace.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete replicationsource -n <protected_namespace> --all
----

. Clean up cluster resources that remain after a restore operation using Data Mover by entering the following commands:

.. Delete VSR CRDs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete vsr -n <app-ns> --all
----

.. Delete `VolumeSnapshot` CRs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete volumesnapshot -A --all
----

.. Delete `VolumeSnapshotContent` CRs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete volumesnapshotcontent --all
----

.. Delete any `ReplicationDestination` resources on the namespace.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete replicationdestination -n <protected_namespace> --all
