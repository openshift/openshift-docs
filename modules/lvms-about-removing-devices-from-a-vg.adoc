= About removing devices and device classes from a volume group

The `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR contains the configuration to specify the paths to the devices that you can remove from the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) volume group.

You can remove the device paths in the `deviceSelector.paths` field.

[WARNING]
====
Ensure that the device you want to remove is empty. You can use the `pvdisplay` command to see attributes of physical volumes (PVs) used in LVM 

There is at least one more device specified in the `deviceSelector.paths` field.

====

You can also remove the deviceClass from the `LVMCluster`. For device class deletion, there is no need to delete `deviceSelector.paths`.

[WARNING]
====
Ensure that the deviceClass you want to remove is not the default deviceClass. That is, the `deviceClasses.default` is `false`.

The disks specified in the `deviceSelector.paths` field are empty.

There is at least one more deviceClass specified in the `storage` field.
