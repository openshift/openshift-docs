= Enabling PVC support


.Procedure

. To enable Knative Serving to use PVCs and write to them, modify the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR) to include the following YAML:
+
.Enabling PVCs with write access
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  config:
    features:
      "kubernetes.podspec-persistent-volume-claim": enabled
      "kubernetes.podspec-persistent-volume-write": enabled
...
----
+
* The `kubernetes.podspec-persistent-volume-claim` extension controls whether persistent volumes (PVs) can be used with Knative Serving.
* The `kubernetes.podspec-persistent-volume-write` extension controls whether PVs are available to Knative Serving with the write access.

. To claim a PV, modify your service to include the PV configuration. For example, you might have a persistent volume claim with the following configuration:
+
[NOTE]
====
Use the storage class that supports the access mode that you are requesting. For example, you can use the `ocs-storagecluster-cephfs` class for the `ReadWriteMany` access mode.
====
+
.PersistentVolumeClaim configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: example-pv-claim
  namespace: my-ns
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
----
+
In this case, to claim a PV with write access, modify your service as follows:
+
.Knative service PVC configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  namespace: my-ns
...
spec:
 template:
   spec:
     containers:
         ...
         volumeMounts: <1>
           - mountPath: /data
             name: mydata
             readOnly: false
     volumes:
       - name: mydata
         persistentVolumeClaim: <2>
           claimName: example-pv-claim
           readOnly: false <3>
----
<1> Volume mount specification.
<2> Persistent volume claim specification.
<3> Flag that enables read-only access.
+
[NOTE]
====
To successfully use persistent storage in Knative services, you need additional configuration, such as the user permissions for the Knative container user.
