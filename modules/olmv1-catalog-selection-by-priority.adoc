= Catalog selection by priority

When multiple catalogs provide the same package, you can resolve ambiguities by specifying the priority in the custom resource (CR) of each catalog. If unspecified, catalogs have a default priority value of `0`. The priority can be any positive or negative 32-bit integer.

[NOTE]
====
* During bundle resolution, catalogs with higher priority values are selected over catalogs with lower priority values.
* Bundles that are not deprecated are prioritized over bundles that are deprecated.
* If multiple bundles exist in catalogs with the same priority and the catalog selection is ambiguous, an error is printed.
