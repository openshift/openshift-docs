= Configuration at installation

This section does not describe how to install a single node on OpenShift.
This can be accomplished through many mechanisms.
Rather, it is intended to capture the elements that should be configured as part of the
installation process.
Some items, such as networking, are needed to enable connectivity to the single node
distributed unit (DU) when the installation is complete.
Other items, such as workload partitioning, can only be configured during installation.
Additionally, items are included to help minimize the potential reboots during post installation.
