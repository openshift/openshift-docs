= Deployment Prerequisites
To deploy {product-title} (ROSA) into your existing Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, Red Hat requires that several prerequisites are met.

Red Hat recommends the use of AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts. The AWS Organizations, managed by the customer, host multiple AWS accounts. There is a root account in the organization that all accounts will refer to in the account hierarchy.

It is a best practice for the ROSA cluster to be hosted in an AWS account within an AWS Organizational Unit. A Service Control Policy (SCP) is created and applied to the AWS Organizational Unit that manages what services the AWS sub-accounts are permitted to access. The SCP applies only to available permissions within a single AWS account for all AWS sub-accounts within the Organizational Unit. It is also possible to apply a SCP to a single AWS account. All other accounts in the customer’s AWS Organizations are managed in whatever manner the customer requires. Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) will not have any control over SCPs within AWS Organizations.
