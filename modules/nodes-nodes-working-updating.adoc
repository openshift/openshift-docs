= Understanding how to update labels on nodes

You can update any label on a node.

Node labels are not persisted after a node is deleted even if the node is backed up by a Machine.

[NOTE]
====
Any change to a MachineSet is not applied to existing machines owned by the MachineSet. 
For example, labels edited or added to an existing MachineSet are not propagated to existing machines and Nodes
associated with the MachineSet.
====

* The following command adds or updates labels on a node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node> <key_1>=<value_1> ... <key_n>=<value_n>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label nodes webconsole-7f7f6 unhealthy=true
----

* The following command updates all pods in the namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label pods --all <key_1>=<value_1>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label pods --all status=unhealthy
----
