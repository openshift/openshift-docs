= Understanding how to update labels on nodes

You can update any label on a node.

Node labels are not persisted after a node is deleted even if the node is backed up by a Machine.

[NOTE]
====
Any change to a `MachineSet` object is not applied to existing machines owned by the compute machine set.
For example, labels edited or added to an existing `MachineSet` object are not propagated to existing machines and nodes
associated with the compute machine set.
====

* The following command adds or updates labels on a node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node> <key_1>=<value_1> ... <key_n>=<value_n>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label nodes webconsole-7f7f6 unhealthy=true
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to apply the label:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Node
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: webconsole-7f7f6
  labels:
    unhealthy: 'true'
#...
----
====

* The following command updates all pods in the namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label pods --all <key_1>=<value_1>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label pods --all status=unhealthy
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {product-title} 4.12 and later, newly installed clusters include both the `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane` and `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` labels on control plane nodes by default.

In {product-title} versions earlier than 4.12, the `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane` label is not added by default. You can manually add the `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane` label to control plane nodes in clusters upgraded from earlier versions, as needed.
