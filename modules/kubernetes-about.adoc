= About Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The general concept of Kubernetes is fairly simple:

* Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads.
* Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more control nodes.
* Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a pod. Using pods provides extra metadata with the container and offers the ability to group several containers in a single deployment entity.
* Create special kinds of assets. For example, services are represented by a set of pods and a policy that defines how they are accessed. This policy allows containers to connect to the services that they need even if they do not have the specific IP addresses for the services. Replication controllers are another special asset that indicates how many pod Replicas are required to run at a time. You can use this capability to automatically scale your application to adapt to its current demand.
