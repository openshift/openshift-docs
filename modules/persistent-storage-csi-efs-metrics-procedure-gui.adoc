= Enabling usage metrics using the web console

To enable Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic File Service (EFS) Storage Container Storage Interface (CSI) usage metrics using the web console:

. Click *Administration* > *CustomResourceDefinitions*.

. On the *CustomResourceDefinitions* page next to the *Name* dropdown box, type `clustercsidriver`.

. Click *CRD ClusterCSIDriver*.

. Click the *YAML* tab.

. Under `spec.aws.efsVolumeMetrics.state`, set the value to `RecursiveWalk`.
+
`RecursiveWalk` indicates that volume metrics collection in the AWS EFS CSI Driver is performed by recursively walking through the files in the volume.

spec:
    driverConfig:
        driverType: AWS
        aws:
            efsVolumeMetrics:
              state: RecursiveWalk
              recursiveWalk:
                refreshPeriodMinutes: 100
                fsRateLimit: 10
----

. Optional: To define how the recursive walk operates, you can also set the following fields:
+
** `refreshPeriodMinutes`: Specifies the refresh frequency for volume metrics in minutes. If this field is left blank, a reasonable default is chosen, which is subject to change over time. The current default is 240 minutes. The valid range is 1 to 43,200 minutes.
** `fsRateLimit`: Defines the rate limit for processing volume metrics in goroutines per file system. If this field is left blank, a reasonable default is chosen, which is subject to change over time. The current default is 5 goroutines. The valid range is 1 to 100 goroutines.

. Click *Save*.

[NOTE]
====
To *disable* AWS EFS CSI usage metrics, use the preceding procedure, but for `spec.aws.efsVolumeMetrics.state`, change the value from `RecursiveWalk` to `Disabled`.
