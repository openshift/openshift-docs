= Troubleshooting service mesh Operators

If you experience Operator issues:

* Verify your Operator subscription status.
* Verify that you did not install a community version of the Operator, instead of the supported Red Hat version.
* Verify that you have the `cluster-admin` role to install {ProductName}.
* Check for any errors in the Operator pod logs if the issue is related to installation of Operators.

[NOTE]
====
You can install Operators only through the OpenShift console, the OperatorHub is not accessible from the command line.

== Viewing Operator pod logs

You can view Operator logs by using the `oc logs` command. Red Hat may request logs to help resolve support cases.

.Procedure

* To view Operator pod logs, enter the command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n openshift-operators <podName>
----
+
For example,
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n openshift-operators istio-operator-bb49787db-zgr87
----

//If your pod fails to start, you may need to use the `--previous` option to see the logs of the last attempt.
