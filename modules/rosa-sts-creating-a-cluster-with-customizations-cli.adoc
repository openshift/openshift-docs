= Creating a cluster with customizations using the CLI

When you create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS), you can customize your installation interactively.

When you run the `rosa create cluster --interactive` command at cluster creation time, you are presented with a series of interactive prompts that enable you to customize your deployment. For more information, see _Interactive cluster creation mode reference_.

After a cluster installation using the interactive mode completes, a single command is provided in the output that enables you to deploy further clusters using the same custom configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only public and AWS PrivateLink clusters are supported with STS. Regular private clusters (non-PrivateLink) are not available for use with STS.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the AWS prerequisites for ROSA with STS.
* You have available AWS service quotas.
* You have enabled the ROSA service in the AWS Console.
* You have installed and configured the latest ROSA CLI, `rosa`, on your installation host. Run `rosa version` to see your currently installed version of the ROSA CLI. If a newer version is available, the CLI provides a link to download this upgrade.
* If you want to use a customer managed AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key for encryption, you must create a symmetric KMS key. You must provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) when creating your cluster. To create a customer managed KMS key, follow the procedure for link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html#create-symmetric-cmk[Creating symmetric encryption KMS keys].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The EBS Operator role is required in addition to the account roles to successfully create your cluster.

This role must be attached with the `ManagedOpenShift-openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-ebs-cloud-credentials` policy, an IAM policy required by ROSA to manage back-end storage through the Container Storage Interface (CSI).

For more information about the policies and permissions that the cluster Operators require, see _Methods of account-wide role creation_.

.Example EBS Operator role
`"arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/<cluster_name>-xxxx-openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-ebs-cloud-credent"`

After you create your Operator roles, you must edit the _Key Policy_ in the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms[*Key Management Service (KMS)* page of the AWS Console] to add the roles.
====

.Procedure

. Create the required account-wide roles and policies, including the Operator policies:
.. Generate the IAM policy JSON files in the current working directory and output the `aws` CLI commands for review:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create account-roles --interactive \ <1>
                            --mode manual <2>
----
<1> `interactive` mode enables you to specify configuration options at the interactive prompts. For more information, see _Interactive cluster creation mode reference_.
<2> `manual` mode generates the `aws` CLI commands and JSON files needed to create the account-wide roles and policies. After review, you must run the commands manually to create the resources.

I: To create a cluster with these roles, run the following command:
rosa create cluster --sts
----
<1> Specify the prefix to include in the {cluster-manager} IAM role name. The default is `ManagedOpenShift`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must specify an account-wide role prefix that is unique across your AWS account, even if you use a custom ARN path for your account roles.
====
+
<2> Optional: Specifies a permissions boundary Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the role. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html[Permissions boundaries for IAM entities] in the AWS documentation.
<3> Specify a custom ARN path for your account-wide roles. The path must contain alphanumeric characters only and start and end with `/`, for example `/test/path/dev/`. For more information, see _ARN path customization for IAM roles and policies_.
<4> Select the role creation mode. You can use `auto` mode to automatically create the account wide roles and policies. In `manual` mode, the `rosa` CLI generates the `aws` commands needed to create the roles and policies. In `manual` mode, the corresponding policy JSON files are also saved to the current directory. `manual` mode enables you to review the details before running the `aws` commands manually.
<5> Creates the account-wide installer, control plane, worker and support roles and corresponding IAM policies. For more information, see _Account-wide IAM role and policy reference_.
+
[NOTE]
====
In this step, the ROSA CLI also automatically creates the account-wide Operator IAM policies that are used by the cluster-specific Operator policies to permit the ROSA cluster Operators to carry out core OpenShift functionality. For more information, see _Account-wide IAM role and policy reference_.
====
--
+
.. After review, run the `aws` commands manually to create the roles and policies. Alternatively, you can run the preceding command using `--mode auto` to run the `aws` commands immediately.

. Optional: If you are using your own AWS KMS key to encrypt the control plane, infrastructure, worker node root volumes, and persistent volumes (PVs), add the ARN for the account-wide installer role to your KMS key policy.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Only persistent volumes (PVs) created from the default storage class are encrypted with this specific key.

PVs created by using any other storage class are still encrypted, but the PVs are not encrypted with this key unless the storage class is specifically configured to use this key.
====

.. Save the key policy for your KMS key to a file on your local machine. The following example saves the output to `kms-key-policy.json` in the current working directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws kms get-key-policy --key-id <key_id_or_arn> --policy-name default --output text > kms-key-policy.json <1>
----
<1> Replace `<key_id_or_arn>` with the ID or ARN of your KMS key.
+
.. Add the ARN for the account-wide installer role that you created in the preceding step to the `Statement.Principal.AWS` section in the file. In the following example, the ARN for the default `ManagedOpenShift-Installer-Role` role is added:
+
[source,json]

<1> You must specify the ARN for the account-wide role that will be used when you create the ROSA cluster. The ARNs listed in the section must be comma-separated.
<2> You must specify the ARN for the operator role that will be used when you create the ROSA cluster. The ARNs listed in the section must be comma-separated.

.. Apply the changes to your KMS key policy:

[source,terminal]
----
$ aws kms put-key-policy --key-id <key_id_or_arn> \ <1>
    --policy file://kms-key-policy.json \ <2>
    --policy-name default
----
<1> Replace `<key_id_or_arn>` with the ID or ARN of your KMS key.
<2> You must include the `file://` prefix when referencing a key policy in a local file.
+
You can reference the ARN of your KMS key when you create the cluster in the next step.

. Create a cluster with STS using custom installation options. You can use the `--interactive` mode to interactively specify custom settings:
+
[WARNING]
====
You cannot install a ROSA cluster into an existing VPC that was created by the OpenShift installer. These VPCs are created during the cluster deployment process and must only be associated with a single cluster to ensure that cluster provisioning and deletion operations work correctly.

To verify whether a VPC was created by the OpenShift installer, check for the `owned` value on the `kubernetes.io/cluster/<infra-id>` tag. For example, when viewing the tags for the VPC named `mycluster-12abc-34def`, the `kubernetes.io/cluster/mycluster-12abc-34def` tag has a value of `owned`. Therefore, the VPC was created by the installer and must not be modified by the administrator.

...
----
<1> Optional. When creating your cluster, you can customize the subdomain for your cluster on `*.openshiftapps.com` using the `--domain-prefix` flag. The value for this flag must be unique within your organization, cannot be longer than 15 characters, and cannot be changed after cluster creation. If the flag is not supplied, an autogenerated value is created that depends on the length of the cluster name. If the cluster name is fewer than or equal to 15 characters, that name is used for the domain prefix. If the cluster name is longer than 15 characters, the domain prefix is randomly generated to a 15 character string.
<2> When creating your cluster, you can create a local administrator user (`cluster-admin`) for your cluster. This automatically configures an `htpasswd` identity provider for the `cluster-admin` user.
<3> You can create a custom password for the `cluster-admin` user, or have the system generate a password. If you do not create a custom password, the generated password is displayed in the command line output. If you specify a custom password, the password must be at least 14 characters (ASCII-standard) without any whitespace. When defined, the password is hashed and transported securely.
<4> When creating the cluster, the listed `OpenShift version` options include the major, minor, and patch versions, for example `4.17.0`.
<5> Optional: Specify `optional` to configure all EC2 instances to use both v1 and v2 endpoints of EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). This is the default value. Specify `required` to configure all EC2 instances to use IMDSv2 only.
+
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Instance Metadata Service settings cannot be changed after your cluster is created.
====
endif::openshift-rosa[]
+
<6> If you have more than one set of account roles for your cluster version in your {AWS} account, an interactive list of options is provided.
<7> Optional: Specify an unique identifier that is passed by {product-title} and the OpenShift installer when an account role is assumed. This option is only required for custom account roles that expect an external ID.
<8> By default, the cluster-specific Operator role names are prefixed with the cluster name and a random 4-digit hash. You can optionally specify a custom prefix to replace `<cluster_name>-<hash>` in the role names. The prefix is applied when you create the cluster-specific Operator IAM roles. For information about the prefix, see _About custom Operator IAM role prefixes_.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you specified custom ARN paths when you created the associated account-wide roles, the custom path is automatically detected. The custom path is applied to the cluster-specific Operator roles when you create them in a later step.
====
<9> Optional: Specify a tag that is used on all resources created by {product-title} in AWS. Tags can help you manage, identify, organize, search for, and filter resources within AWS. Tags are comma separated, for example: `key value, data input`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} only supports custom tags to Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift resources during cluster creation. Once added, the tags cannot be removed or edited.
Tags that are added by Red{nbsp}Hat are required for clusters to stay in compliance with Red{nbsp}Hat production service level agreements (SLAs). These tags must not be removed.

{product-title} does not support adding additional tags outside of ROSA cluster-managed resources. These tags can be lost when AWS resources are managed by the ROSA cluster. In these cases, you might need custom solutions or tools to reconcile the tags and keep them intact.
====
<10> Optional: Multiple availability zones are recommended for production workloads. The default is a single availability zone.
<11> Optional: You can create a cluster in an existing VPC, or ROSA can create a new VPC to use.
+
[WARNING]
====
You cannot install a ROSA cluster into an existing VPC that was created by the OpenShift installer. These VPCs are created during the cluster deployment process and must only be associated with a single cluster to ensure that cluster provisioning and deletion operations work correctly.

To verify whether a VPC was created by the OpenShift installer, check for the `owned` value on the `kubernetes.io/cluster/<infra-id>` tag. For example, when viewing the tags for the VPC named `mycluster-12abc-34def`, the `kubernetes.io/cluster/mycluster-12abc-34def` tag has a value of `owned`. Therefore, the VPC was created by the installer and must not be modified by the administrator.
====
<12> Optional: Enable this option if you are using your own AWS KMS key to encrypt the control plane, infrastructure, worker node root volumes, and PVs. Specify the ARN for the KMS key that you added to the account-wide role ARN in the preceding step.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Only persistent volumes (PVs) created from the default storage class are encrypted with this specific key.

PVs created by using any other storage class are still encrypted, but the PVs are not encrypted with this key unless the storage class is specifically configured to use this key.
====

<13> Optional: You can select additional custom security groups to use in your cluster. You must have already created the security groups and associated them with the VPC you selected for this cluster. You cannot add or edit security groups for the default machine pools after you create the machine pool. For more information, see the requirements for _Security groups_ under _Additional resources_.
<14> Optional: Enable this option if you require your cluster to be FIPS validated. Selecting this option means the encrypt etcd data option is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. You can encrypt etcd data without enabling FIPS support.
<15> Optional: Enable this option if your use case only requires etcd key value encryption in addition to the control plane storage encryption that encrypts the etcd volumes by default. With this option, the etcd key values are encrypted but not the keys.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
By enabling etcd encryption for the key values in etcd, you will incur a performance overhead of approximately 20%. The overhead is a result of introducing this second layer of encryption, in addition to the default control plane storage encryption that encrypts the etcd volumes. Red{nbsp}Hat recommends that you enable etcd encryption only if you specifically require it for your use case.
====
+
<16> The output includes a custom command that you can run to create another cluster with the same configuration.
--
+
As an alternative to using the `--interactive` mode, you can specify the customization options directly when you run the `rosa create cluster` command. Run the `rosa create cluster --help` command to view a list of available CLI options, or see _create cluster_ in _Managing objects with the ROSA CLI_.

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must complete the following steps to create the Operator IAM roles and the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider to move the state of the cluster to `ready`.
====

. Create the cluster-specific Operator IAM roles:
.. Generate the Operator IAM policy JSON files in the current working directory and output the `aws` CLI commands for review:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create operator-roles --mode manual --cluster <cluster_name|cluster_id> <1>
----
<1> `manual` mode generates the `aws` CLI commands and JSON files needed to create the Operator roles. After review, you must run the commands manually to create the resources.
.. After review, run the `aws` commands manually to create the Operator IAM roles and attach the managed Operator policies to them. Alternatively, you can run the preceding command again using `--mode auto` to run the `aws` commands immediately.
+
[NOTE]
====
A custom prefix is applied to the Operator role names if you specified the prefix in the preceding step.

If you specified custom ARN paths when you created the associated account-wide roles, the custom path is automatically detected and applied to the Operator roles.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The EBS Operator role is required in addition to the account roles to successfully create your cluster.

This role must be attached with the `ManagedOpenShift-openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-ebs-cloud-credentials` policy, an IAM policy required by ROSA to manage back-end storage through the Container Storage Interface (CSI).

For more information about the policies and permissions that the cluster Operators require, see _Methods of account-wide role creation_.
.Example EBS Operator role
`"arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/<cluster_name>-xxxx-openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-ebs-cloud-credent"`

After you create your Operator roles, you must edit the _Key Policy_ in the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms[*Key Management Service (KMS)* page of the AWS Console] to add the roles.
====

. Create the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that the cluster Operators use to authenticate:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create oidc-provider --mode auto --cluster <cluster_name|cluster_id> <1>
----
<1> `auto` mode immediately runs the `aws` CLI command that creates the OIDC provider.

. Check the status of your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe cluster --cluster <cluster_name|cluster_id>
