= Deleting a build resource

[role="_abstract"]
You can delete a `build` resource created by the `Buildah`, `source-to-image` (S2I), and `Buildpacks` build processes using the `oc` CLI or the `shp` CLI. Deleting the resources helps you clean up build configurations that are no longer required in your project.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the `oc` CLI.
* Optional: You have installed the shp CLI.

.Procedure

* Delete a `build` resource by using one of the following CLIs:

** Using `oc` CLI
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete builds <build_resource_name> # <1>
----
<1> Replace <build_resource_name> with the name of the `build` resource.

** Using `shp` CLI
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp build delete <build_resource_name> # <1>
----
<1> Replace <build_resource_name> with the name of the `build` resource.
