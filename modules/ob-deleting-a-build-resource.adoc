= Deleting a build resource

[role="_abstract"]
Delete a `build` resource created by the `buildah`, `source-to-image` (S2I), and `buildpacks` build processes using the `oc` CLI or the `shp` CLI. This cleanup ensures that unused build configurations are removed, keeping your project organized and efficient.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the `oc` CLI.
* Optional: You have installed the `shp` CLI.

.Procedure

* Delete a `build` resource by using the `oc` CLI or `shp` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete builds <build_resource_name>
----

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp build delete <build_resource_name>
----
+
where:

`<build_resource_name>`:: Specifies the name of the `build` resource.

.Verification

* Verify that the `build` resource is deleted by using the `oc` CLI or `shp` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get build | grep <build_resource_name>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp build list | grep <build_resource_name>
----
+
where:

`<build_resource_name>`:: Specifies the name of the `build` resource.
+
If the `build` resource is successfully deleted, the commands do not return any output.
