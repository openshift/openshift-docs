= Round-Trip Time
You can use TCP smoothed Round-Trip Time (sRTT) to analyze network flow latencies. You can use RTT captured from the `fentry/tcp_rcv_established` eBPF hookpoint to read sRTT from the TCP socket to help with the following:


* Network Monitoring: Gain insights into TCP latencies, helping
  network administrators identify unusual patterns, potential bottlenecks, or
  performance issues.
* Troubleshooting: Debug TCP-related issues by tracking latency and identifying
  misconfigurations.

By default, when RTT is enabled, you can see the following TCP RTT metrics represented in the *Overview*:

* Top X 90th percentile TCP Round Trip Time with overall
* Top X average TCP Round Trip Time with overall
* Bottom X minimum TCP Round Trip Time with overall

Other RTT panels can be added in *Manage panels*:

* Top X maximum TCP Round Trip Time with overall
* Top X 99th percentile TCP Round Trip Time with overall

See the _Additional resources_ in this section for more information about enabling and working with this view.
