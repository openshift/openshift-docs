= Viewing vulnerabilities in nodes

You can identify vulnerabilities in your nodes by using {product-title-short}. The vulnerabilities that are identified include the following:

* Vulnerabilities in core Kubernetes components
* Vulnerabilities in container runtimes such as Docker, CRI-O, runC, and containerd

For more information about operating systems that {product-title-short} can scan, see "Supported operating systems".

{product-title-short} currently supports scanning nodes with the StackRox scanner and Scanner V4. Depending on which scanner is configured, different results might appear in the list of vulnerabilities. For more information, see "Understanding differences in scanning results between the StackRox Scanner and Scanner V4".

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Vulnerability Management* -> *Results*.
. Select the *Nodes* tab.
. Optional: The page defaults to a list of observed CVEs. Click *Show snoozed CVEs* to view them.
. Optional: To filter CVEs according to entity, select the appropriate filters and attributes. To add more filtering criteria, follow these steps:
.. Select the entity or attribute from the list.
.. Depending on your choices, enter the appropriate information such as text, or select a date or object.
.. Click the right arrow icon.
.. Optional: Select additional entities and attributes, and then click the right arrow icon to add them.
The filter entities and attributes are listed in the following table.

|Entity|Attributes

|Node
a|
* *Name*: The name of the node.
* *Operating system*: The operating system of the node, for example, {op-system-base-full}.
* *Label*: The label of the node.
* *Annotation*: The annotation for the node.
* *Scan time*: The scan date of the node.
|CVE
a|
* *Name*: The name of the CVE.
* *Discovered time*: The date when {product-title-short} discovered the CVE.
* *CVSS*: The severity level for the CVE.
+
The following values are associated with the severity level for the CVE:
+
** *is greater than*
** *is greater than or equal to*
** *is equal to*
** *is less than or equal to*
** *is less than*
|Node Component
a|
* *Name*: The name of the component.
* *Version*: The version of the component, for example, `4.15.0-2024`. You can use this to search for a specific version of a component, for example, in conjunction with a component name.
|Cluster
a|
* *ID*: The alphanumeric ID for the cluster. This is an internal identifier that {product-title-short} assigns for tracking purposes.
* *Name*: The name of the cluster.
* *Label*: The label for the cluster.
* *Type*: The type of cluster, for example, OCP.
* *Platform type*: The type of platform, for example, OpenShift 4 cluster.

. Optional: To refine the list of results, do any of the following tasks:
* Click *CVE severity*, and then select one or more levels.
* Click *CVE status*, and then select *Fixable* or *Not fixable*.
. To view the data, click one of the following tabs:
* *<number> CVEs*: Displays a list of all the CVEs affecting all of your nodes.
* *<number> Nodes*: Displays a list of nodes that contain CVEs.
. To view the details of the node and information about the CVEs according to the CVSS score and fixable CVEs for that node, click a node name in the list of nodes.
