= Creating firewall rules for port 6183

Port `6183` is open by default on the control plane. However, you must create a firewall rule for the VPC connection and for the on-premise network for the bare metal nodes to allow inbound and outbound traffic on that port.

.Procedure

. Modify the AWS VPC security group to open port `6183`:

.. Navigate to the Amazon VPC console in the AWS Management Console.
.. In the left navigation pane, click on **Security Groups**.
.. Find and select the security group associated with the {product-title} cluster.
.. In the **Inbound rules** tab, click **Edit inbound rules**.
.. Click **Add rule** and select **Custom TCP Rule** as the rule type.
.. In the **Port range** field, enter `6183`.
.. In the **Source** field, specify the CIDR block for the on-premise network or the security group ID of the peered VPC (if you have VPC peering) to allow traffic only from the desired sources.
.. Click **Save rules**.

. Modify the AWS VPC network access control lists to open port `6183`:

.. In the Amazon VPC console, click on **Network ACLs** in the left navigation pane.
.. Find and select the network ACL associated with your {product-title} cluster's VPC.
.. In the **Inbound rules** tab, click **Edit inbound rules**.
.. Click **Add rule** and enter a rule number in the **Rule #** field. Choose a number that doesn't conflict with existing rules.
.. Select `TCP` as the protocol.
.. In the **Port range** field, enter `6183`.
.. In the **Source** field, specify the CIDR block for the on-premise network to allow traffic only from the desired sources.
.. Click **Save** to save the new rule.
.. Repeat the same process for the **Outbound rules** tab to allow outbound traffic on port `6183`.

. Modify the on-premise network to allow traffic on port `6183`:

.. Execute the following command to identify the zone you want to modify:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
----

.. To open port `6183` for TCP traffic in the desired zone execute the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=<zone> --add-port=6183/tcp --permanent
----
+
Replace `<zone>` with the appropriate zone name.

.. Reload `firewalld` to apply the new rule:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----
