[id="rosa-sts-cluster-terraform-execute_{context}"]
= Using Terraform to create your ROSA cluster

After you create the Terraform files, you must initiate Terraform to provide all of the required dependencies. Then apply the Terraform plan.

include::snippets/terraform-modification-disclaimer.adoc[]

.Procedure

. Set up Terraform to create your resources based on your Terraform files, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform init
----

. *Optional*: Verify that the Terraform you copied is correct by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform validate
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
Success! The configuration is valid.
----

. Create your cluster with Terraform by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform apply
----

. The Terraform interface lists the resources to be created or changed and prompts for confirmation. Enter `yes` to proceed or `no` to cancel:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Plan: 39 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
----
+
If you enter `yes`, your Terraform plan starts, creating your AWS account roles, Operator roles, and your ROSA Classic cluster.

.Verification
. Verify that your cluster was created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list clusters
----
+
.Example output showing a cluster's ID, name, and status:
+
