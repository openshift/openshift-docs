[id="rosa-sts-cluster-terraform-execute_{context}"]
= Using Terraform to create your ROSA cluster

After you create the Terraform files, you must initiate Terraform to provide all of the required dependencies. Then apply the Terraform plan.

include::snippets/terraform-modification-disclaimer.adoc[]

.Procedure

. Set up Terraform to create your resources based on your Terraform files, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform init
----

. *Optional*: Verify that the Terraform you copied is correct by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform validate
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
Success! The configuration is valid.
----

. Create your cluster with Terraform by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform apply
----
+
The Terraform interface asks two questions to create your cluster, similiar to the following:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
var.create_vpc
  If you would like to create a new VPC, set this value to 'true'. If you do not want to create a new VPC, set this value to 'false'.

  Enter a value: 

var.private_cluster
  If you want to create a private cluster, set this value to 'true'. If you want a publicly available cluster, set this value to 'false'.

  Enter a value: 
----

. Enter `yes` to proceed or `no` to cancel when the Terraform interface lists the resources to be created or changed and prompts for confirmation:
+
ifdef::tf-rosa-hcp[]
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Plan: 63 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
----
endif::tf-rosa-hcp[]
ifdef::tf-rosa-classic[]
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Plan: 74 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
----
endif::tf-rosa-classic[]
+
If you enter `yes`, your Terraform plan starts, creating your AWS account roles, Operator roles, and your ROSA Classic cluster.

.Verification
. Verify that your cluster was created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list clusters
----
+
.Example output showing a cluster's ID, name, and status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
ID                                NAME          STATE  TOPOLOGY

----

. Verify that your account roles were created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list account-roles
----
+
.Example output

. Verify that your Operator roles were created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list operator-roles
