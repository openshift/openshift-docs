= Reverting an on-cluster custom layered image

You can revert an on-cluster custom layered image from nodes by removing the label for the machine config pool (MCP) that you specified in the `MachineOSConfig` object. After you remove the label, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) reboots the nodes in that MCP with the cluster base {op-system-first} image, along with any previously-made machine config changes, overriding the custom layered image. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the node where the custom layered image is deployed uses a custom machine config pool, before you remove the label, make sure the node is associated with a second MCP.
====

You can reapply the custom layered image to the node by using the `oc label node/<node_name> 'node-role.kubernetes.io/<mcp_name>='` label.

.Prerequisites

* You have opted in to on-cluster layering by creating a `MachineOSConfig` object.

.Procedure

* Remove the label from the node by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node/<node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/<mcp_name>-
----
+
When you save the changes, the MCO drains, cordons, and reboots the nodes. After the reboot, the node uses the cluster base {op-system-first} image.

.Verification

You can verify that the custom layered image is removed by performing the following checks:

. Check that the worker machine config pool is updating with the previous machine config:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp

<1> The value `FALSE` in the `UPDATED` column indicates that the `MachineOSBuild` object is building. When the `UPDATED` column reports `FALSE`, the base image has rolled out to the nodes.

. Check the nodes to see that scheduling on the nodes is disabled. This indicates that the change is being applied:

. When the node is back in the `Ready` state, check that the node is using the base image:

.. Open an `oc debug` session to the node. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----

.. Set `/host` as the root directory within the debug shell:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-5.1# chroot /host
----

.. Run an `rpm-ostree status` command to view that the base image is in use:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-5.1# rpm-ostree status
----

.Example output
