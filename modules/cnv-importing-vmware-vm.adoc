= Importing a VMware virtual machine or template

You can import a VMware virtual machine or template using the virtual machine wizard.

.Prerequisites

* You must create a VDDK image, push it to a private container repository, and add it to the `v2v-vmware` ConfigMap.
* There must be sufficient storage space for the imported disk.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you try to import a virtual machine whose disk size is larger than the available storage space, the operation will not complete. You will not be able to import another virtual machine or to delete PVCs or PVs because the Ceph storage will not have sufficient resources for object deletion. You must add more Ceph OSDs to clean up the storage.
====

If you try to import a virtual machine whose disk size is larger than the available storage space, the operation will not complete. You will not be able to import another virtual machine and storage will be unable to be cleaned up.  This is due to not having enough overhead available to support the object deletion.  To resolve add more OSD's to the storage backend.

* The VMware virtual machine must be powered off.

.Procedure

. In the {CNVProductName} web console, click *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines*.
. Click *Create Virtual Machine* and select *Import with Wizard*.
. In the *General* screen, perform the following steps:
.. Select *VMware* from the *Provider* list.
.. Select *Connect to New Instance* or a saved vCenter instance from the *vCenter instance* list.

** If you select *Connect to New Instance*, fill in the *vCenter hostname*, *Username*, and *Password*.
** If you select a saved vCenter instance, the  wizard connects to the vCenter instance using the saved credentials.

.. Select a virtual machine or a template to import from the *VM or Template to Import* list.
.. Select an operating system.
.. Select an existing flavor or *Custom* from the *Flavor* list.
+
If you select *Custom*, specify the *Memory (GB)* and the *CPUs*.
.. Select a *Workload Profile*.
.. If the virtual machine name is already being used by another virtual machine in the namespace, update the name.
.. Click *Next*.

. In the *Networking* screen, perform the following steps:

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} of a network interface and select *Edit*.
.. Enter a valid network interface name.
+
The name can contain lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), and hyphens (`-`), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, periods (`.`), or special characters.

.. Select the network interface model.
.. Select the network definition.
.. Select the network interface type.
.. Enter the MAC address.
.. Click *Save* and then click *Next*.

. In the *Storage* screen, perform the following steps:

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} of a disk and select *Edit*.
+
.. Enter a valid name.
+
The name can contain lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), and hyphens (`-`), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, periods (`.`), or special characters.

.. Select the interface type.
.. Select the storage class.
+
If you do not select a storage class, {CNVProductName} uses the default storage class to create the virtual machine.

.. Click *Save* and then click *Next*.

. In the *Advanced* screen, enter the *Hostname* and *Authorized SSH Keys* if you are using `cloud-init`.
+
You must xref:../../../cnv/cnv-virtual-machines/cnv-edit-vms.adoc#cnv-editing-vm-yaml-web_cnv-edit-vms[edit the virtual machine's YAML configuration] after importing it:

.. In the `cloudInitNoCloud` stanza, under `userData`, change `ssh-authorized-keys` to `ssh_authorized_keys`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- cloudInitNoCloud:
    userData: |
      #cloud-config
      name: default
      hostname: myhostname
      ssh-authorized-keys:
----

.. Restart the virtual machine.
+
See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1786350[BZ#1786350] for details.

. Click *Next*.

. Review your settings and click *Create Virtual Machine*.
+
A *Successfully created virtual machine* message and a list of resources created for the virtual machine are displayed. The powered off virtual machine appears in *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines*.

. Click *See virtual machine details* to view the dashboard of the imported virtual machine.
+
If an error occurs, perform the following steps:

.. Click *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
.. Click the Conversion Pod, for example, `kubevirt-v2v-conversion-rhel7-mini-1-27b9h`.
.. Click *Logs* and check for error messages.
