= Importing a VMware virtual machine or template

You can use the {ProductName} web console to import a VMware virtual machine or template. If you import a template, a virtual machine based on the template is created.

.Prerequisites

* The VMware virtual machine is powered off.
* The VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) has been uploaded to the namespace in which you are importing the virtual machine.

.Procedure

The *Name* and *Operating System* are filled in automatically with the attributes of the selected virtual machine or template. The *Flavor* will be the flavor that matches the virtual machine's CPU and memory configuration most closely. You can change these fields.
