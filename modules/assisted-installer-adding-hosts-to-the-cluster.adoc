= Adding hosts to the cluster

You must add one or more hosts to the cluster. Adding a host to the cluster involves generating a discovery ISO. The discovery ISO runs {op-system-first} in-memory with an agent. Perform the following procedure for each host on the cluster.

.Procedure

. Click the *Add hosts* button and select the installation media.

.. Select *Minimal image file: Provision with virtual media* to download a smaller image that will fetch the data needed to boot. The nodes must have virtual media capability. This is the recommended method.

.. Select *Full image file: Provision with physical media* to download the larger full image.

. Add an SSH public key so that you can connect to the cluster nodes as the `core` user. Having a login to the cluster nodes can provide you with debugging information during the installation.

. Optional: If the cluster hosts are behind a firewall that requires the use of a proxy, select *Configure cluster-wide proxy settings*. Enter the username, password, IP address and port for the HTTP and HTTPS URLs of the proxy server.

. Click *Generate Discovery ISO*.

. Download the discovery ISO.
