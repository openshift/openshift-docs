If a cluster creation action fails, you might receive the following error messages.

**Example install logs output:**
[source,terminal]
----
Client.InvalidKMSKey.InvalidState: The KMS key provided is in an incorrect state
----

**Example {cluster-manager} output:**
[source,terminal]
----
Provisioning Error Code:    OCM3055
Provisioning Error Message: Invalid key.
----

This error indicates that the KMS key is invalid or the key is in an invalid state.

.Procedure

. Start by checking if EBS encryption is enabled in the EC2 settings. You can check the status by following the steps in link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-by-default[AWS Check EBS Encryption].

. Check to see if the AWS specified key is enabled in there and not an `invalidKMSKey` that does not exist. This could happen when an old key was specified and deleted but EBS did not fall back to another key.

. If the previous two steps failed to fix the issue, disable EBS encryption entirely. If this is still a requirement you cannot disable, you can specify a customer-managed-key during ROSA install following the steps in link:https://cloud.redhat.com/experts/rosa/kms/?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001Css5AAC[Creating a ROSA cluster in STS mode with custom KMS key].
