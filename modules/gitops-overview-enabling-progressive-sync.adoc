= Overview of enabling Progressive Sync

Progressive Sync in {gitops-shortname} enable administrators to orchestrate safe, staged rollouts of changes across groups of applications.

When enabled:

* The UI displays rollout wave, health, and messages for each application.
* Teams can track rollout progress, identify bottlenecks, and ensure compliance with deployment policies.
* A new section, *Progressive Sync*, appears in the Application details panel when an application is managed by an `ApplicationSet` controller with the `RollingSync` strategy.

This feature enhances transparency for multi-wave, staged, or progressive deployments managed through {gitops-shortname}.
