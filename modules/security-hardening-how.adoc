= Choosing how to harden {op-system}

Direct modification of {op-system} systems in {product-title} is discouraged.
Instead, you should think of modifying systems in pools of nodes, such
as worker nodes and master nodes. When a new node is needed, in
non-bare metal installs, you can request a new node of the type
you want and it will be created from an {op-system} image plus the
modifications you created earlier.

There are opportunities for modifying {op-system} before installation,
during installation, and after the cluster is up and running.

[id="security-harden-before-installation_{context}"]
== Hardening before installation

For bare metal installations, you can add hardening features to
{op-system} before beginning the {product-title} installation. For example,
you can add kernel options when you boot the {op-system} installer
to turn security features on or off, such as SELinux or various
low-level settings, such as symmetric multithreading.

Although bare metal {op-system} installations are more difficult,
they offer the opportunity of getting operating system
changes in place before starting the {product-title} installation. This can be important when you need to ensure that certain
features, such as disk encryption or special networking settings, be
set up at the earliest possible moment.

[id="security-harden-during-installation_{context}"]
== Hardening during installation

You can interrupt the OpenShift installation process and change
Ignition configs. Through Ignition configs, you can add your own files
and systemd services to the {op-system} nodes.
You can also make some basic security-related changes to the `install-config.yaml` file
used for installation.
Contents added in this way are available at each node's first boot.

[id="security-harden-after-installation_{context}"]
== Hardening after the cluster is running
After the {product-title} cluster is up and running, there are
several ways to apply hardening features to {op-system}:

* DaemonSet: If you need a service to run on every node, you can add
that service with a
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/[Kubernetes DaemonSet].
* MachineConfig: `MachineConfig` objects contain a subset of Ignition configs in the same format.
By applying MachineConfigs to all worker or control plane nodes,
you can ensure that the next node of the same type that is added
to the cluster has the same changes applied.

All of the features noted here are described in the {product-title}
product documentation.
