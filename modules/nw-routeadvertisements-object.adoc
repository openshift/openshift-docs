= RouteAdvertisements object configuration

You can define an `RouteAdvertisements` object, which is cluster scoped, with the following properties.

The fields for the `RouteAdvertisements` custom resource (CR) are described in the following table:

.`RouteAdvertisements` object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|Specifies the name of the `RouteAdvertisements` object.

|`advertisements`
|`array`
|Specifies an array that can contain a list of different types of networks to advertise. Supports only the `"PodNetwork"` and `"EgressIP"` values.

|`frrConfigurationSelector`
|`object`
|Determines which `FRRConfiguration` CR the OVN-Kubernetes driven `FRRConfiguration` CR is based on.

|`networkSelector`
|`object`
|Specifies which networks to advertise among default cluster network and cluster user defined networks (CUDNs).

|`nodeSelector`
|`object`
|
Limits the advertisements to selected nodes. When `advertisements="PodNetwork"` is selected, all nodes must be selected. When `advertisements="EgressIP"` is selected, only the egress IP addresses assigned to the selected nodes are advertised.

|`targetVRF`
|`string`
|Determines which router to advertise the routes in. Routes are advertised on the routers associated with this virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) target, as specified on the selected `FRRConfiguration` CR. When omitted, the default VRF is used as the target. When specified as `auto`, a VRF with the same name as the network name is used as the target.
