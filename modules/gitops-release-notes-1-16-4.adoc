== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the `extraCommandArgs` field in the Argo CD custom resource did not support using the same flag multiple times with different values. With this update, repeated flags are correctly handled. Multiple instances of flags can be specified, and all values are included in the controller pod configuration. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6703[GITOPS-6703]

* Before this update, when upgrading the {gitops-title} Operator from version 1.15.x to 1.16.x or later with high availability (HA) enabled, the `redis-ha-proxy` pod could become stuck during the automatic rollout. With this update, the issue is resolved by updating the Operator's resource management logic to properly reconcile the required permissions and security context fields during the upgrade. As a result, the `redis-ha-proxy` pod rolls out successfully and automatically when the {gitops-title} Operator is upgraded, eliminating the need for manual intervention, such as deleting the deployment. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-7180[GITOPS-7180]
