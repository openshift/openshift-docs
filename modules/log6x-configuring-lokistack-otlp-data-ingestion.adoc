= Configuring LokiStack for OTLP data ingestion

:FeatureName: The OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) output log forwarder
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

To configure a `LokiStack` custom resource (CR) for OTLP ingestion, follow these steps:

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that your Loki setup supports structured metadata, introduced in schema version 13 to enable OTLP log ingestion.

.Procedure

. Set the schema version:
+
** When creating a new `LokiStack` CR, set `version: v13` in the storage schema configuration.
+
[NOTE]
====
For existing configurations, add a new schema entry with `version: v13` and an `effectiveDate` in the future. For more information on updating schema versions, see link:https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configure/storage/#upgrading-schemas[Upgrading Schemas] (Grafana documentation).
====

. Configure the storage schema as follows:
+
.Example configure storage schema
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  storage:
    schemas:
    - version: v13
      effectiveDate: 2024-10-25
----
+
Once the `effectiveDate` has passed, the v13 schema takes effect, enabling your `LokiStack` to store structured metadata.
