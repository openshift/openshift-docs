= Reviewing events

You can review the events in a given namespace to find potential issues.

.Procedure

. Check for events in your namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get events -n <namespace> --sort-by=".metadata.creationTimestamp" <1>
----
<1> Adding the `--sort-by=".metadata.creationTimestamp"` flag places the most recent events at the end of the output.

. Optional: If the events within your specified namespace do not provide enough information, expand your query to all namespaces by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get events -A --sort-by=".metadata.creationTimestamp" <1>
----
<1> The `--sort-by=".metadata.creationTimestamp"` flag places the most recent events at the end of the output.
+
To filter the results of all events from a cluster, you can use the `grep` command.
For example, if you are looking for errors, the errors can appear in two different sections of the output: the `TYPE` or `MESSAGE` sections.
With the `grep` command, you can search for keywords, such as `error` or `failed`.

. For example, search for a message that contains `warning` or `error` by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get events -A | grep -Ei "warning|error"
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE    LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON          OBJECT              MESSAGE
openshift    59s         Warning   FailedMount     pod/openshift-1     MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "v4-0-config-user-idp-0-file-data" : references non-existent secret key: test
----
--

. Optional: To clean up the events and see only recurring events, you can delete the events in the relevant namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete events -n <namespace> --all
----
