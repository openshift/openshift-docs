[id="configuring-workload-hints_{context}"]
= Configuring node power consumption and realtime processing with workload hints

.Procedure

* Create a `PerformanceProfile` appropriate for the environment's hardware and topology by using the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool. The following table describes the possible values set for the `power-consumption-mode` flag associated with the PPC tool and the workload hint that is applied. 

.Impact of combinations of power consumption and real-time settings on latency
[cols="1,1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|Performance Profile creator setting |Hint |Environment |Description

|Default
a|[source,terminal]
----
workloadHints:
highPowerConsumption: false
realTime: false
----
|High throughput cluster without latency requirements
|Performance achieved through CPU partitioning only.

|Low-latency
a|[source,terminal]
----
workloadHints:
highPowerConsumption: false
realTime: true
----
|Regional data-centers
|Both energy savings and low-latency are desirable: compromise between power management, latency and throughput.

|Ultra-low-latency
a|[source,terminal]
----
workloadHints:
highPowerConsumption: true
realTime: true
----
|Far edge clusters, latency critical workloads
|Optimized for absolute minimal latency and maximum determinism at the cost of increased power consumption.

|Per-pod power management
a|[source,terminal]
----
workloadHints:
realTime: true
highPowerConsumption: false
perPodPowerManagement: true
----
|Critical and non-critical workloads
|Allows for power management per pod.
|===

.Example

The following configuration is commonly used in a telco RAN DU deployment. 

[source,yaml]
----
    apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
    kind: PerformanceProfile
    metadata:
      name: workload-hints
    spec:
      ...
      workloadHints:
        realTime: true
        highPowerConsumption: false
        perPodPowerManagement: false <1>
----
<1> Disables some debugging and monitoring features that can affect system latency.

[NOTE]
====
When the `realTime` workload hint flag is set to `true` in a performance profile, add the `cpu-quota.crio.io: disable` annotation to every guaranteed pod with pinned CPUs. This annotation is necessary to prevent the degradation of the process performance within the pod. If the `realTime` workload hint is not explicitly set, it defaults to `true`.
