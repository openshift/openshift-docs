= Configuring workload hints manually

.Procedure

. Create a `PerformanceProfile` appropriate for the environment's hardware and topology as described in the table in "Understanding workload hints". Adjust the profile to match the expected workload. In this example, we tune for the lowest possible latency.

. Add the `highPowerConsumption` and `realTime` workload hints. Both are set to `true` here.

[source,yaml]
----
    apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
    kind: PerformanceProfile
    metadata:
      name: workload-hints
    spec:
      ...
      workloadHints:
        highPowerConsumption: true <1>
        realTime: true <2>
----
<1> If `highPowerConsumption` is `true`, the node is tuned for very low latency at the cost of increased power consumption.
<2> Disables some debugging and monitoring features that can affect system latency.

[NOTE]
====
When the `realTime` workload hint flag is set to `true` in a performance profile, add the `cpu-quota.crio.io: disable` annotation to every guaranteed pod with pinned CPUs. This annotation is necessary to prevent the degradation of the process performance within the pod. If the `realTime` workload hint is not explicitly set then it defaults to `true`.
