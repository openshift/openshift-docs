= Comparison of LVM Storage, LSO, and HPP

The following sections compare the functionalities provided by {lvms}, Local Storage Operator (LSO), and HostPath Provisioner (HPP) to provision local storage.

[id="comparing-storage-types_{context}"]
== Comparison of the support for storage types and filesystems

The following table compares the support for storage types and filesystems provided by {lvms}, Local Storage Operator (LSO), and HostPath Provisioner (HPP) to provision local storage:

|Functionality|LVM Storage|LSO |HPP

|Support for block storage |Yes |Yes |No

|Support for file storage |Yes |Yes |Yes

|Support for object storage ^[1]^ |No |No |No

|Available filesystems |`ext4`, `xfs` |`ext4`, `xfs` |Any mounted system available on the node is supported.

1. None of the solutions ({lvms}, LSO, and HPP) provide support for object storage. Therefore, if you want to use object storage, you need an S3 object storage solution, such as `MultiClusterGateway` from the Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Data Foundation. All of the solutions can serve as underlying storage providers for the S3 object storage solutions.

[id="comparing-core-functionalities_{context}"]
== Comparison of the support for core functionalities

The following table compares how {lvms}, Local Storage Operator (LSO), and HostPath Provisioner (HPP) support core functionalities for provisioning local storage:

[cols="6a,5a,5a,5a",options="header"]
|====

|Functionality|LVM Storage|LSO |HPP

|Support for automatic file system formatting |Yes |Yes |N/A

|Support for dynamic provisioning |Yes |No |No

|Support for using software Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) arrays 
|Yes 

Supported on 4.15 and later.

|Yes |Yes

|Support for transparent disk encryption |Yes 

Supported on 4.16 and later.

|Yes |Yes

|Support for volume based disk encryption |No |No |No

|Support for disconnected installation |Yes |Yes |Yes

|Support for PVC expansion |Yes |No |No

|Support for volume snapshots and volume clones |Yes |No |No

|Support for thin provisioning |Yes

Devices are thin-provisioned by default.

|Yes

You can configure the devices to point to the thin-provisioned volumes

|Yes

You can configure a path to point to the thin-provisioned volumes.

|Support for automatic disk discovery and setup |Yes

Automatic disk discovery is available during installation and runtime. You can also dynamically add the disks to the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) to increase the storage capacity of the existing storage classes.

|Technology Preview

Automatic disk discovery is available during installation. 

|No

[id="comparing-performance-and-isolation-boundary_{context}"]
== Comparison of performance and isolation capabilities

The following table compares the performance and isolation capabilities of {lvms}, Local Storage Operator (LSO), and HostPath Provisioner (HPP) in provisioning local storage.

.Comparison of performance and isolation capabilities
[cols="5a,6a,6a,6a",options="header"]

|Functionality|LVM Storage|LSO |HPP

|Performance

|I/O speed is shared for all workloads that use the same storage class. 

Block storage allows direct I/O operations. 

Thin provisioning can affect the performance. 

|I/O depends on the LSO configuration.

Block storage allows direct I/O operations.

|I/O speed is shared for all workloads that use the same storage class.

The restrictions imposed by the underlying filesystem can affect the I/O speed.

|Isolation boundary ^[1]^

|LVM Logical Volume (LV)

It provides higher level of isolation compared to HPP.

|LVM Logical Volume (LV)

It provides higher level of isolation compared to HPP

|Filesystem path

It provides lower level of isolation compared to LSO and {lvms}.

[id="comparing-additional-functionalities_{context}"]
== Comparison of the support for additional functionalities

The following table compares the additional features provided by {lvms}, Local Storage Operator (LSO), and HostPath Provisioner (HPP) to provision local storage:

.Comparison of the support for additional functionalities
[cols="6a,5a,5a,5a",options="header"]
|====

|Functionality|LVM Storage|LSO |HPP

|Support for generic ephemeral volumes |Yes |No |No

|Support for CSI inline ephemeral volumes |No |No |No

|Support for storage topology |Yes 

Supports CSI node topology 

|Yes

LSO provides partial support for storage topology through node tolerations. 

|No

|Support for `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode ^[1]^ |No |No |No

|====
[.small]
--
1. All of the solutions ({lvms}, LSO, and HPP) have the `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO) access mode. RWO access mode allows access from multiple pods on the same node.
