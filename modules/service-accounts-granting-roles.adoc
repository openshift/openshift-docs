= Examples of granting roles to service accounts

You can grant roles to service accounts in the same way that you grant roles
to a regular user account.

* You can modify the service accounts for the current project. For example, to add
the `view` role to the `robot` service account in the `top-secret` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot
----

* You can also grant access to a specific service account in a project. For
example, from the project to which the service account belongs, use
the `-z` flag and specify the `<service_account_name>`

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user <role_name> -z <service_account_name>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you want to grant access to a specific service account in a project, use the
`-z` flag. Using this flag helps prevent typos and ensures that access
is granted to only the specified service account.
====

* To modify a different namespace, you can use the `-n` option to indicate the
project namespace it applies to, as shown in the following examples.

** For example, to allow all service accounts in all projects to view resources in
the `top-secret` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n top-secret
----

** To allow all service accounts in the `managers` project to edit resources in the
`top-secret` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts:managers -n top-secret
----
