= AWS firewall prerequisites

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only ROSA clusters deployed with PrivateLink can use a firewall to control egress traffic.
====

This section provides the necessary details that enable you to control egress traffic from your {product-title} cluster. If you are using a firewall to control egress traffic, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the domain and port combinations below. {product-title} requires this access to provide a fully managed OpenShift service.

.Procedure

. Allowlist the following URLs that are used to install and download packages and tools:
+
[cols="6,1,6",options="header"]
|===
|Domain | Port | Function

|443
|Provides core container images.

|`*.quay.io`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`sso.redhat.com`
|443, 80
|Required. The `https://console.redhat.com/openshift` site uses authentication from `sso.redhat.com` to download the pull secret and use Red Hat SaaS solutions to facilitate monitoring of your subscriptions, cluster inventory, chargeback reporting, and so on.

|`quay-registry.s3.amazonaws.com`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`ocm-quay-production-s3.s3.amazonaws.com`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`quayio-production-s3.s3.amazonaws.com`
|443
|Provides core container images.

|`cart-rhcos-ci.s3.amazonaws.com`
|443
|Provides {op-system-first} images.

|`openshift.org`
|443
|Provides {op-system-first} images.

|`registry.access.redhat.com` ^[1]^
|443
|Hosts all the container images that are stored on the Red Hat Ecosytem Catalog. Additionally, the registry provides access to the `odo` CLI tool that helps developers build on OpenShift and Kubernetes.

|`registry.connect.redhat.com`
|443, 80
|Required for all third-party images and certified Operators.

|`console.redhat.com`
|443, 80
|Required. Allows interactions between the cluster and OpenShift Console Manager to enable functionality, such as scheduling upgrades.

|`sso.redhat.com`
|443
|The `https://console.redhat.com/openshift` site uses authentication from `sso.redhat.com`.

|`pull.q1w2.quay.rhcloud.com`
|443
|Provides core container images as a fallback when quay.io is not available.

|`.q1w2.quay.rhcloud.com`
|443
|Provides core container images as a fallback when quay.io is not available.

|`www.okd.io`
|443
|The `openshift.org` site redirects through `www.okd.io`.

|`www.redhat.com`
|443, 80
|The `sso.redhat.com` site redirects through `www.redhat.com`.

|`aws.amazon.com`
|443
|The `iam.amazonaws.com` and `sts.amazonaws.com` sites redirect through `aws.amazon.com`.

|`catalog.redhat.com`
|443
|The `registry.access.redhat.com` and `https://registry.redhat.io` sites redirect through `catalog.redhat.com`.
|===
+
[.small]
--
1. In a firewall environment, ensure that the `access.redhat.com` resource is on the allowlist. This resource hosts a signature store that a container client requires for verifying images when pulling them from `registry.access.redhat.com`.
--
+
When you add a site such as `quay.io` to your allowlist, do not add a wildcard entry such as `*.quay.io` to your denylist. In most cases, image registries use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve images. If a firewall blocks access, then image downloads are denied when the initial download request is redirected to a host name such as `cdn01.quay.io`.
+
CDN host names, such as `cdn01.quay.io`, are covered when you add a wildcard entry, such as `.quay.io`, in your allowlist.

. Allowlist the following telemetry URLs:
+
[cols="6,1,6",options="header"]
|===
|Domain | Port | Function

|`cert-api.access.redhat.com`
|443
|Required for telemetry.

|`api.access.redhat.com`
|443
|Required for telemetry.

|`infogw.api.openshift.com`
|443
|Required for telemetry.

|`console.redhat.com`
|443
|Required for telemetry and Red Hat Insights.

|`cloud.redhat.com/api/ingress`
|443
|Required for telemetry and Red Hat Insights.

|`observatorium-mst.api.openshift.com`
|443
|Required for managed OpenShift-specific telemetry.

|`observatorium.api.openshift.com`
|443
|Required for managed OpenShift-specific telemetry.
|===
+
Managed clusters require enabling telemetry to allow Red Hat to react more quickly to problems, better support the customers, and better understand how product upgrades impact clusters.
See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/support/remote_health_monitoring/about-remote-health-monitoring.html[About remote health monitoring] for more information about how remote health monitoring data is used by Red Hat.

|===

. If you did not allow a wildcard for Amazon Web Services (AWS) APIs, you must also allow the S3 bucket used for the internal OpenShift registry. To retrieve that endpoint, run the following command after the cluster is successfully provisioned:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-image-registry get pod -l docker-registry=default -o json | jq '.items[].spec.containers[].env[] | select(.name=="REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET")'
----
+
The S3 endpoint should be in the following format: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
'<cluster-name>-<random-string>-image-registry-<cluster-region>-<random-string>.s3.dualstack.<cluster-region>.amazonaws.com'.
----

. Allowlist any site that provides resources for a language or framework that your builds require.
. Allowlist any outbound URLs that depend on the languages and frameworks used in OpenShift. See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2998411[OpenShift Outbound URLs to Allow] for a list of recommended URLs to be allowed on the firewall or proxy.
