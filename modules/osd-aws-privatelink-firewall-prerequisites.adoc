[IMPORTANT]
====
Only ROSA clusters deployed with PrivateLink can use a firewall to control egress traffic.

endif::[]

This section provides the necessary details that enable you to control egress traffic from your {product-title} cluster. If you are using a firewall to control egress traffic, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the domain and port combinations below. {product-title} requires this access to provide a fully managed OpenShift service.

|`time-a-wwv.nist.gov`
|123 ^[2]^

[.small]
--
1. In a firewall environment, ensure that the `access.redhat.com` resource is on the allowlist. This resource hosts a signature store that a container client requires for verifying images when pulling them from `registry.access.redhat.com`.
2. Both TCP and UDP ports.
--
+
When you add a site such as `quay.io` to your allowlist, do not add a wildcard entry such as `*.quay.io` to your denylist. In most cases, image registries use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve images. If a firewall blocks access, then image downloads are denied when the initial download request is redirected to a host name such as `cdn01.quay.io`.
+
CDN host names, such as `cdn01.quay.io`, are covered when you add a wildcard entry, such as `.quay.io`, in your allowlist.

. Allowlist the following telemetry URLs:
+
[cols="6,1,6",options="header"]
|===
|Domain | Port | Function

|`cert-api.access.redhat.com`
|443
|Required for telemetry.

|`api.access.redhat.com`
|443
|Required for telemetry.

|`infogw.api.openshift.com`
|443
|Required for telemetry.

|`console.redhat.com`
|443
|Required for telemetry and Red Hat Insights.

|`cloud.redhat.com/api/ingress`
|443
|Required for telemetry and Red Hat Insights.

|`observatorium-mst.api.openshift.com`
|443
|Required for managed OpenShift-specific telemetry.

|`observatorium.api.openshift.com`
|443
|Required for managed OpenShift-specific telemetry.
|===
+
Managed clusters require enabling telemetry to allow Red Hat to react more quickly to problems, better support the customers, and better understand how product upgrades impact clusters.
For more information about how remote health monitoring data is used by Red Hat, see _About remote health monitoring_ in the _Additional resources_ section.

. Allowlist the following Amazon Web Services (AWS) API URls:
+
[cols="6,1,6",options="header"]
|===
|Domain | Port | Function

|`.amazonaws.com`
|443
|Required to access AWS services and resources.
|===
+

|`ec2.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`
|443

. If you did not allow a wildcard for Amazon Web Services (AWS) APIs, you must also allow the S3 bucket used for the internal OpenShift registry. To retrieve that endpoint, run the following command after the cluster is successfully provisioned:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-image-registry get pod -l docker-registry=default -o json | jq '.items[].spec.containers[].env[] | select(.name=="REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET")'
----
+
The S3 endpoint should be in the following format:
+
[source,terminal]
----
'<cluster-name>-<random-string>-image-registry-<cluster-region>-<random-string>.s3.dualstack.<cluster-region>.amazonaws.com'.
----

. Allowlist any site that provides resources for a language or framework that your builds require.
. Allowlist any outbound URLs that depend on the languages and frameworks used in OpenShift. See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2998411[OpenShift Outbound URLs to Allow] for a list of recommended URLs to be allowed on the firewall or proxy.
