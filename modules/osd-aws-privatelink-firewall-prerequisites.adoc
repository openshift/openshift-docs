= AWS PrivateLink firewall prerequisites

If you are using a firewall and want to create your cluster using AWS PrivateLink, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the sites that {product-title} requires.

.Procedure

. Allowlist the following URLs that are used to install and download packages and tools:
+
[cols="3,4,1",options="header"]
|===
|URL | Function | Port
|`registry.redhat.io`
|Required. Provides core components such as dev tools and operator based add-ons, and Red Hat provided container images including middleware and Universal Base Image.
|443, 80

|`quay.io`
|Required. Used by the cluster to download the platform container images.
|443, 80

|`.quay.io`
|Required. Used by the cluster to download the platform container images.
|443, 80

|`sso.redhat.com`
|Required. The `https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift` site uses authentication from `sso.redhat.com` to  download the pull secret and use Red Hat SaaS solutions to facilitate monitoring of your subscriptions, cluster inventory, chargeback reporting, and so on.
|443, 80

|`pull.q1w2.quay.rhcloud.com`
|Recommended. Provides a fallback registry used by the cluster when quay.io is not available.
|443, 80

|`.q1w2.quay.rhcloud.com`
|Recommended. Enables a CNAME to resolve to a regionalised endpoint.
|443, 80

|`openshift.org`
|Required. Provides Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) images.
|443, 80

|`console.redhat.com`
|Required. Allows interactions between the cluster and OpenShift Console Manager (OCM) to enable functionality, such as scheduling upgrades.
|443, 80

|`quay-registry.s3.amazonaws.com`
|Required. Used to access Quay image content in AWS.
|443, 80
|===
+
When you add a site such as `quay.io` to your allowlist, do not add a wildcard entry such as `*.quay.io` to your denylist. In most cases, image registries use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve images. If a firewall blocks access, then image downloads are denied when the initial download request is redirected to a host name such as `cdn01.quay.io`.
+
CDN host names, such as `cdn01.quay.io`, are covered when you add a wildcard entry, such as `.quay.io`, in your allowlist.
+
Allowlist any site that provides resources for a language or framework that your builds require.â€¨

. Managed clusters require telemetry to be enabled to allow Red Hat to react more quickly to problems, to better support our customers, and to better understand how product upgrades impact clusters.
See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/support/remote_health_monitoring/about-remote-health-monitoring.html[About remote health monitoring] for more information about how remote health monitoring data is used by Red Hat.
+
[cols="3,4,1",options="header"]
|===
|URL | Function | Port

|443, 80

|`cert-api.access.redhat.com`

|443, 80
|===

. For Amazon Web Services (AWS), you must grant access to the URLs that provide the AWS API and DNS services:
* You can grant access by allowing the `.amazonaws.com` wildcard:
+
[cols="3,4,1",options="header"]
|===
|URL | Function | Requirement

|`.amazonaws.com`
|Required. Used to access AWS services and resources.
|443, 80

|`oso-rhc4tp-docker-registry.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
|Required. Used to access AWS services and resources when using strict security requirements. Review the AWS Service Endpoints in the AWS documentation to determine the exact endpoints to allow for the regions that you use.
|443, 80
|===
+
* Alternatively, you can grant access by allowing the following regional AWS service endpoints:
+
[cols="3,4,1",options="header"]
|===
|URL | Function | Port
|`ec2.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`
|Required. Used for regional access to Amazon EC2 services. EC2 instances are required to deploy the control plane and data plane functions of ROSA. Replace `<aws_region>` with an AWS region code, for example `us-east-1`.

|`<cluster_id>-<shard>.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`
|Required. Used for access to the registry.
|443, 80
|===
+
The cluster ID and shard information is generated at installation time. Use `rosa describe cluster --cluster=<cluster_name>` to get the `<cluster_id>`, `<shard>`, and `<aws_region>` values.
+
You can grant access to `.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com` when you create a cluster and later refine the firewall configuration by specifying the cluster ID and shard.
+
Review the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html[AWS Service Endpoints] in the AWS documentation to determine the exact endpoints to allow for the regions that you use.

. Operators require route access to perform health checks. Specifically, the authentication and web console Operators connect to two routes to verify that the routes work. If you are the cluster administrator and do not want to allow *.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>, then you must allow these routes:
