= Using the CLI to create a virtual machine

.Procedure

The `spec` object of the VirtualMachine configuration file references
the virtual machine settings, such as the number of cores and the amount
of memory, the disk type, and the volumes to use.

. Attach the virtual machine disk to the virtual machine by referencing
the relevant PVC `claimName` as a volume.

. To create a virtual machine with the {product-title} client, run this command:
+
----
$ oc create -f <vm.yaml>
----

. Since virtual machines are created in a *Stopped* state, run a virtual machine
instance by starting it.
