The following items were added during the first quarter of 2025.

* **Support for new {gcp-short} instances.** {product-title} version 4.18 and later now supports `n4` and `c3` instance types on {gcp-full}. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_dedicated/4/html/introduction_to_openshift_dedicated/policies-and-service-definition#gcp-compute-types_osd-service-definition[{gcp-full} compute types].

* **New version of {product-title} available.** {product-title} on {gcp} and {product-title} on {aws} versions 4.18 are now available. For more information about upgrading to this latest version, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_dedicated/4/html/upgrading/osd-upgrades[OpenShift Dedicated cluster upgrades].

* **Support for assigning newly created machine pools to specific availability zones within a Multi-AZ cluster.**
{product-title} on {GCP} users can now assign machine pools to specific availability zones using the {cluster-manager} CLI (`ocm`). For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_dedicated/4/html/cluster_administration/managing-compute-nodes-using-machine-pools#deploying-a-machine-pool-in-a-single-availability-zone-within-a-multi-az-cluster[Deploying a machine pool in a single availability zone within a Multi-AZ cluster].

* ** Support for specifying {product-title} versions when creating or updating a Workload Identity Federation (WIF) configuration.**
{product-title} on {GCP} users can now specify minor versions when creating or updating a WIF configuration. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_dedicated/4/html/openshift_dedicated_clusters_on_google_cloud/osd-creating-a-cluster-on-gcp-with-workload-identity-federation[Creating a Workload Identity Federation cluster using the OCM CLI].

* **Cluster node limit update.** {product-title} clusters versions 4.14.14 and greater can now scale to 249 worker nodes. This is an increase from the previous limit of 180 nodes. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_dedicated/4/html/planning_your_environment/osd-limits-scalability[Limits and scalability].
// * **{product-title} SDN network plugin blocks future major upgrades**
* **Initiate live migration from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes.**
As part of the {product-title} move to OVN-Kubernetes as the only supported network plugin starting with {product-title} version 4.17, users can now initiate live migration from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
+
If your cluster uses the OpenShift SDN network plugin, you cannot upgrade to future major versions of {product-title} without migrating to OVN-Kubernetes.
+
For more information about migrating to OVN-Kubernetes, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_dedicated/4/html/ovn-kubernetes_network_plugin/migrate-from-openshift-sdn-osd[Migrating from OpenShift SDN network plugin to OVN-Kubernetes network plugin].

* **Red{nbsp}Hat SRE log-based alerting endpoints have been updated.** {product-title} customers who are using a firewall to control egress traffic can now remove all references to `*.osdsecuritylogs.splunkcloud.com:9997` from your firewall allowlist. {product-title} clusters still require the `http-inputs-osdsecuritylogs.splunkcloud.com:443` log-based alerting endpoint to be accessible from the cluster.
