== Fixed issues

* Before this update, any changes to the `serviceAccountName` and `serviceAccount` fields in the Redis deployment were not reconciled by the {gitops-title} Operator. With this update, this issue is fixed by ensuring that any unintended changes to these fields are reset to their expected value, `<argocd-instance-name>-argocd-redis`. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6032[GITOPS-6032]

* Before this update, the Notifications Controller reconciled continuously if the context field included multiple entries, generating a large number of logs. With this update, the controller's reconciliation behavior is fixed, preventing repeated log entries when multiple context entries are used. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-5970[GITOPS-5970]

* Before this update, the health check status of a policy, a `Policy` resource from `policy.open-cluster-management.io`, displayed as `Progressing` even when no clusters were targeted by the policy. With this update, the health check status remains `Healthy` when no clusters are targeted by the policy. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6162[GITOPS-6162]
