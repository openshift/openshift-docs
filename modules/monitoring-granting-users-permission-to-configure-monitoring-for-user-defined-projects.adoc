= Granting users permission to configure monitoring for user-defined projects

As a cluster administrator, you can assign the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role to a user. This grants permission to configure and manage monitoring for user-defined projects without giving them permission to configure and manage core {product-title} monitoring components.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* The user account that you are assigning the role to already exists.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Assign the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role to a user in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring adm policy add-role-to-user \
  user-workload-monitoring-config-edit <user> \
  --role-namespace openshift-user-workload-monitoring
----

. Verify that the user is correctly assigned to the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role by displaying the related role binding:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding <role_binding_name> -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring
----
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding user-workload-monitoring-config-edit -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring
----
+
