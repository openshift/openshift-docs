= About the {js-operator}

The {js-operator} is based on the link:https://jobset.sigs.k8s.io/docs/overview/[JobSet] open source project.

{js-operator} is designed to manage a group of jobs as a single, coordinated unit. This is especially useful for fields like High-Performance Computing (HPC) and training massive Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, like PyTorch or TensorFlow, where you need a team of machines to run for hours or days.

You can use the {js-operator} to solve problems that are too big or too complex for a standard {product-title} job. The main benefits center on coordination, stability, and recovery. First, the operator facilitates handling different roles by allowing you to define distinct machine roles—such as one "leader" and many "worker" machines—as "replicated jobs" within a single configuration, which a standard job cannot manage. Second, it ensures stable communication; because regular pods in {product-title} get new, unstable network addresses upon restart, the {js-operator} automatically sets up stable hostnames and network services so workers can reliably find and communicate with each other, even after a failure and restart. Third, it provides automatic failure recovery. If one small part of a large training job fails, the operator can be configured to restart the entire group of workers from a saved checkpoint, which saves vast amounts of time and computing costs. Finally, the operator offers startup control, allowing you to define a specific startup sequence to ensure dependencies are met, such as making sure the leader is running before any workers attempt to connect.

In simple terms, {js-operator} makes managing large, distributed, and coordinated computing tasks on {product-title} easier, turning many individual components into one resilient and manageable system.
