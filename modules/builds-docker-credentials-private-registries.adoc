= Using docker credentials for private registries

You can supply builds with a .`docker/config.json` file with valid credentials for private container registries. This allows you to push the output image into a private container image registry or pull a builder image from the private container image registry that requires authentication.

You can supply credentials for multiple repositories within the same registry, each with credentials specific to that registry path.

[NOTE]
====
For the {product-title} container image registry, this is not required because secrets are generated automatically for you by {product-title}.
====

The `.docker/config.json` file is found in your home directory by default and
has the following format:

[source,yaml]
----
auths:
  index.docker.io/v1/: <1>
    auth: "YWRfbGzhcGU6R2labnRib21ifTE=" <2>
    email: "user@example.com" <3>
  docker.io/my-namespace/my-user/my-image: <4>
    auth: "GzhYWRGU6R2fbclabnRgbkSp=""
    email: "user@example.com"
  docker.io/my-namespace: <5>
    auth: "GzhYWRGU6R2deesfrRgbkSp=""
    email: "user@example.com"
----
<1> URL of the registry.
<2> Encrypted password.
<3> Email address for the login.
<4> URL and credentials for a specific image in a namespace.
<5> URL and credentials for a registry namespace.

You can define multiple container image registries or define multiple repositories in the same registry. Alternatively, you can also add authentication entries to this file by running the `docker login` command. The file will be created if it does not exist.

Kubernetes provides `Secret` objects, which can be used to store configuration and passwords.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a `.docker/config.json` file.

.Procedure

. Create the secret from your local `.docker/config.json` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic dockerhub \
    --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/.docker/config.json> \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----
+
This generates a JSON specification of the secret named `dockerhub` and creates the object.
+
. Add a `pushSecret` field into the `output` section of the `BuildConfig` and set it to the name of the `secret` that you created, which in the previous example is `dockerhub`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "private.registry.com/org/private-image:latest"
    pushSecret:
      name: "dockerhub"
----
+
You can use the `oc set build-secret` command to set the push secret on the build configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set build-secret --push bc/sample-build dockerhub
----
+
You can also link the push secret to the service account used by the build instead of specifying the `pushSecret` field. By default, builds use the `builder` service account. The push secret is automatically added to the build if the secret contains a credential that matches the repository hosting the build's output image.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc secrets link builder dockerhub
----
+
. Pull the builder container image from a private container image registry by specifying the `pullSecret` field, which is part of the build strategy definition:
+
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "docker.io/user/private_repository"
    pullSecret:
      name: "dockerhub"
----
+
You can use the `oc set build-secret` command to set the pull secret on the build configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set build-secret --pull bc/sample-build dockerhub
----
+
ifndef::openshift-builds-v1[]
[NOTE]
====
This example uses `pullSecret` in a Source build, but it is also applicable in Docker and Custom builds.
====
endif::[]
+
You can also link the pull secret to the service account used by the build instead of specifying the `pullSecret` field. By default, builds use the `builder` service account. The pull secret is automatically added to the build if the secret contains a credential that matches the repository hosting the build's input image. To link the pull secret to the service account used by the build instead of specifying the `pullSecret` field, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc secrets link builder dockerhub
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must specify a `from` image in the `BuildConfig` spec to take advantage of this feature. Docker strategy builds generated by `oc new-build` or `oc new-app` may not do this in some situations.
