= Building images using the OpenShift subscription entitlements

Integration between shared resources, the Insights Operator, and {product-title} Builds makes using Red Hat subscriptions (RHEL entitlements) easier in {product-title} Builds.

In {ocp-product-title} 4.10 and later, {builds-title} can use Red Hat subscriptions (RHEL entitlements) by referencing shared resources and the simple content access feature provided by Insights Operator:

* The simple content access feature imports your subscription credentials to a well-known `Secret` object.
* The cluster administrator creates a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) with the `Secret` object and grants permission to projects or namespaces. The cluster administrator gives the `builder` service account permission to use the `SharedSecret` CR.
* Builds that run within those projects or namespaces can mount a Container Storage Interface (CSI) Volume that references the `SharedSecret` CR instance and its entitled RHEL content.
