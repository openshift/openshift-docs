= OpenTelemetry Collector configuration options

#TECH PREVIEW BOILERPLATE HERE#
#What is the actual Operator name?#

The OpenTelemetry Collector is the component responsible for receiving the spans that were captured by the tracer and writing them to an Elasticsearch persistent storage when using the `production` strategy, or to AMQ Streams when using the `streaming` strategy.

The Collectors are stateless and thus many instances of OpenTelemetry Collector can be run in parallel. Collectors require almost no configuration, except for the location of the Elasticsearch cluster.
