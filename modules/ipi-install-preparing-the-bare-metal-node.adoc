= Preparing the bare metal node

To expand your cluster, you must provide the node with the relevant IP address. This can be done with a static configuration, or with a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration protocol) server. When expanding the cluster using a DHCP server, each node must have a DHCP reservation.


[IMPORTANT]
.Reserving IP addresses so they become static IP addresses
====
Some administrators prefer to use static IP addresses so that each node's IP address remains constant in the absence of a DHCP server. To configure static IP addresses with NMState, see "Optional: Configuring host network interfaces in the `install-config.yaml` file" in the "Setting up the environment for an OpenShift installation" section for additional details.
====

Preparing the bare metal node requires executing the following procedure from the provisioner node.

.Procedure

. Get the `oc` binary:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -s https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/$VERSION/openshift-client-linux-$VERSION.tar.gz | tar zxvf - oc
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo cp oc /usr/local/bin
----

. Power off the bare metal node by using the baseboard management controller (BMC), and ensure it is off.

. Retrieve the user name and password of the bare metal node's baseboard management controller. Then, create `base64` strings from the user name and password:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ echo -ne "root" | base64
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo -ne "password" | base64
----

. Create a configuration file for the bare metal node. Depending on whether you are using a static configuration or a DHCP server, use one of the following example `bmh.yaml` files, replacing values in the YAML to match your environment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vim bmh.yaml
----

<1> To configure the network interface for a newly created node, specify the name of the secret that contains the network configuration. Follow the `nmstate` syntax to define the network configuration for your node. See "Optional: Configuring host network interfaces in the install-config.yaml file" for details on configuring NMState syntax.
<2> Replace `<num>` for the worker number of the bare metal node in the `name` fields, the `credentialsName` field, and the `preprovisioningNetworkDataName` field.
<3> Add the NMState YAML syntax to configure the host interfaces.
<4> Optional: If you have configured the network interface with `nmstate`, and you want to disable an interface, set `state: up` with the IP addresses set to `enabled: false` as shown:
+
[source,yaml]
----

   interfaces:
   - name: <nic_name>
     type: ethernet
     state: up
     ipv4:
       enabled: false
     ipv6:
       enabled: false
----
<5> Replace `<nic1_name>`, `<ip_address>`, `<dns_ip_address>`, `<next_hop_ip_address>` and `<next_hop_nic1_name>` with appropriate values.
<6> Replace `<base64_of_uid>` and  `<base64_of_pwd>` with the base64 string of the user name and password.
<7> Replace `<nic1_mac_address>` with the MAC address of the bare metal node's first NIC. See the "BMC addressing" section for additional BMC configuration options.
<8> Replace `<protocol>` with the BMC protocol, such as IPMI, RedFish, or others. Replace `<bmc_url>` with the URL of the bare metal node's baseboard management controller.
<9> To skip certificate validation, set `disableCertificateVerification` to true.
<10> Replace `<bmc_username>` and `<bmc_password>` with the string of the BMC user name and password.
<11> Optional: Replace `<root_device_hint>` with a device path if you specify a root device hint.
<12> Optional: If you have configured the network interface for the newly created node, provide the network configuration secret name in the `preprovisioningNetworkDataName` of the BareMetalHost CR.

[NOTE]
====
If the MAC address of an existing bare metal node matches the MAC address of a bare metal host that you are attempting to provision, then the Ironic installation will fail. If the host enrollment, inspection, cleaning, or other Ironic steps fail, the Bare Metal Operator retries the installation continuously. See "Diagnosing a host duplicate MAC address" for more information.

. Create the bare metal node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-machine-api create -f bmh.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
secret/openshift-worker-<num>-network-config-secret created
secret/openshift-worker-<num>-bmc-secret created
baremetalhost.metal3.io/openshift-worker-<num> created
----
+
Where `<num>` will be the worker number.

. Power up and inspect the bare metal node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-machine-api get bmh openshift-worker-<num>
----
+
Where `<num>` is the worker node number.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                    STATE       CONSUMER   ONLINE   ERROR
openshift-worker-<num>  available              true
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To allow the worker node to join the cluster, scale the `machineset` object to the number of the `BareMetalHost` objects. You can scale nodes either manually or automatically. To scale nodes automatically, use the `metal3.io/autoscale-to-hosts` annotation for `machineset`.
