= Preparing the bare metal node

Expanding the cluster requires a DHCP server. Each node must have a DHCP reservation.

[IMPORTANT]
.Reserving IP addresses so they become static IP addresses
====
Some administrators prefer to use static IP addresses so that each node's IP address remains constant in the absence of a DHCP server. To configure static IP addresses with NMState, see "(Optional) Configuring host network interfaces in the `install-config.yaml` file" in the "Setting up the environment for an OpenShift installation" section for additional details.
====

Preparing the bare metal node requires executing the following procedure from the provisioner node.

.Procedure

. Get the `oc` binary, if needed. It should already exist on the provisioner node.
+
[source,terminal]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ curl -s https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/$VERSION/openshift-client-linux-$VERSION.tar.gz | tar zxvf - oc
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ sudo cp oc /usr/local/bin
----

. Power off the bare metal node through the baseboard management controller and ensure it is off.

. Retrieve the user name and password of the bare metal node's baseboard management controller. Then, create `base64` strings from the user name and password. In the following example, the user name is `root` and the password is `password`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ echo -ne "root" | base64
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ echo -ne "password" | base64
----

. Create a configuration file for the bare metal node.
+
[source,terminal]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ vim bmh.yaml
----

<1> Replace `<num>` for the worker number of the bare metal node in the two `name` fields and the `credentialsName` field.
<2> Replace `<base64-of-uid>` with the `base64` string of the user name.
<3> Replace `<base64-of-pwd>` with the `base64` string of the password.
<4> Replace `<NIC1-mac-address>` with the MAC address of the bare metal node's first NIC. See the BMC addressing section for additional BMC configuration options. Replace `<protocol>` with the BMC protocol, such as IPMI, RedFish, or others.
<5> Replace `<bmc-ip>` with the IP address of the bare metal node's baseboard management controller.
<6> Optional. You can set the `networkConfig` configuration option to configure host network interfaces. See "(Optional) Configuring host network interfaces in the `install-config.yaml` file" in the "Setting up the environment for an OpenShift installation" section for configuration details. 
+
[NOTE]
====
If the MAC address of an existing bare metal node matches the MAC address of a bare metal host that you are attempting to provision, then the Ironic installation will fail. If the host enrollment, inspection, cleaning, or other Ironic steps fail, the Bare Metal Operator retries the installation continuously. See "Diagnosing a host duplicate MAC address" for more information.

. Create the bare metal node.

[source,terminal]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ oc -n openshift-machine-api create -f bmh.yaml
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

baremetalhost.metal3.io/openshift-worker-<num> created
----

Where `<num>` will be the worker number.

. Power up and inspect the bare metal node.
+
[source,terminal]
----
[kni@provisioner ~]$ oc -n openshift-machine-api get bmh openshift-worker-<num>
----
+
Where `<num>` is the worker node number.
