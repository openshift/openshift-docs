= Automatically adding a source clone secret to a build configuration

When a `BuildConfig` is created, {product-title} can automatically populate its source clone secret reference. This behavior allows the resulting `Builds` to automatically use the credentials stored in the referenced `Secret` to authenticate to a remote Git repository, without requiring further configuration.

To use this functionality, a `Secret` containing the Git repository credentials must exist in the namespace in which the `BuildConfig` is later created. This `Secret` must additionally include one or more annotations prefixed with `build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-`. The value of each of these annotations is a URI pattern, defined as follows. When a `BuildConfig` is created without a source clone secret reference and its Git source URI matches a URI pattern in a `Secret` annotation, {product-title} will automatically insert a reference to that `Secret` in the `BuildConfig`.

.Prerequisites

A URI pattern must consist of:

* A valid scheme (`*://`, `git://`, `http://`, `https://` or `ssh://`).
* A host (`\*` or a valid hostname or IP address optionally preceded by `*.`).
* A path (`/\*` or `/` followed by any characters optionally including `*` characters).

In all of the above, a `*` character is interpreted as a wildcard.

[IMPORTANT]
====
URI patterns must match Git source URIs which are conformant to link:https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt[RFC3986]. Do not include a username (or password) component in a URI pattern.

For example, if you use `ssh://git@bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/ATLASSIAN jira.git` for a git repository URL, the source secret must be specified as `pass:c[ssh://bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*]` (and not `pass:c[ssh://git@bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*]`).

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate secret mysecret \
    'build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1=ssh://bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*'

.Procedure

If multiple `Secrets` match the Git URI of a particular `BuildConfig`, {product-title} will select the secret with the longest match. This allows for basic overriding, as in the following example.

The following fragment shows two partial source clone secrets, the first matching any server in the domain `mycorp.com` accessed by HTTPS, and the second overriding access to servers `mydev1.mycorp.com` and `mydev2.mycorp.com`:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: matches-all-corporate-servers-https-only
  annotations:
    build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1: https://*.mycorp.com/*
data:
  ...

kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: override-for-my-dev-servers-https-only
  annotations:
    build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1: https://mydev1.mycorp.com/*
    build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-2: https://mydev2.mycorp.com/*
data:
  ...
----

* Add a `build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-` annotation to a pre-existing secret using:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate secret mysecret \
    'build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1=https://*.mycorp.com/*'
