= Life cycle dates for ROSA GovCloud

ROSA GovCloud is subject to FedRAMP high security controls which require the use of cryptographic modules that have received a validation status of active or implementation under test from the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). As a result, OpenSSL which is the module that is applicable to RHEL CoreOS in an OpenShift implementation is the determining factor for what OpenShift versions ROSA GovCloud offers, which may create drift from the standard OpenShift support lifecycle.
