= Adding or removing projects from the mesh using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource with the web console

You can add or remove projects from the mesh using the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource with the {product-title} web console. You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one mesh.

The `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource is deleted when its corresponding `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource is deleted.

.Prerequisites

* An installed, verified {SMProductName} Operator.
* An existing `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.
* The name of the project with the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.
* The names of the projects you want to add or remove from the mesh.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the *Project* menu and choose the project where your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource is deployed from the list. For example `istio-system`.

. Click the {SMProductName} Operator.

. Click the *Istio Service Mesh Member Roll* tab.

. Click the `default` link.

. Click the YAML tab.

. Modify the YAML to add projects as members (or delete them to remove existing members). You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.
