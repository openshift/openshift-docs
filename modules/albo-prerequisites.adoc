= Prepare to install the AWS Load Balancer Operator

[role="_abstract"]
To prepare your cluster for the AWS Load Balancer Operator, verify that your AWS VPC resources are tagged correctly and meet all requirements. You can also configure environment variables to customize the installation.

Cluster requirements::

Your cluster must be deployed across three availability zones and use a pre-existing VPC that has three public subnets.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These requirements mean that the AWS Load Balancer Operator may not be suitable for some PrivateLink clusters. AWS NLBs may be a better choice for such clusters.
