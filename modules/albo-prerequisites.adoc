= Setting up your environment to install the AWS Load Balancer Operator

The AWS Load Balancer Operator requires a cluster with multiple availiability zones (AZ), as well as three public subnets split across three AZs in the same virtual private cloud (VPC) as the cluster. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because of these requirements, the AWS Load Balancer Operator maybe be unsuitable for many PrivateLink clusters. AWS NLBs do not have this restriction.
====

Before installing the AWS Load Balancer Operator, you must have configured the following:

ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
* A ROSA (classic architecture) cluster with multiple availability zones
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
* A ROSA cluster with multiple availability zones
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
* BYO VPC cluster
* AWS CLI
* OC CLI
