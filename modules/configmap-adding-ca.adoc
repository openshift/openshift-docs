= Adding certifying authorities to a ConfigMap

You can add certifying authorities (CAs) to a ConfigMap with the following
procedure.

.Prerequisites

* You must have cluster administrator privileges.
* You must have access to the registry's public certificates, usually a
`hostname/ca.crt` file located in the `/etc/docker/certs.d/` directory.

.Procedure

. Create a ConfigMap in the `openshift-config` namespace containing the trusted
certificates for the registries that use self-signed certificates. For each
CA file, ensure the key in the ConfigMap is the registry's
hostname in the `hostname[..port]` format:
+
----
$ oc create configmap registry-cas -n openshift-config \
--from-file=myregistry.corp.com..5000=/etc/docker/certs.d/myregistry.corp.com:5000/ca.crt \
--from-file=otherregistry.com=/etc/docker/certs.d/otherregistry.com/ca.crt
----

. Update the cluster image figuration:
+
----
$ oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"registry-cas"}}}' --type=merge
----
