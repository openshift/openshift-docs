= Making control-plane nodes non-schedulable

// TBD - https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPRHV-414
// Here's my version of the intro text from https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/master/docs/user/ovirt/install_upi.md#set-control-plane-nodes-unschedulable . This information is confusing. Please discuss with engineering and provide a good concise explanation of why the user is doing this.

// "Earlier, when you set the compute `replicas` to zero, it also made control-plane nodes schedulable, which is something you do not want at this stage in the process.""
//
// "NOTE: Router pods can run also on control-plane nodes but there are some Kubernetes limitations that prevent the ingress load balancer from reaching those pods.""

Because you are are manually creating and deploying the control plane machines, you must configure a manifest file to make the control-plane nodes non-schedulable.

.Procedure

. To make the control-plane nodes non-schedulable, enter:
+
[source,terminal]

$ python3 -c 'import os, yaml
path = "%s/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml" % os.environ["ASSETS_DIR"]
data = yaml.safe_load(open(path))
data["spec"]["mastersSchedulable"] = False
open(path, "w").write(yaml.dump(data, default_flow_style=False))'
