Feature – Describe the new functionality available to the customer.  For enhancements, try to describe as specifically as possible where the customer will see changes.
Reason – If known, include why has the enhancement been implemented (use case, performance, technology, etc.).   For example, showcases integration of X with Y, demonstrates Z API feature, includes latest framework bug fixes.  There may not have been a 'problem' previously, but system behaviour may have changed.
Result – If changed, describe the current user experience
////
{ProductName} provides a number of key capabilities uniformly across a network of services:

* *Traffic Management* - Control the flow of traffic and API calls between services, make calls more reliable, and make the network more robust in the face of adverse conditions.
* *Service Identity and Security* - Provide services in the mesh with a verifiable identity and provide the ability to protect service traffic as it flows over networks of varying degrees of trustworthiness.
* *Policy Enforcement* - Apply organizational policy to the interaction between services, ensure access policies are enforced and resources are fairly distributed among consumers. Policy changes are made by configuring the mesh, not by changing application code.
* *Telemetry* -  Gain understanding of the dependencies between services and the nature and flow of traffic between them, providing the ability to quickly identify issues.

[NOTE]
====
There are manual steps that must be completed to address CVE-2020-8663.
====

[id="manual-updates-cve-2020-8663_{context}"]
=== Manual updates required by CVE-2020-8663

The fix for link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1844254[CVE-2020-8663]`: envoy: Resource exhaustion when accepting too many connections` added a configurable limit on downstream connections. The configuration option for this limit must be configured to mitigate this vulnerability.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These manual steps are required to mitigate this CVE whether you are using the 1.1 version or the 1.0 version of {ProductName}.
====

This new configuration option is called `overload.global_downstream_max_connections`, and it is configurable as a proxy `runtime` setting.  Perform the following steps to configure limits at the Ingress Gateway.

.Procedure

. Create a file named `bootstrap-override.json` with the following text to force the proxy to override the bootstrap template and load runtime configuration from disk:
+
  {
    "runtime": {
      "symlink_root": "/var/lib/istio/envoy/runtime"
    }
  }
+
. Create a secret from the `bootstrap-override.json` file, replacing <SMCPnamespace> with the namespace where you created the service mesh control plane (SMCP):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc create secret generic -n <SMCPnamespace> gateway-bootstrap --from-file=bootstrap-override.json
----
+
. Update the SMCP configuration to activate the override.

+
.Updated SMCP configuration example #1
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
spec:
  istio:
    gateways:
      istio-ingressgateway:
        env:
          ISTIO_BOOTSTRAP_OVERRIDE: /var/lib/istio/envoy/custom-bootstrap/bootstrap-override.json
        secretVolumes:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/istio/envoy/custom-bootstrap
          name: custom-bootstrap
          secretName: gateway-bootstrap
----
+

. To set the new configuration option, create a secret that has the desired value for the `overload.global_downstream_max_connections` setting.  The following example uses a value of `10000`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc create secret generic -n <SMCPnamespace> gateway-settings --from-literal=overload.global_downstream_max_connections=10000
----
+

. Update the SMCP again to mount the secret in the location where Envoy is looking for runtime configuration:

.Updated SMCP configuration example #2
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
spec:
  template: default
#Change the version to "v1.0" if you are on the 1.0 stream.
  version: v1.1
  istio:
    gateways:
      istio-ingressgateway:
        env:
          ISTIO_BOOTSTRAP_OVERRIDE: /var/lib/istio/envoy/custom-bootstrap/bootstrap-override.json
        secretVolumes:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/istio/envoy/custom-bootstrap
          name: custom-bootstrap
          secretName: gateway-bootstrap
        # below is the new secret mount
        - mountPath: /var/lib/istio/envoy/runtime
          name: gateway-settings
          secretName: gateway-settings

[id="upgrading_es5_es6_{context}"]
=== Upgrading from Elasticsearch 5 to Elasticsearch 6

When updating from Elasticsearch 5 to Elasticsearch 6, you must delete your Jaeger instance, then recreate the Jaeger instance because of an issue with certificates. Re-creating the Jaeger instance triggers creating a new set of certificates.   If you are using persistent storage the same volumes can be mounted for the new Jaeger instance as long as the Jaeger name and namespace for the new Jaeger instance are the same as the deleted Jaeger instance.

.Procedure if Jaeger is installed as part of Red Hat Service Mesh

. Determine the name of your Jaeger custom resource file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get jaeger -n istio-system
----
+
You should see something like the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     AGE
jaeger   3d21h
----
+
. Copy the generated custom resource file into a temporary directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get jaeger jaeger -oyaml -n istio-system > /tmp/jaeger-cr.yaml
----
+
. Delete the Jaeger instance:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete jaeger jaeger -n istio-system
----
+
. Recreate the Jaeger instance from your copy of the custom resource file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f /tmp/jaeger-cr.yaml -n istio-system
----
+
. Delete the copy of the generated custom resource file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rm /tmp/jaeger-cr.yaml
----


.Procedure if Jaeger not installed as part of Red Hat Service Mesh

Before you begin, create a copy of your Jaeger custom resource file.

. Delete the Jaeger instance by deleting the custom resource file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f <jaeger-cr-file>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f jaeger-prod-elasticsearch.yaml
----
+
. Recreate your Jaeger instance from the backup copy of your custom resource file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <jaeger-cr-file>
----
+
. Validate that your Pods have restarted:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n jaeger-system -w
----
+

[id="ossm-manual-updates-1.0-1.1_{context}"]
=== Manual updates from 1.0 to 1.1

If you are updating from {ProductName} 1.0 to 1.1, you must update the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to update the control plane components to the new version.

. In the web console, click the {ProductName} Operator.

. Click the *Project* menu and choose the project where your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` is deployed from the list, for example `istio-system`.

. Click the name of your control plane, for example `basic-install`.

. Click YAML and add a version field to the `spec:` of your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. For example, to update to {ProductName} 1.1.0, add `version: v1.1`.

----
spec:
  version: v1.1
  ...
----

The version field specifies the version of {ProductShortName} to install and defaults to the latest available version.

[NOTE]
====
Note that support for {ProductName} v1.0 ended in October, 2020.  You must upgrade to either v1.1 or v2.0.
