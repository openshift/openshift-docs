= Creating account wide roles

[role="_abstract"]
You create your account wide roles to create your cluster by using the {rosa-cli-first} tool.

[NOTE]
====
If you already have account roles from an earlier deployment, skip this step. The UI will detect your existing roles after you select an associated AWS account.
====

If this is the _first time_ you are deploying {product-title} in this account and you have _not_ yet created the account roles, create the account-wide roles and policies, including the Operator policies.

.Procedure
* In your terminal, run the following command to create the account-wide roles:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create account-roles --mode auto --yes
----
+
**Example output**
