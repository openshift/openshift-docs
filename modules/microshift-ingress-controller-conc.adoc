= Using ingress control in {microshift-short}

When you create your {microshift-short} cluster, each pod and service running on the cluster is allocated an IP address. These IP addresses are accessible to other pods and services running nearby by default, but are not accessible to external clients. {microshift-short} uses a minimal implementation of the {ocp} `IngressController` API to enable external access to cluster services.

With more configuration options, you can fine-tune ingress to meet your specific needs. To use enhanced ingress control, update the parameters in the {microshift-short} configuration file and restart the service. Ingress configuration is useful in a variety of ways, for example:

* If your application starts processing requests from clients but the connection is
closed before it can respond, you can set the `ingress.tuningOptions.serverTimeout` parameter in the configuration file to a higher value to accommodate the speed of the response from the server.

* If the router has many connections open because an application running on the cluster does not close connections properly, you can set the `ingress.tuningOptions.serverTimeout` and `spec.tuningOptions.serverFinTimeout` parameters to a lower value, forcing those connections to close sooner.
