= Using the must-gather tool

You can collect logs, metrics, and information about {MTC-short} custom resources by using the `must-gather` tool.

The `must-gather` data must be attached to all customer cases.

You can collect data for a one-hour or a 24-hour period and view the data with the Prometheus console.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in to the {product-title} cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.
. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command:

* To gather data for the past hour:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/rhmtc/openshift-migration-must-gather-rhel8:v{mtc-version}
----
+
The data is saved as `/must-gather/must-gather.tar.gz`. You can upload this file to a support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

* To gather data for the past 24 hours:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image= \
  registry.redhat.io/rhmtc/openshift-migration-must-gather-rhel8: \
  v{mtc-version} -- /usr/bin/gather_metrics_dump
----
+
This operation can take a long time. The data is saved as `/must-gather/metrics/prom_data.tar.gz`. You can view this file with the Prometheus console.

.To view data with the Prometheus console

. Create a local Prometheus instance:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make prometheus-run
----
+
The command outputs the Prometheus URL:
+
.Output
[source,terminal]
----
Started Prometheus on http://localhost:9090
----

. Launch a web browser and navigate to the URL to view the data by using the Prometheus web console.
. After you have viewed the data, delete the Prometheus instance and data:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make prometheus-cleanup
----
