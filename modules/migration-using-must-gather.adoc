= Using must-gather to collect data

You must run the `must-gather` tool if you open a customer support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal] for the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}).

The `openshift-migration-must-gather-rhel8` image for {mtc-short} collects migration-specific logs and data that are not collected by the default `must-gather` image.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.
. Run the `must-gather` command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/rhmtc/openshift-migration-must-gather-rhel8:v{mtc-version}
----

. Remove authentication keys and other sensitive information.
. Create an archive file containing the contents of the `must-gather` data directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather.local.<uid>/
----

. Upload the compressed file as an attachment to your customer support case.
