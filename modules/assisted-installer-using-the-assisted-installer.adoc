= Using the Assisted Installer

The link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform[{ai-full}] is a user-friendly installation solution offered on the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters/~new[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console]. The {ai-full} supports the various deployment platforms with a focus on bare metal, Nutanix, and vSphere infrastructures.

The {ai-full} provides installation functionality as a service. This software-as-a-service (SaaS) approach has the following advantages:

* *Web user interface:* The web user interface performs cluster installation without the user having to create the installation configuration files manually.
* *No bootstrap node:* A bootstrap node is not required when installing with the {ai-full}. The bootstrapping process executes on a node within the cluster.
* *Hosting:* The {ai-full} hosts:
** Ignition files
** The installation configuration
** A discovery ISO
** The installer
* *Streamlined installation workflow:* Deployment does not require in-depth knowledge of {product-title}. The {ai-full} provides reasonable defaults and provides the installer as a service, which:
** Eliminates the need to install and run the {product-title} installer locally.
** Ensures the latest version of the installer up to the latest tested z-stream releases. Older versions remain available, if needed.
** Enables building automation by using the API without the need to run the {product-title} installer locally.
* *Advanced networking:* The {ai-full} supports IPv4 networking with SDN and OVN, IPv6 and dual stack networking with OVN only, NMState-based static IP addressing, and an HTTP/S proxy. OVN is the default Container Network Interface (CNI) for OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later releases. SDN is supported up to {product-title} 4.14, but is not supported for {product-title} 4.15 and later releases.

* *Preinstallation validation:* The {ai-full} validates the configuration before installation to ensure a high probability of success. The validation process includes the following checks:
** Ensuring network connectivity
** Ensuring sufficient network bandwidth
** Ensuring connectivity to the registry
** Ensuring time synchronization between cluster nodes
** Verifying that the cluster nodes meet the minimum hardware requirements
** Validating the installation configuration parameters
* *REST API:* The {ai-full} has a REST API, enabling automation.

The {ai-full} supports installing {product-title} on premises in a connected environment, including with an optional HTTP/S proxy. It can install the following:

* Highly available {product-title} or {sno} (SNO)

* {product-title} on bare metal, Nutanix, or vSphere with full platform integration, or other virtualization platforms without integration

* Optional: {VirtProductName}, multicluster engine, {lvms-first}, and {rh-storage}

[NOTE]
====
Currently, {VirtProductName} and {lvms} are not supported on {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architecture.
====

The user interface provides an intuitive interactive workflow where automation does not exist or is not required. Users may also automate installations using the REST API.
