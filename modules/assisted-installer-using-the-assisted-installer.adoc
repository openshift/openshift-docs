= Using the Assisted Installer

The {product-title} link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters/~new[{ai-full}] is a user-friendly installation solution offered on the link:http://console.redhat.com[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console]. The {ai-full} supports the various deployment platforms with a focus on bare metal, Nutanix, and vSphere infrastructures.

The {ai-full} provides installation functionality as a service. This software-as-a-service (SaaS) approach has the following advantages:

* *Web user interface:* The web user interface performs cluster installation without the user having to create the installation configuration files manually.
* *No bootstrap node:* A bootstrap node is not required when installing with the {ai-full}. The bootstrapping process executes on a node within the cluster.
* *Hosting:* The {ai-full} hosts:
  - Ignition files
  - The installation configuration
  - A discovery ISO
  - The installer
* *Streamlined installation workflow:* Deployment does not require in-depth knowledge of {product-title}. The {ai-full} provides reasonable defaults and provides the installer as a service, which:
  - Eliminates the need to install and run the {product-title} installer locally.
  - Ensures the latest version of the installer up to the latest tested z-stream releases. Older versions remain available, if needed.
  - Enables building automation by using the API without the need to run the {product-title} installer locally.
* *Advanced networking:* The {ai-full} supports IPv4 networking with SDN and OVN, IPv6 and dual stack networking with OVN only, NMState-based static IP addressing, and an HTTP/S proxy. OVN is the default Container Network Interface (CNI) for OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later releases, but you can use SDN.

* *Preinstallation validation:* The {ai-full} validates the configuration before installation to ensure a high probability of success. Validation includes:
  - Ensuring network connectivity
  - Ensuring sufficient network bandwidth
  - Ensuring connectivity to the registry
  - Ensuring time synchronization between cluster nodes
  - Verifying that the cluster nodes meet the minimum hardware requirements
  - Validating the installation configuration parameters
* *REST API:* The {ai-full} has a REST API, enabling automation.

The {ai-full} supports installing {product-title} on premises in a connected environment, including with an optional HTTP/S proxy. It can install the following:

* Highly available {product-title} or Single Node OpenShift (SNO)

* {product-title} on bare metal, Nutanix, or vSphere with full platform integration, or other virtualization platforms without integration
* Optionally {VirtProductName} and {rh-storage} (formerly OpenShift Container Storage)

The user interface provides an intuitive interactive workflow where automation does not exist or is not required. Users may also automate installations using the REST API.

See link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters/~new[Install OpenShift with the Assisted Installer] to create an {product-title} cluster with the {ai-full}. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/2022/html-single/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/index[Assisted Installer for OpenShift Container Platform] documentation for details on using the {ai-full}.
