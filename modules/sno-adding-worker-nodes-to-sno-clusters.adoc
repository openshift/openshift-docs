= Adding worker nodes using the Assisted Installer and {cluster-manager}

You can add worker nodes to {sno} clusters that were created on link:https://console.redhat.com[{cluster-manager-first}] using the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters/~new[Assisted Installer].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Adding worker nodes to {sno} clusters is only supported for clusters running {product-title} version 4.11 and up.
====

.Prerequisites

* Have access to a {sno} cluster installed using link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters/~new[Assisted Installer].
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Ensure that all the required DNS records exist for the cluster that you are adding the worker node to.

.Procedure

. Log in to link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[{cluster-manager}] and click the single-node cluster that you want to add a worker node to.

. Click *Add hosts*, and download the discovery ISO for the new worker node, adding SSH public key and configuring cluster-wide proxy settings as required.

. Boot the target host using the discovery ISO, and wait for the host to be discovered in the console. After the host is discovered, start the installation.

. As the installation proceeds, the installation generates pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) for the worker node. When prompted, approve the pending CSRs to complete the installation.
+
When the worker node is sucessfully installed, it is listed as a worker node in the cluster web console.

[IMPORTANT]
====
New worker nodes will be encrypted using the same method as the original cluster.
