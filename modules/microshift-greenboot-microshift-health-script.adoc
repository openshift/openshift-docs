= The {product-title} health script

The `40_microshift_running_check.sh` health check script only performs validation of core {product-title} services. Install your customized workload validation scripts in the greenboot directories to ensure successful application operations after system updates. Scripts run in alphabetical order.

{product-title} health checks are listed in the following table:

[id="validation-wait-period"]
== Validation wait period
The wait period in each validation is five minutes by default. After the wait period, if the validation has not succeeded, it is declared a failure. This wait period is incrementally increased by the base wait period after each boot in the verification loop.

* You can override the base-time wait period by setting the `MICROSHIFT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SEC` environment variable in the `/etc/greenboot/greenboot.conf` configuration file. For example, you can change the wait time to three minutes by resetting the value to 180 seconds, such as `MICROSHIFT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SEC=180`.
