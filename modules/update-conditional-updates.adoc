= Updating along a conditional update path

You can update along a recommended conditional update path using the web console or the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
When a conditional update is not recommended for your cluster, you can update along a conditional update path using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) 4.10 or later.

.Procedure

. To view the description of the update when it is not recommended because a risk might apply, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --include-not-recommended
----

. If the cluster administrator evaluates the potential known risks and decides it is acceptable for the current cluster, then the administrator can waive the safety guards and proceed the update by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --allow-not-recommended --to <version> <.>
----
<.> `<version>` is the supported but not recommended update version that you obtained from the output of the previous command.
