= Control Plane Machine Set Operator limitations

The Control Plane Machine Set Operator has the following limitations:

* Only Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), {ibm-power-server-name}, Microsoft Azure, Nutanix, VMware vSphere, and {rh-openstack-first} clusters are supported.

* Clusters that do not have preexisting machines that represent the control plane nodes cannot use a control plane machine set or enable the use of a control plane machine set after installation. Generally, preexisting control plane machines are only present if a cluster was installed using infrastructure provisioned by the installation program.
+
To determine if a cluster has the required preexisting control plane machines, run the following command as a user with administrator privileges:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machine \
  -n openshift-machine-api \
  -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role=master

* The Operator requires the Machine API Operator to be operational and is therefore not supported on clusters with manually provisioned machines. When installing a {product-title} cluster with manually provisioned machines for a platform that creates an active generated `ControlPlaneMachineSet` custom resource (CR), you must remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machine set as instructed in the installation process.

* Only clusters with three control plane machines are supported.

* Horizontal scaling of the control plane is not supported.

* Deploying Azure control plane machines on Ephemeral OS disks increases risk for data loss and is not supported.

* Deploying control plane machines as AWS Spot Instances, GCP preemptible VMs, or Azure Spot VMs is not supported.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Attempting to deploy control plane machines as AWS Spot Instances, GCP preemptible VMs, or Azure Spot VMs might cause the cluster to lose etcd quorum. A cluster that loses all control plane machines simultaneously is unrecoverable.
====

* Making changes to the control plane machine set during or prior to installation is not supported. You must make any changes to the control plane machine set only after installation.
