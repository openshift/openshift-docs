|Component|Description

|Prometheus Operator
|The Prometheus Operator in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project creates, configures, and manages Prometheus and Thanos Ruler instances in the same project.

|Prometheus
|Prometheus is the monitoring system through which monitoring is provided for user-defined projects. Prometheus sends alerts to Alertmanager for processing. However, alert routing is not currently supported.

|Thanos Ruler
|The Thanos Ruler is a rule evaluation engine for Prometheus that is deployed as a separate process. In {product-title} {product-version}, Thanos Ruler provides rule and alerting evaluation for the monitoring of user-defined projects.

|===

// TODO: Just checking that the {product-version} is correct and replaces properly for dedicated

All of these components are monitored by the stack and are automatically updated when {product-title} is updated.
