= Common baseline model

The following configurations and use model description are applicable to all {rds} use cases.

Cluster::

The cluster conforms to these requirements:

* High-availability (3+ supervisor nodes) control plane
* Non-schedulable supervisor nodes
* Multiple `MachineConfigPool` resources

Storage::

Core use cases require persistent storage as provided by external {rh-storage}. For more information, see the "Storage" subsection in "Reference core design components".

Networking::

{rds-caps} clusters networking conforms to these requirements:

* Dual stack IPv4/IPv6

* Fully disconnected: Clusters do not have access to public networking at any point in their lifecycle.

* Multiple networks: Segmented networking provides isolation between OAM, signaling, and storage traffic.

* Cluster network type: OVN-Kubernetes is required for IPv6 support.

+
Core clusters have multiple layers of networking supported by underlying RHCOS, SR-IOV Operator, Load Balancer, and other components detailed in the following "Networking" section. At a high level these layers include:

* Cluster networking: The cluster network configuration is defined and applied through the installation configuration. Updates to the configuration can be done at Day 2 through the NMState Operator. Initial configuration can be used to establish:

** Host interface configuration

** Active/Active Bonding (Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP))

* Secondary or additional networks: OpenShift CNI is configured through the Network `additionalNetworks` or NetworkAttachmentDefinition CRs.

** MACVLAN

* Application Workload: User plane networking is running in cloud-native network functions (CNFs).

Service Mesh::

Use of Service Mesh by telco CNFs is very common. It is expected that all core clusters will include a Service Mesh implementation. Service Mesh implementation and configuration is outside the scope of this specification.
