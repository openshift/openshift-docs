= Installing the {ServerlessOperatorName}

This procedure describes how to install and subscribe to the {ServerlessOperatorName} from the OperatorHub using the {product-title} web console.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before upgrading to the latest Serverless release, you must remove the community Knative Eventing Operator if you have previously installed it. Having the Knative Eventing Operator installed prevents you from being able to install the latest version of Knative Eventing using the {ServerlessOperatorName}.
====

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* page.

. Scroll, or type the keyword *Serverless* into the *Filter by keyword* box to find the {ServerlessOperatorName}.

. Review the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:
.. The *Installation Mode* is *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This mode installs the Operator in the default `openshift-serverless` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster.
.. The *Installed Namespace* will be `openshift-serverless`.
.. Select the *stable* channel as the *Update Channel*. The *stable* channel will enable installation of the latest stable release of the {ServerlessOperatorName}.
.. Select *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy.

. Click *Install* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on this {product-title} cluster.

. From the *Catalog* -> *Operator Management* page, you can monitor the {ServerlessOperatorName} subscription's installation and upgrade progress.
.. If you selected a *Manual* approval strategy, the subscription's upgrade status will remain *Upgrading* until you review and approve its install plan. After approving on the *Install Plan* page, the subscription upgrade status moves to *Up to date*.
.. If you selected an *Automatic* approval strategy, the upgrade status should resolve to *Up to date* without intervention.

.Verification

After the Subscription's upgrade status is *Up to date*, select *Catalog* -> *Installed Operators* to verify that the {ServerlessOperatorName} eventually shows up and its *Status* ultimately resolves to *InstallSucceeded* in the relevant namespace.

If it does not:

. Switch to the *Catalog* -> *Operator Management* page and inspect the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors under *Status*.

. Check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-serverless` project on the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot further.
