= Installing the {ServerlessOperatorName}

This procedure describes how to install and subscribe to the {ServerlessOperatorName} from the OperatorHub using the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to the *Operators* → *OperatorHub* page.
. Scroll, or type they keyword *Serverless* into the *Filter by keyword box* to find the {ServerlessOperatorName}.

. Review the information about the Operator and click *Install*.
. On the *Install Operator* page:
.. The *Installation Mode* is *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This mode installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster.
.. The *Installed Namespace* will be `openshift-operators`.
.. Select the *4.6* channel as the *Update Channel*. The *4.6* channel will enable installation of the latest stable release of the {ServerlessOperatorName}.
.. Select *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy.
. Click *Install* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on this {product-title} cluster.
. From the *Catalog* → *Operator Management* page, you can monitor the {ServerlessOperatorName} subscription’s installation and upgrade progress.
.. If you selected a *Manual* approval strategy, the subscription’s upgrade status will remain *Upgrading* until you review and approve its install plan. After approving on the *Install Plan* page, the subscription upgrade status moves to *Up to date*.
.. If you selected an *Automatic* approval strategy, the upgrade status should resolve to *Up to date* without intervention.

.Verification steps

After the Subscription’s upgrade status is *Up to date*, select *Catalog* → *Installed Operators* to verify that the {ServerlessOperatorName} eventually shows up and its *Status* ultimately resolves to *InstallSucceeded* in the relevant namespace.

If it does not:

. Switch to the *Catalog* → *Operator Management* page and inspect the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors under *Status*.
. Check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-operators` project on the *Workloads* → *Pods* page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot further.
