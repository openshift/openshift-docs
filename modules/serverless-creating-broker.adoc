= Creating a broker as a developer

.Procedure

. If you do not have an existing event sink created to consume events from the broker, create a simple Knative Service to use as an event sink.
.. Save the following YAML in a `.yaml` file:
+

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
  namespace: default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display
----

.. Create the Service by applying the file:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <FILENAME>
----

. If you do not have an existing event source, create an event source that emits events to the `default` broker. The following example shows how you can create a basic PingSource.
.. Save the following YAML in a `.yaml` file:
+

[source,yml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha2
kind: PingSource
metadata:
  name: ping-source
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
  jsonData: '{"message": "Hello serverless!"}'
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1beta1
      kind: Broker
      name: default
----

+
..  Create the event source by applying the file:

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <FILENAME>
----

. Create the broker by creating a Trigger object that uses the `knative-eventing-injection: enabled` annotation.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you create a broker that uses the `knative-eventing-injection: enabled` annotation, you cannot delete this broker without cluster administrator permissions.
If you delete the broker without having a cluster administrator remove this annotation first, the broker will be created again after deletion.
====

.. Save the following YAML in a `.yaml` file:
+

[source,yml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  annotations:
    knative-eventing-injection: enabled
  name: example-trigger
spec:
  broker: default
  subscriber: <1>
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display <1>
----

+
<1> Specify the name of the event sink to use with the broker.

+
..  Create the broker by applying the file:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <FILENAME>
----

.Verification steps

You can verify that events were sent to the event sink by looking at the sink Pod's logs.

By default, Knative Services terminate their pods if no traffic is received within a 60 second period.
The example shown in this procedure creates a PingSource that sends a message every 2 minutes, so each message should be observed in a newly created pod.

. Watch for a new Pod:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ watch oc get pods
----

. Cancel watching the pods by pressing Ctrl+C.
. Review the logs of the new Pod:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs $(oc get pod -o name | grep event-display) -c user-container
----

+
The logs should contain lines similar to the following:
