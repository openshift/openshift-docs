= About the Build resource

The `Build` resource defines the source code of your application and the location where your application images will be pushed. The following example shows a simple build that consists of a Git source, a build strategy, and an output image:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1 
kind: Build 
metadata: 
  name: buildah-golang-build 
spec: 
  source: 
    git: 
      url: https://github.com/username/taxi 
  strategy: 
    name: buildah 
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy 
  output: 
    image: registry.mycompany.com/my-org/taxi-app:latest
----

You can also extend a `Build` resource to push your images to a private registry or use a `.podman` file.
