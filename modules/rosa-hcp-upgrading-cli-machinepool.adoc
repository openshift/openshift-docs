= Upgrading machine pools with the ROSA CLI

You can manually upgrade one or more machine pools in a {hcp-title} cluster by using the ROSA CLI. This method schedules the specified machine pool for an upgrade if a more recent version is available, either immediately, or at a specified future time.

[NOTE]
====
Your control plane only supports machine pools within two minor Y-stream versions. For example, a {hcp-title} cluster with a control plane using version 4.15.z supports machine pools with version 4.13.z and 4.14.z, but the control plane does not support machine pools using version 4.12.z.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have installed and configured the latest version of the ROSA CLI.
* No upgrades for the hosted control plane are in progress on the cluster, or scheduled to occur at the same time as the machine pool upgrade.

= Upgrading machine pools

When your hosted control plane upgrade is complete, you can upgrade one or more machine pools.

//END WHOLE CLUSTER condition

.Procedure
. Verify the current version of your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe cluster --cluster=<cluster_name_or_id> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<cluster_name_or_id>` with the cluster name or the cluster ID.
+
ifeval::["{context}" != "rosa-hcp-upgrading-whole-cluster"]
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
OpenShift Version:     4.14.0
----
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "rosa-hcp-upgrading-whole-cluster"]
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
OpenShift Version:     4.14.8
----
//WHOLE CLUSTER: updating the version here to show after hcp upgrade in whole cluster section
endif::[]

. List the versions that you can upgrade your machine pools to by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list upgrade --cluster <cluster-name> --machinepool <machinepool_name>
----
+
The command returns a list of available updates, including the recommended version.
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
VERSION  NOTES
4.14.5   recommended
4.14.4
4.14.3
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not upgrade your machine pool to a version higher than your control plane. If you want to move to a higher version, upgrade the control plane to that version first.
====
//Is it even possible to do this? Will a higher version display? Can you specify a higher version even if it doesn't display?

. Verify the upgrade behavior of the machine pools you intend to upgrade by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe machinepool --cluster=<cluster_name_or_id> <machinepool_name> 
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Replicas: 5
Node drain grace period:   30 minutes

Management upgrade:
- Type: Replace
- Max surge: 20%
- Max unavailable: 20%
----
+
In the example, these settings allow the machine pool to provision one excess node (`max-surge` of 20% of `replicas`) and to have up to one node unavailable (`max-unavailable` of 20% of `replicas`) during an upgrade. This machine pool can therefore upgrade two nodes at a time, by provisioning one new node in excess of the replica count, and by making one node unavailable and replacing it. Node upgrades may be delayed by up to 30 minutes (`node-drain-grace-period` of 30 minutes) if necessary to protect workloads that have a pod disruption budget.

. Upgrade a machine pool by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa upgrade machinepool -c <cluster_name> <machinepool_name> [--schedule-date=<yyyy-mm-dd> --schedule-time=<HH:mm>] --version <version_number>
----
+
You can upgrade multiple machine pools concurrently by running this command for each machine pool you want to upgrade.

** To schedule the immediate upgrade of a machine pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa upgrade machinepool -c <cluster_name> <machinepool_name> --version <version_number>
----
+
The machine pool is scheduled for immediate upgrade, which initiates a rolling replacement of all nodes in the specified machine pool.

** To schedule an upgrade to start at a future time:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa upgrade machinepool -c <cluster_name> <machinepool_name> --schedule-date=<yyyy-mm-dd> --schedule-time=<HH:mm> --version <version_number>
----
+
The machine pool is scheduled to begin an upgrade at the specified time and date in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This will initiate a rolling replacement of all nodes in the specified machine pool, beginning at the specified time.

.Troubleshooting
* Sometimes a scheduled upgrade does not initiate. See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6648291[Upgrade maintenance canceled] for more information.
