= Upgrading machine pools with the ROSA CLI

You can manually upgrade one or more machine pools in a {hcp-title} cluster by using the ROSA CLI. This method schedules the specified machine pool for an upgrade if a more recent version is available, either immediately, or at a specified future time.

[NOTE]
====
Your control plane only supports machine pools within two minor Y-stream versions. For example, a {hcp-title} cluster with a control plane using version 4.15.z supports machine pools with version 4.13.z and 4.14.z, but the control plane does not support machine pools using version 4.12.z.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have installed and configured the latest version of the ROSA CLI.
* No upgrades for the hosted control plane are in progress on the cluster, or scheduled to occur at the same time as the machine pool upgrade.

When your hosted control plane upgrade is complete, you can upgrade one or more machine pools.

.Procedure
. Verify the current version of your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe cluster --cluster=<cluster_name_or_id> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<cluster_name_or_id>` with the cluster name or the cluster ID.
+
ifeval::["{context}" != "rosa-hcp-upgrading-whole-cluster"]
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
OpenShift Version:     4.14.0
----
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "rosa-hcp-upgrading-whole-cluster"]
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
OpenShift Version:     4.14.8
----
//WHOLE CLUSTER: updating the version here to show after hcp upgrade in whole cluster section
endif::[]

. List the versions that you can upgrade your machine pools to by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list upgrade --cluster <cluster-name> --machinepool <machinepool_name>
----
+
The command returns a list of available updates, including the recommended version.
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
VERSION  NOTES
4.14.5   recommended
4.14.4
4.14.3
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not upgrade your machine pool to a version higher than your control plane. If you want to move to a higher version, upgrade the control plane to that version first.
====
//Is it even possible to do this? Will a higher version display? Can you specify a higher version even if it doesn't display?

. Verify the upgrade behavior of the machine pools you intend to upgrade by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe machinepool --cluster=<cluster_name_or_id> <machinepool_name> 
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

Replicas: 5
Node drain grace period:   30 minutes

Management upgrade:
- Type: Replace
- Max surge: 20%
- Max unavailable: 20%
----
+
In the example, these settings allow the machine pool to provision one excess node (`max-surge` of 20% of `replicas`) and to have up to one node unavailable (`max-unavailable` of 20% of `replicas`) during an upgrade. This machine pool can therefore upgrade two nodes at a time, by provisioning one new node in excess of the replica count, and by making one node unavailable and replacing it. Node upgrades may be delayed by up to 30 minutes (`node-drain-grace-period` of 30 minutes) if necessary to protect workloads that have a pod disruption budget.

. Upgrade a machine pool by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa upgrade machinepool -c <cluster_name> <machinepool_name> [--schedule-date=<yyyy-mm-dd> --schedule-time=<HH:mm>] --version <version_number>
----
+
You can upgrade multiple machine pools concurrently by running this command for each machine pool you want to upgrade.

** To schedule the immediate upgrade of a machine pool, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa upgrade machinepool -c <cluster_name> <machinepool_name> --version <version_number>
----
+
The machine pool is scheduled for immediate upgrade, which initiates a rolling replacement of all nodes in the specified machine pool.

** To schedule an upgrade to start at a future time, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa upgrade machinepool -c <cluster_name> <machinepool_name> --schedule-date=<yyyy-mm-dd> --schedule-time=<HH:mm> --version <version_number>
----
+
The machine pool is scheduled to begin an upgrade at the specified time and date in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This will initiate a rolling replacement of all nodes in the specified machine pool, beginning at the specified time.
