[NOTE]
====
If you already have a `config.yml` file for CircleCI in your repository, add a new jobs section with the specified details in your existing configuration file.
====
. After you commit the configuration file to your repository, navigate to the *Jobs* queue in your CircleCI dashboard to verify the build policy enforcement.
