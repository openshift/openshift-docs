= Removing the `UsingDeprecatedAPIExtensionsV1Beta1` alert

As of {product-title} 4.3.8, the `UsingDeprecatedAPIExtensionsV1Beta1` alert is no longer required. As long as your cluster version is 4.3.8 or newer, you can safely remove this rule.

.Procedure

. Verify that your cluster version is 4.3.8 or newer:
+
----
$ oc get clusterversion
----
+
If your cluster version is earlier than 4.3.8, upgrade before proceeding.

. Review the contents of the `kube-apiserver` `PrometheusRule`:
+
----
$ oc get prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com/kube-apiserver -n openshift-kube-apiserver -oyaml
----
+
Find the `UsingDeprecatedAPIExtensionsV1Beta1` rule in the output.

. Remove the `UsingDeprecatedAPIExtensionsV1Beta1` rule.

** If `UsingDeprecatedAPIExtensionsV1Beta1` is the only rule listed in the output, remove it using the following command:
+
----
$ oc delete prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com/kube-apiserver -n openshift-kube-apiserver
----

** If there are more rules, you must manually remove only the `UsingDeprecatedAPIExtensionsV1Beta1` rule from that resource.
