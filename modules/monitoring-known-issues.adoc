For short period of time `UsingDeprecatedAPIExtensionsV1Beta1` alert existed
in {product-title} version 4.3. Starting from version 4.3.8 the alert is no
more required, if you notice it is firing in your cluster and you are on a
{product-title} version 4.3.8 or newer you can safely remove that `PrometheusRule`.


.Procedure

. Verify your cluster version:
+
----
$ oc get clusterversion
----

. If cluster version is 4.3.8 or newer proceed, otherwise upgrade your cluster.

. Verify the contents of `kube-apiserv` `PrometheusRule` invoking:
+
----
$ oc get prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com/kube-apiserver -n openshift-kube-apiserver -oyaml
----

. Look for `UsingDeprecatedAPIExtensionsV1Beta1`, if this is the only rule you are safe to remove it invoking:
+
----
$ oc delete prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com/kube-apiserver -n openshift-kube-apiserver
----

. If there are more rules you should manually remove only the `UsingDeprecatedAPIExtensionsV1Beta1` rule from that resource.
