= Configuring workload update methods

When you upgrade {VirtProductName}, virtual machine instance (VMI) workloads, such as `virt-launcher` pods, update automatically if they support live migration. You can configure workload update strategies or opt out of workload updates by editing the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* To use live migration as an update method, you must first enable live migration in the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a `VirtualMachineInstance` CR contains `evictionStrategy: LiveMigrate` and the VMI does not support live migration, the VMI will not update.
====

.Procedure

. To open the `HyperConverged` CR in your default editor, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit hco -n openshift-cnv kubevirt-hyperconverged
----

. Edit the `workloadUpdateStrategy` stanza of the `HyperConverged` CR. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
spec:
  workloadUpdateStrategy:
    workloadUpdateMethods: <1>
    - LiveMigrate <2>
    - Evict <3>
    batchEvictionSize: 10 <4>
    batchEvictionInterval: "1m0s" <5>
----
<1> The methods that can be used to perform automated workload updates. The supported values are `LiveMigrate` and `Evict`. By default, only `LiveMigrate` is enabled. If you enable both options as shown in this example, updates use `LiveMigrate` for VMIs that support live migration and `Evict` for any VMIs that do not support live migration. To disable automatic workload updates, set `workloadUpdateMethods: []` to leave the array empty.
<2> The least disruptive update method. VMIs that support live migration are updated by migrating the virtual machine (VM) guest into a new pod with the updated components enabled. If `LiveMigrate` is the only workload update method listed, VMIs that do not support live migration are not disrupted or updated. `LiveMigrate` is enabled by default.
<3> A disruptive method that shuts down VMI pods during upgrade. `Evict` is the only update method available if live migration is not enabled in the cluster. If a VMI is controlled by a `VirtualMachine` object that has `runStrategy: always` configured, a new VMI is created in a new pod with updated components. `Evict` is not enabled by default.
<4> The number of VMIs that can be forced to be updated at a time. The default value is `10`.
<5> The interval to wait before evicting the next batch of workloads. The default value is `"1m0s"`.
