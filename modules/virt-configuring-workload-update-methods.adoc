= Configuring workload update methods

You can configure workload update methods by editing the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* To use live migration as an update method, you must first enable live migration in the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a `VirtualMachineInstance` CR contains `evictionStrategy: LiveMigrate` and the virtual machine instance (VMI) does not support live migration, the VMI will not update.
====

.Procedure

. To open the `HyperConverged` CR in your default editor, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n {CNVNamespace}
----

. Edit the `workloadUpdateStrategy` stanza of the `HyperConverged` CR. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
spec:
  workloadUpdateStrategy:
    workloadUpdateMethods: <1>
    - LiveMigrate <2>
    - Evict <3>
    batchEvictionSize: 10 <4>
    batchEvictionInterval: "1m0s" <5>
# ...
----
<1> The methods that can be used to perform automated workload updates. The available values are `LiveMigrate` and `Evict`. If you enable both options as shown in this example, updates use `LiveMigrate` for VMIs that support live migration and `Evict` for any VMIs that do not support live migration. To disable automatic workload updates, you can either remove the `workloadUpdateStrategy` stanza or set `workloadUpdateMethods: []` to leave the array empty.
//NOTE: in 4.10, removing the stanza will not disable the feature.
<2> The least disruptive update method. VMIs that support live migration are updated by migrating the virtual machine (VM) guest into a new pod with the updated components enabled. If `LiveMigrate` is the only workload update method listed, VMIs that do not support live migration are not disrupted or updated.
<3> A disruptive method that shuts down VMI pods during upgrade. `Evict` is the only update method available if live migration is not enabled in the cluster. If a VMI is controlled by a `VirtualMachine` object that has `runStrategy: Always` configured, a new VMI is created in a new pod with updated components.
<4> The number of VMIs that can be forced to be updated at a time by using the `Evict` method. This does not apply to the `LiveMigrate` method.
<5> The interval to wait before evicting the next batch of workloads. This does not apply to the `LiveMigrate` method.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can configure live migration limits and timeouts by editing the `spec.liveMigrationConfig` stanza of the `HyperConverged` CR.
