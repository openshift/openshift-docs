* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-2009[TRACING-2009] The Jaeger Operator has been updated to include support for the Strimzi Kafka Operator 0.23.0.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-1907[TRACING-1907] The Jaeger agent sidecar injection was failing due to missing config maps in the application namespace. The config maps were getting automatically deleted due to an incorrect `OwnerReference` field setting and as a result, the application pods were not moving past the "ContainerCreating" stage. The incorrect settings have been removed.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-1725[TRACING-1725] Follow-up to TRACING-1631. Additional fix to ensure that Elasticsearch certificates are properly reconciled when there are multiple Jaeger production instances, using same name but within different namespaces. See also link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1918920[BZ-1918920].

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/TRACING-1631[TRACING-1631] Multiple Jaeger production instances, using same name but within different namespaces, causing Elasticsearch certificate issue. When multiple service meshes were installed, all of the Jaeger Elasticsearch instances had the same Elasticsearch secret instead of individual secrets, which prevented the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator from communicating with all of the Elasticsearch clusters.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-1300[TRACING-1300] Failed connection between Agent and Collector when using Istio sidecar. An update of the Jaeger Operator enabled TLS communication by default between a Jaeger sidecar agent and the Jaeger Collector.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-1208[TRACING-1208] Authentication "500 Internal Error" when accessing Jaeger UI. When trying to authenticate to the UI using OAuth, I get a 500 error because oauth-proxy sidecar doesn't trust the custom CA bundle defined at installation time with the `additionalTrustBundle`.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-1166[TRACING-1166] It is not currently possible to use the Jaeger streaming strategy within a disconnected environment. When a Kafka cluster is being provisioned, it results in a error: `Failed to pull image registry.redhat.io/amq7/amq-streams-kafka-24-rhel7@sha256:f9ceca004f1b7dccb3b82d9a8027961f9fe4104e0ed69752c0bdd8078b4a1076`.
