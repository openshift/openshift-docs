= Creating a source-to-image build in a network-restricted environment

[role="_abstract"]
Create a `source-to-image` build in a network-restricted environment by mirroring the images that `source-to-image` build strategy requires. Mirroring the images eliminates the need for public registry access. This ensures clusters use only images that comply with external content controls.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the `oc` CLI.
* Your cluster can connect and interact with the Git source used to create the `source-to-image` build.
* You have the builder-image required to create the `source-to-image` build in your local registry. If the builder-image is not present in the local registry, mirror the source image.

.Procedure

. Run the following command to mirror the images that `source-to-image` build strategy requires:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror --insecure -a <registry_authentication> registry.redhat.io/source-to-image/source-to-image-rhel8@sha256:d041c1bbe503d152d0759598f79802e257816d674b342670ef61c6f9e6d401c5 <mirror_registry>/<repo>/source-to-image-source-to-image-rhel8
----
+
where:

`<registry_authentication>`:: Specifies the authentication credentials used to access a container registry. This is required when pushing to or pulling from a private registry.
`<mirror_registry>`:: Specifies the registry where the image you want to mirror is stored.
`<image_name>`:: Specifies the name of the mirror image.
`<tag>`:: Specifies the tag of the image.


. Perform the steps mentioned in the "Creating a source-to-image build" section.
