= Cluster installation options for an {aws-service-name-full} environment

Choose one of the following installations options to install an {product-title} cluster in on AWS with
edge worker nodes in {aws-service-name-full} infrastructure:

* Full automated option: Installing a cluster to quickly extend workers to edge compute pools, where the installation program
  automatically creates infrastructure resources for the {product-title} cluster.

* Existing VPC option: Installing a cluster on AWS into an existing VPC, where you supply {aws-service-name-single} subnets
  to the `install-config.yaml` file.
