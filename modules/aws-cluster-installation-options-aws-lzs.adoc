= Cluster installation options for an AWS Local Zones environment

To install an {product-title} cluster in an AWS Local Zones environment on AWS infrastructure, choose one of the following installation options:

* Installing a cluster to quickly extend workers to edge compute pools, where the installation program automatically creates resources for the {product-title} cluster.

* Installing a cluster on AWS into an existing VPC, where you must add Local Zone subnets to the `install-config.yaml` file.
