= Displaying Open vSwitch logs

Use the following procedure to display Open vSwitch (OVS) logs.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* Run one of the following commands:

** Display the logs by using the `oc` command from outside the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm node-logs <node_name> -u ovs-vswitchd
----

** Display the logs after logging on to a node in the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# journalctl -b -f -u ovs-vswitchd.service
----
+
One way to log on to a node is by using the `oc debug node/<node_name>` command.
