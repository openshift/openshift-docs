= About storing and recording data

You can store and record data to help you protect the data and use them for troubleshooting.
You can configure the default monitoring stack by performing any of the following actions:

* Configure persistent storage:
** Protect your metrics and alerting data from data loss by storing them in a persistent volume (PV). As a result, they can survive pods being restarted or recreated.
** Avoid getting duplicate notifications and losing silences for alerts when the Alertmanager pods are restarted.
* Modify the retention time and size for Prometheus and Thanos Ruler metrics data.
* Configure logging to help you troubleshoot issues with your cluster:
** Configure audit logs for Metrics Server.
** Set log levels for monitoring.
** Enable the query logging for Prometheus and Thanos Querier.
