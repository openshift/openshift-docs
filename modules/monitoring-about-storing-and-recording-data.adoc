= About storing and recording data

[role="_abstract"]
You can store and record data to help you protect the data and use them for troubleshooting.
You can configure the monitoring stack by performing any of the following actions:

* Configure persistent storage:
** Protect your metrics and alerting data from data loss by storing them in a persistent volume (PV). As a result, they can survive pods being restarted or recreated.
** Avoid getting duplicate notifications and losing silences for alerts when the Alertmanager pods are restarted.
* Modify the retention time and size for Prometheus and Thanos Ruler metrics data.
* Configure logging to help you troubleshoot issues with your cluster:
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp[]
** Configure audit logs for Metrics Server.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp[]
** Set log levels for monitoring.
** Enable the query logging for Prometheus and Thanos Querier.
