= Machine Config Operator

The Machine Config Operator manages and applies configuration and updates of the base operating system and container runtime, including everything between the kernel and kubelet.

There are four components:

* `machine-config-server`: Provides Ignition configuration to new machines joining the cluster.
* `machine-config-controller`: Coordinates the upgrade of machines to the desired configurations defined by a `MachineConfig` object. Options are provided to control the upgrade for sets of machines individually.
* `machine-config-daemon`: Applies new machine configuration during update. Validates and verifies the state of the machine to the requested machine configuration.
* `machine-config`: Provides a complete source of machine configuration at installation, first start up, and updates for a machine.
