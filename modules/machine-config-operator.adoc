base operating system and container runtime, including everything between the
kernel and kubelet.

There are four components:

* machine-config-server: Provides Ignition configuration to new machines joining the cluster.
* machine-config-controller: Coordinates the upgrade of machines to the desired
configurations defined by a MachineConfig object. Options are provided to
control the upgrade for sets of machines individually.
* machine-config-daemon: Applies new machine configuration during update.
Validates and verifies the machine's state to the requested machine
configuration.
* machine-config: Provides a complete source of machine configuration at
installation, first start up, and updates for a machine.
