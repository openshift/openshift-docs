= Telco-specific infrastructure

Hardware requirements:: In telco networks, clusters are primarily built on bare-metal hardware. This means that the operating system (op-system-first) is installed directly on the physical machines, without using virtual machines. This reduces network connectivity complexity, minimizes latency, and optimizes CPU usage for applications.

Network requirements:: Telco networks require much higher bandwidth compared to standard IT networks. Telco networks commonly use dual-port 25 GB connections or 100 GB Network Interface Cards (NICs) to handle massive data throughput. Security is critical, requiring encrypted connections and secure endpoints to protect sensitive personal data.
