= Security and Authentication

The Argo CD Agent architecture uses `mutual TLS (mTLS)` certificates to secure communication between the principal Agent (hub) and workload Agents (spokes). `mTLS` certificates are more secure than traditional password-based authentication, unlike passwords, `mTLS` certificates allow for certificate expiration, certificate rotation, as well as subject verification to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

A root CA certificate signs both the principal and agent certificates.

The following points describe how certificate-based authentication and trust are established between the control plane (principal) and the agents in the Argo CD Agent architecture:

* The public root CA certificate must be available on both the control plane and workload clusters for certificate validation.
* The principal Agent certificate, signed by the root CA, is used to authenticate the principal to agents.
* Each agent has its own root CA-signed certificate, used to authenticate with the principal.
* This approach provides secure, verifiable communication with certificate rotation and expiration policies, reducing the risk of credential exposure.
