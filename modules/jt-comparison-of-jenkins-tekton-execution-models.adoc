|Jenkins|Tekton
|Jenkins has a control node. Jenkins executes pipelines and steps centrally, or orchestrates jobs running in other nodes.|Tekton is serverless and distributed, and there is no central dependency for execution.
|The containers are launched by the control node through the pipeline.|Tekton adopts a 'container-first' approach, where every step is executed as a container running in a pod (equivalent to nodes in Jenkins).
|Extensibility is achieved using plugins.|Extensibility is achieved using tasks in Tekton Hub, or by creating custom tasks and scripts.
