== Installing {product-title-short} on {osp} by using the {product-title-short} Operator

. On the {osp} cluster, install the {product-title-short} Operator into the `rhacs-operator` project, or namespace.
. On the {osp} cluster that will contain Central, called the central cluster, use the {product-title-short} Operator to install Central services into the `stackrox` project. One central cluster can secure multiple clusters.
. Log in to the {product-title-short} web console from the central cluster, and then create an init bundle and download it. The init bundle is then installed on the cluster that you want to secure, called the secured cluster.
. For the secured cluster:
.. Install the {product-title-short} Operator into the `rhacs-operator` namespace.
.. On the secured cluster, apply the init bundle that you created in {product-title-short} by performing one of these steps:
* Use the {ocp} web console to import the YAML file of the init bundle that you created. Make sure you are in the `stackrox` namespace.
* In the terminal window, run the `oc create -f <init_bundle>.yaml -n <stackrox>` command, specifying the path to the downloaded YAML file of the init bundle.
.. On the secured cluster, use the {product-title-short} Operator to install Secured Cluster services into the `stackrox` namespace. When creating these services, be sure to enter the address of Central in the *Central Endpoint* field so that the secured cluster can communicate with Central.

== Installing {product-title-short} on {osp} by using Helm charts

. Add the {product-title-short} Helm charts repository.
. Install the `central-services` Helm chart on the {osp} cluster that will contain Central, called the central cluster.
. Log in to the {product-title-short} web console on the Central cluster and create an init bundle.
. For each cluster that you want to secure, log in to the secured cluster and perform the following steps:
.. Apply the init bundle you created with {product-title-short}. To apply the init bundle on the secured cluster, perform one of these steps:
* Use the {ocp} web console to import the YAML file of the init bundle that you created. Make sure you are in the `stackrox` namespace.
* In the terminal window, run the `oc create -f <init_bundle>.yaml -n <stackrox>` command, specifying the path to the downloaded YAML file of the init bundle.
.. Install the `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart on the secured cluster, specifying the path to the init bundle that you created.

[id="installing-ocp-roxctl-steps"]
== Installing {product-title-short} on {osp} by using the `roxctl` CLI

This installation method is also called the _manifest installation method_.

. Install the `roxctl` CLI.
. On the {osp} cluster that will contain Central, perform these steps:
.. In the terminal window, run the interactive install command by using the `roxctl` CLI.
.. Run the setup shell script.
.. In the terminal window, create the Central resources by using the `oc create` command.
. Perform one of the following actions:
* In the {product-title-short} web console, create and download the sensor YAML file and keys.
* On the secured cluster, use the `roxctl sensor generate openshift` command.
. On the secured cluster, run the sensor installation script.
