= Deleting the KataConfig custom resource using the web console

Deleting the `KataConfig` custom resource (CR) removes and uninstalls the `kata` runtime and its related resources from your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deleting the `KataConfig` CR automatically reboots the worker nodes. The reboot can take from 10 to more than 60 minutes. Factors that impede reboot time are as follows:

* A larger {product-title} deployment with a greater number of worker nodes.
* Activation of the BIOS and Diagnostics utility.
* Deployment on a hard drive rather than an SSD.
* Deployment on physical nodes such as bare metal, rather than on virtual nodes.
* A slow CPU and network.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have {product-title} {product-version} installed on your cluster.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have no running pods that use `kata` as the `runtimeClass`.

.Procedure

. From the *Administrator* perspective, navigate to *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators*.
. Search for the {sandboxed-containers-operator} using the *Search by name* field.
. Click the Operator to open it, and then select the *KataConfig* tab.
. Click the *Options* menu  {kebab} for the `KataConfig` resource, and then select *Delete `KataConfig`*.
. Click *Delete* in the confirmation window.

Wait for the `kata` runtime and resources to uninstall and for the worker nodes to reboot before continuing to the next step.
