= Installing the Special Resource Operator by using the web console

As a cluster administrator, you can install the Special Resource Operator (SRO) by using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.
. Create the required namespace for the Special Resource Operator:
.. Navigate to *Administration* -> *Namespaces* and click *Create Namespace*.
.. Enter `openshift-special-resource-operator` in the *Name* field and click *Create*.

. Install the Special Resource Operator:
.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose *Special Resource Operator* from the list of available Operators, and then click *Install*.

.. On the *Install Operator* page, select *a specific namespace on the cluster*, select the namespace created in the previous section, and then click *Install*.

.Verification

To verify that the Special Resource Operator installed successfully:

. Navigate to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.
. Ensure that *Special Resource Operator* is listed in the *openshift-special-resource-operator* project with a *Status* of *InstallSucceeded*.
+
[NOTE]
====
During installation, an Operator might display a *Failed* status. If the installation later succeeds with an *InstallSucceeded* message, you can ignore the *Failed* message.
====
+
. If the Operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:
+
.. Navigate to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page and inspect the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors under *Status*.
.. Navigate to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page and check the logs for pods in the `openshift-special-resource-operator` project.

[NOTE]
====
The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator is a dependency of the Special Resource Operator (SRO). If the NFD Operator is not installed before installing the SRO, the Operator Lifecycle Manager will automatically install the NFD Operator. However, the required Node Feature Discovery operand will not be deployed automatically. The Node Feature Discovery Operator documentation provides details about how to deploy NFD by using the NFD Operator.
