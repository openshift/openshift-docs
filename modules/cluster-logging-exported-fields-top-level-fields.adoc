// Normally, the following title would be an H1 prefixed with an `=`. However, because the following content is auto-generated at https://github.com/ViaQ/documentation/blob/main/src/data_model/public/top-level.part.adoc and pasted here, it is more efficient to use it as-is with no modifications. Therefore, to "realign" the content, I am going to prefix the title with `==` and use `include::modules/cluster-logging-exported-fields-top-level-fields.adoc[leveloffset=0]` in the assembly file.

// DO NOT MODIFY THE FOLLOWING CONTENT. Instead, update https://github.com/ViaQ/documentation/blob/main/src/data_model/model/top-level.yaml and run `make` as instructed here: https://github.com/ViaQ/documentation

//The top-level fields can be present in every record. The descriptions for fields that are optional begin with "Optional:"


The top level fields may be present in every record.

[discrete]
== message

The original log entry text, UTF-8 encoded. This field may be absent or empty if a non-empty `structured` field is present. See the description of `structured` for more.

[horizontal]
Data type:: text
Example value:: `HAPPY`

[discrete]
== structured

Original log entry as a structured object. This field may be present if the forwarder was configured to parse structured JSON logs. If the original log entry was a valid structured log, this field will contain an equivalent JSON structure. Otherwise this field will be empty or absent, and the `message` field will contain the original log message. The `structured` field can have any subfields that are included in the log message, there are no restrictions defined here.

[horizontal]
Data type:: group
Example value:: map[message:starting fluentd worker pid=21631 ppid=21618 worker=0 pid:21631 ppid:21618 worker:0]

[discrete]
== @timestamp

A UTC value that marks when the log payload was created or, if the creation time is not known, when the log payload was first collected. The “@” prefix denotes a field that is reserved for a particular use. By default, most tools look for “@timestamp” with ElasticSearch.

[horizontal]
Data type:: date
Example value:: `2015-01-24 14:06:05.071000000 Z`

[discrete]
== hostname

The name of the host where this log message originated. In a Kubernetes cluster, this is the same as `kubernetes.host`.

[horizontal]
Data type:: keyword

[discrete]
== ipaddr4

The IPv4 address of the source server. Can be an array.

[horizontal]
Data type:: ip

[discrete]
== ipaddr6

The IPv6 address of the source server, if available. Can be an array.

[horizontal]
Data type:: ip

[discrete]
== level

The logging level from various sources, including `rsyslog(severitytext property)`, a Python logging module, and others.

The following values come from link:http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=misc/sys/syslog.h;h=ee01478c4b19a954426a96448577c5a76e6647c0;hb=HEAD#l74[`syslog.h`], and are preceded by their http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=misc/sys/syslog.h;h=ee01478c4b19a954426a96448577c5a76e6647c0;hb=HEAD#l51[numeric equivalents]:

* `0` = `emerg`, system is unusable.
* `1` = `alert`, action must be taken immediately.
* `2` = `crit`, critical conditions.
* `3` = `err`, error conditions.
* `4` = `warn`, warning conditions.
* `5` = `notice`, normal but significant condition.
* `6` = `info`, informational.
* `7` = `debug`, debug-level messages.

The two following values are not part of `syslog.h` but are widely used:

* `8` = `trace`, trace-level messages, which are more verbose than `debug` messages.
* `9` = `unknown`, when the logging system gets a value it does not recognize.

Map the log levels or priorities of other logging systems to their nearest match in the preceding list. For example, from link:https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/logging.html#logging-levels[python logging], you can match `CRITICAL` with `crit`, `ERROR` with `err`, and so on.

[horizontal]
Data type:: keyword
Example value:: `info`

[discrete]
== pid

The process ID of the logging entity, if available.

[horizontal]
Data type:: keyword

[discrete]
== service

The name of the service associated with the logging entity, if available. For example, syslog's `APP-NAME` and rsyslog's `programname` properties are mapped to the service field.

[horizontal]
Data type:: keyword

== tags

Optional. An operator-defined list of tags placed on each log by the collector or normalizer. The payload can be a string with whitespace-delimited string tokens or a JSON list of string tokens.

[horizontal]
Data type:: text

[discrete]
== file

The path to the log file from which the collector reads this log entry. Normally, this is a path in the `/var/log` file system of a cluster node.

[horizontal]
Data type:: text

[discrete]
== offset

The offset value. Can represent bytes to the start of the log line in the file (zero- or one-based), or log line numbers (zero- or one-based), so long as the values are strictly monotonically increasing in the context of a single log file. The values are allowed to wrap, representing a new version of the log file (rotation).

[horizontal]
Data type:: long
