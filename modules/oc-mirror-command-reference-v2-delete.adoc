= Command reference for deleting images

The following tables describe the `oc mirror` subcommands and flags for deleting images:

.Subcommands and flags for the deleting images
[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Subcommand
|Description

|`--authfile <string>`
|Path of the authentication file. The default value is `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json`.

|`--cache-dir <string>`
|Use this flag to specify a directory where the oc-mirror plugin stores a persistent cache of image blobs and manifests for use during mirroring operations. The oc-mirror plugin uses the cache in the `disk-to-mirror` and `mirror-to-disk` workflows but does not use the cache in the `mirror-to-mirror` workflow. The plugin uses the cache to perform incremental mirroring and avoids remirroring unchanged images, which saves time and reduces network bandwidth usage. The default cache directory is `$HOME`. For more information, see "About the --cache-dir and --workspace flags".

|`-c <string>`, `--config <string>`
|Path to the delete imageset configuration file.

|`--delete-id <string>`
|Used to differentiate between versions for files created by the delete functionality.

|`--delete-v1-images`
|Used during the migration, along with `--generate`, in order to target images previously mirrored with oc-mirror plugin v1.

|`--delete-yaml-file <string>`
|If set, uses the generated or updated yaml file to delete contents.

|`--dest-tls-verify`
|Require HTTPS and verify certificates when talking to the container registry or daemon. The default value is `true`.

|`--force-cache-delete`
|Used to force delete the local cache manifests and blobs.

|`--generate`
|Used to generate the delete yaml for the list of manifests and blobs, used when deleting from local cache and remote registry.

|`-h`, `--help`
|Displays help.

|`--log-level <string>`
|Log level one of `info`, `debug`, `trace`, and `error`. The default value is `info`.

|`--parallel-images <unit>`
|Indicates the number of images deleted in parallel. The value must be in the range of 1–10. The default value is `4`.

|`--parallel-layers <unit>`
|Indicates the number of image layers deleted in parallel. The value must be in the range of 1–10. The default value is `5`.

|`-p <unit>`, `--port <unit>`
|HTTP port used by oc-mirror's local storage instance. The default value is `55000`.

|`--retry-delay`
|Duration delay between 2 retries. The default value is `1s`.

|`--retry-times <int>`
|The number of times to retry. The default value is `2`.

|`--src-tls-verify`
|Require HTTPS and verify certificates when talking to the container registry or daemon. The default value is `true`.

|`--workspace <string>`
|You can use the `--workspace` flag to specify a directory where the oc-mirror plugin stores the working files that it creates during a mirroring operation, such as the `ImageDigestMirrorSet` and `ImageTagMirrorSet` manifests. Use this directory to apply the generated configuration to clusters and repeat mirroring operations. For more information, see "About the --cache-dir and --workspace flags".
