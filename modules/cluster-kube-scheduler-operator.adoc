= Kubernetes Scheduler Operator

== Purpose

The Kubernetes Scheduler Operator manages and updates the Kubernetes Scheduler
deployed on top of {product-title}. The operator is based on the {product-title} library-go
framework and it is installed with the Cluster Version Operator (CVO).

The Kubernetes Scheduler Operator contains the following components:

* Operator
* Bootstrap manifest renderer
* Installer based on static pods
* Configuration observer

By default, the Operator exposes Prometheus metrics through the metrics service.

== Configuration

The configuration for the Kubernetes Scheduler is the result of merging:

* a default configuration.
* an observed configuration from the spec `schedulers.config.openshift.io`.

All of these are sparse configurations, invalidated JSON snippets which are
merged in order to form a valid configuration at the end.
