This release has the following major resolved issue:

.Adjust rsync options in DVM

In this release, you can prevent absolute symlinks from being manipulated by Rsync in the course of direct volume migration (DVM). Running DVM in privileged mode preserves absolute symlinks inside the persistent volume claims (PVCs). To switch to privileged mode, in the `MigrationController` CR, set the `migration_rsync_privileged` spec to `true`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2204461[*BZ#2204461*])
