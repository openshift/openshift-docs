= About volume and access modes for virtual machine disks

If you use the storage API with known storage providers, the volume and access modes are selected automatically. However, if you use a storage class that does not have a storage profile, you must configure the volume and access mode.

For best results, use the `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode and the `Block` volume mode. This is important for the following reasons:

* `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode is required for live migration.

* The `Block` volume mode performs significantly better than the `Filesystem` volume mode. This is because the `Filesystem` volume mode uses more storage layers, including a file system layer and a disk image file. These layers are not necessary for VM disk storage.

For example, if you use {rh-storage-first}, Ceph RBD volumes are preferable to CephFS volumes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot live migrate virtual machines with the following configurations:

* Storage volume with `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO) access mode
* Passthrough features such as GPUs

Do not set the `evictionStrategy` field to `LiveMigrate` for these virtual machines.
