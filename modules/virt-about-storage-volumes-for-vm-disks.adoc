= About volume and access modes for virtual machine disks

[role="_abstract"]
If you use the storage API with known storage providers, the volume and access modes are selected automatically. However, if you use a storage class that does not have a storage profile, you must configure the volume and access mode.

For a list of known storage providers for {VirtProductName}, see link:https://catalog.redhat.com/search?searchType=software&badges_and_features=OpenShift+Virtualization&subcategories=Storage[the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog].

For best results, use the `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode and the `Block` volume mode. This is important for the following reasons:

* `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode is required for live migration.

* The `Block` volume mode performs significantly better than the `Filesystem` volume mode. This is because the `Filesystem` volume mode uses more storage layers, including a file system layer and a disk image file. These layers are not necessary for VM disk storage.

For example, if you use {rh-storage-first}, Ceph RBD volumes are preferable to CephFS volumes.

====
You cannot live migrate virtual machines with the following configurations:

* Storage volume with `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO) access mode
* Passthrough features such as GPUs

Set the `evictionStrategy` field to `None` for these virtual machines.
The `None` strategy powers down VMs during node reboots.
