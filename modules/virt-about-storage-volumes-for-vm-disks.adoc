= About storage volumes for virtual machine disks

If you use the storage API with known storage providers, volume and access modes are selected automatically. However, if you use a storage class that does not have a storage profile, you must select the volume and access mode.

For best results, use `accessMode: ReadWriteMany` and `volumeMode: Block`. This is important for the following reasons:

* The ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode is required for live migration.

* The `Block` volume mode performs significantly better in comparison to the `Filesystem` volume mode. This is because the `Filesystem` volume mode uses more storage layers, including a file system layer and a disk image file. These layers are not necessary for VM disk storage.
+
For example, if you use {rh-storage-first}, Ceph RBD volumes are preferable to CephFS volumes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot live migrate virtual machines that use:

* A storage volume with ReadWriteOnce (RWO) access mode

* Passthrough features such as GPUs

Do not set the `evictionStrategy` field to `LiveMigrate` for these virtual machines.
