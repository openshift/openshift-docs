* {rh-rhacm-first} will be updated to 2.16 when the aligned {rh-rhacm-first} version is released.
* {rh-storage} will be updated to 4.21 when the aligned {rh-storage} version is released.
* The cert-manager Operator and {gitops-title} Operator are platform agnostic operators. 
The support lifecycle for these operators is independent from the support lifecycle for {product-title}. 
You might need to update to a newer minor version of these operators at the end of an operator lifecycle, or when planning to update the {product-title} cluster to continue support. 
For support lifecycle details for platform agnostic operators, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].
