= Mirroring an image set to a mirror registry

To populate your mirror registry with {product-title} images, you can use one of the following scenarios:

* *Partially disconnected environment*: The host can access both the internet and your mirror registry, but not your cluster nodes. This setup enables you to mirror content directly from the host machine.

* *Fully disconnected environment*: The host cannot access the internet, your mirror registry, or the cluster nodes. In this setup, you must mirror the images to a file system and then bring that host or removable media into your restricted environment.
