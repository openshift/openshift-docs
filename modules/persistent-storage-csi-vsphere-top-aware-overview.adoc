= vSphere CSI topology overview

{product-title} provides the ability to deploy {product-title} for vSphere on different zones and regions, which allows you to deploy over multiple compute clusters and datacenters, thus helping to avoid a single point of failure. 

This is accomplished by defining zone and region categories in vCenter, and then assigning these categories to different failure domains, such as a compute cluster, by creating tags for these zone and region categories. After you have created the appropriate categories, and assigned tags to vCenter objects, you can create additional machinesets that create virtual machines (VMs) that are responsible for scheduling pods in those failure domains.

The following example defines two failure domains with one region and two zones:

.vSphere storage topology with one region and two zones
|===
|Compute cluster | Failure domain |Description

|Compute cluster: ocp1, 
Datacenter: Atlanta
|openshift-region: us-east-1 (tag), openshift-zone: us-east-1a (tag)
|This defines a failure domain in region us-east-1 with zone us-east-1a.

|Computer cluster: ocp2, 
Datacenter: Atlanta
|openshift-region: us-east-1 (tag), openshift-zone: us-east-1b (tag)
|This defines a different failure domain within the same region called us-east-1b.

== vSphere CSI topology requirements 
The following guidelines are recommended for vSphere CSI topology:

* You are strongly recommended to add topology tags to datacenters and compute clusters, and *not* to hosts. 
+
`vsphere-problem-detector` provides alerts if the `openshift-region` or `openshift-zone` tags are not defined at the datacenter or compute cluster level, and each topology tag (`openshift-region` or `openshift-zone`) should occur only once in the hierarchy.
+
[NOTE]
====
Ignoring this recommendation only results in a log warning from the CSI driver and duplicate tags lower in the hierarchy, such as hosts, are ignored; VMware considers this an invalid configuration, and therefore to prevent problems you should not use it.
====

* Volume provisioning requests in topology-aware environments attempt to create volumes in datastores accessible to all hosts under a given topology segment. This includes hosts that do not have Kubernetes node VMs running on them. For example, if the vSphere Container Storage Plug-in driver receives a request to provision a volume in zone-a, applied on the Datacenter dc-1, all hosts under dc-1 must have access to the datastore selected for volume provisioning. The hosts include those that are directly under dc-1, and those that are a part of clusters inside dc-1.

* For additional recommendations, you should read the VMware https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere-Container-Storage-Plug-in/3.0/vmware-vsphere-csp-getting-started/GUID-162E7582-723B-4A0F-A937-3ACE82EAFD31.html[Guidelines and Best Practices for Deployment with Topology] section.
