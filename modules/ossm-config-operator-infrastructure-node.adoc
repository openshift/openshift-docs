= Configuring the {SMProductShortName} Operator to run on infrastructure nodes

This task should only be performed if the {SMProductShortName} Operator runs on an infrastructure node.

If the operator will run on a worker node, skip this task.

.Prerequisites

* The {SMProductShortName} Operator must be installed.

* One of the nodes comprising the deployment must be an infrastructure node. For more information, see "Creating infrastructure machine sets."

.Procedure

. List the operators installed in the namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-operators get subscriptions
----

. Edit the {SMProductShortName} Operator `Subscription` resource to specify where the operator should run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-operators edit subscription <name> <1>
----
<1> `<name>` represents the name of the `Subscription` resource. The default name of the `Subscription` resource is `servicemeshoperator`.

. Add the `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` to `spec.config` in the `Subscription` resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  config:
    nodeSelector: <1>
      node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
    tolerations: <2>
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
      value: reserved
    - effect: NoExecute
      key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
      value: reserved
----
<1> Ensures that the operator pod is only scheduled on an infrastructure node.
<2> Ensures that the pod is accepted by the infrastructure node.
