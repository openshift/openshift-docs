== Configuring the OpenShift Service Mesh Operator to run on infrastructure nodes

This task should only be performed if the {SMProductShortName} Operator will run on an infrastructure node. If the operator will run on a worker node, skip this task.

.Prerequisites

* The Service Mesh Operator must be installed using the Operator hub.

* One of the nodes must be an infrastructure node. For more information, see Creating infrastructure machine sets.

.Procedure

. Edit the {SMProductShortName} Operator `Subscription` resource to specify where the operator should run. In this example, `<name>` represents the name of the `Subscription` resource.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-operators edit subscription <name>
----

. Add the `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` to `spec.config` in the `Subscription` resource.
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
 config:
   nodeSelector: <1>
     node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
   tolerations: <2>
   - effect: NoSchedule
     key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
     value: reserved
   - effect: NoExecute
     key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
     value: reserved
----
<1> Ensures that the operator pod is only scheduled on an infrastructure node.
<2> Ensures that the pod is accepted by the infrastructure node.
