[id="security-osp-validating-certificates_{context}"]
= Scanning {rh-openstack} endpoints for legacy HTTPS certificates

Beginning with {product-title} 4.10, HTTPS certificates must contain subject alternative name (SAN) fields. Run the following script to scan each HTTPS endpoint in a {rh-openstack-first} catalog for legacy certificates that only contain the `CommonName` field.

[IMPORTANT]
{product-title} does not check the underlying {rh-openstack} infrastructure for legacy certificates prior to installation or updates. Use the provided script to check for these certificates yourself. Failing to update legacy certificates prior to installing or updating a cluster will result in cluster dysfunction.

.Prerequisites

* On the machine where you run the script, have the following software:
** Bash version 4.0 or greater
** `grep`
** link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.2/html/command_line_interface_reference/the_openstack_client[OpenStack client]
** link:https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[`jq`]
** link:https://www.openssl.org/[OpenSSL version 1.1.1l or greater]
* Populate the machine with {rh-openstack} credentials for the target cloud.


.Procedure

. Save the following script to your machine:

openstack catalog list --format json --column Name --column Endpoints \
	| jq -r '.[] | .Name as $name | .Endpoints[] | [$name, .interface, .url] | join(" ")' \
	| sort \
	> "$catalog"

while read -r name interface url; do
	# Ignore HTTP

	# Remove the path and only keep host and port

		> "$san"

	# openssl returns the empty string if no SAN is found.
	# If a SAN is found, openssl is expected to return something like:
	#
	#    X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
	#        DNS:standalone, DNS:osp1, IP Address:192.168.2.1, IP Address:10.254.1.2
	if [[ "$(grep -c "Subject Alternative Name" "$san" || true)" -gt 0 ]]; then
		echo "PASS: $name $interface $url"
	else
		invalid=$((invalid+1))
		echo "INVALID: $name $interface $url"
	fi
done < "$catalog"

# clean up temporary files
rm "$catalog" "$san"

if [[ $invalid -gt 0 ]]; then
	echo "${invalid} legacy certificates were detected. Update your certificates to include a SAN field."
	exit 1
else
	echo "All HTTPS certificates for this cloud are valid."
fi
----
====

. Run the script.

. Replace any certificates that the script reports as `INVALID` with certificates that contain SAN fields.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must replace all legacy HTTPS certificates before you install {product-title} 4.10 or update a cluster to that version. Legacy certificates will be rejected with the following message:

[source,txt]
----
x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs instead
