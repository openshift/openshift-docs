= Required GCP permissions for shared VPC installations

When you are installing a cluster to a link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc[shared VPC], you must configure the service account for both the host project and the service project. If you are not installing to a shared VPC, you can skip this section.

You must apply the minimum roles required for a standard installation as listed above, to the service project.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can use granular permissions for a Cloud Credential Operator that operates in either manual or mint credentials mode. You cannot use granular permissions in passthrough credentials mode.
====

Ensure that the host project applies one of the following configurations to the service account:
