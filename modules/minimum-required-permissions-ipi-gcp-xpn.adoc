= Required GCP permissions for shared VPC installations

When you are installing a cluster to a link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc[shared VPC], you must configure the service account for both the host project and the service project. If you are not installing to a shared VPC, you can skip this section.

You must apply the minimum roles required for a standard installation as listed above, to the service project.

You can use granular permissions for a Cloud Credential Operator that operates in either manual or mint credentials mode. You cannot use granular permissions in passthrough credentials mode.

Ensure that the host project applies one of the following configurations to the service account:
