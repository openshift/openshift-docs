= Required GCP permissions for shared VPC installations

When you are installing a cluster to a link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc[shared VPC], you must configure the service account for both the host project and the service project. If you are not installing to a shared VPC, you can skip this section.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must apply the minimum roles required for a standard installation to the service project. The "Required minimal permissions" table lists these permissions.

Ensure that host project applies one of the following configurations to the service account:
