= Required GCP permissions for shared VPC installations

When you are installing a cluster to a link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc[shared VPC], you must configure the service account for both the host project and the service project. If you are not installing to a shared VPC, you can skip this section.

You must apply the minimum roles required for a standard installation as listed above, to the service project. Note that custom roles, and therefore fine-grained permissions, cannot be used in shared VPC installations because GCP does not support adding the required permission `compute.organizations.administerXpn` to custom roles.

In addition, the host project must apply one of the following configurations to the service account:

.Required permissions for creating firewalls in the host project
