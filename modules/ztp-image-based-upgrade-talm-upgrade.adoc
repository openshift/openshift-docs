= Moving to the Upgrade stage of the image-based upgrade with {lcao} and GitOps ZTP

After you completed the `Prep` stage, you can upgrade the target cluster. During the upgrade process, the OADP Operator creates a backup of the artifacts specified in the OADP CRs, then the {lcao} upgrades the cluster.

If the upgrade fails or stops, an automatic rollback is initiated. If you have an issue after the upgrade, you can initiate a manual rollback. For more information about manual rollback, see "(Optional) Initiating a rollback with Lifecycle Agent and GitOps ZTP".

.Prerequisites

* Complete the `Prep` stage.

.Procedure

. When you are ready to move to the `Upgrade` stage, create the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR that references the `Upgrade` policy:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: cgu-ibu-upgrade
  namespace: default
spec:
  actions:
    beforeEnable:
      addClusterAnnotations:
        import.open-cluster-management.io/disable-auto-import: "true" <1>
    afterCompletion:
      removeClusterAnnotations:
      - import.open-cluster-management.io/disable-auto-import <2>
  clusters: 
  - spoke1
  enable: true
  managedPolicies: 
  - example-group-ibu-upgrade-policy
  remediationStrategy: 
    canaries: 
      - spoke1
    maxConcurrency: 1 
    timeout: 240
----
<1> Applies the `disable-auto-import` annotation to the managed cluster before starting the upgrade. This annotation ensures the automatic importing of managed cluster is disabled during the upgrade stage until the cluster is ready.
<2> Removes the `disable-auto-import` annotation after the upgrade is complete.

. Apply the `Upgrade` policy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cgu-ibu-upgrade.yml
----

.. Monitor the status and wait for the `cgu-ibu-upgrade` `ClusterGroupUpgrade` to report `Completed`.
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu -n default
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                              AGE   STATE       DETAILS
example-group-ibu-prep            31h   Completed   All clusters are compliant with all the managed policies
example-group-ibu-upgrade         31h   Completed   All clusters are compliant with all the managed policies
----
--

. When you are satisfied with the changes and ready to finalize the upgrade, create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR that references the policy that finalizes the upgrade:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: cgu-ibu-finalize
  namespace: default
spec:
  clusters: 
  - spoke1
  enable: true
  managedPolicies: 
  - example-group-ibu-finalize-policy
  remediationStrategy: 
    canaries: 
      - spoke1
    maxConcurrency: 1 
    timeout: 240
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that no other `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CRs are in progress because this causes {cgu-operator} to continuously reconcile them. Delete all `"In-Progress"` `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CRs before applying the `cgu-ibu-finalize.yaml`. 
====
--

. Apply the policy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cgu-ibu-finalize.yaml
----

.. Monitor the status and wait for the `cgu-ibu-upgrade` `ClusterGroupUpgrade` to report `Completed`.
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu -n default
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                    AGE   STATE       DETAILS
cgu-ibu-finalize        30h   Completed   All clusters are compliant with all the managed policies
cgu-ibu-prep            31h   Completed   All clusters are compliant with all the managed policies
cgu-ibu-upgrade         31h   Completed   All clusters are compliant with all the managed policies
