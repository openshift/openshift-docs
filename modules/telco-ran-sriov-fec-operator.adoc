= SRIOV-FEC Operator

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
SRIOV-FEC Operator is an optional 3rd party Certified Operator supporting FEC accelerator hardware.

Limits and requirements::
* Starting with FEC Operator v2.7.0:

** `SecureBoot` is supported

** The `vfio` driver for the `PF` requires the usage of `vfio-token` that is injected into Pods.
Applications in the pod can pass the `VF` token to DPDK by using the EAL parameter `--vfio-vf-token`.

Engineering considerations::
* The SRIOV-FEC Operator uses CPU cores from the `isolated` CPU set.

* You can validate FEC readiness as part of the pre-checks for application deployment, for example, by extending the validation policy.
