= Optional: Configuring host network interfaces

Before installation, you can set the `networkConfig` configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml` file to configure host network interfaces using NMState.

The most common use case for this functionality is to specify a static IP address on the bare-metal network, but you can also configure other networks such as a storage network. This functionality supports other NMState features such as VLAN, VXLAN, bridges, bonds, routes, MTU, and DNS resolver settings.

.Prerequisites

* Configure a `PTR` DNS record with a valid hostname for each node with a static IP address.
* Install the NMState CLI (`nmstate`).

.Procedure

. Optional: Consider testing the NMState syntax with `nmstatectl gc` before including it in the `install-config.yaml` file, because the installer will not check the NMState YAML syntax.

[NOTE]
====
Errors in the YAML syntax might result in a failure to apply the network configuration. Additionally, maintaining the validated YAML syntax is useful when applying changes using Kubernetes NMState after deployment or when expanding the cluster.

.. Create an NMState YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
interfaces:
- name: <nic1_name> <1>
  type: ethernet
  state: up
  ipv4:
    address:
    - ip: <ip_address> <1>
      prefix-length: 24
    enabled: true
dns-resolver:
  config:
    server:
    - <dns_ip_address> <1>
routes:
  config:
  - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
    next-hop-address: <next_hop_ip_address> <1>
    next-hop-interface: <next_hop_nic1_name> <1>
----
+
<1> Replace `<nic1_name>`, `<ip_address>`, `<dns_ip_address>`, `<next_hop_ip_address>` and `<next_hop_nic1_name>` with appropriate values.

.. Test the configuration file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ nmstatectl gc <nmstate_yaml_file>
----
+
Replace `<nmstate_yaml_file>` with the configuration file name.

. Use the `networkConfig` configuration setting by adding the NMState configuration to hosts within the `install-config.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish+http://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: null
        bootMACAddress: <NIC1_mac_address>
        bootMode: UEFI
        rootDeviceHints:
          deviceName: "/dev/sda"
        networkConfig: <1>
          interfaces:
          - name: <nic1_name> <2>
            type: ethernet
            state: up
            ipv4:
              address:
              - ip: <ip_address> <2>
                prefix-length: 24
              enabled: true
          dns-resolver:
            config:
              server:
              - <dns_ip_address> <2>
          routes:
            config:
            - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
              next-hop-address: <next_hop_ip_address> <2>
              next-hop-interface: <next_hop_nic1_name> <2>
----
<1> Add the NMState YAML syntax to configure the host interfaces.
<2> Replace `<nic1_name>`, `<ip_address>`, `<dns_ip_address>`, `<next_hop_ip_address>` and `<next_hop_nic1_name>` with appropriate values.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
After deploying the cluster, you cannot modify the `networkConfig` configuration setting of `install-config.yaml` file to make changes to the host network interface. Use the Kubernetes NMState Operator to make changes to the host network interface after deployment.
