= (Optional) Configuring host network interfaces

During installation, you can set the `networkConfig` configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml` file to configure host network interfaces using NMState. To use the `networkConfig` configuration setting, you must provide an NMState YAML configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before configuring host network interfaces, review the OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 release notes.
====

See link:https://nmstate.io/examples.html#interfaces-ethernet[NMState] for additional examples of the NMState syntax.

<1> Add NMState YAML syntax to configure host interfaces.

[TIP]
====
Consider saving the `networkConfig` YAML syntax to a file and testing it using the NMState command line interface before including it in the `install-config.yaml` file, because the installer will not check the NMState YAML syntax. Execute `nmstatectl gc <yaml-config>` to test the syntax. Errors in the YAML syntax might result in a failure to apply the network configuration. Additionally, maintaining the validated YAML syntax is useful when applying changes using Kubernetes NMState after deployment or when expanding the cluster.
====

The most common use case for this functionality is to specify a static IP address on the `baremetal` network, but you can also configure other networks such as a storage network. This functionality will also support other NMState features such as VLAN, VXLAN, bridges, bonds, routes, MTU, and DNS resolver settings.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Once deployed, you cannot modify the `networkConfig` configuration setting of `install-config.yaml` file to make changes to the host network interface. Use the Kubernetes NMState Operator to make changes to the host network interface after deployment.
