= Configuring virtual machine (VM) secondary network interfaces for Network Observability
You can observe network traffic on an OpenShift Virtualization setup by identifying eBPF-enriched network flows coming from VMs that are connected to secondary networks, such as through OVN-Kubernetes. Network flows coming from VMs that are connected to the default internal pod network are automatically captured by Network Observability.

.Procedure
. Get information about the virtual machine launcher pod by running the following command. This information is used in Step 5: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod virt-launcher-<vm_name>-<suffix> -n <namespace> -o yaml

. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster* and then select the *YAML* tab.
. Configure `FlowCollector` based on the information you found from the additional network investigation:

        name: my-vms/l2-network   <4>

----
<.> Ensure that the eBPF agent is in `privileged` mode so that flows are collected for secondary interfaces.
<.> Define the fields to use for indexing the virtual machine launcher pods. It is recommended to use the `MAC` address as the indexing field to get network flows enrichment for secondary interfaces. If you have overlapping MAC address between pods, then additional indexing fields, such as `IP` and `Interface`, could be added to have accurate enrichment.
<.> If your additional network information has a MAC address, add `MAC` to the field list.
<.> Specify the name of the network found in the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status` annotation. Usually <namespace>/<network_attachement_definition_name>. 

. Observe VM traffic:
.. Navigate to the *Network Traffic* page.
.. Filter by *Source* IP using your virtual machine IP found in `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status` annotation.
.. View both *Source* and *Destination* fields, which should be enriched, and identify the VM launcher pods and the VM instance as owners.
