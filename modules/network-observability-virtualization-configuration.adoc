= Configuring virtual machine (VM) secondary network interfaces for Network Observability

[role="_abstract"]
To monitor virtual machine secondary network traffic, you can configure the network observability `FlowCollector` resource to capture and enrich flows from secondary interfaces.

Network flows coming from VMs that are connected to the default internal pod network are automatically captured by network observability.

.Procedure
. Get information about the virtual machine launcher pod by running the following command. This information is used in Step 5:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod virt-launcher-<vm_name>-<suffix> -n <namespace> -o yaml
----

<1> The name of the secondary network.

<3> The list of IPs used by the secondary network.
<4> The MAC address used for secondary network.

. In the web console, navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster* and then select the *YAML* tab.
. Configure `FlowCollector` based on the information you found from the additional network investigation:
+
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1beta2
kind: FlowCollector

        name: my-vms/l2-network \ <4>
# ...
----
<1> Ensure that the eBPF agent is in `privileged` mode so that flows are collected for secondary interfaces.
<2> Define the fields to use for indexing the virtual machine launcher pods. It is recommended to use the `MAC` address as the indexing field to get network flows enrichment for secondary interfaces. If you have overlapping MAC address between pods, then additional indexing fields, such as `IP` and `Interface`, could be added to have accurate enrichment.
<3> If your additional network information has a MAC address, add `MAC` to the field list.
<4> Specify the name of the network found in the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status` annotation. Usually <namespace>/<network_attachement_definition_name>.

. Observe VM traffic:
.. Navigate to the *Network Traffic* page.
.. Filter by *Source* IP using your virtual machine IP found in `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status` annotation.
.. View both *Source* and *Destination* fields, which should be enriched, and identify the VM launcher pods and the VM instance as owners.
