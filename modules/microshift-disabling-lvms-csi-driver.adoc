[id="microshift-disabling-lvms-csi-driver_{context}"]
= Disabling deployments that run the CSI driver implementations

Use the following procedure to disable installation of the CSI implementation pods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure is for users who are defining the configuration file before installing and running {microshift-short}. If {microshift-short} is already started then CSI driver implementation will be running. Users must manually remove it by following the uninstallation instructions.
====

[NOTE]
====
{microshift-short} will not delete CSI driver implementation pods. You must configure {microshift-short} to disable installation of the CSI driver implementation pods during the startup process.
====

.Procedure

. Disable installation of the CSI driver by entering the `driver` value under the `storage` section of the {microshift-short} configuration file in `/etc/microshift/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
  storage
   driver:
   - "none" <1>
# ...
----
<1> Valid values are `none` or `lvms`.
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the `driver` value is empty or null and LVMS is deployed.
====

. Start {microshift-short} after the `driver` field is specified with a supported value in the `/etc/microshift/config.yaml` file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl enable --now microshift
----
+
[NOTE]
====
{microshift-short} does not redeploy the disabled components after a restart operation.
