= Creating network resources on {rh-openstack}

Create the network resources that an {product-title} on {rh-openstack-first} installation on your own infrastructure requires. To save time, run supplied Ansible playbooks that generate security groups, networks, subnets, routers, and ports.

.Prerequisites

* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies".
* You downloaded the playbooks in "Downloading the installation playbooks".

.Procedure

. For a dual stack cluster deployment, edit the `inventory.yaml` file and uncomment the `os_subnet6` attribute.

. On a command line, create the network resources by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml network.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The API and Ingress VIP fields will be overwritten in the `inventory.yaml` playbook with the IP addresses assigned to the network ports.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
The resources created by the `network.yaml` playbook are deleted by the `down-network.yaml` playbook.
