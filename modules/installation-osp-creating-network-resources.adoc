= Creating network resources

Create the network resources that an {product-title} on {rh-openstack-first} installation on your own infrastructure requires. To save time, run supplied Ansible playbooks that generate security groups, networks, subnets, routers, and ports.

.Procedure

. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `common.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.5/upi/openstack/common.yaml[]
----
. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `inventory.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.5/upi/openstack/inventory.yaml[]
----
. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `01_security-groups.yaml`
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.5/upi/openstack/security-groups.yaml[]
----
. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `02_network.yaml`
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.5/upi/openstack/network.yaml[]
----

. On a command line, create security groups by running the first numbered playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml 01_security-groups.yaml
----

. On a command line, create a network, subnet, and router by running the second numbered playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml 02_network.yaml
----

. Optional: If you want to control the default resolvers that Nova servers use, run the {rh-openstack} CLI command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack subnet set --dns-nameserver <server_1> --dns-nameserver <server_2> "$INFRA_ID-nodes"
