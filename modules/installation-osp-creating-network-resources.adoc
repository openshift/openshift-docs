= Creating network resources

Create the network resources that an {product-title} on {rh-openstack-first} installation on your own infrastructure requires. To save time, run supplied Ansible playbooks that generate security groups, networks, subnets, routers, and ports.

.Procedure

. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `common.yaml`:
+
.`common.yaml` Ansible playbook
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.6/upi/openstack/common.yaml[]
----
====

. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `inventory.yaml`:
+
.`inventory.yaml` Ansible playbook
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.6/upi/openstack/inventory.yaml[]
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not define values for `os_api_fip` and `os_ingress_fip`, you must perform post-installation network configuration.

If you do not define a value for `os_bootstrap_fip`, the installer cannot download debugging information from failed installations.

See "Enabling access to the environment" for more information.

. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `security-groups.yaml`:
+
.`security-groups.yaml`
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----

. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `network.yaml`:
+
.`network.yaml`
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.6/upi/openstack/network.yaml[]
----
====

. On a command line, create security groups by running the `security-groups.yaml` playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml security-groups.yaml
----

. On a command line, create a network, subnet, and router by running the `network.yaml` playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml network.yaml
----

. Optional: If you want to control the default resolvers that Nova servers use, run the {rh-openstack} CLI command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack subnet set --dns-nameserver <server_1> --dns-nameserver <server_2> "$INFRA_ID-nodes"
----

[NOTE]
====
If you did not provide a value for `os_external_network` in the `inventory.yaml` file, you must ensure that VMs can access Glance and an external connection yourself.
