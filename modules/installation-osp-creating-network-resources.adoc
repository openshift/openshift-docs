= Creating network resources on {rh-openstack}

Create the network resources that an {product-title} on {rh-openstack-first} installation on your own infrastructure requires. To save time, run supplied Ansible playbooks that generate security groups, networks, subnets, routers, and ports.

.Prerequisites

* Python 3 is installed on your machine.
* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies".
* You downloaded the playbooks in "Downloading the installation playbooks".

.Procedure

. Optional: Add an external network value to the `inventory.yaml` playbook:
+
.Example external network value in the `inventory.yaml` Ansible playbook
[source,yaml]
----
...
      # The public network providing connectivity to the cluster. If not
      # provided, the cluster external connectivity must be provided in another
      # way.

      # Required for os_api_fip, os_ingress_fip, os_bootstrap_fip.
      os_external_network: 'external'
...
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you did not provide a value for `os_external_network` in the `inventory.yaml` file, you must ensure that VMs can access Glance and an external connection yourself.
====

. Optional: Add external network and floating IP (FIP) address values to the `inventory.yaml` playbook:
+
.Example FIP values in the `inventory.yaml` Ansible playbook
[source,yaml]
----
...
      # OpenShift API floating IP address. If this value is non-empty, the
      # corresponding floating IP will be attached to the Control Plane to
      # serve the OpenShift API.
      os_api_fip: '203.0.113.23'

      # OpenShift Ingress floating IP address. If this value is non-empty, the
      # corresponding floating IP will be attached to the worker nodes to serve
      # the applications.
      os_ingress_fip: '203.0.113.19'

      # If this value is non-empty, the corresponding floating IP will be
      # attached to the bootstrap machine. This is needed for collecting logs
      # in case of install failure.
      os_bootstrap_fip: '203.0.113.20'
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not define values for `os_api_fip` and `os_ingress_fip`, you must perform postinstallation network configuration.

If you do not define a value for `os_bootstrap_fip`, the installer cannot download debugging information from failed installations.

See "Enabling access to the environment" for more information.
====

. On a command line, create security groups by running the `security-groups.yaml` playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml security-groups.yaml
----

. On a command line, create a network, subnet, and router by running the `network.yaml` playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml network.yaml
----

. Optional: If you want to control the default resolvers that Nova servers use, run the {rh-openstack} CLI command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack subnet set --dns-nameserver <server_1> --dns-nameserver <server_2> "$INFRA_ID-nodes"
----
