= Reissuing internal certificates for Secured Clusters using init bundles

Secured clusters contain the Collector, Sensor, and Admission Control components. These components use a built-in server certificate for authentication when communicating with other {product-title} components.

The RHACS portal shows an information banner when the Central certificate is about to expire.

[NOTE]
====
The information banner only appears 15 days before the certificate expiry date.
====

.Prerequisites

* To reissue certificates, you must have `write` permission for the `ServiceIdentity` resource.

.Procedure

. Choose *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
. Click *Manage Tokens*.
. Navigate to the *Authentication Tokens* section and click on *Cluster Init Bundle* (indicated with a Helm icon).
. Click *Generate bundle*.
. Enter a name for the cluster init bundle and click *Generate*.
. Click *Download Kubernetes secrets file* to download the generated bundle.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Store this bundle securely because it contains secrets.
You can use the same bundle on multiple secured clusters.
====

.Next steps
* Use the `oc -n stackrox apply -f <init-bundle.yaml>` command to create the necessary resources on each secured cluster.
