= Binding infrastructure node workloads using taints and tolerations

If you have an infra node that has the `infra` and `worker` roles assigned, you must configure the node so that user workloads are not assigned to it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended that you preserve the dual `infra,worker` label that is created for infra nodes and use taints and tolerations to manage nodes that user workloads are scheduled on. If you remove the `worker` label from the node, you must create a custom pool to manage it. A node with a label other than `master` or `worker` is not recognized by the MCO without a custom pool. Maintaining the `worker` label allows the node to be managed by the default worker machine config pool, if no custom pools that select the custom label exists. The `infra` label communicates to the cluster that it does not count toward the total number of subscriptions.
====

.Prerequisites

* Configure additional `MachineSet` objects in your {product-title} cluster.

.Procedure

. Add a taint to the infra node to prevent scheduling user workloads on it:

.. Determine if the node has the taint:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe nodes <node_name>
----
+
.Sample output
[source,text]
----
oc describe node ci-ln-iyhx092-f76d1-nvdfm-worker-b-wln2l
Name:               ci-ln-iyhx092-f76d1-nvdfm-worker-b-wln2l
Roles:              worker
 ...
Taints:             node-role.kubernetes.io/infra:NoSchedule
 ...
----
+
This example shows that the node has a taint. You can proceed with adding a toleration to your pod in the next step.

.. If you have not configured a taint to prevent scheduling user workloads on it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node_name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=reserved:NoSchedule
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the taint:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Node
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: <node_name>
  labels:
    ...
spec:
  taints:
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
      effect: NoSchedule
      value: reserved
  ...
----
====
+
This example places a taint on `node1` that has key `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` and taint effect `NoSchedule`. Nodes with the `NoSchedule` effect schedule only pods that tolerate the taint, but allow existing pods to remain scheduled on the node. 
+
[NOTE]
====
If a descheduler is used, pods violating node taints could be evicted from the cluster.
====

.. Add the taint with NoExecute Effect along with the above taint with NoSchedule Effect:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node_name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=reserved:NoExecute
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the taint:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Node
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: <node_name>
  labels:
    ...
spec:
  taints:
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
      effect: NoExecute
      value: reserved
  ...
----
====
+
This example places a taint on `node1` that has the key `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` and taint effect `NoExecute`. Nodes with the `NoExecute` effect schedule only pods that tolerate the taint. The effect will remove any existing pods from the node that do not have a matching toleration. 
+


. Add tolerations for the pod configurations you want to schedule on the infra node, like router, registry, and monitoring workloads. Add the following code to the `Pod` object specification:
+
[source,yaml]
----
tolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule <1>
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra <2>
    value: reserved <3>
  - effect: NoExecute <4>
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra <5>
    operator: Exists <6>
    value: reserved <7>
----
<1> Specify the effect that you added to the node.
<2> Specify the key that you added to the node.
<3> Specify the value of the key-value pair taint that you added to the node.
<4> Specify the effect that you added to the node.
<5> Specify the key that you added to the node.
<6> Specify the `Exists` Operator to require a taint with the key `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` to be present on the node.
<7> Specify the value of the key-value pair taint that you added to the node.
+
This toleration matches the taint created by the `oc adm taint` command. A pod with this toleration can be scheduled onto the infra node.
+
[NOTE]
====
Moving pods for an Operator installed via OLM to an infra node is not always possible. The capability to move Operator pods depends on the configuration of each Operator.
====

. Schedule the pod to the infra node using a scheduler. See the documentation for _Controlling pod placement onto nodes_ for details.
