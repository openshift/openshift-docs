= Binding infrastructure node workloads using taints and tolerations

If you have an infrastructure node that has the `infra` and `worker` roles assigned, you must configure the node so that user workloads are not assigned to it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended that you preserve the dual `infra,worker` label that is created for infrastructure nodes and use taints and tolerations to manage nodes that user workloads are scheduled on. If you remove the `worker` label from the node, you must create a custom pool to manage it. A node with a label other than `master` or `worker` is not recognized by the MCO without a custom pool. Maintaining the `worker` label allows the node to be managed by the default worker machine config pool, if no custom pools that select the custom label exists. The `infra` label communicates to the cluster that it does not count toward the total number of subscriptions.
====

.Prerequisites

* Configure additional `MachineSet` objects in your {product-title} cluster.

.Procedure

. Add a taint to the infrastructure node to prevent scheduling user workloads on it:

.. Determine if the node has the taint:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe nodes <node_name>
----
+
.Sample output
[source,text]
----
oc describe node ci-ln-iyhx092-f76d1-nvdfm-worker-b-wln2l
Name:               ci-ln-iyhx092-f76d1-nvdfm-worker-b-wln2l
Roles:              worker
 ...
Taints:             node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=reserved:NoSchedule
 ...
----
+
This example shows that the node has a taint. You can proceed with adding a toleration to your pod in the next step.

.. If you have not configured a taint to prevent scheduling user workloads on it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node_name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=reserved:NoSchedule
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively edit the pod specification to add the taint:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Node
metadata:
  name: node1
# ...
spec:
  taints:
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
      value: reserved
      effect: NoSchedule
# ...
----
====
+
These examples place a taint on `node1` that has the `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` key and the `NoSchedule` taint effect. Nodes with the `NoSchedule` effect schedule only pods that tolerate the taint, but allow existing pods to remain scheduled on the node. 
+
If you added a `NoSchedule` taint to the infrastructure node, any pods that are controlled by a daemon set on that node are marked as `misscheduled`. You must either delete the pods or add a toleration to the pods as shown in the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6592171[add toleration on `misscheduled` DNS pods]. Note that you cannot add a toleration to a daemon set object that is managed by an operator.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a descheduler is used, pods violating node taints could be evicted from the cluster.
====

. Add tolerations to the pods that you want to schedule on the infrastructure node, such as the router, registry, and monitoring workloads. Referencing the previous examples, add the following tolerations to the `Pod` object specification:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:

# ...
spec:
# ...
  tolerations:
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra <1>
      value: reserved <2>
      effect: NoSchedule <3>
      operator: Equal <4>
----
<1> Specify the key that you added to the node.
<2> Specify the value of the key-value pair taint that you added to the node.
<3> Specify the effect that you added to the node.
<4> Specify the `Equal` Operator to require a taint with the key `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` to be present on the node.
+
This toleration matches the taint created by the `oc adm taint` command. A pod with this toleration can be scheduled onto the infrastructure node.
+
[NOTE]
====
Moving pods for an Operator installed via OLM to an infrastructure node is not always possible. The capability to move Operator pods depends on the configuration of each Operator.
====

. Schedule the pod to the infrastructure node by using a scheduler. See the documentation for "Controlling pod placement using the scheduler" for details.

. Remove any workloads that you do not want, or that do not belong, on the new infrastructure node. See the list of workloads supported for use on infrastructure nodes in "{product-title} infrastructure components".
