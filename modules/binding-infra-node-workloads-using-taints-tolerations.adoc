= Binding infrastructure node workloads using taints and tolerations

If you have an infra node that has the `infra` and `worker` roles assigned, you must configure the node so that user workloads are not assigned to it.

.Prerequisites

* Configure additional `MachineSet` objects in your {product-title} cluster.

.Procedure

. Use the following command to add a taint to the infra node to prevent scheduling user workloads on it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node_name> <key>:<effect>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 node-role.kubernetes.io/infra:NoSchedule
----
+
This example places a taint on `node1` that has key `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` and taint effect `NoSchedule`. Nodes with the `NoSchedule` effect schedule only pods that tolerate the taint, but allow existing pods to remain scheduled on the node.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a descheduler is used, pods violating node taints could be evicted from the cluster.
====

. Add tolerations for the pod configurations you want to schedule on the infra node, like router, registry, and monitoring workloads. Add the following code to the `Pod` object specification:
+
[source, yaml]
----
tolerations: 
  - effect: NoSchedule <1>
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra <2>
    operator: Exists <3>
----
<1> Specify the effect that you added to the node.
<2> Specify the key that you added to the node.
<3> Specify the `Exists` Operator to require a taint with the key `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` to be present on the node. 
+
This toleration matches the taint created by the `oc adm taint` command. A pod with this toleration can be scheduled onto the infra node.
+
[NOTE]
====
Moving pods for an Operator installed via OLM to an infra node is not always possible. The capability to move Operator pods depends on the configuration of each Operator.
====

. Schedule the pod to the infra node using a scheduler. See the documentation for _Controlling pod placement onto nodes_ for details.
