=== Events

{product-title} events are records of important life-cycle information in a
project and are useful for monitoring and troubleshooting resource
scheduling, creation, and deletion issues.

To retrieve the `events` for the project, run:

`$ oc get events`

Events are also included in the resource description, which you can retrieve 
by using the {product-title} client.
