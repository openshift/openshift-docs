= About OperatorGroups
endif::[]

An _OperatorGroup_ is an OLM resource that provides multitenant configuration to
OLM-installed Operators. An OperatorGroup selects target namespaces in which to
generate required RBAC access for its member Operators.

The set of target namespaces is provided by a comma-delimited string stored in
the ClusterServiceVersion's (CSV) `olm.targetNamespaces` annotation. This
annotation is applied to member Operator's CSV instances and is projected into
their deployments.
