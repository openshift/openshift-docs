= Loki deployment sizing

Sizing for Loki follows the format of `1x.<size>` where the value `1x` is number of instances and `<size>` specifies performance capabilities.

The `1x.pico` configuration defines a single Loki deployment with minimal resource and limit requirements, offering high availability (HA) support for all Loki components. This configuration is suited for deployments that do not require a single replication factor or auto-compaction.

Disk requests are similar across size configurations, allowing customers to test different sizes to determine the best fit for their deployment needs.


[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not possible to change the number `1x` for the deployment size.
