= Configuring the ScanSettingBinding object

[role="_abstract"]
Create a `ScanSettingBinding` object in the `openshift-compliance` namespace to scan the cluster by using the `cis` and `cis-node` profiles.

This is a test.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* If you are using the compliance 2.0 feature, you can schedule your scan by using {product-title-short} to create a compliance scan schedule instead of creating the `ScanSettingBinding` on the Compliance Operator.
+
For more information about scheduling a compliance scan by using the compliance 2.0 feature, see "Customizing and automating your compliance scans" in the "Additional resources‚Äù section.

* This example uses `ocp4-cis` and `ocp4-cis-node` profiles, but {ocp} provides additional profiles. See "Understanding the Compliance Operator" in the "Additional resources" section for more information.

.Procedure

Select one of the following options:

* Use the CLI to create the YAML file and object. For example:

.. Create a file called `sscan.yaml` using the following text:
+
[source,yaml]
----

apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ScanSettingBinding
metadata:
  name: cis-compliance
profiles:
  - name: ocp4-cis-node
    kind: Profile
    apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  - name: ocp4-cis
    kind: Profile
    apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
settingsRef:
  name: default
  kind: ScanSetting
  apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
----
.. Create the `ScanSettingBinding` object by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc create -f sscan.yaml -n openshift-compliance
----
If successful, the following message is displayed:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ scansettingbinding.compliance.openshift.io/cis-compliance created
----
* Use the web console to create the object by performing the following steps:

.. Change the active project to `openshift-compliance`.
.. Click *+* to open the *Import YAML* page.
.. Paste the YAML from the previous example and then click *Create*.

.Verification

. Run a compliance scan in {product-title-short}.
+
For more information about running a compliance scan by using the compliance 1.0 feature, see "Running a compliance scan" in the "Additional resources" section.

. Ensure that `ocp4-cis` and `ocp4-cis-node` results are displayed.
