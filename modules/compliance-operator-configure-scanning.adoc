= Configuring the ScanSettingBinding object

[role="_abstract"]
By creating a `ScanSettingBinding` object in the `openshift-compliance` namespace, you can scan your cluster by using the `cis` and `cis-node` profiles either from the command-line interface (CLI) or user interface (UI).

[IMPORTANT]
====
This example uses `ocp4-cis` and `ocp4-cis-node` profiles, but {ocp} provides additional profiles. 

For more information, see "Understanding the Compliance Operator".

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the Compliance Operator.

.Procedure

* To create the `ScanSettingBinding` object from the CLI, perform the following steps:

.. Create a file named `sscan.yaml` by using the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ScanSettingBinding
metadata:
  name: cis-compliance
profiles:
  - name: ocp4-cis-node
    kind: Profile
    apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  - name: ocp4-cis
    kind: Profile
    apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
settingsRef:
  name: default
  kind: ScanSetting
  apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
----

.. Create the `ScanSettingBinding` object by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc create -f sscan.yaml -n openshift-compliance
----
If successful, the following message is displayed:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ scansettingbinding.compliance.openshift.io/cis-compliance created
----

* To create the `ScanSettingBinding` object from the UI, perform the following steps:

.. Change the active project to `openshift-compliance`.
.. Click *+* to open the *Import YAML* page.
.. Paste the YAML from the previous example, and then click *Create*.

.Verification

. Run a compliance scan in {product-title-short}.

For more information about how to run a compliance scan by using the compliance feature, see "Checking the compliance status of your infrastructure".

. Ensure that `ocp4-cis` and `ocp4-cis-node` results are displayed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* If you are using the CLI, you can view the compliance scan results from the dashboard page. 
+
For more information about how to view the compliance scan results from the dashboard page, see "Viewing the compliance standards across your environment".

* If you are using the UI, you can view the compliance scan results from both the dashboard and coverage page.
