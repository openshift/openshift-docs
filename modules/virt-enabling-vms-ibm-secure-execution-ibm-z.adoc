= Enabling VMs to run {ibm-title} Secure Execution on {ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title}

[role="_abstract"]
To enable {ibm-name} Secure Execution virtual machines (VMs) on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} on the compute nodes of your cluster, you must ensure that you meet the prerequisites and complete the following steps.

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster has logical partition (LPAR) nodes running on {ibm-name} z15 or later, or {ibm-linuxone-name} III or later.
* You have {ibm-name} Secure Execution workloads available to run on the cluster.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. To run {ibm-name} Secure Execution VMs, you must add the `prot_virt=1` kernel parameter for each compute node. To enable all compute nodes, create a file named `secure-execution.yaml` that contains the following machine config manifest:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: secure-execution
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
spec:
  kernelArguments:
    - prot_virt=1
----
+
where:
+
`prot_virt=1`:: Specifies that the ultravisor can store memory security information.

. Apply the changes by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f secure-execution.yaml
----
+
The Machine Config Operator (MCO) applies the changes and reboots the nodes in a controlled rollout.
