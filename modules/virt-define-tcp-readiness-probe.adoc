= Defining a TCP readiness probe

Define a TCP readiness probe by setting the `spec.readinessProbe.tcpSocket` field of the virtual machine (VM) configuration.


.Procedure

. Include details of the TCP readiness probe in the VM configuration file.

.Sample readiness probe with a TCP socket test
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  readinessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 120 <1>
    periodSeconds: 20 <2>
    tcpSocket: <3>
      port: 1500 <4>
    timeoutSeconds: 10 <5>
# ...
----
<1> The time, in seconds, after the VM starts before the readiness probe is initiated.
<2> The delay, in seconds, between performing probes. The default delay is 10 seconds. This value must be greater than `timeoutSeconds`.
<3> The TCP action to perform.
<4> The port of the VM that the probe queries.
<5> The number of seconds of inactivity after which the probe times out and the VM is assumed to have failed. The default value is 1. This value must be lower than `periodSeconds`.

. Create the VM by running the following command:

$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
