[id="virt-define-tcp-readiness-probe_{context}"]

= Defining a TCP readiness probe

Define a TCP readiness probe by setting the `spec.readinessProbe.tcpSocket` field of the virtual machine instance (VMI) configuration.


.Procedure

. Include details of the TCP readiness probe in the VMI configuration file.

.Sample readiness probe with a TCP socket test
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  readinessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 120 <1>
    periodSeconds: 20 <2>
    tcpSocket: <3>
      port: 1500 <4>
    timeoutSeconds: 10 <5>
...
----
<1> The time, in seconds, after the VMI starts before the readiness probe is initiated.
<2> The delay, in seconds, between performing probes. The default delay is 10 seconds. This value must be greater than `timeoutSeconds`.
<3> The TCP action to perform.
<4> The port of the VMI that the probe queries.
<5> The number of seconds of inactivity after which the probe times out and the VMI is assumed to have failed. The default value is 1. This value must be lower than `periodSeconds`.

. Create the VMI by running the following command:

$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
