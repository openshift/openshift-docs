= Considerations for using an egress IP address on additional network interfaces

In {product-title}, egress IP addresses provide administrators a way to control network traffic. Egress IP addresses can be used with a `br-ex` Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge interface and any physical interface that has IP connectivity enabled.

You can inspect your network interface type by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ip -details link show
----

The primary network interface is assigned a node IP address which also contains a subnet mask. Information for this node IP address can be retrieved from the Kubernetes node object for each node within your cluster by inspecting the `k8s.ovn.org/node-primary-ifaddr` annotation. In an IPv4 cluster, this annotation is similar to the following example: `"k8s.ovn.org/node-primary-ifaddr: {"ipv4":"192.168.111.23/24"}"`.

If the egress IP address is not within the subnet of the primary network interface subnet, you can use an egress IP address on another Linux network interface that is not of the primary network interface type. By doing so, {product-title} administrators are provided with a greater level of control over networking aspects such as routing, addressing, segmentation, and security policies. This feature provides users with the option to route workload traffic over specific network interfaces for purposes such as traffic segmentation or meeting specialized requirements.

If the egress IP address is not within the subnet of the primary network interface, then the selection of another network interface for egress traffic might occur if they are present on a node.

You can determine which other network interfaces might support egress IP address addresses by inspecting the `k8s.ovn.org/host-cidrs` Kubernetes node annotation. This annotation contains the addresses and subnet mask found for the primary network interface. It also contains additional network interface addresses and subnet mask information. These addresses and subnet masks are assigned to network interfaces that use the link:https://networklessons.com/cisco/ccna-200-301/longest-prefix-match-routing[longest prefix match routing] mechanism to determine which network interface supports the egress IP address.

[NOTE]
====
OVN-Kubernetes provides a mechanism to control and direct outbound network traffic from specific namespaces and pods. This ensures that it exits the cluster through a particular network interface and with a specific egress IP address.
====

For users who want an egress IP address and traffic to be routed over a particular interface that is not the primary network interface, the following conditions must be met:

* {product-title} is installed on a bare-metal cluster. This feature is disabled within a cloud or a hypervisor environment.

* Your {product-title} pods are not configured as _host-networked_.

* If a network interface is removed or if the IP address and subnet mask which allows the egress IP address to be hosted on the interface is removed, the egress IP address is reconfigured. Consequently, the egress IP address could be assigned to another node and interface.

* If you use an Egress IP address on a secondary network interface card (NIC), you must use the Node Tuning Operator to enable IP forwarding on the secondary NIC.
