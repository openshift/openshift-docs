== Enhancements

The following enhancements have been made with {ols-official} 1.0.9:

* With this update, {ols-long} supports automatic updates of BYO Knowledge images that use floating tags, such as `latest`. If over time a BYO Knowledge image tag points to different underlying images, {ols-long} detects those changes and updates the corresponding BYO Knowledge database accordingly. This feature is built using {red-hat} OpenShift `ImageStream` objects. {ocp-product-title} clusters check for updates to `ImageStream` objects every 15 minutes.

* Starting with this release, you can specify an array of image pull secrets in the `OLSConfig` Custom Resource (CR) file. Pull secrets contain authentication credentials for remote image registries and are used to pull RAG BYO Knowledge images from image registries requiring authentication.
