= Installing the Local Storage Operator

The Local Storage Operator is not installed in {product-title} by default. Use the following procedure to install and configure this Operator to enable local volumes in your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Create the `local-storage` project:
+
----
$ oc new-project local-storage
----

. Optional: Allow local storage creation on infrastructure nodes.
+
You might want to use the Local Storage Operator to create volumes on infrastructure nodes in support of components such as logging and monitoring.
+
You must adjust the default node selector so that the Local Storage Operator includes the infrastructure nodes, and not just worker nodes.
+
To block the Local Storage Operator from inheriting the cluster-wide default selector, enter the following command:
+
----
$ oc annotate project local-storage openshift.io/node-selector=''
----
