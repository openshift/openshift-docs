= Installing the Local Storage Operator

The Local Storage Operator is not installed in {product-title} by default. Use the following procedure to install and configure this Operator to enable local volumes in your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the {product-title} web console or command-line interface (CLI).

.Procedure

. Create the `openshift-local-storage` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm new-project openshift-local-storage
----

. Optional: Allow local storage creation on infrastructure nodes.
+
You might want to use the Local Storage Operator to create volumes on infrastructure nodes in support of components such as logging and monitoring.
+
You must adjust the default node selector so that the Local Storage Operator includes the infrastructure nodes, and not just worker nodes.
+
To block the Local Storage Operator from inheriting the cluster-wide default selector, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate project openshift-local-storage openshift.io/node-selector=''
----

.From the UI

To install the Local Storage Operator from the web console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type *Local Storage* into the filter box to locate the Local Storage Operator.

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page, select *A specific namespace on the cluster*. Select *openshift-local-storage* from the drop-down menu.

. Adjust the values for *Update Channel* and *Approval Strategy* to the values that you want.

. Click *Install*.

Once finished, the Local Storage Operator will be listed in the *Installed Operators* section of the web console.

.From the CLI
. Install the Local Storage Operator from the CLI.

.. Run the following command to get the {product-title} major and minor version. It is required for the `channel` value in the next
step.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OC_VERSION=$(oc version -o yaml | grep openshiftVersion | \
    grep -o '[0-9]*[.][0-9]*' | head -1)
----

.. Create an object YAML file to define an Operator group and subscription for the Local Storage Operator,
such as `openshift-local-storage.yaml`:
+
.Example openshift-local-storage.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: local-operator-group
  namespace: openshift-local-storage
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
    - openshift-local-storage
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: local-storage-operator
  namespace: openshift-local-storage
spec:
  channel: "${OC_VERSION}"
  installPlanApproval: Automatic <1>
  name: local-storage-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----
<1> The user approval policy for an install plan.

. Create the Local Storage Operator object by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f openshift-local-storage.yaml
----
+
At this point, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) is now aware of the Local Storage Operator. A ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) for the Operator should appear in the target namespace, and APIs provided by the Operator should be available for creation.
+
. Verify local storage installation by checking that all pods and the Local Storage Operator have been created:

.. Check that all the required pods have been created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-local-storage get pods
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
local-storage-operator-746bf599c9-vlt5t   1/1     Running   0          19m
----

.. Check the ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) YAML manifest to see that the Local Storage Operator is available in the `openshift-local-storage` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csvs -n openshift-local-storage
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                         DISPLAY         VERSION               REPLACES   PHASE
local-storage-operator.4.2.26-202003230335   Local Storage   4.2.26-202003230335              Succeeded
----

After all checks have passed, the Local Storage Operator is installed successfully.
