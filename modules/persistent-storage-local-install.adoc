= Installing the Local Storage Operator

The Local Storage Operator is not installed in {product-title} by default. Use the following procedure to install and configure this Operator to enable local volumes in your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the {product-title} web console or command-line interface (CLI).

.Procedure

. Create the `local-storage` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project local-storage
----

. Optional: Allow local storage creation on master and infrastructure nodes.
+
You might want to use the Local Storage Operator to create volumes on master and infrastructure nodes, and not just worker nodes, to support components such as logging and monitoring.
+
To allow local storage creation on master and infrastructure nodes, add a toleration to the DaemonSet by entering the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch ds local-storage-local-diskmaker -n local-storage -p '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"tolerations":[{"operator": "Exists"}]}}}}'
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch ds local-storage-local-provisioner -n local-storage -p '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"tolerations":[{"operator": "Exists"}]}}}}'
----

.From the UI

To install the Local Storage Operator from the web console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type *Local Storage* into the filter box to locate the Local Storage Operator.

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page, select *A specific namespace on the cluster*. Select *local-storage* from the drop-down menu.

. Adjust the values for *Update Channel* and *Approval Strategy* to the values that you want.

. Click *Subscribe*.

Once finished, the Local Storage Operator will be listed in the *Installed Operators* section of the web console.

.From the CLI
. Install the Local Storage Operator from the CLI.

.. Create an object YAML file to define a Namespace, OperatorGroup, and Subscription for the Local Storage Operator,
such as `local-storage.yaml`:
+
.Example local-storage
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Namespace
  metadata:
    name: local-storage
  ---
  apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha2
  kind: OperatorGroup
  metadata:
    name: local-operator-group
    namespace: local-storage
  spec:
    targetNamespaces:
      - local-storage
  ---
  apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
  kind: Subscription
  metadata:
    name: local-storage-operator
    namespace: local-storage
  spec:
    channel: "{product-version}" <1>
    installPlanApproval: Automatic
    name: local-storage-operator
    source: redhat-operators
    sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----
<1> This field can be edited to match your release selection of {product-title}.

. Create the Local Storage Operator object by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f local-storage.yaml
----
+
At this point, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) is now aware of the Local Storage Operator. A ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) for the Operator should appear in the target namespace, and APIs provided by the Operator should be available for creation.
+
. Verify local storage installation by checking that all Pods and the Local Storage Operator have been created:

.. Check that all the required Pods have been created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n local-storage get pods
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
local-storage-operator-746bf599c9-vlt5t   1/1     Running   0          19m
----

.. Check the ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) YAML manifest to see that the Local Storage Operator is available in the `local-storage` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csvs -n local-storage
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                         DISPLAY         VERSION               REPLACES   PHASE
local-storage-operator.4.2.26-202003230335   Local Storage   4.2.26-202003230335              Succeeded
----

After all checks have passed, the Local Storage Operator is installed successfully.
