= Creating monitoring dashboards for hosted clusters

The HyperShift Operator can create or delete monitoring dashboards in the management cluster for each hosted cluster that it manages.

[#hosted-control-planes-enable-dashboard]
== Enabling monitoring dashboards

To enable monitoring dashboards in a hosted cluster, complete the following steps:

.Procedure

. Create the `hypershift-operator-install-flags` config map in the `local-cluster` namespace, being sure to specify the `--monitoring-dashboards` flag in the `data.installFlagsToAdd` section. For example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: hypershift-operator-install-flags
  namespace: local-cluster
data:
  installFlagsToAdd: "--monitoring-dashboards"
  installFlagsToRemove: ""
----

. Wait a couple of minutes for the HyperShift Operator deployment in the `hypershift` namespace to be updated to include the following environment variable:

+
----
    - name: MONITORING_DASHBOARDS
      value: "1"
----

+
When monitoring dashboards are enabled, for each hosted cluster that the HyperShift Operator manages, the Operator creates a config map named `cp-[NAMESPACE]-[NAME]` in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace, where `NAMESPACE` is the namespace of the hosted cluster and `NAME` is the name of the hosted cluster. As a result, a new dashboard is added in the administrative console of the management cluster.

. To view the dashboard, log in to the management cluster's console and go to the dashboard for the hosted cluster by clicking *Observe -> Dashboards*.

. Optional: To disable a monitoring dashboards in a hosted cluster, remove the `--monitoring-dashboards` flag from the `hypershift-operator-install-flags` config map. When you delete a hosted cluster, its corresponding dashboard is also deleted.

[#hosted-control-planes-customize-dashboards]
== Dashboard customization

To generate dashboards for each hosted cluster, the HyperShift Operator uses a template that is stored in the `monitoring-dashboard-template` config map in the operator namespace (`hypershift`). This template contains a set of Grafana panels that contain the metrics for the dashboard. You can edit the content of the config map to customize the dashboards.

When a dashboard is generated, the following strings are replaced with values that correspond to a specific hosted cluster:

|===
| Name | Description
| [x-]`__NAME__` | The name of the hosted cluster
| [x-]`__NAMESPACE__` | The namespace of the hosted cluster
| [x-]`__CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE__` | The namespace where the control plane pods of the hosted cluster are placed
| [x-]`__CLUSTER_ID__` | The UUID of the hosted cluster, which matches the `_id` label of the hosted cluster metrics
