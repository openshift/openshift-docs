= Understanding default scheduling

The existing generic scheduler is the default platform-provided scheduler
_engine_ that selects a node to host the pod in a three-step operation:


Filters the Nodes::
The available nodes are filtered based on the constraints or requirements
specified. This is done by running each node through the list of filter
functions called _predicates_.

Prioritize the Filtered List of Nodes::
This is achieved by passing each node through a series of priority_ functions
that assign it a score between 0 - 10, with 0 indicating a bad fit and 10
indicating a good fit to host the pod. The scheduler configuration can also take
in a simple _weight_ (positive numeric value) for each priority function. The
node score provided by each priority function is multiplied by the weight
(default weight for most priorities is 1) and then combined by adding the scores for each node
provided by all the priorities. This weight attribute can be used by
administrators to give higher importance to some priorities.

Select the Best Fit Node::
The nodes are sorted based on their scores and the node with the highest score
is selected to host the pod. If multiple nodes have the same high score, then
one of them is selected at random.

== Understanding Scheduler Policy

The selection of the predicate and priorities defines the policy for the scheduler.

The scheduler configuration file is a JSON file, which must be named `policy.cfg`, that specifies the predicates and priorities the scheduler
will consider.

In the absence of the scheduler policy file, the default scheduler behavior is used.

// we are working on how to configures this in 4.0 right now in https://github.com/openshift/api/pull/181

[IMPORTANT]
====
The predicates and priorities defined in
the scheduler configuration file completely override the default scheduler
policy. If any of the default predicates and priorities are required,
you must explicitly specify the functions in the policy configuration.

<1> The `GeneralPredicates` predicate represents the `PodFitsResources`, `HostName`, `PodFitsHostPorts`, and `MatchNodeSelector` predicates.
Because you are not allowed to configure the same predicate multiple times, the `GeneralPredicates` predicate cannot be used alongside
any of the four represented predicates.
