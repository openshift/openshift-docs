= Creating a new system policy

In addition to using the default policies, you can also create custom policies in {product-title}.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Policy Management*.
. Click *+ New Policy*.
. Enter the *Name* for the policy.
. Select a *Severity* level for the policy: Critical, High, Medium, or Low.
. Choose the *Lifecycle Stages* for which the policy is applicable, from *Build*, *Deploy*, or *Runtime*. You can select more than one stage.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you create a new policy for integrating with a CI system, select *Build* as the lifecycle stage.
====
** Build-time policies apply to image fields such as CVEs and Dockerfile instructions.
** Deploy-time policies can include all build-time policy criteria. They can also have data from your cluster configurations, such as running in privileged mode or mounting the Docker daemon socket.
** Runtime policies can include all build-time and deploy-time policy criteria, and data about process executions during runtime.
. Enter information about the policy in the *Description*, *Rationale*, and *Remediation* fields.
When CI validates the build, the data from these fields is displayed.
Therefore, include all information explaining the policy.
. Select a category from the *Categories* drop-down menu.
. Select a notifier from the *Notifications* drop-down menu that receives alert notifications when a violation occurs for this policy.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must integrate {product-title-short} with your notification providers, such as webhooks, Jira, or PagerDuty, to receive alert notifications. Notifiers only show up if you have integrated any notification providers with {product-title-short}.
====
. Use *Restrict to Scope* to enable this policy only for a specific cluster, namespace, or label.
You can add multiple scopes and also use regular expressions in RE2 Syntax for namespaces and labels.
. Use *Exclude by Scope* to exclude deployments, clusters, namespaces, and labels.
This field indicates that the policy will not apply to the entities that you specify.
You can add multiple scopes and also use regular expressions in RE2 Syntax for namespaces and labels.
However, you cannot use regular expressions for selecting deployments.
. For *Excluded Images (Build Lifecycle only)*, select all the images from the list for which you do not want to trigger a violation for the policy.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Excluded Images (Build Lifecycle only)* setting only applies when you check images in a continuous integration system (the Build lifecycle stage).
It does not have any effect if you use this policy to check running deployments (the Deploy lifecycle stage) or runtime activities (the Runtime lifecycle stage).
====
. In the *Policy Criteria* section, configure the attributes that will trigger the policy.
//TODO: Add link to policy criteria
. Select *Next* on the panel header.
. The new policy panel shows a preview of the violations that are triggered if you enable the policy.
. Select *Next* on the panel header.
. Choose the enforcement behavior for the policy.
Enforcement settings are only available for the stages that you selected for the *Lifecycle Stages* option.
Select *ON* to enforce policy and report a violation. Select *OFF* to only report a violation.
+
[NOTE]
====
The enforcement behavior is different for each lifecycle stage.

* For the *Build* stage, {product-title-short} fails your CI builds when images match the conditions of the policy.
* For the *Deploy* stage, {product-title-short} blocks the creation and update of deployments that match the conditions of the policy if the {product-title-short} admission controller is configured and running.
** In clusters with admission controller enforcement, the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server blocks all noncompliant deployments. In other clusters, {product-title-short} edits noncompliant deployments to prevent pods from being scheduled.
** For existing deployments, policy changes only result in enforcement at the next detection of the criteria, when a Kubernetes event occurs. For more information about enforcement, see "Deploy stage enforcement".
* For the *Runtime* stage, {product-title-short} stops all pods that match the conditions of the policy.
====

[WARNING]
====
Policy enforcement can impact running applications or development processes. Before you enable enforcement options, inform all stakeholders and plan how to respond to the automated enforcement actions.
