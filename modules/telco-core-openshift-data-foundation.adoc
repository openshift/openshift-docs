New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
{rh-storage-first} is a software-defined storage service for containers.
For telco core clusters, storage support is provided by {rh-storage} storage services running externally to the application workload cluster.
{rh-storage} supports separation of storage traffic using secondary CNI networks.

Limits and requirements::
* In an IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking environment, {rh-storage} uses IPv4 addressing.
For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.17/html/planning_your_deployment/network-requirements_rhodf#network-requirements_rhodf[Network requirements].

Engineering considerations::
* {rh-storage} network traffic should be isolated from other traffic on a dedicated network, for example, by using VLAN isolation.
