New in this release::
* Clarification on internal compared to external mode and RDS recommendations.

Description::
+
--
{rh-storage} is a software-defined storage service for containers.
{rh-storage} can be deployed in one of two modes:
* Internal mode, where {rh-storage} software components are deployed as software containers directly on the {product-title} cluster nodes, together with other containerized applications.
* External mode, where {rh-storage} is deployed on a dedicated storage cluster, which is usually a separate Red Hat Ceph Storage cluster running on {op-system-base-full}.
These storage services are running externally to the application workload cluster.

For telco core clusters, storage support is provided by {rh-storage} storage services running in external mode, for several reasons:

* Separating dependencies between {product-title} and Ceph operations allows for independent {product-title} and {rh-storage} updates.
* Separation of operations functions for the Storage and {product-title} infrastructure layers, is a typical customer requirement for telco core use cases.
* External Red Hat Ceph Storage clusters can be re-used by multiple {product-title} clusters deployed in the same region.

{rh-storage} supports separation of storage traffic using secondary CNI networks.
--

Limits and requirements::
* In an IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking environment, {rh-storage} uses IPv4 addressing.
For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.19/html/planning_your_deployment/network-requirements_rhodf#ipv6-support_rhodf[IPv6 support].

Engineering considerations::
* {rh-storage} network traffic should be isolated from other traffic on a dedicated network, for example, by using VLAN isolation.
* Workload requirements must be scoped before attaching multiple {product-title} clusters to an external {rh-storage} cluster to ensure sufficient throughput, bandwidth, and performance KPIs.
