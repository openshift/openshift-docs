= Bundling an Operator and deploying on Operator Lifecycle Manager

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) helps you to install, update, and generally manage the lifecycle of Operators and their associated services on a Kubernetes cluster. OLM is installed by default on {product-title} and runs as a Kubernetes extension so that you can use the web console and the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) for all Operator lifecycle management functions without any additional tools.

The Operator Bundle Format is the default packaging method for Operator SDK and OLM. You can get your Operator ready for OLM by building, pushing, validating, and running a bundle image on OLM with the Operator SDK.

.Prerequisites

- Operator SDK CLI installed on a development workstation
- OpenShift CLI (`oc`) v{product-version}+ installed
- Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) installed on a Kubernetes-based cluster (v1.16.0 or later if you use `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1` CRDs, for example {product-title} {product-version})
- Logged into the cluster with `oc` using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions
- Operator built by using the Operator SDK
ifdef::golang[]
- Prepared your Go-based Operator to run on {product-title} by updating the project to use supported images

.Procedure

. Run the following `make` commands in your Operator project directory to build and push your Operator image. Modify the `IMG` argument in the following steps to reference a repository that you have access to. You can obtain an account for storing containers at repository sites such as Quay.io.

.. Build the image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make docker-build IMG=<registry>/<user>/<operator_image_name>:<tag>
----

.. Push the image to a repository:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make docker-push IMG=<registry>/<user>/<operator_image_name>:<tag>
----

. Update your `Makefile` by setting the `IMG` URL to your Operator image name and tag that you pushed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ # Image URL to use all building/pushing image targets
IMG ?= <registry>/<user>/<operator_image_name>:<tag>
----
+
This value is used for subsequent operations.

. Create your Operator bundle manifest by running the `make bundle` command, which invokes several commands, including the Operator SDK `generate bundle` and `bundle validate` subcommands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make bundle
----
+
Bundle manifests for an Operator describe how to display, create, and manage an application. The `make bundle` command creates the following files and directories in your Operator project:
+
--
* A bundle manifests directory `bundle/manifests` containing a `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) object
* A bundle metadata directory `bundle/metadata`
* All CRDs in `config/crd`
* A Dockerfile `bundle.Dockerfile`
--
+
These files are then automatically validated by using `operator-sdk bundle validate` to ensure the on-disk bundle representation is correct.

. Build and push your bundle image by running the following commands. OLM consumes Operator bundles using an index image, which reference one or more bundle images.

.. Build the bundle image. Set `BUNDLE_IMAGE` with the details for the registry, user namespace, and image tag where you intend to push the image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make bundle-build BUNDLE_IMG=<registry>/<user>/<bundle_image_name>:<tag>
----

.. Push the bundle image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker push <registry>/<user>/<bundle_image_name>:<tag>
----

. Check the status of OLM on your cluster by using the following Operator SDK command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk olm status \
    --olm-namespace=openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager
----

. Run the Operator on your cluster by using the OLM integration in Operator SDK:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk run bundle \
    [-n <namespace>] \//<1>
    <registry>/<user>/<bundle_image_name>:<tag>
----
<1> By default, the command installs the Operator in the currently active project in your `~/.kube/config` file. You can add the `-n` flag to set a different namespace scope for the installation.
+
This command performs the following actions:
+
--
* Create an index image with your bundle image injected.
* Create a catalog source that points to your new index image, which enables OperatorHub to discover your Operator.
* Deploy your Operator to your cluster by creating an Operator group, subscription, install plan, and all other required objects, including RBAC.
