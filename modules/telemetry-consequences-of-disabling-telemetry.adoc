= Consequences of disabling remote health reporting

In {product-title}, customers can disable reporting usage information.

Before you disable remote health reporting, read the following benefits of a connected cluster:

* Red{nbsp}Hat can react more quickly to problems and better support our customers.
* Red{nbsp}Hat can better understand how product upgrades impact clusters.
* Connected clusters help to simplify the subscription and entitlement process.
* Connected clusters enable the {cluster-manager} service to offer an overview of your clusters and their subscription status.

[NOTE]
====
Consider leaving health and usage reporting enabled for pre-production, test, and production clusters. This means that Red{nbsp}Hat can participate in qualifying {product-title} in your environments and react more rapidly to product issues.
====

The following lists some consequences of disabling remote health reporting on a connected cluster:

* Red{nbsp}Hat cannot view the success of product upgrades or the health of your clusters without an open support case.
* Red{nbsp}Hat cannot use configuration data to better triage customer support cases and identify which configurations our customers find important.
* The {cluster-manager} cannot show data about your clusters, which includes health and usage information.

* You must manually enter your subscription information in the `console.redhat.com` web console without the benefit of automatic usage reporting.
endif::[]

In restricted networks, Telemetry and {red-hat-lightspeed} data still gets gathered through the appropriate configuration of your proxy.
