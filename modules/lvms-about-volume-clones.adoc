= About volume clones

A volume clone is a duplicate of an existing persistent volume claim (PVC). You can create a volume clone to make a point-in-time copy of the data.

== Limitations for creating volume clones in multi-node topology

{lvms} has the following limitations for creating volume clones in multi-node topology:

* Creating volume clones is based on the LVM thin pool capabilities.
* The node must have additional storage after creating a volume clone for further updating the original data source.
* You can create volume clones only on the node where you have deployed the original data source.
* Pods relying on the PVC that uses the clone data can be scheduled only on the node where you have deployed the original data source.
