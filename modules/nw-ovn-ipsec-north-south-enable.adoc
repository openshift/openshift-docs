= Configuring IPsec encryption for external traffic

As a cluster administrator, to encrypt external traffic with IPsec you must configure IPsec for your network infrastructure, including providing PKCS#12 certificates. Because this procedure uses Butane to create machine configs, you must have the `butane` command installed.

[NOTE]
====
After you apply the machine config, the Machine Config Operator reboots affected nodes in your cluster to rollout the new machine config.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the {oc-first}.
* You have installed the `butane` utility on your local computer.
* You have installed the NMState Operator on the cluster.
* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have an existing PKCS#12 certificate for the IPsec endpoint and a CA cert in PEM format.
* You enabled IPsec in either `Full` or `External` mode on your cluster.
* The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin must be configured in local gateway mode, where `ovnKubernetesConfig.gatewayConfig.routingViaHost=true`.

.Procedure

. Create an IPsec configuration with an NMState Operator node network configuration policy. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/securing_networks/configuring-a-vpn-with-ipsec_securing-networks#configuring-a-vpn-with-ipsec_securing-networks[Libreswan as an IPsec VPN implementation].

.. To identify the IP address of the cluster node that is the IPsec endpoint, enter the following command:
+
----
$ oc get nodes
----

.. Create a file named `ipsec-config.yaml` that contains a node network configuration policy for the NMState Operator, such as in the following examples. For an overview about `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` objects, see link:https://nmstate.io/kubernetes-nmstate/[The Kubernetes NMState project].

.. To configure the IPsec interface, enter the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f ipsec-config.yaml

. Provide the following certificate files to add to the Network Security Services (NSS) database on each host. These files are imported as part of the Butane configuration in subsequent steps.
+
--
* `left_server.p12`: The certificate bundle for the IPsec endpoints
* `ca.pem`: The certificate authority that you signed your certificates with

. Create a machine config to add your certificates to the cluster:

[IMPORTANT]
====
As the Machine Config Operator (MCO) updates machines in each machine config pool, it reboots each node one by one. You must wait until all the nodes are updated before external IPsec connectivity is available.
====

. Check the machine config pool status by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp
----
+
A successfully updated node has the following status: `UPDATED=true`, `UPDATING=false`, `DEGRADED=false`.
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the MCO updates one machine per pool at a time, causing the total time the migration takes to increase with the size of the cluster.
====

. To confirm that IPsec machine configs rolled out successfully, enter the following commands:
.. Confirm that the IPsec machine configs were created:
+

$ oc get mc | grep ipsec
