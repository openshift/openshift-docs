= The hub and spoke architecture

At the end of running all workflows in the hub and spoke pipelines the architecture resembles the following:

== Network topology

Every blade in the chassis has access to multiple NICs, which are connected to internal switches. Switches and NICs are referred to as networks using the name of the interface.

Both, the eno4 and eno5 networks, are 10gbs networks with enough bandwidth to support the internal and external traffic of the cluster. Both networks are L2.

The eno4 network is used as the external network. It will be configured by DHCP, to make it easier for the factory to configure and interact with it. This also simplifies the on site customer configuration.

The eno5 network is the internal network. It is only be accessible from within the blades. This network is configured with static IPs and is expected to be used only for the internal traffic of the cluster.
