= Increasing Compliance Operator resource limits

In some cases, the Compliance Operator might require more memory than the default limits allow. The best way to mitigate this issue is to set custom resource limits.

To increase the default memory and CPU limits of scanner pods, see _`ScanSetting` Custom resource_.

.Procedure

. To increase the Operator's memory limits to 500 Mi, create the following patch file named `co-memlimit-patch.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  config:
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 500Mi
----

. Apply the patch file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch sub compliance-operator -nopenshift-compliance --patch-file co-memlimit-patch.yaml --type=merge
----
