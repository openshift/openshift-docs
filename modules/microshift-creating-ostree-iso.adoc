[id="microshift-creating-ostree-iso_{context}"]
= Creating the {op-system-ostree} image

Use the following procedure to create the ISO. The {op-system-ostree} Installer image pulls the commit from the running container and creates an installable boot ISO with a Kickstart file configured to use the embedded `rpm-ostree` commit.

.Prerequisites
* Your build host meets the Image Builder system requirements.
* You have installed and set up Image Builder and the `composer-cli` tool.
* You have root-user access to your build host.
* You have installed the `podman` tool.

.Procedure

. Start an `ostree` container image build by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ BUILDID=$(sudo composer-cli compose start-ostree --ref "rhel/{op-system-version-major}/$(uname -m)/edge" minimal-microshift edge-container | awk '{print $2}')
----
+
This command also returns the identification (ID) of the build for monitoring.

. You can check the status of the build periodically by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo composer-cli compose status
----
+

[NOTE]
====
You can use the `watch` command to monitor your build if you are familiar with how to start and stop it.
====

. Download the container image using the ID and get the image ready for use by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo composer-cli compose image ${BUILDID}
----

. Change the ownership of the downloaded container image to the current user by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo chown $(whoami). ${BUILDID}-container.tar
----

. Add read permissions for the current user to the image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo chmod a+r ${BUILDID}-container.tar
----

. Bootstrap a server on port 8085 for the `ostree` container image to be consumed by the ISO build by completing the following steps:

.. Get the `IMAGEID` variable result by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ IMAGEID=$(cat < "./${BUILDID}-container.tar" | sudo podman load | grep -o -P '(?<=sha256[@:])[a-z0-9]*')
----

.. Use the `IMAGEID` variable result to execute the podman command step by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman run -d --name=minimal-microshift-server -p 8085:8080 ${IMAGEID}
----
+
This command also returns the ID of the container saved in the `IMAGEID` variable for monitoring.

. Generate the installer blueprint file by running the following command:
+
[source,text]
----
cat > microshift-installer.toml <<EOF
name = "microshift-installer"

description = ""
version = "0.0.0"
modules = []
groups = []
packages = []
EOF
