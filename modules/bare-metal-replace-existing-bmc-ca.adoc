= Replacing an existing BMC CA certificate

[role="_abstract"]
You can replace the BMC CA certificate with your own local or self-signed CA certificate by editing the `bmc-verify-ca` ConfigMap in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace. Providing your own CA certificate gives you control over the secure communications between your cluster and BMC's.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed a cluster on bare metal.
* You configured a CA certificate for BMC communication when you installed the cluster.
* You have a local or self-signed CA certificate.

.Procedure

. Edit the `bmc-verify-ca` ConfigMap by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configmap bmc-verify-ca -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Replace the contents of the `verify_ca.crt` stanza with your local or self-signed CA certificate, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  verify_ca.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <self_signed_certificate_contents>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
kind: ConfigMap
----
+
where:

`<self_signed_certificate_contents>`:: Specifies the contents of your local or self-signed CA certificate.
