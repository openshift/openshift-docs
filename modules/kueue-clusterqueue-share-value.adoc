= Cluster queue weights

After you have enabled fair sharing, you must set share values for each cluster queue before fair sharing can take place. Share values are represented as the `weight` value in a `ClusterQueue` object.

Share values are important because they allow administrators to prioritize specific job types or teams. Critical applications or high-priority teams can be configured with a weighted value so that they receive a proportionally larger share of the available resources. Configuring weights ensures that unused resources are distributed according to defined organizational or project priorities rather than on a first-come, first-served basis.

The `weight` value, or share value, defines a comparative advantage for the cluster queue when competing for borrowable resources. Generally, {kueue-name} admits jobs with a lower share value first. Jobs with a higher share value are more likely to be preempted before those with lower share values.

== Zero weight

A `weight` value of `0` represents an infinite share value. This means that the cluster queue is always at a disadvantage compared to others, and its workloads are always the first to be preempted when fair sharing is enabled.
