= Monitoring upgrade status

The best way to monitor {VirtProductName} upgrade status is to watch the
ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) `PHASE`. You can also monitor the CSV conditions
in the web console or by running the command provided here.

[NOTE]
====
The `PHASE` and conditions values are approximations that are based on
available information.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.

.Procedure

. Run the following command:
+
----
$ oc get csv
----

. Review the output, checking the `PHASE` field. For example:
+
----
VERSION  REPLACES                                        PHASE
2.2.1    kubevirt-hyperconverged-operator.v2.2.0         Installing
2.2.0                                                    Replacing
----

. Optional: Monitor the aggregated status of all {VirtProductName} component
conditions by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc get hco -n openshift-cnv kubevirt-hyperconverged \
-o=jsonpath='{range .status.conditions[*]}{.type}{"\t"}{.status}{"\t"}{.message}{"\n"}{end}'
----
+
A successful upgrade results in the following output:
+
----
ReconcileComplete  True  Reconcile completed successfully
Available          True  Reconcile completed successfully
Progressing        False Reconcile completed successfully
Degraded           False Reconcile completed successfully
Upgradeable        True  Reconcile completed successfully
