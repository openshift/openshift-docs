= Common default cluster roles for users

An installed cluster extension might include default cluster roles to determine role-based access control (RBAC) for regular users to API resources provided by the extension. A common set of cluster roles can resemble the following policies:

`view` cluster role:: Grants read-only access to all custom resource (CR) objects of specified API resources across the cluster. Intended for regular users who require visibility into the resources without any permissions to modify them. Ideal for monitoring purposes and limited access viewing.
`edit` cluster role:: Allows users to modify all CR objects within the cluster. Enables users to create, update, and delete resources, making it suitable for team members who must manage resources but should not control RBAC or manage permissions for others.
`admin` cluster role:: Provides full permissions, including `create`, `update`, and `delete` verbs, over all custom resource objects for the specified API resources across the cluster.
