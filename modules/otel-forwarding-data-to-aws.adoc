= Forwarding telemetry data to AWS

[role="_abstract"]
You can have metrics, logs, and traces forwarded to the Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray services by using the following exporters of the OpenTelemetry Collector: AWS CloudWatch Logs Exporter, AWS EMF Exporter, and AWS X-Ray Exporter.

// Currently, this docs repository does not permit linking from here to the sections for AWS CloudWatch Logs Exporter, AWS EMF Exporter, and AWS X-Ray Exporter. See the xref to the "Exporters" page placed in observability/otel/otel-forwarding-telemetry-data.adoc.
