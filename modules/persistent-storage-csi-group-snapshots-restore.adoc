= Restoring a volume group snapshot

You can use the `VolumeGroupSnapshot` custom resource definition (CRD) content to restore the existing volumes to a previous state.

To restore existing volumes, you can request a new persistent volume claim (PVC) to be created from a `VolumeSnapshot` object that is part of a `VolumeGroupSnapshot`. This triggers provisioning of a new volume that is populated with data from the specified snapshot. Repeat this process until all volumes are created from all the snapshots that are part of a volume group snapshot.

.Prerequisites
* Logged in to a running {product-title} cluster.
* PVC has been created using a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver that supports volume group snapshots.
* A storage class to provision the storage back end.
* A volume group snapshot has been created and is ready to use.

.Procedure

To restore existing volumes to a previous state from a volume group snapshot:

. Specify a `VolumeSnapshot` data source from a volume group snapshot for a PVC as shown in the following example:
+
.Example restore PVC YAML file
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: <pvc-restore-name> <1>
  namespace: <namespace> <2>
spec:
  storageClassName: csi-hostpath-sc
  dataSource:
    name: snapshot-fbfe59eff570171765df664280910c3bf1a4d56e233a5364cd8cb0152a35965b <3>
    kind: VolumeSnapshot <4>
    apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io <5>
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
----
<1> Name of the restore PVC.
<2> Name of the namespace.
<3> Name of an individual volume snapshot that is part of the volume group snapshot to use as source.
<4> Must be set to the `VolumeSnapshot` value.
<5> Must be set to the `snapshot.storage.k8s.io` value

. Create the PVC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <pvc-restore-filename>.yaml <1>
----
<1> Name of the PVC restore file specified in the preceding step.

. Verify that the restored PVC has been created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pvc
----
+
A new PVC with the name you specified in the first step appears.

. Repeat the procedure as needed until all volumes are created from all the snapshots that are part of a volume group snapshot.
