= ROSA architecture on public and private networks

You can install ROSA using either a public or private network.

A private cluster and private network connection can be configured for ROSA during the cluster creation process. Alternatively, you can set up a private cluster using AWS PrivateLink, which is hosted on private subnets only.

In both public and private network scenarios, Red Hat SREs manage the control plane and infrastructure nodes with limited access through a public network. Red Hat SREs do not access or manage the customerâ€™s worker nodes. For more information, see the Service Definition.

The following diagram shows the ROSA architecture on public and private networks.
