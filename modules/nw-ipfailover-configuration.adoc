= Configuring IP failover in your cluster

As a cluster administrator, you can configure IP failover on an entire cluster, or on a subset of nodes, as defined by the label selector. You can also configure multiple IP failover deployment configurations in your cluster, where each one is independent of the others.

The IP failover deployment configuration ensures that a failover pod runs on each of the nodes matching the constraints or the label used.

This pod runs Keepalived, which can monitor an endpoint and use Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) to fail over the virtual IP (VIP) from one node to another if the first node cannot reach the service or endpoint.

For production use, set a `selector` that selects at least two nodes, and set `replicas` equal to the number of selected nodes.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You created a pull secret.

.Procedure

//. Create an {product-title} pull secret
//+
. Create an IP failover service account:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create sa ipfailover
----
+
. Update security context constraints (SCC) for `hostNetwork`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z ipfailover
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user hostnetwork -z ipfailover
----
+
. Create a deployment YAML file to configure IP failover:

----
<1> The name of the IP failover deployment.
<2> The list of IP address ranges to replicate. This must be provided. For example, `1.2.3.4-6,1.2.3.9`.
<3> The number of groups to create for VRRP. If not set, a group is created for each virtual IP range specified with the `OPENSHIFT_HA_VIP_GROUPS` variable.
<4> The interface name that IP failover uses to send VRRP traffic. By default, `eth0` is used.
<5> The IP failover pod tries to open a TCP connection to this port on each VIP. If connection is established, the service is considered to be running. If this port is set to `0`, the test always passes. The default value is `80`.
<6> The offset value used to set the virtual router IDs. Using different offset values allows multiple IP failover configurations to exist within the same cluster. The default offset is `0`, and the allowed range is `0` through `255`.
<7> The number of replicas to create. This must match `spec.replicas` value in IP failover deployment configuration. The default value is `2`.
<8> The name of the `iptables` chain to automatically add an `iptables` rule to allow the VRRP traffic on. If the value is not set, an `iptables` rule is not added. If the chain does not exist, it is not created, and Keepalived operates in unicast mode. The default is `INPUT`.
<9> The full path name in the pod file system of a script that is run whenever the state changes.
<10> The full path name in the pod file system of a script that is periodically run to verify the application is operating.
<11> The strategy for handling a new higher priority host. The default value is `preempt_delay 300`, which causes a Keepalived instance to take over a VIP after 5 minutes if a lower-priority master is holding the VIP.
<12> The period, in seconds, that the check script is run. The default value is `2`.
<13> Create the pull secret before creating the deployment, otherwise you will get an error when creating the deployment.
