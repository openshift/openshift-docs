[id="cnf-image-based-upgrade-rollback_{context}"]
= Moving to the Rollback stage of the image-based upgrade with {lcao}

An automatic rollback is initiated if the upgrade does not complete within the time frame specified in the `initMonitorTimeoutSeconds` field after rebooting.

.Example ImageBasedUpgrade CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageBasedUpgrade
metadata:
  name: upgrade
spec:
  stage: Idle
  seedImageRef:
    version: 4.15.2
    image: <seed_container_image>
  autoRollbackOnFailure: {}
#    initMonitorTimeoutSeconds: 1800 # <1>
# ...
----
<1> Optional: The time frame in seconds to roll back if the upgrade does not complete within that time frame after the first reboot. If not defined or set to `0`, the default value of `1800` seconds (30 minutes) is used.

You can manually roll back the changes if you encounter unresolvable issues after an upgrade.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged into the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You ensured that the control plane certificates on the original stateroot are valid. If the certificates expired, see "Recovering from expired control plane certificates".

.Procedure

. To move to the rollback stage, patch the value of the `stage` field to `Rollback` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Rollback"}}' --type=merge
----

The {lcao} reboots the cluster with the previously installed version of {product-title} and restores the applications.
--

. If you are satisfied with the changes, finalize the rollback by patching the value of the `stage` field to `Idle` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Idle"}}' --type=merge -n openshift-lifecycle-agent
----

[WARNING]
====
If you move to the `Idle` stage after a rollback, the {lcao} cleans up resources that can be used to troubleshoot a failed upgrade.
