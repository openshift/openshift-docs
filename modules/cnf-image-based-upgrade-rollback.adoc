= (Optional) Moving to the Rollback stage of the image-based upgrade with {lcao}

You can manually roll back the changes if you encounter unresolvable issues after an upgrade.

An automatic rollback is initiated if the upgrade does not complete within the time frame specified in the `initMonitorTimeoutSeconds` field after rebooting.

.Example ImageBasedUpgrade CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageBasedUpgrade
metadata:
  name: upgrade
spec:
  stage: Idle
  seedImageRef:
    version: 4.15.2
    image: <seed_container_image>
  autoRollbackOnFailure: {}
#    initMonitorTimeoutSeconds: 1800 <1>
[...]
----
<1> (Optional) Specify the time frame in seconds to roll back if the upgrade does not complete within that time frame after the first reboot. If not defined or set to `0`, the default value of `1800` seconds (30 minutes) is used.

.Prerequisites

* Log in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Move to the rollback stage by changing the value of the `stage` field to `Rollback` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Rollback"}}' --type=merge
----

. The {lcao} reboots the cluster with the previously installed version of {product-title} and restores the applications.

. When you are satisfied with the changes and ready to finalize the the rollback, change the value of the `stage` field to `Idle` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Idle"}}' --type=merge -n openshift-lifecycle-agent
----

[WARNING]
====
If you move to the `Idle` stage after a rollback, the {lcao} cleans up resources that can be used to troubleshoot a failed upgrade.
