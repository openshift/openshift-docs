= Configuring Capacity Reservation by using machine sets

//If backported to earlier versions, must replace {product-version} with the correct .z
{product-title} version {product-version} and later supports on-demand Capacity Reservation with Capacity Reservation groups on {azure-full} clusters.

You can configure a machine set to deploy machines on any available resources that match the parameters of a capacity request that you define.
These parameters specify the VM size, region, and number of instances that you want to reserve.
If your {azure-short} subscription quota can accommodate the capacity request, the deployment succeeds.

For more information, including limitations and suggested use cases for this {azure-short} instance type, see the {azure-full} documentation about link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-overview[On-demand Capacity Reservation].

[NOTE]
====
You cannot change an existing Capacity Reservation configuration for a machine set.
To use a different Capacity Reservation group, you must replace the machine set and the machines that the previous machine set deployed.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You installed the {oc-first}.
* You created a Capacity Reservation group.
+
For more information, see the {azure-full} documentation link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-create[Create a Capacity Reservation].

.Procedure

. In a text editor, open the YAML file for an existing machine set or create a new one.

. Edit the following section under the `providerSpec` field:
+
--
.Sample configuration
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet

      providerSpec:
        value:
          capacityReservationGroupID: <capacity-reservation-group> # <1>
# ...
----
<1> Specify the ID of the Capacity Reservation group that you want the machine set to deploy machines on.
--

.Verification

* To verify machine deployment, list the machines that the machine set created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
ifndef::cpmso[]
$ oc get machines.machine.openshift.io \
  -n openshift-machine-api \
  -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset=<machine_set_name>
endif::cpmso[]
ifdef::cpmso[]
$ oc get machine \
  -n openshift-machine-api \
  -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role=master
endif::cpmso[]
----
ifndef::cpmso[]
+
where `<machine_set_name>` is the name of the compute machine set.
endif::cpmso[]
+
In the output, verify that the characteristics of the listed machines match the parameters of your Capacity Reservation.
