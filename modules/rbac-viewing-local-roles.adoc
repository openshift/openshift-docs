= Viewing local roles and bindings

You can use the `oc` CLI to view local roles and bindings by using the
`oc describe` command.

.Prerequisites

* Install the `oc` CLI.
* Obtain permission to view the local roles and bindings:

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
** Users with the `dedicated-admins-cluster` role can view and manage local roles and bindings.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
** Users with the `cluster-admin` default cluster role bound cluster-wide can
perform any action on any resource, including viewing local roles and bindings.
endif::[]

** Users with the `admin` default cluster role bound locally can view and manage
roles and bindings in that project.

.Procedure

. To view the current set of local role bindings, which show the users and groups
that are bound to various roles for the current project:
+
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac
----

. To view the local role bindings for a different project, add the `-n` flag
to the command:
+
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n joe-project
