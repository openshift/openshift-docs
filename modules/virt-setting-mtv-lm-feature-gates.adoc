= Setting a live migration feature gate in the {mtv-first}

[role="_abstract"]
You enable the {product-title} live migration feature gate in the {mtv-first} to allow virtual machines to migrate between clusters during cross-cluster live migration. This feature gate must be enabled in both clusters that participate in the migration.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

* You must have cluster admin privileges.

* The `virt-synchronization-controller` pods must be running.

.Procedure

* To enable the feature gate by modifying the CR, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch ForkliftController forklift-controller -n openshift-mtv --type json -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/feature_ocp_live_migration", "value": "true"}]'
----

.Verification

* Verify that the feature gate is enabled by checking the `ForkliftController` custom resource (CR). Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ForkliftController forklift-controller -n openshift-mtv -o yaml
----
+
Confirm that the `feature_ocp_live_migration` key value is set to `true`, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: forklift.konveyor.io/v1beta1
kind: ForkliftController
metadata:
  name: forklift-controller
  namespace: openshift-mtv
spec:
  feature_ocp_live_migration: "true"
  feature_ui_plugin: "true"
