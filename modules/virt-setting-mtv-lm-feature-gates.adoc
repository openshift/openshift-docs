Enable the {product-title} live migration feature gate in the {mtv-first} by modifying the `spec` stanza in the `forklift-controller` custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch ForkliftController forklift-controller -n openshift-mtv --type json -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/feature_ocp_live_migration", "value": "true"}]
----

. Verify that the feature gate has been enabled by confirming that the `feature_ocp_live_migration` key value is set to `true`, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  feature_ocp_live_migration: "true"
