= Building the RPM package for the application manifests

To build your own RPMs, you must create a spec file that adds the application manifests to the RPM package. The following is an example procedure. As long as the application RPMs and other elements needed for image building are accessible to Image Builder, you can use the method that you prefer.

.Prerequisites
* You have set up a {op-system-ostree-first} {op-system-version} build host that meets the Image Builder system requirements.
* You have root access to the host.
* The file tree required to build RPM packages was created.

.Procedure

. In the `~/rpmbuild/SPECS` directory, create a file such as `<application_workload_manifests.spec>` using the following template:

<1> The `%install` section creates the target directory inside the RPM package, `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests/`
and copies the manifests from the source home directory, `~/manifests`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
All of the required YAML files must be in the source home directory `~/manifests`, including a `kustomize.yaml` file if you are using kustomize.
====

. Build your RPM package in the `~/rpmbuild/RPMS` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]

$ rpmbuild -bb ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/<application_workload_manifests.spec>
