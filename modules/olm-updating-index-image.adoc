[id="olm-updating-index-image_{context}"]
= Updating a SQLite-based index image

After configuring OperatorHub to use a catalog source that references a custom index image, cluster administrators can keep the available Operators on their cluster up to date by adding bundle images to the index image.

You can update an existing index image using the `opm index add` command.
ifeval::["{context}" == "olm-restricted-networks"]
For restricted networks, the updated content must also be mirrored again to the cluster.
endif::[]

.Prerequisites

* `opm` version 1.18.0+
* `podman` version 1.9.3+
* An index image built and pushed to a registry.
* An existing catalog source referencing the index image.

.Procedure

. Update the existing index by adding bundle images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ opm index add \
    --bundles <registry>/<namespace>/<new_bundle_image>@sha256:<digest> \//<1>
    --from-index <registry>/<namespace>/<existing_index_image>:<tag> \//<2>
    --tag <registry>/<namespace>/<existing_index_image>:<tag> <3>
----
<1> A comma-separated list of additional bundle images to add to the index.
<2> The existing index that was previously pushed.
<3> The image tag that you want the updated index image to have.

. Push the updated index image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman push <registry>/<namespace>/<existing_index_image>:<tag>
----

ifeval::["{context}" == "olm-restricted-networks"]
. Follow the steps in the _Mirroring an Operator catalog_ procedure again to mirror the updated content. However, when you get to the step about creating the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) object, use the `oc replace` command instead of the `oc create` command. For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc replace -f ./manifests-{index-image}-<random_number>/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----
+
This change is required because the object already exists and must be updated.
+
[NOTE]
====
Normally, the `oc apply` command can be used to update existing objects that were previously created using `oc apply`. However, due to a known issue regarding the size of the `metadata.annotations` field in ICSP objects, the `oc replace` command must be used for this step currently.
====
endif::[]

. After Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically polls the index image referenced in the catalog source at its regular interval, verify that the new packages are successfully added:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace
----
