= Default authorization mode

Knative Eventing authorization is governed by two key mechanisms. The `EventPolicy` custom resource defines explicit rules for event delivery, and the `default-authorization-mode` feature flag applies whenever no `EventPolicy` is associated with a resource.

The supported authorization modes are as follows:

[cols=2,options=header]
|===

|Authorization mode
|Description

|`allow-all`
|All incoming event requests are permitted without restriction.

|`deny-all`
|All incoming event requests are denied. To enable event delivery, an EventPolicy must explicitly authorize the requests.

|`allow-same-namespace`
|(Default) Only requests from subjects within the same namespace are allowed.

|===

To configure the default authorization mode via the {ServerlessOperatorName}, you can edit the `KnativeEventing` custom resource as shown in the following example:
