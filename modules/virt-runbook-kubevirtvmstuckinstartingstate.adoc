== Mitigation

Ensure that the VM is configured correctly and has the required resources.

A `Pending` state indicates that the VM has not yet been scheduled. Check the
following possible causes:

* The `virt-launcher` pod is not scheduled.
* Topology hints for the VMI are not up to date.
* Data volume is not provisioned or ready.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
link:https://access.redhat.com[Customer Portal] and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.
