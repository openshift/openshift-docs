= Configuring the Ingress Controller endpoint publishing scope to Internal

When a cluster administrator installs a new cluster without specifying that the cluster is private, the default Ingress Controller is created with a `scope` set to `External`. Cluster administrators can change an `External` scoped Ingress Controller to `Internal`.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the `oc` CLI.

.Procedure

* To change an `External` scoped Ingress Controller to `Internal`, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ingress-operator patch ingresscontrollers/default --type=merge --patch='{"spec":{"endpointPublishingStrategy":{"type":"LoadBalancerService","loadBalancer":{"scope":"Internal"}}}}'
----
+
.Verification
+
* To check the status of the Ingress Controller, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ingress-operator get ingresscontrollers/default -o yaml
----
+
** The `Progressing` status condition indicates whether you must take further action. For example, the status condition can indicate that you need to delete the service by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ingress delete services/router-default
----
+
If you delete the service, the Ingress Operator recreates it as `Internal`.
