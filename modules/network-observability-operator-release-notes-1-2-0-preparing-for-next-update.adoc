= Network observability release notes 1.2.0 preparing for the next update

[role="_abstract"]
Switch the Network Observability Operator's update channel from the deprecated `v1.0.x` to the `stable` channel to continue receiving future releases and updates.

The subscription of an installed Operator specifies an update channel that tracks and receives updates for the Operator. Until the 1.2 release of the Network Observability Operator, the only channel available was `v1.0.x`. The 1.2 release of the Network Observability Operator introduces the `stable` update channel for tracking and receiving updates. You must switch your channel from `v1.0.x` to `stable` to receive future Operator updates. The `v1.0.x` channel is deprecated and planned for removal in a following release.
