= Key escrow

Key escrow is the traditional system for storing cryptographic keys, where a key server on the network stores the encryption key for a node with an encrypted boot disk and returns it when queried. The complexities around key management, transport encryption, and authentication do not make this a reasonable choice for boot disk encryption, at least not when the network itself is subject to interception.

Although available in {op-system-base-full}, key escrow-based disk encryption setup and management is a manual process and not suited to OpenShift automation operations, including automated addition of nodes, and currently not supported by OpenShift.
