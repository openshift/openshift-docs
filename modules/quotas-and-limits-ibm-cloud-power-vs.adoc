= Quotas and limits on IBM Cloud Power VS

The {product-title} cluster uses a number of IBM Cloud and Power VS components, and the default quotas and limits affect your ability to install {product-title} clusters. If you use certain cluster configurations, deploy your cluster in certain regions, or run multiple clusters from your account, you might need to request additional resources for your IBM Cloud Power VS account.

For a comprehensive list of the default IBM Cloud VPC quotas and service limits, see IBM Cloud's documentation for link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-quotas[Quotas and service limits].

[discrete]
== Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Each {product-title} cluster creates its own VPC. The default quota of VPCs per region is 10. If you have 10 VPCs created, you will need to increase your quota before attempting an installation.

[discrete]
== Application load balancer

By default, each cluster creates three application load balancers (ALBs):

* Internal load balancer for the master API server
* External load balancer for the master API server
* Load balancer for the router

You can create additional `LoadBalancer` service objects to create additional ALBs. The default quota of VPC ALBs are 50 per region. To have more than 50 ALBs, you must increase this quota.

VPC ALBs are supported. Classic ALBs are not supported for IBM Cloud VPC.

[discrete]
== Floating IP address

By default, the installation program distributes control plane and compute machines across all availability zones within a region to provision the cluster in a highly available configuration. In each availability zone, a public gateway is created and requires a separate floating IP address.

The default quota for a floating IP address is 20 addresses per availability zone. The default cluster configuration yields three floating IP addresses:

* Two floating IP addresses in the `us-east-1` primary zone. The IP address associated with the bootstrap node is removed after installation.
* One floating IP address in the `us-east-2` secondary zone.
* One floating IP address in the `us-east-3` secondary zone.

IBM Cloud VPC can support up to 19 clusters per region in an account. If you plan to have more than 19 default clusters, you must increase this quota.

[discrete]
== Virtual Server Instances (VSI)

By default, a cluster creates server instances with the following resources :

* 0.5 CPUs
* 32 GB RAM
* System Type: s922
* Processor Type: uncapped, shared
* Storage Tier: Tier-3

The following nodes are created:

* One bootstrap machine, which is removed after the installation is complete
* Three control plane nodes
* Three compute nodes
