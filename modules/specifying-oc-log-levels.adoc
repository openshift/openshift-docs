= Specifying OpenShift CLI (`oc`) log levels

You can investigate OpenShift CLI (`oc`) issues by increasing the command's log level.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Specify the `oc` log level when running an `oc` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc <options> --loglevel <log_level>
----

. The {product-title} user's current session token is typically included in logged `curl` requests where required. You can also obtain the current user's session token manually, for use when testing aspects of an `oc` command's underlying process step by step:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc whoami -t
----
