= Operator Lifecycle Manager architecture

The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) is composed of two Operators: the OLM
Operator and the Catalog Operator.

Each of these Operators are responsible for managing the Custom Resource
Definitions (CRDs) that are the basis for the OLM framework:

.CRDs managed by OLM and Catalog Operators
[cols="2a,1a,1a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Resource |Short name |Owner |Description

|ClusterServiceVersion
|`csv`
|OLM
|Application metadata: name, version, icon, required resources, installation,
etc.

|InstallPlan
|`ip`
|Catalog
|Calculated list of resources to be created in order to automatically install or
upgrade a CSV.

|CatalogSource
|`catsrc`
|Catalog
|A repository of CSVs, CRDs, and packages that define an application.

|Subscription
|`sub`
|Catalog
|Keeps CSVs up to date by tracking a channel in a package.

|OperatorGroup
|`og`
|OLM
|Configures all Operators deployed in the same namespace as the OperatorGroup
object to watch for their Custom Resource (CR) in a list of namespaces or
cluster-wide.
|===

Each of these Operators are also responsible for creating resources:

== OLM Operator

The OLM Operator is responsible for deploying applications defined by CSV
resources after the required resources specified in the CSV are present in the
cluster.

The OLM Operator is not concerned with the creation of the required resources;
users can choose to manually create these resources using the CLI, or users can
choose to create these resources using the Catalog Operator. This separation of
concern enables users incremental buy-in in terms of how much of the OLM
framework they choose to leverage for their application.

While the OLM Operator is often configured to watch all namespaces, it can also
be operated alongside other OLM Operators so long as they all manage separate
namespaces.

.OLM Operator workflow
* Watches for ClusterServiceVersion (CSVs) in a namespace and checks that
requirements are met. If so, runs the install strategy for the CSV.
+
[NOTE]
====
A CSV must be an active member of an OperatorGroup in order for the install
strategy to be run.

[id="olm-architecture-catalog-operator_{context}"]
== Catalog Operator

The Catalog Operator is responsible for resolving and installing CSVs and the
required resources they specify. It is also responsible for watching
CatalogSources for updates to packages in channels and upgrading them
(optionally automatically) to the latest available versions.

A user that wishes to track a package in a channel creates a Subscription
resource configuring the desired package, channel, and the CatalogSource from
which to pull updates. When updates are found, an appropriate InstallPlan is
written into the namespace on behalf of the user.

Users can also create an InstallPlan resource directly, containing the names of
the desired CSV and an approval strategy, and the Catalog Operator creates an
execution plan for the creation of all of the required resources. After it is
approved, the Catalog Operator creates all of the resources in an InstallPlan;
this then independently satisfies the OLM Operator, which proceeds to install
the CSVs.

.Catalog Operator workflow
* Has a cache of CRDs and CSVs, indexed by name.
* Watches for unresolved InstallPlans created by a user:
** Finds the CSV matching the name requested and adds it as a resolved resource.
** For each managed or required CRD, adds it as a resolved resource.
** For each required CRD, finds the CSV that manages it.
* Watches for resolved InstallPlans and creates all of the discovered resources for it (if approved by a user or automatically).
* Watches for CatalogSources and Subscriptions and creates InstallPlans based on them.

[id="olm-architecture-catalog-registry_{context}"]
== Catalog Registry

The Catalog Registry stores CSVs and CRDs for creation in a cluster and stores
metadata about packages and channels.

A _package manifest_ is an entry in the Catalog Registry that associates a
package identity with sets of CSVs. Within a package, channels point to a
particular CSV. Because CSVs explicitly reference the CSV that they replace, a
package manifest provides the Catalog Operator all of the information that is
required to update a CSV to the latest version in a channel, stepping through
each intermediate version.
