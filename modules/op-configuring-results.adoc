= Configuring {tekton-results}

After you install {pipelines-shortname}, {tekton-results} is enabled by default.

However, if you want to store and access logging information for your pipeline runs and task runs, you must configure forwarding this information to LokiStack. 

You can optionally complete additional configuration for {tekton-results}.
