=== Using an Open vSwitch bridge as the network source for a VM

With {ProductName}, you can connect a virtual machine
instance to an Open vSwitch bridge configured on the node.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster running {product-title} 3.11 or newer

.Procedure

. Prepare the cluster host networks (optional).
+
If the host network needs additional configuration changes, such as
bonding, please refer to the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/networking_guide/[Red
Hat Enterprise Linux networking guide].

. Configure interfaces and bridges on all cluster hosts.
+
On each node, choose an interface connected to the desired network.
Then, create an Open vSwitch bridge and specify the interface you chose
as the bridgeâ€™s port.
+
In this example, we create bridge `br1` and connect it to interface
`eth1`. This bridge must be configured on all nodes. If it is only
available on a subset of nodes, make sure that VMIs have `nodeSelector`
constraints in place.
+
NOTE: Any connections to `eth1` will be lost once the interface is
assigned to the bridge, so another interface should exist on the host.
+
....
$ ovs-vsctl add-br br1
$ ovs-vsctl add-port br1 eth1
$ ovs-vsctl show
8d004495-ea9a-44e1-b00c-3b65648dae5f
    Bridge br1
        Port br1
            Interface br1
                type: internal
        Port "eth1"
            Interface "eth1"
    ovs_version: "2.8.1"
....

. Configure the network on the cluster.
+
L2 networks are treated as cluster-wide resources. The network should be
defined in a network attachment definition YAML file. You can define the
network using the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRD.
+
The `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRD object contains information about
pod-to-network attachment. In the following example, there is an
attachment to Open vSwitch bridge `br1` and traffic is tagged to VLAN
100.
+
....
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: vlan-100-net-conf
spec:
  config: '{
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "type": "ovs",
      "bridge": "br1",
      "vlan": 100
    }'
....
+
NOTE: `"vlan"` is optional. If omitted, the VMI will be attached
through a trunk.

. Edit the virtual machine instance configuration file to include the
details of the interface and network.
+
Specify that the network is connected to the previously created
`NetworkAttachmentDefinition`. In this scenario, `vlan-100-net` is
connected to the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` called
`vlan-100-net-conf`:
+
....
networks:
- name: default
  pod: {}
- name: vlan-100-net
  multus:
    networkName: vlan-100-net-conf
....
+
Once you start the VMI, it should have the `eth0` interface connected to
the default cluster network and `eth1` connected to VLAN 100 using
bridge `br1` on the node running the VMI.
