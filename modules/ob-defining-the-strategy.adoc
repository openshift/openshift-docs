You can configure the strategy for a build in the `Build` CR. The following build strategies are available for use:

* `buildah`
* `source-to-image`

To configure a build strategy, define the `spec.strategy.name` and `spec.strategy.kind` fields in the `Build` CR, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
