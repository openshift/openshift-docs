= FIPS mode with {op-system-base} RPM-based installations

Using FIPS with {microshift-short} requires enabling the cryptographic module self-checks in your {op-system-base-full} installation. After the host operating system has been configured to start with the FIPS modules, {microshift-short} containers are automatically enabled to run in FIPS mode.

* When {op-system-base} is started in FIPS mode, {microshift-short} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 validation on only the x86_64 architectures.

* You must enable FIPS mode when you install {op-system-base} {op-system-version-major} on the machines that you plan to use as worker machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because FIPS must be enabled before the operating system that your cluster uses starts for the first time, you cannot enable FIPS after you deploy a cluster.
====

* {microshift-short} uses a FIPS-compatible Golang compiler.

* FIPS is supported in the CRI-O container runtime.

[id="microshift-fips-limitations_{context}"]
== Limitations

* TLS implementation FIPS support is not complete.

* The FIPS implementation does not offer a single function that both computes hash functions and validates the keys that are based on that hash. This limitation continues to be evaluated for improvement in future {microshift-short} releases.
