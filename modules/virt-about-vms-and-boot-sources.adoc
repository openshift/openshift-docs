= About virtual machines and boot sources

Virtual machines consist of a virtual machine definition and one or more disks that are backed by data volumes. Virtual machine templates enable you to create virtual machines using predefined virtual machine specifications.

To use the boot sources feature, install the latest release of {VirtProductName}. The namespace `openshift-virtualization-os-images` enables the feature and is installed with the {VirtProductName} Operator.
Once the boot source feature is installed, you can create boot sources, attach them to templates, and create virtual machines from the templates.

Every virtual machine template requires a boot source, which is a fully configured virtual machine disk image including configured drivers. Each virtual machine template contains a virtual machine definition with a pointer to the boot source. Each boot source has a predefined name and namespace. For some operating systems, a boot source is automatically provided. If it is not provided, then an administrator must prepare a custom boot source.

Define a boot source by using a persistent volume claim (PVC) that is populated by uploading a local file, cloning an existing PVC, importing from a registry, or by URL. Attach a boot source to a virtual machine template by using the web console. After the boot source is attached to a virtual machine template, you  create any number of fully configured ready-to-use virtual machines from the template.
