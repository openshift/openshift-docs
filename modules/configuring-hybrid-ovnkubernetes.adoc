= Configuring hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes

You can configure your cluster to use hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes. This allows a hybrid cluster that supports different node networking configurations. For example, this is necessary to run both Linux and Windows nodes in a cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must configure hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes during the installation of your cluster. You cannot switch to hybrid networking after the installation process.
====

.Prerequisites

* You defined `OVNKubernetes` for the `networking.networkType` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file. See the installation documentation for configuring {product-title} network customizations on your chosen cloud provider for more information.

.Procedure

. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
----
+
--
where:

`<installation_directory>`:: Specifies the name of the directory that contains the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster.
--

. Create a stub manifest file for the advanced network configuration that is named `cluster-network-03-config.yml` in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF > <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
EOF
----
+
--
where:

`<installation_directory>`:: Specifies the directory name that contains the
`manifests/` directory for your cluster.
--

. Open the `cluster-network-03-config.yml` file in an editor and configure OVN-Kubernetes with hybrid networking, such as in the following example:
+
--
.Specify a hybrid networking configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNetwork:
    ovnKubernetesConfig:
      hybridOverlayConfig:
        hybridClusterNetwork: <1>
        - cidr: 10.132.0.0/14
          hostPrefix: 23
        hybridOverlayVXLANPort: 9898 <2>
----
<1> Specify the CIDR configuration used for nodes on the additional overlay network. The `hybridClusterNetwork` CIDR cannot overlap with the `clusterNetwork` CIDR.
<2> Specify a custom VXLAN port for the additional overlay network. This is required for running Windows nodes in a cluster installed on vSphere, and must not be configured for any other cloud provider. The custom port can be any open port excluding the default `4789` port. For more information on this requirement, see the Microsoft documentation on link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/kubernetes/common-problems#pod-to-pod-connectivity-between-hosts-is-broken-on-my-kubernetes-cluster-running-on-vsphere[Pod-to-pod connectivity between hosts is broken].
--
+
[NOTE]
====
Windows Server Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC): Windows Server 2019 is not supported on clusters with a custom `hybridOverlayVXLANPort` value because this Windows server version does not support selecting a custom VXLAN port.
====

. Save the `cluster-network-03-config.yml` file and quit the text editor.
. Optional: Back up the `manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml` file. The
installation program deletes the `manifests/` directory when creating the
cluster.
