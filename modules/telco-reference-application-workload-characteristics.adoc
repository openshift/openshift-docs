= {rds-caps} representative reference application workload characteristics

The representative reference application workload has the following characteristics:

* Has a maximum of 15 pods and 30 containers for the vRAN application including its management and control functions

* Uses a maximum of 2 `ConfigMap` and 4 `Secret` CRs per pod

* Uses a maximum of 10 exec probes with a frequency of not less than 10 seconds

* Incremental application load on the `kube-apiserver` is less than 10% of the cluster platform usage
+
[NOTE]
====
You can extract CPU load can from the platform metrics.
For example:

[source,text]
----
query=avg_over_time(pod:container_cpu_usage:sum{namespace="openshift-kube-apiserver"}[30m])
----
====

* Application logs are not collected by the platform log collector

* Aggregate traffic on the primary CNI is less than 1 MBps
