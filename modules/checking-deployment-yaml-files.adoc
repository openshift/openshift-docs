= Checking deployment YAML files

.Procedure

* Run the following command to check the build-time and deploy-time violations of your security policies in YAML deployment files:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl deployment check --file=<yaml_filename> \
--namespace=<cluster_namespace> \
--cluster=<cluster_name_or_id> \
--verbose
----
+
where:
+
--
`<yaml_filename>`:: Specifies the YAML file with one or more deployments to send to Central for policy evaluation.
`<cluster_namespace>`:: Specifies a namespace to enhance deployments with context information such as network policies, role-based access controls (RBACs), and services for deployments that do not have a namespace in their specification. The namespace defined in the specification is not changed. The default value is `default`.
`<cluster_name_or_id>`:: Specifies the cluster name or ID that you want to use as the context for the evaluation to enable extended deployments with cluster-specific information.
`--verbose`:: Specifies that you receive additional information for each deployment during the policy check, including the RBAC permission level and a comprehensive list of applied network policies.
--
+
The format is defined in the API reference.
To cause {rh-rhacs-first} to re-pull image metadata and image scan results from the associated registry and scanner, add the `--force` option.
+
[NOTE]
====
To check specific image scan results, you must have a token with both `read` and `write` permissions for the `Image` resource.
The default *Continuous Integration* system role already has the required permissions.
//TODO: Add link to the system role topic.

This command validates the following items:

** Configuration options in a YAML file, such as resource limits or privilege options
** Aspects of the images used in a YAML file, such as components or vulnerabilities
