= Viewing deployment logs

.Procedure

. To stream the logs of the latest revision for a given DeploymentConfig:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -f dc/<name>
----
+
If the latest revision is running or failed, the command returns the logs of the
process that is responsible for deploying your pods. If it is successful, it
returns the logs from a Pod of your application.

. You can also view logs from older failed deployment processes, if and only if
these processes (old ReplicationControllers and their deployer pods) exist and
have not been pruned or deleted manually:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs --version=1 dc/<name>
----
