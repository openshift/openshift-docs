= Creating the account-wide STS roles and policies

Before using the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI, `rosa`, to create {hcp-title-first} clusters, create the required account-wide roles and policies, including the Operator policies.

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the AWS prerequisites for {hcp-title}.
* You have available AWS service quotas.
* You have enabled the ROSA service in the AWS Console.
* You have installed and configured the latest ROSA CLI (`rosa`) on your installation host.
+
[NOTE]
====
To successfully install {hcp-title} clusters, use the latest version of the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).
====
* You have logged in to your Red Hat account by using the ROSA CLI.

.Procedure

. If they do not exist in your AWS account, create the required account-wide STS roles and policies by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create account-roles --force-policy-creation
----
+
The `--force-policy-creation` parameter updates any existing roles and policies that are present. If no roles and policies are present, the command creates these resources instead.
