= Creating the account-wide STS roles and policies

Before using the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI (`rosa`) to create {hcp-title-first} clusters, create the required account-wide roles and policies, including the Operator policies.

[NOTE]
====
{hcp-title} clusters require account and Operator roles with AWS managed policies attached. Customer managed policies are not supported. For more information regarding AWS managed policies for {hcp-title} clusters, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ROSA/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol-account-policies.html[AWS managed policies for ROSA account roles].
====

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the AWS prerequisites for {hcp-title}.
* You have available AWS service quotas.
* You have enabled the ROSA service in the AWS Console.
* You have installed and configured the latest ROSA CLI (`rosa`) on your installation host.
* You have logged in to your Red{nbsp}Hat account by using the ROSA CLI.

.Procedure

. If they do not exist in your AWS account, create the required account-wide STS roles and attach the policies by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create account-roles --hosted-cp
----

ifdef::egress-lockdown[]
. Ensure that the your worker role has the correct AWS policy by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws iam attach-role-policy \
--role-name ManagedOpenShift-HCP-ROSA-Worker-Role \ <1>
--policy-arn "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly"
----
<1> This role needs to include the prefix that was created in the previous step.
endif::egress-lockdown[]

. Optional: Set your prefix as an environmental variable by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ACCOUNT_ROLES_PREFIX=<account_role_prefix>
----

** View the value of the variable by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo $ACCOUNT_ROLES_PREFIX
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
ManagedOpenShift
