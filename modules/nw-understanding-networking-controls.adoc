= Network controls

Network controls define rules for how pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints. Network controls are implemented at the network level to ensure that only allowed traffic can flow between pods. This helps secure the cluster by restricting traffic flow and preventing unauthorized access.

* Admin network policies (ANP): ANPs are cluster-scoped custom resource definitions (CRDs). As a cluster administrator, you can use an ANP to define network policies at a cluster level. You cannot override these policies by using regular network policy objects. These policies enforce strict network security rules across the entire cluster. ANPs can specify ingress and egress rules to allow administrators to control the traffic that enters and leaves the cluster.

* Egress firewall: The egress firewall restricts egress traffic leaving the cluster. With this firewall, administrators can limit the external hosts that pods can access from within the cluster. You can configure egress firewall policies to allow or deny traffic to specific IP ranges, DNS names, or external services. This helps prevent unauthorized access to external resources and ensures that only allowed traffic can leave the cluster.

* Ingress node firewall: The ingress node firewall controls ingress traffic to the nodes in a cluster. With this firewall, administrators define rules that restrict which external hosts can initiate connections to the nodes. This helps protect the nodes from unauthorized access and ensures that only trusted traffic can reach the cluster.
