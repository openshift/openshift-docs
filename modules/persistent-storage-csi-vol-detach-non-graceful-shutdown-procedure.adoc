= Adding an out-of-service taint manually for automatic volume detachment

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.

.Procedure

To allow volumes to detach automatically from a node after a non-graceful node shutdown:

. After a node is detected as unhealthy, shut down the worker node.

. Ensure that the node is shutdown by running the following command and checking the status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get node <node_name> <1>
----
<1> <node_name> = name of the node that shut down non-gracefully
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the node is not completely shut down, do not proceed with tainting the node. If the node is still up and the taint is applied, filesystem corruption can occur.
====
+
. Taint the corresponding node object by running the following command:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Tainting a node this way deletes all pods on that node. This also causes any pods that are backed by 
statefulsets to be evicted, and replacement pods to be created on a different node.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint node <node_name> node.kubernetes.io/out-of-service=nodeshutdown:NoExecute <1>
----
<1> <node_name> = name of the node that shut down non-gracefully
+
After the taint is applied, the volumes detach from the shutdown node allowing their disks to be attached to a different node.
+
.Example
+
The resulting YAML file resembles the following:
+
[source, yaml]
----
spec:
  taints:
  - effect: NoExecute
    key: node.kubernetes.io/out-of-service
    value: nodeshutdown
----

. Restart the node.

. Remove the taint from the corresponding node object by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint node <node_name> node.kubernetes.io/out-of-service=nodeshutdown:NoExecute- <1>
----
<1> <node_name> = name of the node that shut down non-gracefully
