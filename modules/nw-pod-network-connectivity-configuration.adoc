= Configuring pod connectivity check placement

As a cluster administrator, you can configure which nodes the connectivity check pods run by modifying the `network.config.openshift.io` object named `cluster`.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. To edit the connectivity check configuration, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit network.config.openshift.io cluster
----

. In the text editor, update the `networkDiagnostics` stanza to specify the node selectors that you want for the source and target pods.

. To commit your changes, save your changes and exit the text editor.

.Verification

To verify that the source and target pods are running on the intended nodes, enter the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-network-diagnostics -o wide
----
