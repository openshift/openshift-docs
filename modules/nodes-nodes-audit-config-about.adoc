= About audit log policy profiles

Audit log profiles define how to log requests that come to the OpenShift API server, the Kubernetes API server, and the OAuth API server.

{product-title} provides the following predefined audit policy profiles:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Profile
|Description

|`Default`
|Logs only metadata for read and write requests; does not log request bodies except for OAuth access token creation (login) requests. This is the default policy.

|`WriteRequestBodies`
|In addition to logging metadata for all requests, logs request bodies for every write request to the API servers (`create`, `update`, `patch`). This profile has more resource overhead than the `Default` profile. ^[1]^

|`AllRequestBodies`
|In addition to logging metadata for all requests, logs request bodies for  every read and write request to the API servers (`get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `patch`). This profile has the most resource overhead. ^[1]^

1. Sensitive resources, such as `Secret`, `Route`, and `OAuthClient` objects, are never logged past the metadata level. OAuth tokens are not logged at all if your cluster was upgraded from {product-title} 4.5, because their object names might contain secret information.

By default, {product-title} uses the `Default` audit log profile. You can use another audit policy profile that also logs request bodies, but be aware of the increased resource usage (CPU, memory, and I/O).
