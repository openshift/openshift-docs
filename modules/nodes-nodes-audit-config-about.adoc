|Profile
|Description

|`Default`
|Logs only metadata for read and write requests; does not log request bodies except for OAuth access token requests. This is the default policy.

|`WriteRequestBodies`
|In addition to logging metadata for all requests, logs request bodies for every write request to the API servers (`create`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`, `deletecollection`). This profile has more resource overhead than the `Default` profile. ^[1]^

|`AllRequestBodies`
|In addition to logging metadata for all requests, logs request bodies for  every read and write request to the API servers (`get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `patch`). This profile has the most resource overhead. ^[1]^

ifndef::microshift[]
|`None`
|No requests are logged, including OAuth access token requests and OAuth authorize token requests. Custom rules are ignored when this profile is set.
endif::microshift[]

ifdef::microshift[]
|`None`
|No requests are logged, including OAuth access token requests and OAuth authorize token requests.
endif::microshift[]

[WARNING]
====
Do not disable audit logging by using the `None` profile unless you are fully aware of the risks of not logging data that can be beneficial when troubleshooting issues. If you disable audit logging and a support situation arises, you might need to enable audit logging and reproduce the issue to troubleshoot properly.

By default, {product-title} uses the `Default` audit log profile. You can use another audit policy profile that also logs request bodies, but be aware of the increased resource usage such as CPU, memory, and I/O.
