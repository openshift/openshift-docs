= Creating a directory to contain additional manifests

If you create additional manifests to configure your Agent-based installation beyond the `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` files, you must create an `openshift` subdirectory within your installation directory.
All of your additional machine configurations must be located within this subdirectory.

[NOTE]
====
The most common type of additional manifest you can add is a `MachineConfig` object.
For examples of `MachineConfig` objects you can add during the Agent-based installation, see "Using MachineConfig objects to configure nodes" in the "Additional resources" section.

.Procedure

* On your installation host, create an `openshift` subdirectory within the installation directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir <installation_directory>/openshift
