To install the {ProductName} Operator, you must first install these Operators:

* *Elasticsearch* - Based on the open source link:https://www.elastic.co/[Elasticsearch] project that enables you to configure and manage an Elasticsearch cluster for tracing and logging with Jaeger.
* *Jaeger* - based on the open source link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger] project, lets you perform tracing to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems.
* *Kiali* - based on the open source link:https://www.kiali.io/[Kiali] project, provides observability for your service mesh. By using Kiali you can view configurations, monitor traffic, and view and analyze traces in a single console.

After you install the Elasticsearch, Jaeger, and Kiali Operators, then you install the {ProductName} Operator. The {ProductShortName} Operator defines and monitors the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resources that manage the deployment, updating, and deletion of the {ProductShortName} components.
