= AWS Load Balancer Operator considerations

Review the following limitations before installing and using the AWS Load Balancer Operator:

* The IP traffic mode only works on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The AWS Load Balancer Operator disables the IP traffic mode for the AWS Load Balancer Controller. As a result of disabling the IP traffic mode, the AWS Load Balancer Controller cannot use the pod readiness gate.

* The AWS Load Balancer Operator adds command-line flags such as `--disable-ingress-class-annotation` and `--disable-ingress-group-name-annotation` to the AWS Load Balancer Controller. Therefore, the AWS Load Balancer Operator does not allow using the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` and `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name` annotations in the `Ingress` resource.

* You have configured the AWS Load Balancer Operator so that the SVC type is `NodePort` (not `LoadBalancer` or `ClusterIP`).
