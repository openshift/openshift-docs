= Updating node pools in a hosted cluster

You can update your version of {product-title} by updating the node pools in your hosted cluster. The node pool version must not surpass the hosted control plane version.

The `.spec.release` field in the `NodePool` custom resource (CR) shows the version of a node pool.

.Procedure

* Change the `spec.release.image` value in the node pool by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch nodepool <node_pool_name> -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"nodeDrainTimeout":"60s","release":{"image":"<openshift_release_image>"}}}' <1> <2>
----
+
<1> Replace `<node_pool_name>` and `<hosted_cluster_namespace>` with your node pool name and hosted cluster namespace, respectively.
<2> The `<openshift_release_image>` variable specifies the new {product-title} release image that you want to upgrade to, for example, `quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.y.z-x86_64`. Replace `<4.y.z>` with the supported {product-title} version.

.Verification

* To verify that the new version was rolled out, check the `.status.conditions` value in the node pool by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> nodepool <node_pool_name> -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
