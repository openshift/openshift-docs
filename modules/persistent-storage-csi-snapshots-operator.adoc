= About the CSI Snapshot Controller Operator

The CSI Snapshot Controller Operator runs in the `openshift-cluster-storage-operator` namespace. It is installed by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) in all clusters by default.

The CSI Snapshot Controller Operator installs the CSI snapshot controller, which runs in the `csi-snapshot-controller` namespace.

== VolumeSnapshot CRDs

During {product-title} installation, the CSI Snapshot Controller Operator creates the following snapshot Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) in the `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/` API group:

VolumeSnapshotContent::
A snapshot taken of a volume in the cluster that has been provisioned by a cluster administrator.
+
Similar to the PersistentVolume CRD, the VolumeSnapshotContent CRD is a cluster resource that points to a real snapshot in the storage backend.
+
For manually pre-provisioned snapshots, a cluster administrator creates a number of VolumeSnapshotContent objects. These carry the details of the real volume snapshot in the storage system.
+
The VolumeSnapshotContent CRD is not namespaced and is for use by a cluster administrator.

VolumeSnapshot::

Similar to PersistentVolumeClaim, the VolumeSnapshot CRD defines a developer request for a snapshot. The CSI Snapshot Controller Operator runs the CSI snapshot controller, which handles the binding of a VolumeSnapshot object with an appropriate VolumeSnapshotContent object. The binding is a one-to-one mapping.
+
The VolumeSnapshot CRD is namespaced. A developer uses the CRD as a distinct request for a snapshot.

VolumeSnapshotClass::

Allows a cluster administrator to specify different attributes belonging to a VolumeSnapshot object. These attributes may differ among snapshots taken of the same volume on the storage system, in which case they would not be expressed by using the same StorageClass of a PersistentVolumeClaim.
+
The VolumeSnapshotClass CRD defines the parameters for the `csi-external-snapshotter` sidecar to use when creating a snapshot. This allows the storage backend to know what kind of snapshot to dynamically create if multiple options are supported.
+
Dynamically provisioned snapshots use the VolumeSnapshotClass to specify storage-provider-specific parameters to use when creating a snapshot.
+
The VolumeSnapshotContentClass CRD is not namespaced and is for use by a cluster administrator to enable global configuration options for their storage backend.
