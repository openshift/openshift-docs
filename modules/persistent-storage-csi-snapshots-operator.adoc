= About the CSI Snapshot Controller Operator

The CSI Snapshot Controller Operator runs in the cluster-csi-snapshot-controller-operator namespace. It is installed by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) in all clusters by default.

The CSI Snapshot Controller Operator watches for snapshots. It installs the CSI snapshot controller, which runs in csi-snapshot-controller. The Operator also contains the CSI external snapshot sidecar, which runs in csi-external-snapshotter.

== VolumeSnapshot CRDs

During {product-title} installation, the CSI Snapshot Controller Operator is responsible for creating the following snapshot Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) in the API group `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1`:

VolumeSnapshotContent::
A snapshot taken from a volume in the cluster that has been provisioned by the cluster administrator.
+
Similar to PersistentVolume, VolumeSnapshotContent is a cluster resource that points to a real snapshot in the storage backend.
+
For manually pre-provisioned snapshots, the cluster administrator creates a number of VolumeSnapshotContents. These carry the details of the real volume snapshot in the storage system
+
VolumeSnapshotContent is not namespaced and is for use by the cluster administrator.

VolumeSnapshot::

Similar to PersistentVolumeClaim, VolumeSnapshot defines a developer request for a snapshot. The csi-snapshot-controller handles the binding of a VolumeSnapshot object with an appropriate VolumeSnapshotContent object. The binding is a one-to-one mapping.
+
VolumeSnapshot is namespaced for use by the developer.

VolumeSnapshotClass::

Allows the cluster administrator to specify different attributes belonging to a VolumeSnapshot. These attributes may differ among snapshots taken from the same volume on the storage system and therefore cannot be expressed by using the same StorageClass of a PersistentVolumeClaim.
+
Similar to StorageClass, VolumeSnapshotClass defines parameters for csi-external-snapshotter to use when taking a snapshot. This allows the storage backend to know what kind of snapshot to take dynamically if multiple options are supported.
+
Dynamically provisioned snapshots use the VolumeSnapshotClass to specify storage-provider-specific parameters to use when taking a snapshot.
+
VolumeSnapshotContentClass is not namespaced and is for use by the cluster administrator.
