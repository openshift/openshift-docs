|===
|Jenkins|OpenShift Pipelines
|Jenkins has a controller node. Jenkins runs pipelines and steps centrally, or orchestrates jobs running in other nodes.|OpenShift Pipelines is serverless and distributed, and there is no central dependency for execution.
|Containers are launched by the Jenkins controller node through the pipeline.|OpenShift Pipelines adopts a 'container-first' approach, where every step runs as a container in a pod (equivalent to nodes in Jenkins).
|Extensibility is achieved by using plugins.|Extensibility is achieved by using tasks in Tekton Hub or by creating custom tasks and scripts.
