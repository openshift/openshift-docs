= About running {ols-long} in disconnected mode

The {ols-long} Operator and the {ols-long} service can work in a disconnected environment. A disconnected environment is an environment that does not have full access to the internet. 

In a disconnected environment, you must mirror the required container images into the environment. For more information, see "Mirroring in disconnected environments" in the {ocp-product-title} product documentation.

[NOTE]
====
When you mirror the images in a disconnected environment, you must list the {ols-long} Operator when you use the `oc mirror` command.
