= Introduction to the Argo CD Agent architecture

The Argo CD Agent introduces an opinionated mechanism for managing multiple clusters by using Argo CD in a `hub-and-spoke` configuration. Argo CD Agent, configured alongside Argo CD, enables the familiar Argo CD Web console, but extends its capabilities to allow you to simultaneously configure and monitor multiple, separate Argo CD instances from a single location.

Unlike a traditional single-instance Argo CD deployment, the Argo CD Agent architecture provides a `single pane of glass` for monitoring and managing Argo CD Applications across multiple clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Argo CD Agent configuration is designed for advanced users who already understand Argo CD and {gitops-title} concepts. If you are new to Argo CD, start with the traditional push-based hub-and-spoke model before adopting the Agent-based approach.
