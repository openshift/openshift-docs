= Federation implementation checklist

Federating services meshes involves the following activities:

* [ ] Configure networking between the clusters that you are going to federate.

** [ ] Configure the load balancers supporting the services associated with the federation gateways to support raw TLS traffic.

* [ ] Installing the {SMProductName} version 2.1 or later Operator in each of your clusters.

* [ ] Deploying a version 2.1 or later `ServiceMeshControlPlane` to each of your clusters.

* [ ] Configuring the SMCP for federation for each mesh that you want to federate:

** [ ] Create a federation egress gateway for each mesh you are going to federate with.
** [ ] Create a federation ingress gateway for each mesh you are going to federate with.
** [ ] Configure a unique trust domain.

* [ ] Federate two or more meshes by creating a `ServiceMeshPeer` resource for each mesh pair.

* [ ] Export services by creating an `ExportedServiceSet` resource to make services available from one mesh to a peer mesh.

* [ ] Import services by creating an `ImportedServiceSet` resource to import services shared by a mesh peer.
