= Limitations of a user-defined network

While user-defined networks (UDN) offer highly customizable network configuration options, there are limitations that cluster administrators and developers should be aware of when implementing and managing these networks. Consider the following limitations before implementing a UDN.

//Check on the removal of the DNS limitation for 4.18 or 4.17.z.
* *DNS limitations*:
** DNS lookups for pods resolve to the pod's IP address on the cluster default network. Even if a pod is part of a user-defined network, DNS lookups will not resolve to the pod's IP address on that user-defined network. However, DNS lookups for services and external entities will function as expected.
** When a pod is assigned to a primary UDN, it can access the Kubernetes API (KAPI) and DNS services on the cluster's default network.

* *Initial network assignment*: You must create the namespace and network before creating pods. Assigning a namespace with pods to a new network or creating a UDN in an existing namespace will not be accepted by OVN-Kubernetes.

//Check in 4.18 or 4.17.z for this capability.
//* *Service reachability*: Services created in namespaces that are served by the UDN are only accessible by namespaces connected to the UDN. Services in a UDN are reachable by other namespaces that share the same network. This can limit the flexibility of services across different networks.

* *Health check limitations*: Kubelet health checks are performed by the cluster default network, which does not confirm the network connectivity of the primary interface on the pod. Consequently, scenarios where a pod appears healthy by the default network, but has broken connectivity on the primary interface, are possible with user-defined networks.

* *Network policy limitations*: Network policies that enable traffic between namespaces connected to different user-defined primary networks are not effective. These traffic policies do not take effect because there is no connectivity between these isolated networks.

* *Creation and modification limitation*: The `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR and the `UserDefinedNetwork` CR cannot be modified after being created.

*Limited access to default network services*: By default, pods running on a user-defined network are isolated from initiating connections to most services residing on the cluster's default network, such as those with IPs in the default network range, and potentially other `openshift-*.svc` services. This means that the following services are generally unreachable from user-defined network pods:
+
** The {product-title} image registry (`image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc`)
** Monitoring services such as Prometheus or Alertmanager
** Management services such as ACS, ACM, and cost management
+
This limitation can affect features relying on these services, such as application creation from Git repositories, such as `oc new-app <command>` or templates that use source-to-image builds.
+
To allow specific default network services to connect to user-defined network pods, you can use the `k8s.ovn.org/open-default-ports` annotation on the user-defined network pod to explicitly open the required ports and protocols for inbound connections from the default network.

* *Connectivity limitation*: NodePort services on user-defined networks are not guaranteed isolation. For example, NodePort traffic from a pod to a service on the same node is not accessible, whereas traffic from a pod on a different node succeeds.
