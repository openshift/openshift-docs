= Limitations for UserDefinedNetwork custom resource

While user-defined networks (UDN) offer highly customizable network configuration options, there are limitations that cluster administrators and developers should be aware of when implementing and managing these networks. Consider the following limitations before implementing a user-defined network.

//Check on the removal of the DNS limitation for 4.18 or 4.17.z.
* *DNS limitations*: DNS lookups for pods resolve to the pod's IP address on the cluster default network. Even if a pod is part of a user-defined network, DNS lookups will not resolve to the pod's IP address on that user-defined network.

* *Initial network assignment*: You must create the namespace and network before creating pods. Assigning a namespace with pods to a new network or creating a UDN in an existing namespace will not be accepted by OVN-Kubernetes.

//Check in 4.18 or 4.17.z for this capability.
//* *Service reachability*: Services created in namespaces that are served by the UDN are only accessible by namespaces connected to the UDN. Services in a UDN are reachable by other namespaces that share the same network. This can limit the flexibility of services across different networks.

* *Health check limitations*: Kubelet health checks are performed by the cluster default network, which does not confirm the network connectivity of the primary interface on the pod. Consequently, scenarios where a pod appears healthy by the default network, but has broken connectivity on the primary interface, are possible with user-defined networks.

* *Network policy limitations*: Network policies that enable traffic between namespaces connected to different user-defined primary networks are not effective. These traffic policies do not take effect because there is no connectivity between these isolated networks.
