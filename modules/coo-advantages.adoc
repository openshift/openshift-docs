= Key advantages of using {coo-short}

[role="_abstract"]
Deploying {coo-short} helps you address monitoring requirements that are hard to achieve using the default monitoring stack, including extensibility for custom metrics, multi-tenancy support for per-team configurations, scalability through multiple monitoring stacks, and flexibility with independent release cycles from core OpenShift platform monitoring.

[id="coo-advantages-extensibility_{context}"]
== Extensibility

- You can add more metrics to a {coo-short}-deployed monitoring stack, which is not possible with core platform monitoring without losing support.
- You can receive cluster-specific metrics from core platform monitoring through federation.
- {coo-short} supports advanced monitoring scenarios like trend forecasting and anomaly detection.

[id="coo-advantages-multi-tenancy_{context}"]
== Multi-tenancy support

- You can create monitoring stacks per user namespace.
- You can deploy multiple stacks per namespace or a single stack for multiple namespaces.
- {coo-short} enables independent configuration of alerts and receivers for different teams.

[id="coo-advantages-scalability_{context}"]
== Scalability

- Supports multiple monitoring stacks on a single cluster.
- Enables monitoring of large clusters through manual sharding.
- Addresses cases where metrics exceed the capabilities of a single Prometheus instance.

[id="coo-advantages-scalabilityflexibility_{context}"]
== Flexibility

- Decoupled from {ocp-product-title} release cycles.
- Faster release iterations and rapid response to changing requirements.
- Independent management of alerting rules.
