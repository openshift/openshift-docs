ifdef::installing-3-4[]
= Installing the {mtc-full} on an {product-title} 3 source cluster

You can install the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) manually on an {product-title} 3 source cluster.
endif::[]
ifdef::installing-disconnected-3-4[]
= Installing the {mtc-full} on an {product-title} 3 source cluster in a restricted environment

You can create a manifest file based on the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) Operator image and edit the manifest to point to your local image registry. Then, you can use the local image to create the {mtc-full} Operator on an {product-title} 3 source cluster.
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must install the same {mtc-short} version on the {product-title} 3 and 4 clusters.

To ensure that you have the latest version on the {product-title} 3 cluster, download the `operator.yml` and `controller-3.yml` files when you are ready to create and run the migration plan.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges on all clusters.
* You must have access to `registry.redhat.io`.
* You must have `podman` installed.
* The source cluster must be {product-title} 3.7, 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11.
ifdef::installing-3-4[]
* The source cluster must be configured to pull images from `registry.redhat.io`.
+
To pull images, you must link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3772061[create an image stream secret] and copy it to each node in your cluster.
endif::[]
ifdef::installing-disconnected-3-4[]
* You must have a Linux workstation with unrestricted network access.
* You must have access to a mirror registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]

.Procedure

ifdef::installing-3-4[]
. Log in to `registry.redhat.io` with your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials:
endif::[]
ifdef::installing-disconnected-3-4[]
. On the workstation with unrestricted network access, log in to `registry.redhat.io` with your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials:
endif::[]
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman login registry.redhat.io
----

. Download the `operator.yml` file:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ sudo podman cp $(sudo podman create \
  registry.redhat.io/rhmtc/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator:v{mtc-version}):/operator.yml ./
----

. Download the `controller-3.yml` file:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ sudo podman cp $(sudo podman create \
  registry.redhat.io/rhmtc/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator:v{mtc-version}):/controller-3.yml ./
----

ifdef::installing-disconnected-3-4[]
. Obtain the Operator image value from the `mapping.txt` file that was created when you ran the `oc adm catalog mirror` on the {product-title} 4 cluster:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ grep openshift-migration-rhel7-operator ./mapping.txt | grep rhmtc
----
+
The output shows the mapping between the `registry.redhat.io` image and your mirror registry image.
+
.Example output

----

. Update the `image` and `REGISTRY` values in the Operator configuration file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
containers:
  - name: ansible
    image: <registry.apps.example.com>/rhmtc/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator@sha256:<468a6126f73b1ee12085ca53a312d1f96ef5a2ca03442bcb63724af5e2614e8a> <1>

...
    env:
    - name: REGISTRY
      value: <registry.apps.example.com> <3>
----
<1> Specify your mirror registry and the `sha256` value of the Operator image in the `mapping.txt` file.
<2> Specify your mirror registry and the `sha256` value of the Operator image in the `mapping.txt` file.
<3> Specify your mirror registry.
endif::[]

. Log in to your {product-title} 3 cluster.

ifdef::installing-3-4[]
. Verify that the cluster can authenticate with `registry.redhat.io`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc run test --image registry.redhat.io/ubi8 --command sleep infinity
----
endif::[]

. Create the {mtc-full} Operator object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f operator.yml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

----
<1> You can ignore `Error from server (AlreadyExists)` messages. They are caused by the {mtc-full} Operator creating resources for earlier versions of {product-title} 3 that are provided in later releases.

. Create the `MigrationController` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f controller-3.yml
----

. Verify that the `Velero` and `Restic` pods are running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-migration
