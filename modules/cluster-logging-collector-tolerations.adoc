= Using tolerations to control the log collector Pod placement

You can ensure which nodes the logging collector Pods run on and prevent 
other workloads from using those nodes by using tolerations on the Pods.

You apply tolerations to logging collector Pods through the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR)
and apply taints to a node through the node specification. You can use taints and tolerations
to ensure the Pod does not get evicted for things like memory and CPU issues.

By default, the logging collector Pods have the following toleration:

[source, yaml]
----
tolerations:
- key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoExecute"
----

.Prerequisites

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

.Procedure

. Use the following command to add a taint to a node where you want logging collector Pods to schedule logging collector Pods:
+
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 collector=node:NoExecute
----
+
This example places a taint on `node1` that has key `collector`, value `node`, and taint effect `NoExecute`.
You must use the `NoExecute` taint effect. `NoExecute` schedules only Pods that match the taint and removes existing Pods
that do not match.

. Edit the `collection` section of the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) to configure a toleration for the logging collector Pods:
+
[source, yaml]
----
  collection:
    logs:
      type: "fluentd"
      rsyslog:
        tolerations: 
        - key: "collector"  <1>
          operator: "Exists"  <2>
          effect: "NoExecute"  <3>
          tolerationSeconds: 6000  <4>
----
<1> Specify the key that you added to the node.
<2> Specify the `Exists` operator to require the `key`/`value`/`effect` parameters to match. 
<3> Specify the `NoExecute` effect.
<4> Optionally, specify the `tolerationSeconds` parameter to set how long a Pod can remain bound to a node before being evicted.

This toleration matches the taint created by the `oc adm taint` command. A Pod with this toleration would be able to schedule onto `node1`.
