= Recovering Loki pods from failed zones

In {product-title} a zone failure happens when specific availability zone resources become inaccessible. Availability zones are isolated areas within a cloud provider's data center, aimed at enhancing redundancy and fault tolerance. If your {product-title} cluster isn't configured to handle this, a zone failure can lead to service or data loss.

Loki pods are part of a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/[StatefulSet], and they come with Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) provisioned by a `StorageClass` object. Each Loki pod and its PVCs reside in the same zone. When a zone failure occurs in a cluster, the StatefulSet controller automatically attempts to recover the affected pods in the failed zone.

[WARNING]
====
The following procedure will delete the PVCs in the failed zone, and all data contained therein.  To avoid complete data loss the replication factor field of the `LokiStack` CR should always be set to a value greater than 1 to ensure that Loki is replicating.
====

.Prerequisites
* Logging version 5.8 or later.
* Verify your `LokiStack` CR has a replication factor greater than 1.
* Zone failure detected by the control plane, and nodes in the failed zone are marked by cloud provider integration.

The StatefulSet controller automatically attempts to reschedule pods in a failed zone. Because the associated PVCs are also in the failed zone, automatic rescheduling to a different zone does not work. You must manually delete the PVCs in the failed zone to allow successful re-creation of the stateful Loki Pod and its provisioned PVC in the new zone.


.Procedure
. List the pods in `Pending` status by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc get pods --field-selector status.phase==Pending -n openshift-logging
----
+
.Example `oc get pods` output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE # <1>
logging-loki-index-gateway-1   0/1     Pending   0          17m

----
<1> These pods are in `Pending` status because their corresponding PVCs are in the failed zone.

. List the PVCs in `Pending` status by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc get pvc -o=json -n openshift-logging | jq '.items[] | select(.status.phase == "Pending") | .metadata.name' -r
----
+
.Example `oc get pvc` output
[source,terminal]
----

storage-logging-loki-ingester-1
wal-logging-loki-ingester-1
storage-logging-loki-ruler-1
wal-logging-loki-ruler-1
----

. Delete the PVC(s) for a pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc delete pvc __<pvc_name>__  -n openshift-logging
----
+
. Then delete the pod(s) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc delete pod __<pod_name>__  -n openshift-logging
----

Once these objects have been successfully deleted, they should automatically be rescheduled in an available zone.

== Troubleshooting PVC in a terminating state

The PVCs might hang in the terminating state without being deleted, if PVC metadata finalizers are set to `kubernetes.io/pv-protection`. Removing the finalizers should allow the PVCs to delete successfully.

. Remove the finalizer for each PVC by running the command below, then retry deletion.
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc patch pvc __<pvc_name>__ -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' -n openshift-logging
