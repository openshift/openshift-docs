= Pod limits

The `maxPods` setting for each node affects how many hosted clusters can fit in a control-plane node. It is important to note the `maxPods` value on all control-plane nodes. Plan for about 75 pods for each highly available hosted control plane.

For bare-metal nodes, the default `maxPods` setting of 250 is likely to be a limiting factor because roughly three {hcp} fit for each node given the pod requirements, even if the machine has plenty of resources to spare. Setting the `maxPods` value to 500 by configuring the `KubeletConfig` value allows for greater hosted control plane density, which can help you take advantage of additional compute resources.
