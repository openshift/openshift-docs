= Agent-based installer

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
Agent-based installer (ABI) provides installation capabilities without centralized infrastructure.
The installation program creates an ISO image that you mount to the server.
When the server boots it installs {product-title} and supplied extra manifests.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also use ABI to install {product-title} clusters without a hub cluster.
An image registry is still required when you use ABI in this manner.
====

Agent-based installer (ABI) is an optional component.

Limits and requirements::
* You can supply a limited set of additional manifests at installation time.

* You must include `MachineConfiguration` CRs that are required by the RAN DU use case.

Engineering considerations::

* ABI provides a baseline {product-title} installation.

* You install Day 2 Operators and the remainder of the RAN DU use case configurations after installation.
