= Agent-based installer

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
The optional Agent-based Installer component provides installation capabilities without centralized infrastructure.
The installation program creates an ISO image that you mount to the server.
When the server boots it installs {product-title} and supplied extra manifests.
The Agent-based Installer allows you to install {product-title} without a hub cluster.
A container image registry is required for cluster installation.

Limits and requirements::
* You can supply a limited set of additional manifests at installation time.
* You must include `MachineConfiguration` CRs that are required by the RAN DU use case.

Engineering considerations::
* The Agent-based Installer provides a baseline {product-title} installation.
* You install Day 2 Operators and the remainder of the RAN DU use case configurations after installation.
