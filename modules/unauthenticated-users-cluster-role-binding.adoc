[id="unauthenticated-users-cluster-role-bindings_{context}"]
= Adding unauthenticated groups to cluster roles

As a cluster administrator, you can add unauthenticated users to the following cluster roles in {product-title} by creating a cluster role binding. Unauthenticated users do not have access to non-public cluster roles. This should only be done in specific use cases when necessary.

You can add unauthenticated users to the following cluster roles:

* `system:scope-impersonation`
* `system:webhook`
* `system:oauth-token-deleter`
* `self-access-reviewer`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always verify compliance with your organization's security standards when modifying unauthenticated access.
