= Creating a ServiceMeshPeer resource

.Prerequisites

* Two or more {product-title} 4.6 or above clusters.
* The clusters must already be networked.
* The load balancers supporting the services associated with the federation gateways must be configured to support raw TLS traffic.
* Each cluster must have a version 2.1 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` configured to support federation deployed.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure from the Console
This is conjecture about what the flow might look like…

Follow this procedure to create a `ServiceMeshPeer` resource from the console. This example shows the `red-mesh` creating a peer resource for the `green-mesh`.

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.
. Navigate to *Operators* → *Installed Operators*.
. Click the *Project* menu and select the project where you installed the control plane for the mesh that is creating the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource. For example, `red-mesh-system`.
. Click the {ProductName} Operator, then click *Istio Service Mesh ServiceMeshPeer*.
. On the *Istio Service Mesh ServiceMeshPeer* tab, click *Create ServiceMeshPeer*.
. On the *Create ServiceMeshPeer* page, click *YAML* to modify your configuration.
. Modify the default configuration with values for the mesh federation between the peers.
. Click *Create*. The Operator creates the mesh peer based on your configuration parameters.
. To verify the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource was created, click the *Istio Service Mesh ServiceMeshPeer* tab.
.. Click the name of the new `ServiceMeshPeer`, for example, `green-mesh`.
.. Click the *Resources* tab to see the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource the Operator created and configured.

.Procedure from the CLI

Follow this procedure to create a `ServiceMeshPeer` resource from the command line. This example shows the `red-mesh` creating a peer resource for the `green-mesh`.

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. Enter the following command. Then, enter your username and password when prompted.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --username=<NAMEOFUSER> <API token> https://{HOSTNAME}:6443
----
+
. Change to the project where you installed the control plane, for example, `red-mesh-system`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project red-mesh-system
----
+
. Create a `ServiceMeshPeer` file based the following example for the two meshes that you want to federate.

.Example ServiceMeshPeer resource for red-mesh to green-mesh
[source,yaml]

kind: ServiceMeshPeer
apiVersion: federation.maistra.io/v1
metadata:

. Run the following command to deploy the resource, where `red-mesh-system` is the system namespace and `servicemeshpeer.yaml` includes a full path to the file you edited:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n red-mesh-system -f servicemeshpeer.yaml
