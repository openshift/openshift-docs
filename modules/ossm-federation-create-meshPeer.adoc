= Creating a ServiceMeshPeer resource

.Prerequisites

* Two or more {product-title} 4.6 or above clusters.
* The clusters must already be networked.
* The load balancers supporting the services associated with the federation gateways must be configured to support raw TLS traffic.
* Each cluster must have a version 2.1 or later `ServiceMeshControlPlane` configured to support federation deployed.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure from the Console
This is conjecture about what the flow might look like…

Follow this procedure to create a `ServiceMeshPeer` resource from the console. This example shows the `red-mesh` creating a peer resource for the `green-mesh`.

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.
. Navigate to *Operators* → *Installed Operators*.
. Click the *Project* menu and select the project where you installed the control plane for the mesh that is creating the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource. For example, `red-mesh-system`.
. Click the {SMProductName} Operator, then click *Istio Service Mesh ServiceMeshPeer*.
. On the *Istio Service Mesh ServiceMeshPeer* tab, click *Create ServiceMeshPeer*.
. On the *Create ServiceMeshPeer* page, click *YAML* to modify your configuration.
. Modify the default configuration with values for the mesh federation between the peers.
. Click *Create*. The Operator creates the mesh peer based on your configuration parameters.
. To verify the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource was created, click the *Istio Service Mesh ServiceMeshPeer* tab.
.. Click the name of the new `ServiceMeshPeer`, for example, `green-mesh`.
.. Click the *Resources* tab to see the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource the Operator created and configured.

.Procedure from the CLI

Follow this procedure to create a `ServiceMeshPeer` resource from the command line. This example shows the `red-mesh` creating a peer resource for the `green-mesh`.

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. Enter the following command. Then, enter your username and password when prompted.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --username=<NAMEOFUSER> <API token> https://<HOSTNAME>:6443
----
+
. Change to the project where you installed the control plane, for example, `red-mesh-system`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project red-mesh-system
----
+
. Create a `ServiceMeshPeer` file based the following example for the two meshes that you want to federate.
+
.Example ServiceMeshPeer resource for red-mesh to green-mesh
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ServiceMeshPeer
apiVersion: federation.maistra.io/v1
metadata:
  name: green-mesh
  namespace: red-mesh-system
spec:
  remote:
    addresses:
    - ingress-red-mesh.green-mesh-system.apps.domain.com
  gateways:
    ingress:
      name: ingress-green-mesh
    egress:
      name: egress-green-mesh
  security:
    trustDomain: green-mesh.local
    clientID: green-mesh.local/ns/green-mesh-system/sa/egress-red-mesh-service-account
    certificateChain:
      kind: ConfigMap
      name: green-mesh-ca-root-cert
----
+
. Run the following command to deploy the resource, where `red-mesh-system` is the system namespace and `servicemeshpeer.yaml` includes a full path to the file you edited:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n red-mesh-system -f servicemeshpeer.yaml
----
+
. To confirm that connection between the red mesh and green mesh is established, inspect the status of the green-mesh `ServiceMeshPeer` in the red-mesh-system namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n red-mesh-system get servicemeshpeer green-mesh -o yaml
----
+

----
The `status.discoveryStatus.active.remotes` field shows that istiod in the peer mesh (in this example, the green mesh) is connected to istiod in the current mesh (in this example, the red mesh).
+
The `status.discoveryStatus.active.watch` field shows that istiod in the current mesh is connected to istiod in the peer mesh.
+
If you check the `servicemeshpeer` named `red-mesh` in `green-mesh-system`, you'll find information about the same two connections from the perspective of the green mesh.
+
When the connection between two meshes is not established, the `ServiceMeshPeer` status indicates this in the `status.discoveryStatus.inactive` field.
+
For more information on why a connection attempt failed, inspect the Istiod log, the access log of the egress gateway handling egress traffic for the peer, and the ingress gateway handling ingress traffic for the current mesh in the peer mesh.
+
For example, if the red mesh can't connect to the green mesh, check the following logs:

* istiod-red-mesh in red-mesh-system
* egress-green-mesh in red-mesh-system
* ingress-red-mesh in green-mesh-system
