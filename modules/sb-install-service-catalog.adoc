= Installing service catalog

If you plan on using any of the services from the {tsb-name}, you must install
the service catalog by completing the following steps.

The custom resources for the service catalog's API server and controller manager
are created by default in {product-title}, but initially have a
`managementState` of `Removed`. To install the service catalog, you must change
the `managementState` for these resources to `Managed`.

.Procedure

. Enable the service catalog API server.
.. Use the following command to edit the service catalog API server resource.
+
----
$ oc edit servicecatalogapiservers
----
.. Under `spec`, set the `managementState` field to `Managed`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  logLevel: Normal
  managementState: Managed
----
.. Save the file to apply the changes.

The Operator installs the service catalog API server component. As of
