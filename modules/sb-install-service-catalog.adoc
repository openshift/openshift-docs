= Installing service catalog

If you plan on using any of the services from the {asb-name} or {tsb-name}, you must install the service catalog by completing the following steps.

The custom resources for the service catalog's API server and controller manager
are created by default in {product-title}, but initially have a
`managementState` of `Removed`. To install the service catalog, you must change
the `managementState` for these resources to `Managed`.

.Procedure

. Enable the service catalog API server:
.. Use the following command to edit the service catalog API server resource:
+
----
$ oc edit servicecatalogapiservers
----
.. Under `spec`, set the `managementState` field to `Managed`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  logLevel: Normal
  managementState: Managed
----
.. Save the file to apply the changes.
+
The Operator installs the service catalog API server component. As of
{product-title} 4, this component is installed into the
`openshift-service-catalog-apiserver` namespace.

. Enable the service catalog controller manager:
.. Use the following command to edit the service catalog controller manager resource:
+
----
$ oc edit servicecatalogcontrollermanagers
----
.. Under `spec`, set the `managementState` field to `Managed`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  logLevel: Normal
  managementState: Managed
----
.. Save the file to apply the changes.
+
The Operator installs the service catalog controller manager component. As of
{product-title} 4, this component is installed into the
`openshift-service-catalog-controller-manager` namespace.
