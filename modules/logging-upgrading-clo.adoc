= Updating the {clo}

To update the {clo} to a new major release version, you must modify the update channel for the Operator subscription.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {clo}.
* You have administrator permissions.
* You have access to the {product-title} web console and are viewing the *Administrator* perspective.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Select the *openshift-logging* project.

. Click the *Red Hat OpenShift Logging* Operator.

. Click *Subscription*. In the *Subscription details* section, click the *Update channel* link. This link text might be *stable* or *stable-5.9*, depending on your current update channel.

. In the *Change Subscription Update Channel* window, select the latest major version update channel, *stable-5.9*, and click *Save*. Note the `cluster-logging.v5.9.<z>` version.

. Wait for a few seconds, and then go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* to verify that the {clo} version matches the latest `cluster-logging.v5.9.<z>` version.

. On the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page, wait for the *Status* field to report *Succeeded*.

. Check if the `LokiStack` custom resource contains the `v13` schema version and add it if it is missing. For correctly adding the `v13` schema version, see "Upgrading the LokiStack storage schema".
