= Converting and uploading the image to {oci-c3-no-rt}

Convert the ISO image to an {oci} image and upload it to your {oci-c3-short} system from your {oci-first} Home Region Object Store. You can perform this step on your local machine, rather than on the bastion server or within environments such as Oracle Solution Center.

.Prerequisites

* You have generated the {product-title} Discovery ISO in the {ai-full} web console, and saved the file to your local system.

.Procedure

. Convert the image from ISO to {oci}.
. Upload the {oci} image to an {oci} bucket, and generate a Pre-Authenticated Request (PAR) URL.
. Import the {oci} image to the {oci-c3-short} portal.
. Copy the Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID) of the image for use in the next procedure.

For the full procedure, see step 6 - 8 in the "OpenShift Image Preparation" section of the link:https://www.oracle.com/a/otn/docs/compute_cloud_at_customer_assisted_installer.pdf?source=:em:nl:mt::::PCATP[Oracle documentation].
