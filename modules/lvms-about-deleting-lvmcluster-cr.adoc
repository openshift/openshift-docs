= Ways to delete an LVMCluster custom resource

You can delete an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) or the {product-title} web console. If you have installed {lvms} by using {rh-rhacm-first}, you can also delete an `LVMCluster` CR by using {rh-rhacm}.

Upon deleting the `LVMCluster` CR, {lvms} deletes the following CRs:

* `storageClass`
* `volumeSnapshotClass`
* `LVMVolumeGroup`
* `LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus`
