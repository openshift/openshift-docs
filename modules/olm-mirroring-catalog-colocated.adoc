= Mirroring catalog contents to registries on the same network

If your mirror registry is co-located on the same network as your workstation with unrestricted network access, take the following actions on your workstation.

.Procedure

. If your mirror registry requires authentication, run the following command to log in to the registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login <mirror_registry>
----

. Run the following command to extract and mirror the content to the mirror registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror \
    <index_image> \ <.>
    <mirror_registry>:<port>/<namespace> \ <.>
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \ <.>
    [--insecure] \ <.>
    [--index-filter-by-os='<platform>/<arch>'] \ <.>
    [--manifests-only] <.>
----
<1> Specify the index image for the catalog that you want to mirror. For example, this might be a pruned index image that you created previously, or one of the source index images for the default catalogs, such as `{index-image-pullspec}`.
<2> Specify the target registry and namespace to mirror the Operator contents to, where `<namespace>` is any existing namespace on the registry. For example, you might create an `olm-mirror` namespace to push all mirrored content to.
<3> Optional: If required, specify the location of your registry credentials file.
<4> Optional: If you do not want to configure trust for the target registry, add the `--insecure` flag.
<5> Optional: Specify which platform and architecture of the index image to select when multiple variants are available. Images are passed as `'<platform>/<arch>[/<variant>]'`. This does not apply to images referenced by the index. Valid values are `linux/amd64`, `linux/ppc64le`, `linux/s390x`, and `.*`
<6> Optional: Generate only the manifests required for mirroring, and do not actually mirror the image content to a registry. This option can be useful for reviewing what will be mirrored, and it allows you to make any changes to the mapping list if you require only a subset of packages. You can then use the `mapping.txt` file with the `oc image mirror` command to mirror the modified list of images in a later step. This flag is intended for only advanced selective mirroring of content from the catalog; the `opm index prune` command, if you used it previously to prune the index image, is suitable for most catalog management use cases.

.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
src image has index label for database path: /database/index.db
using database path mapping: /database/index.db:/tmp/153048078
wrote database to /tmp/153048078 <1>
...
wrote mirroring manifests to manifests-{index-image}-1614211642 <2>
----
<1> Directory for the temporary `index.db` database generated by the command.
<2> Record the manifests directory name that is generated. This directory is referenced in subsequent procedures.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Quay does not support nested repositories. As a result, running the `oc adm catalog mirror` command will fail with a `401` unauthorized error. As a workaround, you can use the `--max-components=2` option when running the `oc adm catalog mirror` command to disable the creation of nested repositories. For more information on this workaround, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5440741[Unauthorized error thrown while using catalog mirror command with Quay registry] Knowledgebase Solution.
