= Remove the console Operator

The console Operator installs and maintains the web console on a cluster.  Given that a single node
distributed unit (DU) is a single node master and worker, the Operator is not needed and makes space for
application workloads. You can remove the Operator using the following configuration file.
No customization is required.
