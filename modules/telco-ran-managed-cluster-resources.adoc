= {rds-caps} worker node cluster resource utilization

The maximum number of running pods in the system, inclusive of application workloads and {product-title} pods, is 120.

Resource utilization::
{product-title} resource utilization varies depending on many factors including application workload characteristics such as:

* Pod count

* Type and frequency of probes

* Messaging rates on primary CNI or secondary CNI with kernel networking

* API access rate

* Logging rates

* Storage IOPS

Cluster resource requirements are applicable under the following conditions:

* The cluster is running the described representative application workload.

* The cluster is managed with the constraints described in "{rds-caps} worker node cluster resource utilization".

* Components noted as optional in the RAN DU use model configuration are not applied.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You will need to do additional analysis to determine the impact on resource utilization and ability to meet KPI targets for configurations outside the scope of the {rds-caps} reference design.
You might have to allocate additional resources in the cluster depending on your requirements.
