[id="images-other-jenkins-non-browser-access_{context}"]
= Providing Jenkins with non-browser access

You can configure to access API for Jenkins running on OpenShift Instance.

When the plugin manages authentication, to directly access Jenkins by using non-browser direct HTTP or HTTPS access to Jenkins, a HTTP bearer token authentication header must be supplied with an OpenShift token that has sufficient permissions to access the project where Jenkins is running.

Consider using the token associated with the service account for the project where Jenkins is running.

If you started Jenkins using the example link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/jenkins-ephemeral-template.json[jenkins-ephemeral] or link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/jenkins-persistent-template.json[jenkins-persistent] templates, the commands to display the token are:

.Procedure

. Get the secret token of the service account where Jenkins is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe serviceaccount jenkins
----

. Describe the secret for that service account:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe secret <serviceaccount secret name>
----

. Extract the token, Base64 decode it, and passed it along as a bearer token when communicating with Jenkins, such as when you validate a Jenkins file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ JENKINS_TOKEN=$(oc get secret <serviceaccount secret name> -o=jsonpath={.data.token} | base64 -D)
$ curl --silent -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JENKINS_TOKEN}" -F "jenkinsfile=<Jenkinsfile" "<Jenkins URL>/pipeline-model-converter/validate"
----
