= Installing VirtIO drivers on an existing Windows virtual machine

Install the VirtIO drivers from the attached SATA CD drive to an
existing Windows virtual machine.

[NOTE]

. Right-click the device and select *Update Driver Software*.
. Click *Browse my computer for driver software* and browse to the attached
SATA CD drive, where the VirtIO drivers are located. The drivers are arranged
hierarchically according to their driver type, operating system,
and CPU architecture.
. Click *Next* to install the driver.
. Repeat this process for all the necessary VirtIO drivers.
. After the driver installs, click *Close* to close the window.
