= About reclaiming persistent volumes

In past releases, you accomplished persistent volume reclamation by setting
the Storage Class *reclaimPolicy* to *recycle*. However, Kubernetes no
longer recommends using *recycle* for persistent volume reclamation.

Instead, to reclaim a persistent volume for binding to a new persistent volume
claim, use this procedure to do the following:

* Erase all data in the share.
* Create a new persistent volume with a different name,
maintaining the original persistent volume's connection settings.
