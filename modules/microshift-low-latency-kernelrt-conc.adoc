= Using Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Real Time

If your workload has stringent low-latency determinism requirements for core kernel features such as interrupt handling and process scheduling in the microsecond (Î¼s) range, you can use the {op-system-rt-kernel}. The goal of the {op-system-rtk} is consistent, low-latency determinism that offers predictable response times.

When considering system tuning, consider the following factors:

* System tuning is just as important when using the {op-system-rtk} as it is for the standard kernel.
* Installing the {op-system-rtk} on an untuned system running the standard kernel supplied as part of the RHEL 9 release is not likely to result in any noticeable benefit.
* Tuning the standard kernel yields 90% of possible latency gains.
* The {op-system-rtk} provides the last 10% of latency reduction required by the most demanding workloads.
