= Testing an Operator upgrade on Operator Lifecycle Manager

You can quickly test upgrading your Operator by using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) integration in the Operator SDK, without requiring you to manually manage index images and catalog sources.

The `run bundle-upgrade` subcommand automates triggering an installed Operator to upgrade to a later version by specifying a bundle image for the later version.

.Prerequisites

- Operator installed with OLM either by using the `run bundle` subcommand or with traditional OLM installation
- A bundle image that represents a later version of the installed Operator

.Procedure

. If your Operator has not already been installed with OLM, install the earlier version either by using the `run bundle` subcommand or with traditional OLM installation.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the earlier version of the bundle was installed traditionally using OLM, the newer bundle that you intend to upgrade to must not exist in the index image referenced by the catalog source. Otherwise, running the `run bundle-upgrade` subcommand will cause the registry pod to fail because the newer bundle is already referenced by the index that provides the package and cluster service version (CSV).
====

For example, you can use the following `run bundle` subcommand for a Memcached Operator by specifying the earlier bundle image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk run bundle <registry>/<user>/memcached-operator:v0.0.1
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
