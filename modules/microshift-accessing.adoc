= How to access the {microshift-short} cluster

Use the procedures in this section to access the {microshift-short} cluster, either from the same machine running the {microshift-short} service or remotely from a workstation. You can use this access to observe and administrate workloads. When using these steps, choose the `kubeconfig` file that contains the host name or IP address you want to connect with and place it in the relevant directory. As listed in each procedure, you use the {OCP} CLI tool (`oc`) for cluster activities.
