= Interacting with pipelines from Topology view

The side panel of the application node in the *Topology* page displays the status of a pipeline run and you can interact with it. 

* If a pipeline run does not start automatically, the side panel displays a message that the pipeline cannot be automatically started, hence it would need to be started manually. 
* If a pipeline is created but the user has not started the pipeline, its status is not started. When the user clicks the *Not started* status icon, the start dialog box opens in the *Topology* view. 
* If the pipeline has no build or build config, the *Builds* section is not visible. If there is a pipeline and build config, the *Builds section* is visible.
* The side panel displays a *Log Snippet* when a pipeline run fails on a specific task run. You can view the *Log Snippet* in the *Pipeline Runs* section, under the *Resources* tab. It provides a general error message and a snippet of the log. A link to the *Logs* section provides quick access to the details about the failed run.
