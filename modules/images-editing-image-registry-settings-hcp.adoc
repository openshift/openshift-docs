= Editing image registry settings for {hcp-title}

You can change the image registry config with the `rosa edit` command.

[WARNING]
====
When the `allowedRegistries` parameter is defined, all registries are blocked unless explicitly listed. To prevent pod failure, a list of Red{nbsp}Hat registries is automatically whitelisted, as they are required by payload images within your environment. The current list consists of `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000,quay.io,registry.redhat.io` and it is also visible when running the `rosa describe cluster` command.
====

[NOTE]
====
You can change any registry-related parameter, which will trigger a rollout across all machine pools; all machine pool nodes will be recreated, following pod draining from each node.
====

.Procedure

* Update or edit the image registry for the cluster by running the following command:

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa edit cluster --registry-config-insecure-registries <insecure_registries> \
   --registry-config-allowed-registries <allowed_registries> \
   --registry-config-allowed-registries-for-import <registry_name:insecure> \
   --registry-config-additional-trusted-ca <additional_trusted_ca_file>

? Changing any registry related parameter will trigger a rollout across all machinepools
(all machinepool nodes will be recreated, following pod draining from each node).
Do you want to proceed? Yes
I: Updated cluster '<cluster_name>'
----

.Verification
* Run the `rosa describe` command again, to see if the changes you made to your image registry updated by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe cluster --cluster=<cluster_name>

----
<1> `Allowed Registries`: A comma-separated list of registries for which image pull and push actions are allowed.
<2> `Blocked Registries`: A comma-separated list of registries for which image pull and push actions are blocked. Parameters `allowedRegistries`, `blockedRegistries` are mutually exclusive.
<3> `Insecure Registries`: A comma-separated list of registries which do not have a valid TLS certificate or only support HTTP connections.
<4> `Allowed Registries for Import`: Limits the container image registries from which normal users can import images. The format should be a comma-separated list of `domainName:insecure`.
<5> `domainName`: Specifies a domain name for the registry.
<6> `insecure`: Indicates whether the registry is secure or insecure.
<7> `Platform Allowlist`: A reference to the id of the list of registries that needs to be whitelisted for the platform to work.
<8> `Registries`: The list of registries that needs to be whitelisted for the platform to work.
<9> `Additional Trusted CA`: A JSON file containing the registry hostname as the key, and the PEM-encoded certificate as the value, for each additional registry CA to trust.
