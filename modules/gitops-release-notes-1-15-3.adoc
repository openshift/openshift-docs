== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the RBAC ConfigMap's scope was configured with `\\[groups,email\\]` but the corresponding `Spec.RBAC.Scopes` remained unchanged. This discrepancy led to conflicts during ConfigMap synchronization, specifically when transitioning to Keycloak SSO and modifying the Argo CD configuration. With this update, a new mechanism is implemented in the {gitops-title} Operator to maintain the existing RBAC scope configuration within the RBAC ConfigMap when upgrading to Keycloak SSO. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-5977[GITOPS-5977]
