== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the scope configuration in the RBAC `argocd-rbac-cm` config map was configured with `'[groups,email]'` without the corresponding change in `.spec.rbac.scopes`. This discrepancy led to conflicts during config map synchronization when transitioning to Keycloak SSO. With this update, the {gitops-title} Operator now maintains the existing RBAC scope configuration. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-5977[GITOPS-5977]
