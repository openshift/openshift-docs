= Uploading kernel support packages to Central

You can upload the kernel support packages containing probes for all recent and supported Linux kernel versions to Central.

.Prerequisites

* You must have an API token with the administrator role.
* You must have installed the `roxctl` command-line interface (CLI).

.Procedure

. Set the `ROX_API_TOKEN` and the `ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS` environment variables:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ROX_API_TOKEN=<api_token>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS=<address>:<port_number>
----
. Run the following command to upload the kernel support packages:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl collector support-packages upload <package_file> \
  -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS"
----

[NOTE]
====
* When you upload a new support package that includes content uploaded to Central previously, only new files are uploaded.
* When you upload a new support package that includes files with the same name but different contents than those present on the Central, `roxctl` shows a warning message and does not overwrite files.
** You can use the `--overwrite` option with the upload command to overwrite the files.
* When you upload a support package that contains a required probe, Central does not make any outbound requests (to the internet) for downloading this probe. Central uses the probe from the support package.
