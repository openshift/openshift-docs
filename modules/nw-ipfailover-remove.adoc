= Removing IP failover

When IP failover is initially configured, the worker nodes in the cluster are modified with an `iptables` rule that explicitly allows multicast packets on `224.0.0.18` for Keepalived. Because of the change to the nodes, removing IP failover requires running a job to remove the `iptables` rule and removing the virtual IP addresses used by Keepalived.

.Procedure

. Optional: Identify and delete any check and notify scripts that are stored as config maps:

.. Identify whether any pods for IP failover use a config map as a volume:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -l ipfailover \
  -o jsonpath="\
{range .items[?(@.spec.volumes[*].configMap)]}
{'Namespace: '}{.metadata.namespace}
{'Pod:       '}{.metadata.name}
{'Volumes that use config maps:'}
{range .spec.volumes[?(@.configMap)]}  {'volume:    '}{.name}
  {'configMap: '}{.configMap.name}{'\n'}{end}
{end}"
----
+
.Example output
----
Namespace: default
Pod:       keepalived-worker-59df45db9c-2x9mn
Volumes that use config maps:
  volume:    config-volume
  configMap: mycustomcheck
----

.. If the preceding step provided the names of config maps that are used as volumes, delete the config maps:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete configmap <configmap_name>
----

. Identify an existing deployment for IP failover:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment -l ipfailover
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE   NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
default     ipfailover   2/2     2            2           105d
----

. Delete the deployment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete deployment <ipfailover_deployment_name>
----

. Remove the `ipfailover` service account:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete sa ipfailover
----

. Run a job that removes the IP tables rule that was added when IP failover was initially configured:

.. Create a file such as `remove-ipfailover-job.yaml` with contents that are similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  generateName: remove-ipfailover-
  labels:
    app: remove-ipfailover
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: remove-ipfailover
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: remove-ipfailover
        image: quay.io/openshift/origin-keepalived-ipfailover:{product-version}
        command: ["/var/lib/ipfailover/keepalived/remove-failover.sh"]
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/hostname: <host_name>  <.>
      restartPolicy: Never
----
<.> Run the job for each node in your cluster that was configured for IP failover and replace the hostname each time.

.. Run the job:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f remove-ipfailover-job.yaml
----
+
.Example output
----
job.batch/remove-ipfailover-2h8dm created
----

.Verification

* Confirm that the job removed the initial configuration for IP failover.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs job/remove-ipfailover-2h8dm
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
remove-failover.sh: OpenShift IP Failover service terminating.
