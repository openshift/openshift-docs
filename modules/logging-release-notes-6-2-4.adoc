== Bug Fixes

* Before this update, using the `prune` filter to remove Kubernetes metadata fields such as `.kubernetes.namespace_name` caused a `remapping` error during Syslog output generation. This prevented the `appname` and `tag` fields from being correctly initialized and could prevent forwarding of logs. With this update, this issue is fixed. Improved error handling initializes these fields with an empty string if the source metadata is missing, ensuring successful log processing. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7267[LOG-7267])

*  Before this update, a `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR) that was configured for a `LokiStack` output with the OpenTelemetry  (OTEL) data model incorrectly passed validation without the `tech preview` annotation. With this update, a `ClusterLogForwarder` CR that is configured for a `LokiStack` output with the OTEL data model correctly fails validation unless the `tech preview` annotation is included. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7280[LOG-7280])

* Before this update, the diagnostic tool of the {clo} did not automatically collect certain diagnosis data. With this update, the `operators.openshift.io/must-gather-image` annotation has been added to the Operator's `ClusterServiceVersion`. As a result, you can now use the `--all-images` flag to automatically collect the Operator's diagnostic data successfully. 
(https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7304[LOG-7304])

* Before this update, you could not create the `AlertingRule` CR for the infrastructure logs without specifying a namespace label. This limitation prevented alerts from being created in certain scenarios. With this update, you can create the `RecordingRule` and `AlertingRule` CRs in the infrastructure and audit logs without specifying a namespace label. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7317[LOG-7317])

* Before this update, the `ClusterLogForwarder` API did not validate the URL scheme for Kafka outputs, which could lead to configuration errors. With this update, the `ClusterLogForwarder` API validates the URL scheme for Kafka outputs, and the API documentation reflects the valid URL scheme. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7387[LOG-7387])
