= Configuring revision response start timeout

By setting the revision response start timeout, you can specify the maximum duration in seconds that Serving waits for a revision to start sending network traffic after a request has been routed to it. The revision response start timeout must not exceed the revision timeout. The default duration is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving.
* You have the required permissions for your cluster:
** Cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}
** Cluster administrator or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title}
** Cluster administrator or dedicated administrator permissions on {dedicated-product-title}

.Procedure

* Choose the appropriate method to configure the revision response start timeout:
** To configure the timeout globally, set the `revision-response-start-timeout-seconds` field in your `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR). If your required response start timeout exceeds the revision timeout, also adjust the `revision-timeout-seconds` field accordingly:

** To configure the timeout per revision, set the `responseStartTimeoutSeconds` field in your service definition. If your required response start timeout exceeds the revision timeout, also adjust the `timeoutSeconds` field accordingly:

[NOTE]
====
To set the revision response start timeout and the revision timeout to a value over 600 seconds (10 minutes), you must increase the default {ocp-product-title} route timeout and the maximum revision timeout. 

For instructions on how to configure timeouts for requests exceeding the default 600 seconds (10 minutes), see "Long-running requests".
