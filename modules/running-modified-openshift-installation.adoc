= Running a modified OCP installation

Running a default OCP 4 cluster is the best way to ensure that the OpenShift cluster you get will be easy to install, maintain, and upgrade going forward. However, because you may want to add to or change your OpenShift cluster, openshift-install offers several ways to modify the default installation or add to it later. These include:

* Creating an install-config file: Changing the contents of the install-config file, to identify things like the cluster name and credentials, is fully supported.
* Creating ignition-config files: Viewing ignition-config files, which define how individual nodes are configured when they are first deployed, is fully supported. However, changing those files is not supported.
* Creating Kubernetes (manifests) and OpenShift (openshift) manifest files: You can view manifest files in the manifests and openshift directories to see how Kubernetes and OpenShift features are configured, respectively. Changing those files is not supported.

Whether you want to change your OCP installation or simply gain a deeper understanding of the details of the installation process, the goal of this section is to step you through an OCP installation. Along the way, it covers:

* The underlying activities that go on under the covers to bring up an OpenShift cluster
* Major components that are leveraged (RHCOS, Ignition, Terraform, and so on)
* Opportunities to customize the install process (install configs, Ignition configs, manifests, and so on)
