= Deploying the NUMA-aware secondary pod scheduler

After you install the NUMA Resources Operator, follow this procedure to deploy the NUMA-aware secondary pod scheduler. 

.Procedure
. Create the `NUMAResourcesScheduler` custom resource that deploys the NUMA-aware custom pod scheduler:

.. Save the following minimal required YAML in the `nro-scheduler.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesScheduler
metadata:
  name: numaresourcesscheduler
spec:
  imageSpec: "registry.redhat.io/openshift4/noderesourcetopology-scheduler-rhel9:v{product-version}" <1>
----
+
<1> In a disconnected environment, make sure to configure the resolution of this image by either:

* Creating an `ImageTagMirrorSet` custom resource (CR). For more information, see "Configuring image registry repository mirroring" in the "Additional resources" section.

* Setting the URL to the disconnected registry.

.. Create the `NUMAResourcesScheduler` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f nro-scheduler.yaml
----

. After a few seconds, run the following command to confirm the successful deployment of the required resources:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get all -n openshift-numaresources
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
