[id="rosa-minimum-scp_{context}"]
= Minimum set of effective permissions for service control policies (SCP)

Service control policies (SCP) are a type of organization policy that manages permissions within your organization. SCPs ensure that accounts within your organization stay within your defined access control guidelines. These polices are maintained in AWS Organizations and control the services that are available within the attached AWS accounts. SCP management is the responsibility of the customer.

ifeval::["{context}" == "rosa-sts-about-iam-resources"]
:aws-sts:
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "prerequisites"]
:aws-non-sts:
endif::[]

ifdef::aws-sts[]
[NOTE]
====
When using AWS Security Token Service (STS), you must ensure that the service control policy does not block the following resources:

* `ec2:{}`
* `iam:{}`
* `tag:*`
====
endif::aws-sts[]

ifdef::aws-non-sts[]
[NOTE]
====
The minimum SCP requirement does not apply when using AWS Security Token Service (STS). For more information about STS, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_getting_started_sts/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.html[AWS prerequisites for ROSA with STS].
====
endif::aws-non-sts[]

Verify that your service control policy (SCP) does not restrict any of these required permissions.
