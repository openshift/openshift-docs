You can review the fixed issues for the Network Observability Operator 1.6.2 release.

* When the secondary interface support was added, there was a need to iterate multiple times to register the per network namespace with the netlink to learn about interface notifications. At the same time, unsuccessful handlers caused a leaking file descriptor because with TCX hook, unlike TC, handlers needed to be explicitly removed when the interface went down. Now, there are no longer leaking file descriptors when creating and deleting pods. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1805[*NETOBSERV-1805*])
