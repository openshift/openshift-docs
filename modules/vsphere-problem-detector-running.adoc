= Running the {operator-name} checks

You can override the schedule for running the {operator-name} checks and run the checks immediately.

The {operator-name} automatically runs the checks every hour. After the Operator starts, the Operator runs the checks immediately. After the Cluster Storage Operator starts and determines that a cluster runs on {vmw-full}, the Cluster Storage Operator starts the {operator-name}. To run the checks immediately, you can scale the {operator-name} to `0` and back to `1` so that the Cluster Storage Operator restarts the {operator-name}.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

* Scale the Operator to `0`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deployment/vsphere-problem-detector-operator --replicas=0 \
    -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator
----

.Verification

* Verify that the pods have restarted by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator get pod -l name=vsphere-problem-detector-operator -w
----
+

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
vsphere-problem-detector-operator-77486bd645-9ntpb   1/1     Running   0          11s
----
+
The `AGE` field must indicate that the pod restarted.

.Next steps

* Viewing the events from the {operator-name}
* Viewing the logs from the {operator-name}
