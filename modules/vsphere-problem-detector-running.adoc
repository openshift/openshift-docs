= Running the {operator-name} checks

You can override the schedule for running the {operator-name} checks and run the checks immediately.

The {operator-name} automatically runs the checks every 8 hours. However, when the Operator starts, it runs the checks immediately. The Operator is started by the Cluster Storage Operator when the Cluster Storage Operator starts and determines that the cluster is running on vSphere. To run the checks immediately, you can scale the {operator-name} to `0` and back to `1` so that it restarts the {operator-name}.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Scale the Operator to `0`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deployment/vsphere-problem-detector-operator --replicas=0 \
    -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator
----
+
If the deployment does not scale to zero immediately, you can run the following command to wait for the pods to exit:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait pods -l name=vsphere-problem-detector-operator \
    --for=delete --timeout=5m -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator
----

. Scale the Operator back to `1`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deployment/vsphere-problem-detector-operator --replicas=1 \
    -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator
----

. Delete the old leader lock to speed up the new leader election for the Cluster Storage Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator \
    cm vsphere-problem-detector-lock
----

.Verification

* View the events or logs that are generated by the {operator-name}. Confirm that the events or logs have recent timestamps.
