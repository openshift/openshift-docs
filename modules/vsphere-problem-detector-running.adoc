= Running the {operator-name} checks

You can override the schedule for running the {operator-name} checks and run the checks immediately.

The {operator-name} automatically runs the checks every hour. However, when the Operator starts, it runs the checks immediately. The Operator is started by the Cluster Storage Operator when the Cluster Storage Operator starts and determines that the cluster is running on vSphere. To run the checks immediately, you can scale the {operator-name} to `0` and back to `1` so that it restarts the {operator-name}.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

* Scale the Operator to `0`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deployment/vsphere-problem-detector-operator --replicas=0 \
    -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator
----

.Verification

* Verify that the pods have restarted by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator get pod -l name=vsphere-problem-detector-operator -w
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

The `AGE` field must indicate that the pod is restarted.
