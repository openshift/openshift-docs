= Updating your mirror registry content

After you publish the initial image set to the mirror registry, you can use the oc-mirror plugin to keep your disconnected clusters updated.

Depending on your image set configuration, oc-mirror automatically detects newer releases of {product-title} and your selected Operators that have been released after you completed the initial mirror. It is recommended to run oc-mirror at regular intervals, for example in a nightly cron job, to receive product and security updates on a timely basis.

.Prerequisites

* You have used the oc-mirror plugin to mirror the initial image set to your mirror registry.
* You have access to the storage backend that was used for the initial execution of the oc-mirror plugin.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must use the same storage backend as the initial execution of oc-mirror for the same mirror registry. Do not delete or modify the metadata image that is generated by the oc-mirror plugin.
====

.Procedure

. If necessary, update your image set configuration file to pick up new {product-title} and Operator versions. See _Image set configuration examples_ for example mirroring use cases.

. Follow the same steps that you used to mirror your initial image set to the mirror registry. For instructions, see _Mirroring an image set in a partially disconnected environment_ or _Mirroring an image set in a fully disconnected environment_.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* You must provide the same storage backend so that only a differential image set is created and mirrored.
* If you specified a top-level namespace for the mirror registry during the initial image set creation, then you must use this same namespace every time you run the oc-mirror plugin for the same mirror registry.
====

. Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror.
