= Understanding the {sco} flow

The {sco} dynamically generates installation manifests based on user-defined cluster templates that are instantiated from the data in the `ClusterInstance` CR.
You can source the `ClusterInstance` CR from your Git repository through ArgoCD, or you can manually create it on the hub cluster directly or through external tools and workflows.

As shown in Figure 1., the process involves the following steps:

. Create one or more sets of cluster templates on the hub cluster.
. Create a `ClusterInstance` CR that references those cluster templates and supporting manifests.
. After the resources are created, the {sco} reconciles the `ClusterInstance` CR by populating the templated fields that are referenced in the CR.
. The {sco} validates and renders the installation manifests, then the Operator performs a dry run.
. If the dry run is successful, the manifests are created, then the underlying Operators consume and process the manifests.
. The installation begins.
. The {sco} continuously monitors for changes in the associated `ClusterDeployment` resource and updates the `ClusterInstance` CR's `status` field accordingly.
