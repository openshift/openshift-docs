= About the {run-once-operator}

{product-title} relies on run-once pods to perform tasks such as deploying a pod or performing a build. Run-once pods are pods that have a `RestartPolicy` of `Never` or `OnFailure`.

Cluster administrators can use the {run-once-operator} to force a limit on the time that those run-once pods can be active. After the time limit expires, the cluster will try to actively terminate those pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to run for an excessive amount of time.

To apply the run-once duration override from the {run-once-operator} to run-once pods, you must enable it on each applicable namespace.

If both the run-once pod and the {run-once-operator} have their `activeDeadlineSeconds` value set, the lower of the two values is used.
