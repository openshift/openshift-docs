= How file system overhead affects space for virtual machine disks

When you add a virtual machine disk to a persistent volume claim (PVC) that uses the `Filesystem` volume mode, you must ensure that there is enough space on the PVC for:

* The virtual machine disk.
* The space that the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) reserves for file system overhead, such as metadata.

By default, CDI reserves 5.5% of the PVC space for overhead, reducing the space available for virtual machine disks by that amount.

If a different value works better for your use case, you can configure the overhead value by editing the `CDI` object. You can change the value globally and you can specify values for specific storage classes.
