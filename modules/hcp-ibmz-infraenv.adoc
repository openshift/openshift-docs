[id="hcp-ibmz-infraenv_{context}"]
= Creating an InfraEnv resource for {hcp} on {ibm-z-title}

An `InfraEnv` is an environment where hosts that are booted with PXE images can join as agents. In this case, the agents are created in the same namespace as your hosted control plane.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file to contain the configuration. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: InfraEnv
metadata:
  name: <hosted_cluster_name>
  namespace: <hosted_control_plane_namespace>
spec:
  cpuArchitecture: s390x
  pullSecretRef:
    name: pull-secret
  sshAuthorizedKey: <ssh_public_key>
----

. Save the file as `infraenv-config.yaml`.

. Apply the configuration by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f infraenv-config.yaml
----

. To fetch the URL to download the PXE images, such as, `initrd.img`, `kernel.img`, or `rootfs.img`, which allows {ibm-z-title} machines to join as agents, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <hosted_control_plane_namespace> get InfraEnv <hosted_cluster_name> -o json
----
