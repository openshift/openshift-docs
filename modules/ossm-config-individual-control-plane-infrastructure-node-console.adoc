[id="ossm-config-individual-control-plane-infrastructure-node-console_{context}"]
= Configuring individual control plane components to run on infrastructure nodes using the web console

Perform this task if individual components deployed by the {SMProductShortName} control plane will run on infrastructure nodes. These deployed components include Istiod, the Ingress Gateway, and the Egress Gateway.

If the control plane will run on a worker node, skip this task.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator.
* You are logged in as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you are logged in as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the {SMProductName} Operator, and then click *Istio Service Mesh Control Plane*.

. Click the name of the control plane resource. For example, `basic`.

. Click *YAML*.

. Add the `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` fields to the `spec.runtime.components.pilot.pod` specification in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]

      pilot:
        pod:
          nodeSelector: <1>
            node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
          tolerations: <2>
          - effect: NoSchedule
            key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
            value: reserved
          - effect: NoExecute
            key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
            value: reserved
----
<1> Ensures that the `Istiod` pod is only scheduled on an infrastructure node.
<2> Ensures that the pod is accepted by the infrastructure node for execution.

. Add the `nodeSelector` and the `tolerations` fields to the `spec.gateways.ingress.runtime.pod` and `spec.gateways.egress.runtime.pod` specifications in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]

            value: reserved
          - effect: NoExecute
            key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
            value: reserved
    egress:
      runtime:
        pod:
          nodeSelector: <1>
            node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
          tolerations: <2>
          - effect: NoSchedule
            key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
            value: reserved
          - effect: NoExecute
            key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
            value: reserved
----
<1> Ensures that the gateway pod is only scheduled on an infrastructure node
<2> Ensures that the pod is accepted by the infrastructure node for execution.
