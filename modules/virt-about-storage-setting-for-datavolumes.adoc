= About storage settings for data volumes

Data volumes require a defined _access mode_ and _volume mode_ to be created in the web console.
These storage settings are configured by default with a `ReadWriteOnce` access mode and `Filesystem` volume mode.

You can modify these settings by editing the `kubevirt-storage-class-defaults` config map in the `openshift-cnv` namespace.
You can also add settings for other storage classes in order to create data volumes in the web console for different storage types.

[NOTE]
====
You must configure storage settings that are supported by the underlying storage.
====

All data volumes that you create in the web console use the default storage settings unless you specify a storage class that is also defined in the config map.

== Access modes

Data volumes support the following access modes:

* `ReadWriteOnce`: The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node. `ReadWriteOnce` has greater versatility and is the default setting.
* `ReadWriteMany`: The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes. `ReadWriteMany` is required for some features, such as live migration of virtual machines between nodes.

`ReadWriteMany` is recommended if the underlying storage supports it.

[id="virt-datavolumes-volume-modes_{context}"]
== Volume modes

The volume mode defines if a volume is intended to be used with a formatted file system or to remain in raw block state. Data volumes support the following volume modes:

* `Filesystem`: Creates a file system on the data volume. This is the default setting.
* `Block`: Creates a block data volume. Only use `Block` if the underlying storage supports it.
