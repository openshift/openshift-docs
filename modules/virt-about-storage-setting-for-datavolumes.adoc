= About storage settings for DataVolumes

DataVolumes require a defined _access mode_ and _volume mode_ to be created in the web console.
These storage settings are configured by default with a `ReadWriteOnce` access mode and `Filesystem` volume mode.

You can modify these settings by editing the `kubevirt-storage-class-defaults` ConfigMap in the `openshift-cnv` namespace.
You can also add settings for other storage classes in order to create DataVolumes in the web console for different storage types.

[NOTE]
====
You must configure storage settings that are supported by the underlying storage.
====

All DataVolumes that you create in the web console use the default storage settings unless you specify a storage class that is also defined in the ConfigMap.

[id="virt-datavolumes-access-modes_{context}"]
== Access modes

DataVolumes support the following access modes:

* `ReadWriteOnce`: The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node. `ReadWriteOnce` has greater versatility and is the default setting.
* `ReadWriteMany`: The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes. `ReadWriteMany` is required for some features, such as live migration of virtual machines between nodes.

`ReadWriteMany` is recommended if the underlying storage supports it.

[id="virt-datavolumes-volume-modes_{context}"]
== Volume modes

The volume mode defines if a volume is intended to be used with a formatted filesystem or to remain in raw block state. DataVolumes support the following volume modes:

* `Filesystem`: Creates a filesystem on the DataVolume. This is the default setting.
* `Block`: Creates a block DataVolume. Only use `Block` if the underlying storage supports it.
