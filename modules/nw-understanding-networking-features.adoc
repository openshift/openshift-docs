= Networking features

{product-title} offers several networking features and enhancements. These features and enhancements are listed as follows: 

* Ingress Operator and Route API: {product-title} includes an Ingress Operator that implements the Ingress Controller API. This component enables external access to cluster services by deploying and managing HAProxy-based Ingress Controllers that support advanced routing configurations and load balancing. {product-title} uses the Route API to translate upstream Ingress objects to route objects. Routes are specific to networking in {product-title}, but you can also use third-party Ingress Controllers.

* Enhanced security: {product-title} provides advanced network security features, such as the egress firewall and and the ingress node firewall.
+
** Egress firewall: The egress firewall controls and restricts outbound traffic from pods within the cluster. You can set rules to limit which external hosts or IP ranges with which pods can communicate.
** Ingress node firewall: The ingress node firewall is managed by the Ingress Firewall Operator and provides firewall rules at the node level. You can protect your nodes from threats by configuring this firewall on specific nodes within the cluster to filter incoming traffic before it reaches these nodes.

====
{product-title} also implements services, such as Network Policy, Admin Network Policy, and Security Context Constraints (SCC) to secure communication between pods and enforce access controls.

* Role-based access control (RBAC): {product-title} extends Kubernetes RBAC to provide more granular control over who can access and manage network resources. RBAC helps maintain security and compliance within the cluster.

* Multi-tenancy support: {product-title} offers multi-tenancy support to enable multiple users and teams to share the same cluster while keeping their resources isolated and secure.

* Hybrid and multi-cloud capabilities: {product-title} is designed to work seamlessly across on-premise, cloud, and multi-cloud environments. This flexibility allows organizations to deploy and manage containerized applications across different infrastructures.

* Observability and monitoring: {product-title} provides integrated observability and monitoring tools that help manage and troubleshoot network issues. These tools include role-based access to network metrics and logs.

* User-defined networks (UDN): UDNs allow administrators to customize network configurations. UDNs provide enhanced network isolation and IP address management.

* Egress IP: Egress IP allows you to assign a fixed source IP address for all egress traffic originating from pods within a namespace. Egress IP can improve security and access control by ensuring consistent source IP addresses for external services. For example, if a pod needs to access an external database that only allows traffic from specific IP adresses, you can configure an egress IP for that pod to meet the access requirements.

* Egress router: An egress router is a pod that acts as a bridge between the cluster and external systems. Egress routers allow traffic from pods to be routed through a specific IP address that is not used for any other purpose. With egress routers, you can enforce access controls or route traffic through a specific gateway.
