= Using tolerations to control the log store pod placement

You can control which nodes the log store pods runs on and prevent
other workloads from using those nodes by using tolerations on the pods.

You apply tolerations to the log store pods through the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR)
and apply taints to a node through the node specification. A taint on a node is a `key:value pair` that
instructs the node to repel all pods that do not tolerate the taint. Using a specific `key:value` pair
that is not on other pods ensures only the log store pods can run on that node.

By default, the log store pods have the following toleration:

[source,yaml]
----
tolerations:
- effect: "NoExecute"
  key: "node.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure"
  operator: "Exists"
----

.Prerequisites

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

.Procedure

. Use the following command to add a taint to a node where you want to schedule the cluster logging pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 elasticsearch=node:NoExecute
----
+
This example places a taint on `node1` that has key `elasticsearch`, value `node`, and taint effect `NoExecute`.
Nodes with the `NoExecute` effect schedule only pods that match the taint and remove existing pods
that do not match.

. Edit the `logstore` section of the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) to configure a toleration for the Elasticsearch pods:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  logStore:
    type: "elasticsearch"
    elasticsearch:
      nodeCount: 1
      tolerations:
      - key: "elasticsearch"  <1>
        operator: "Exists"  <2>
        effect: "NoExecute"  <3>
        tolerationSeconds: 6000  <4>
----
<1> Specify the key that you added to the node.
<2> Specify the `Exists` operator to require a taint with the key `elasticsearch` to be present on the Node.
<3> Specify the `NoExecute` effect.
<4> Optionally, specify the `tolerationSeconds` parameter to set how long a pod can remain bound to a node before being evicted.

This toleration matches the taint created by the `oc adm taint` command. A pod with this toleration could be scheduled onto `node1`.
