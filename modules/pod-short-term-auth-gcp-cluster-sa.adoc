= Creating an {product-title} service account for {gcp-short}

You create an {product-title} service account and annotate it to impersonate a {gcp-short} service account.

.Prerequisites

* Your {gcp-short} cluster uses {gcp-wid-short}.

* You have created a federated {gcp-short} service account.

* You have access to the {oc-first} as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You have access to the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) as a user with privileges to manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) and workload identity configurations.

.Procedure

. Create an {product-title} service account to use for {gcp-wid-short} pod authentication by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create serviceaccount <service_account_name>
----

. Annotate the service account with the identity provider and {gcp-short} service account to impersonate by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch serviceaccount <service_account_name> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"cloud.google.com/workload-identity-provider": "projects/<project_number>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/<identity_pool>/providers/<identity_provider>"}}}'
----
+
Replace `<project_number>`, `<identity_pool>`, and `<identity_provider>` with the values for your configuration.
+
[NOTE]
====
For `<project_number>`, specify the Google Cloud project number, not the project ID.
====

. Annotate the service account with the email address for the {gcp-short} service account by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch serviceaccount <service_account_name> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"cloud.google.com/service-account-email": "<service_account_email>"}}}'
----
+
Replace `<service_account_email>` with the email address for the {gcp-short} service account.
+
[TIP]
====
{gcp-short} service account email addresses typically use the format `<service_account_name>@<project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
====

. Annotate the service account to use the `direct` external credentials configuration injection mode by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch serviceaccount <service_account_name> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"cloud.google.com/injection-mode": "direct"}}}'
----
+
In this mode, the Workload Identity Federation webhook controller directly generates the {gcp-short} external credentials configuration and injects them into the pod.

. Use the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) to specify the permissions for the workload by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project_id> --member "<service_account_email>" --role "projects/<project_id>/roles/<role_for_workload_permissions>"
----
+
Replace `<role_for_workload_permissions>` with the role for the workload. 
Specify a role that grants the permissions that your workload requires.

.Verification

* To verify the service account configuration, inspect the `ServiceAccount` manifest by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get serviceaccount <service_account_name>
----
+
In the following example, the `service-a/app-x` {product-title} service account can impersonate a {gcp-short} service account called `app-x`:
+
