= Unexpected resource behavior

[role="_abstract"]
On clusters that support migrating resources between the Machine API and the Cluster API, users might experience unexpected resource behavior when updating the authoritative API.

Cause::

In addition to the two-way synchronization controller that manages changes related to migrating between authoritative APIs, other controllers can act on Machine API and Cluster API resources.
+
If you make other changes while updating the value of the `spec.authoritativeAPI` field, the synchronization controller might not be the first controller to act on the resource when you save the resource specification.

Consequence::

Because other controllers might process updates to other values before the synchronization controller processes the `spec.authoritativeAPI` field update, changing other values can cause unexpected behavior.
+
For example, if you increase the number of replicas in a machine set specification while updating the value of the `spec.authoritativeAPI` field, the machine set might create machines with the unintended authoritative API.

Workaround::

Do not change other values when you update the value of the `spec.authoritativeAPI` field.
