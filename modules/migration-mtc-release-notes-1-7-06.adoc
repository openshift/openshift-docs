== New features

.Implement proposed changes for DVM support with PSA in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12
With the incoming enforcement of Pod Security Admission (PSA) in {OCP} 4.12 the default pod would run with a `restricted` profile. This `restricted` profile would mean workloads to migrate would be in violation of this policy and no longer work as of now. The following enhancement outlines the changes that would be required to remain compatible with OCP 4.12. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIG-1240[*MIG-1240*])
