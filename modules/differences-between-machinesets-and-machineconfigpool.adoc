= Understanding the difference between MachineSets and the MachineConfigPool

MachineSets describe {product-title} nodes with respect to the cloud or machine
provider.

The MachineConfigPool allows MachineConfigController components to define and
provide the status of machines in the context of upgrades.

The MachineConfigPool allows users to configure how upgrades are rolled out to the
{product-title} nodes in the MachineConfigPool.

NodeSelector can be replaced with a reference to MachineSets.
