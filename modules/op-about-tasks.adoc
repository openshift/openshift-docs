= Tasks

_Tasks_ are the building blocks of a Pipeline and consist of sequentially executed Steps. Tasks are reusable and can be used in multiple Pipelines.

_Steps_ are a series of commands that achieve a specific goal, such as building an image. Every Task runs as a pod, and each Step runs as a container within that pod. Because Steps run within the same pod, they can access the same volumes for caching files, config maps, and secrets.

The following example shows the `apply-manifests` Task.
