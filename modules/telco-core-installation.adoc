= Installation

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
{rds-caps} clusters can be installed using the Agent Based Installer (ABI). This method allows users to install {product-title} on bare-metal servers without requiring additional servers or VMs for managing the installation.

Limits and requirements::
* Disconnected installation requires a reachable registry with all required content mirrored.

Engineering considerations::
* Networking configuration should be applied as an `NMState` custom resource (CR) during installation in preference to Day 2 configuration with the NMState Operator.
