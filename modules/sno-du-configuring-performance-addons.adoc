= Configuring the Node Tuning Operator

This is a key configuration for the single node distributed unit (DU). Many of the real-time capabilities and service assurance are configured here.

.Procedure

* Configure the performance profile using the following example:

<1> Set the isolated CPUs. Ensure all of the HT pairs match.
<2> Set the reserved CPUs.  In this case, a hyperthreaded pair is allocated on NUMA 0 and a pair on NUMA 1.
<3> Set the huge page size.
<4> Set the huge page number.
<5> Set to `true` to isolate the CPUs from networking interrupts.
<6> Set to `true` to install the real-time Linux kernel.
