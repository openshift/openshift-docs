= Configuring the Performance Addon Operator

This is a key configuration for the single node distributed unit (DU).
Many of the real time capabilities and service assurance is configured here.

.Procedure

* Configure the performance addons using the following example:

<1> Set the isolated CPUs. Ensure all of the HT pairs match.
<2> Set the reserved CPUs.  In this case, a hyperthreaded pair was allocated on NUMA 0 and a pair on NUMA 1.
<3> Set the huge page size.
<4> Set the huge page number.
<5> This setting isolates the CPUs from networking interrupts.
<6> This installs the real-time Linux kernel.
