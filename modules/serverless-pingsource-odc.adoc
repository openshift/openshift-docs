= Creating a ping source by using the web console

After Knative Eventing is installed on your cluster, you can create a ping source by using the web console. Using the {ocp-product-title} web console provides a streamlined and intuitive user interface to create an event source.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console.
* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Serving and Knative Eventing are installed on the cluster.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.

.Procedure

. To verify that the ping source is working, create a simple Knative
service that dumps incoming messages to the logs of the service.

.. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to *+Add* -> *YAML*.
.. Copy the example YAML:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/openshift-knative/showcase
----
.. Click *Create*.

. Create a ping source in the same namespace as the service created in the previous step, or any other sink that you want to send events to.

.. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to *+Add* -> *Event Source*. The  *Event Sources* page is displayed.
.. Optional: If you have multiple providers for your event sources, select the required provider from the *Providers* list to filter the available event sources from the provider.
.. Select *Ping Source* and then click *Create Event Source*. The *Create Event Source* page is displayed.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can configure the *PingSource* settings by using the *Form view* or *YAML view* and can switch between the views. The data is persisted when switching between the views.
====
.. Enter a value for *Schedule*. In this example, the value is `*/2 * * * *`, which creates a PingSource that sends a message every two minutes.
.. Optional: You can enter a value for *Data*, which is the message payload.
.. In the *Target* section, select your event sink. This can be either a *Resource* or a *URI*:
... Select *Resource* to use a channel, broker, or service as an event sink for the event source. In this example, the `event-display` service created in the previous step is used as the target *Resource*.
... Select *URI* to specify a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) where the events are routed to.
.. Click *Create*.

.Verification

You can verify that the ping source was created and is connected to the sink by viewing the *Topology* page.

. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to *Topology*.
. View the ping source and sink.

. View the event-display service in the web browser. You should see the ping source events in the web UI.
