= Creating a PingSource using the Developer Perspective

You can create and verify a basic PingSource from the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites
To create a PingSource using the *Developer* perspective, ensure that:

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Serving, and Knative Eventing are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* You have logged in to the web console.
* You are in the *Developer* perspective.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

.Procedure

. To verify that the PingSource is working, create a simple Knative
service that dumps incoming messages to the logs of the service.
.. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to *+Add* -> *YAML*.
.. Copy the example YAML:
+

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:latest
----

.. Click *Create*.

. Create a PingSource in the same namespace as the service created in the previous step, or any other sink that you want to send events to.
.. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to *+Add* -> *Event Source*.
.. Select *Ping Source*.
.. Enter a value for *Schedule*. In this example, the value is `*/2 * * * *`, which creates a PingSource that sends a message every two minutes.
.. Optional: You can enter a value for *Data*, which is the message payload.
.. Select a *Sink*. This can be either a *Resource* or a *URI*. In this example, the `event-display` service created in the previous step is used as the *Resource* sink.
.. Click *Create*.

.Verfication steps

You can verify that the PingSource was created and is connected to the sink by viewing the *Topology* page.

. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to *Topology*.
. View the PingSource and sink.
