= Uninstalling the DAS Operator using the CLI

You can uninstall the Dynamic Accelerator Slicer (DAS) Operator using the OpenShift CLI.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* The DAS Operator is installed in your cluster.

.Procedure

. List the installed operators to find the DAS Operator subscription:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get subscriptions -n das-operator
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME           PACKAGE        SOURCE             CHANNEL
das-operator   das-operator   redhat-operators   stable
----

. Delete the subscription:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete subscription das-operator -n das-operator
----

. List and delete the cluster service version (CSV):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csv -n das-operator
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete csv <csv-name> -n das-operator
----

. Remove the operator group:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete operatorgroup das-operator -n das-operator
----

. Delete any remaining `AllocationClaim` resources:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete allocationclaims --all -n das-operator
----

. Remove the DAS Operator namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete namespace das-operator
----

.Verification

. Verify that the DAS Operator resources have been removed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get namespace das-operator
----
+
The command should return an error indicating that the namespace is not found.

. Verify that no `AllocationClaim` custom resource definitions remain:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get crd | grep allocationclaim
----

[WARNING]
====
Uninstalling the DAS Operator will remove all GPU slice allocations and may cause running workloads that depend on GPU slices to fail. Ensure that no critical workloads are using GPU slices before proceeding with the uninstallation.
