= Configuring the monitoring stack

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
In {product-title} {product-version}, you can configure the monitoring stack using the `cluster-monitoring-config` or `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` objects. Config maps configure the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO), which in turn configures the components of the stack.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
In {product-title}, you can configure the stack that monitors workloads for user-defined projects by using the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object. Config maps configure the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO), which in turn configures the components of the stack.

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* *If you are configuring core {product-title} monitoring components*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* The `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object exists. This object is created by default when the cluster is created.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the `ConfigMap` object.
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
** *To configure core {product-title} monitoring components*:
.. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

.. Add your configuration under `data/config.yaml` as a key-value pair `<component_name>:{nbsp}<component_configuration>`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      <configuration_for_the_component>
----
+
Substitute `<component>` and `<configuration_for_the_component>` accordingly.
+
The following example `ConfigMap` object configures a persistent volume claim (PVC) for Prometheus. This relates to the Prometheus instance that monitors core {product-title} components only:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s: <1>
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: fast
          volumeMode: Filesystem
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 40Gi
----
<1> Defines the Prometheus component and the subsequent lines define its configuration.

** *To configure components that monitor user-defined projects*:
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
.. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

.. Add your configuration under `data/config.yaml` as a key-value pair `<component_name>:{nbsp}<component_configuration>`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      <configuration_for_the_component>
----
+
Substitute `<component>` and `<configuration_for_the_component>` accordingly.
+
The following example `ConfigMap` object configures a data retention period and minimum container resource requests for Prometheus. This relates to the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects only:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus: <1>
      retention: 24h <2>
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 200m <3>
          memory: 2Gi <4>
----
<1> Defines the Prometheus component and the subsequent lines define its configuration.
<2> Configures a twenty-four hour data retention period for the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects.
<3> Defines a minimum resource request of 200 millicores for the Prometheus container.
<4> Defines a minimum pod resource request of 2 GiB of memory for the Prometheus container.

[NOTE]
====
The Prometheus config map component is called `prometheusK8s` in the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object and `prometheus` in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
====
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

. Save the file to apply the changes to the `ConfigMap` object. The pods affected by the new configuration are restarted automatically.
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to a monitoring config map, the pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
