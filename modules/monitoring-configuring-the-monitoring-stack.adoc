= Configuring the monitoring stack

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can configure the monitoring stack using the `cluster-monitoring-config` or `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMaps. ConfigMaps configure the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO), which in turn configures the components of the stack.

.Prerequisites

* *If you are configuring core {product-title} monitoring components*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the ConfigMap.
** *To configure core {product-title} monitoring components*:
.. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

.. Add your configuration under `data/config.yaml` as a key-value pair `<component_name>:{nbsp}<component_configuration>`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      <configuration_for_the_component>
----
+
Substitute `<component>` and `<configuration_for_the_component>` accordingly.
+
The following example ConfigMap configures a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) for Prometheus. This relates to the Prometheus instance that monitors core {product-title} components only:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s: <1>
      volumeClaimTemplate:
       spec:
         storageClassName: fast
         volumeMode: Filesystem
         resources:
           requests:
             storage: 40Gi
----
<1> Defines the Prometheus component and the subsequent lines define its configuration.

** *To configure components that monitor user-defined projects*:
.. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

.. Add your configuration under `data/config.yaml` as a key-value pair `<component_name>:{nbsp}<component_configuration>`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      <configuration_for_the_component>
----
+
Substitute `<component>` and `<configuration_for_the_component>` accordingly.
+
The following example ConfigMap configures a data retention period and minimum container resource requests for Prometheus. This relates to the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects only:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus: <1>
      retention: 24h <2>
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 200m <3>
          memory: 2Gi <4>
----
<1> Defines the Prometheus component and the subsequent lines define its configuration.
<2> Configures a twenty-four hour data retention period for the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects.
<3> Defines a minimum resource request of 200 millicores for the Prometheus container.
<4> Defines a minimum pod resource request of 2 GiB of memory for the Prometheus container.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Prometheus ConfigMap component is called `prometheusK8s` in the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap and `prometheus` in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap.
====

. Save the file to apply the changes to the ConfigMap. The pods affected by the new configuration are restarted automatically.
+
[NOTE]
====
Configurations applied to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap are not activated unless a cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to a monitoring ConfigMap, the pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
