= Migrating consumer applications to use HTTP transport for PTP or bare-metal events

If you have previously deployed PTP or bare-metal events consumer applications, you need to update the applications to use HTTP message transport.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have updated the PTP Operator or {redfish-operator} to version 4.13+ which uses HTTP transport by default.

.Procedure

. Update your events consumer application to use HTTP transport.
Set the `http-event-publishers` variable for the cloud event sidecar deployment.
+
For example, in a cluster with PTP events configured, the following YAML snippet illustrates a cloud event sidecar deployment:
+
[source,yaml]
----
containers:
  - name: cloud-event-sidecar
    image: cloud-event-sidecar
    args:
      - "--metrics-addr=127.0.0.1:9091"
      - "--store-path=/store"
      - "--transport-host=consumer-events-subscription-service.cloud-events.svc.cluster.local:9043"
      - "--http-event-publishers=ptp-event-publisher-service-NODE_NAME.openshift-ptp.svc.cluster.local:9043" <1>
      - "--api-port=8089"
----
<1> The PTP Operator automatically resolves `NODE_NAME` to the host that is generating the PTP events.
For example, `compute-1.example.com`.
+
In a cluster with bare-metal events configured, set the `http-event-publishers` field to `hw-event-publisher-service.openshift-bare-metal-events.svc.cluster.local:9043` in the cloud event sidecar deployment CR.

. Deploy the `consumer-events-subscription-service` service alongside the events consumer application.
For example:
+
[source,yaml]

kind: Service
