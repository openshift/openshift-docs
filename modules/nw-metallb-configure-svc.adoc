= Configuring a service with MetalLB

You can configure a load-balancing service to use an external IP address from an address pool.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Install the MetalLB Operator and start MetalLB.

* Configure at least one address pool.

* Configure your network to route traffic from the clients to the host network for the cluster.

.Procedure

. Create a `<service_name>.yaml` file. In the file, ensure that the `spec.type` field is set to `LoadBalancer`.
+
Refer to the examples for information about how to request the external IP address that MetalLB assigns to the service.

. Create the service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <service_name>.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
service/<service_name> created
----

.Verification

* Describe the service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe service <service_name>
----
+

<.> The annotation is present if you request an IP address from a specific pool.
<.> The service type must indicate `LoadBalancer`.
<.> The load-balancer ingress field indicates the external IP address if the service is assigned correctly.
<.> The events field indicates the node name that is assigned to announce the external IP address.
If you experience an error, the events field indicates the reason for the error.
