[id="ocp-release-notes-scale-and-perform_{context}"]
== Scalability and performance

Pod-level IRQ affinity introduces housekeeping mode::
+
For latency-sensitive workloads, you can now configure the `irq-load-balancing.crio.io` pod annotation to use `housekeeping` mode. This mode enables a subset of pinned CPUs to handle system interrupts while isolating the remaining pinned CPUs for latency-sensitive workloads. This reduces the overall CPU footprint by eliminating the need for dedicated housekeeping CPUs for IRQ handling. When you configure `housekeeping` mode, the first pinned CPU and its thread siblings handle interrupts for the system.
+
For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-provisioning-low-latency-workloads.adoc#cnf-disabling-interrupt-processing-for-individual-pods_cnf-provisioning-low-latency[Configuring interrupt processing for individual pods].
