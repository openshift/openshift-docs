Installing a cluster on {azure-full} uses Marketplace images by default::
+
As of this update, the {product-title} installation program uses Marketplace images by default when installing a cluster on {azure-short}. This speeds up the installation by removing the need to upload a virtual hard disk to {azure-short} and create an image during installation. This feature is not supported on Azure Stack Hub, or for {azure-short} installations that use Confidential VMs.

Managing your own firewall rules when installing a cluster on {gcp-short} into an existing VPC::
+
As of this update, you can manage your own firewall rules when installing a cluster on {gcp-short} into an existing VPC by enabling the `firewallRulesManagement` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file. You can limit the permissions that you grant to the installation program by managing your own firewall rules.
+
For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.adoc#installation-gcp-user-managed-firewall-rules_installing-gcp-account[Managing your own firewall rules].

Throughput customization for {aws-full} gp3 drives::
+
With this update, you can now customize the maximum throughput for gp3 `rootVolume` drives when installing a cluster on {aws-full}. This customization is set by modifying the `compute.platform.aws.rootVolume.throughput` or `controlPlane.platform.aws.rootVolume.throughput` parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file.
+
For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installation-config-parameters-aws.adoc#installation-configuration-parameters-optional-aws_installation-config-parameters-aws[Optional AWS configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-release-notes-monitoring_{context}"]
== Monitoring

// This should be left for a little while to get users used to the fact that they will find release notes at a new place.
[NOTE]
====
The monitoring stack documentation is now available as a separate documentation set. The {product-version} monitoring release notes are available at link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/monitoring_stack_for_red_hat_openshift/{product-version}/html-single/release_notes_for_openshift_monitoring[Release notes for OpenShift monitoring].

== Networking

Applying unassisted holdover for boundary clocks and time synchronous clocks::
+
{product-title} 4.20 introduced unassisted holdover for boundary clocks and time synchronous clocks as a Technology Preview feature. This feature is now Generally Available (GA).
+
For more information, see xref:../networking/advanced_networking/ptp/configuring-ptp.adoc[Applying unassisted holdover for boundary clocks and time slave clocks].

SR-IOV Operator supports ARM architecture::
+
The Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Operator can now communicate with ARM hardware. You can now complete tasks such as configure network cards that are already plugged into an ARM server and use these cards in your applications. For instructions on how to search for ARM hardware that the SR-IOV Operator supports, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc[About Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) hardware networks].

[id="ocp-release-notes-ocp-cli_{context}"]
== OpenShift CLI (oc)

Signature mirroring enabled by default for oc-mirror v2::
With this update, the oc-mirror v2 plugin mirrors image signatures by default. This enhancement ensures that image integrity is automatically preserved during the mirroring process without requiring additional configuration. If your environment does not require signature validation, you can manually disable this feature by using the `--remove-signatures` command-line flag. For more information, see xref:../disconnected/about-installing-oc-mirror-v2.adoc#oc-mirror-signature-mirroring_about-installing-oc-mirror-v2[Disabling signature mirroring for oc-mirror plugin v2].

[id="ocp-release-notes-scale-and-perform_{context}"]
== Scalability and performance

Pod-level IRQ affinity introduces housekeeping mode::
+
For latency-sensitive workloads, you can now configure the `irq-load-balancing.crio.io` pod annotation to use `housekeeping` mode. This mode enables a subset of pinned CPUs to handle system interrupts while isolating the remaining pinned CPUs for latency-sensitive workloads. This reduces the overall CPU footprint by eliminating the need for dedicated housekeeping CPUs for IRQ handling. When you configure `housekeeping` mode, the first pinned CPU and its thread siblings handle interrupts for the system.
+
