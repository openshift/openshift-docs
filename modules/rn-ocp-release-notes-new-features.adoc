[id="ocp-release-notes-auth_{context}"]
== Authentication and authorization

Using the Azure `kubelogin` plugin for direct authentication with Microsoft Entra ID::
Red{nbsp}Hat tested authenticating to {product-title} by using the Azure `kubelogin` plugin. This validation covers environments where Microsoft Entra ID is configured as the external OIDC provider for direct authentication. The following login modes for `kubelogin` were tested:
+
--
* Device code grant
* Service principal authentication
* Interactive web browser flow
--
+
For more information, see xref:../authentication/external-auth.adoc#external-auth[Enabling direct authentication with an external OIDC identity provider].

[id="ocp-release-notes-auto_{context}"]
== Autoscaling

Network policy support for Autoscaling Operators::
+
The following Operators now have multiple network policies that control network traffic to and from the Operator and operand pods. These policies restrict traffic to only traffic that is explicitly allowed or required.

* Cluster Resource Override Operator
* Cluster Autoscaler
* Vertical Pod Autoscaler
* Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

Applying VPA recommendations without pod re-creation::
+
You can now configure a Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA) in the `InPlaceOrRecreate` mode. In this mode, the VPA attempts to apply the recommended updates without re-creating pods. If the VPA is unable to update the pods in place, the VPA falls back to re-creating the pods. For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-vertical-autoscaler.adoc#nodes-pods-vertical-autoscaler-modes_nodes-pods-vertical-autoscaler[About the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator modes].

Cluster Autoscaler Operator can now cordon nodes before removing the node::
+
By default, when the Cluster Autoscaler Operator removes a node, it does not cordon the node when draining the pods from the node. You can configure the Operator to cordon the node before draining and moving the pods. For more information, see xref:../machine_management/applying-autoscaling.adoc#cluster-autoscaler-about_applying-autoscaling[About the cluster autoscaler].

== Installation and update

Configuring {image-mode-os-lower} during installation is now supported::
+
You can now apply a custom layered image to your nodes during {product-title} installation. For more information, see xref:../machine_configuration/mco-coreos-layering.adoc#coreos-layering-install-time_mco-coreos-layering[Applying a custom layered image during OpenShift Container Platform installation].

Installing a cluster on {gcp-short} with a user-provisioned DNS is generally available::
+
You can enable a user-provisioned domain name server (DNS) instead of the default cluster-provisioned DNS solution. For example, your organization’s security policies might not allow the use of public DNS services such as {gcp-full} DNS. You can manage your DNS only for the IP addresses of the API and Ingress servers. If you use this feature, you must provide your own DNS solution that includes records for `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` and `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`.
+
Installing a cluster on {gcp-short} with a user-provisioned DNS was introduced in {product-title} 4.19 with Technology Preview status. In {product-title} {product-version}, it is now generally available.
+
For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-restricted-networks-gcp-installer-provisioned.adoc#installation-gcp-enabling-user-managed-DNS_installing-restricted-networks-gcp-installer-provisioned[Enabling a user-managed DNS] and xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-restricted-networks-gcp-installer-provisioned.adoc#installation-gcp-provisioning-own-dns-records_installing-restricted-networks-gcp-installer-provisioned[Provisioning your own DNS records].

Installing a cluster on {azure-full} uses Marketplace images by default::
+
As of this update, the {product-title} installation program uses Marketplace images by default when installing a cluster on {azure-short}. This speeds up the installation by removing the need to upload a virtual hard disk to {azure-short} and create an image during installation. This feature is not supported on Azure Stack Hub, or for {azure-short} installations that use Confidential VMs.

Managing your own firewall rules when installing a cluster on {gcp-short} into an existing VPC::
+
As of this update, you can manage your own firewall rules when installing a cluster on {gcp-short} into an existing VPC by enabling the `firewallRulesManagement` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file. You can limit the permissions that you grant to the installation program by managing your own firewall rules.
+
For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.adoc#installation-gcp-user-managed-firewall-rules_installing-gcp-account[Managing your own firewall rules].

Throughput customization for {aws-full} gp3 drives::
+
With this update, you can now customize the maximum throughput for gp3 `rootVolume` drives when installing a cluster on {aws-full}. This customization is set by modifying the `compute.platform.aws.rootVolume.throughput` or `controlPlane.platform.aws.rootVolume.throughput` parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file.
+
For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installation-config-parameters-aws.adoc#installation-configuration-parameters-optional-aws_installation-config-parameters-aws[Optional AWS configuration parameters].

Support for {vmw-full} Foundation 9 and VMware Cloud Foundation 9::
+
You can now install {product-title} on {vmw-full} Foundation (VVF) 9 and VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.

[NOTE]
====
The following additional VCF and VVF components are outside the scope of Red Hat support:

* Management: VCF Operations, VCF Automation, VCF Fleet Management, and VCF Identity Broker.
* Networking: VMware NSX Container Plugin (NCP).
* Migration: VMware HCX.
====

Support for installing {product-title} on {oda-first}::
+
With this update, you can install a cluster on {oda} using the {ai-full}.
+
For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_oda/installing-oda-assisted.adoc#installing-oda-assisted-installer[Installing a cluster on {oda} by using the {ai-full}].


Installing a cluster on {azure-first} using NAT Gateways::
+
With this update, you can install a cluster on {azure-short} using NAT Gateways as your outbound routing strategy. NAT Gateways can minimize the risk of SNAT port exhaustion that can occur with other outbound routing strategies. You can configure NAT Gateways using the `platform.azure.outboundType` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file.
+
For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_azure/installation-config-parameters-azure.adoc#installation-configuration-parameters-additional-azure_installation-config-parameters-azure[Additional Azure configuration parameters].

Installing a cluster using {gcp-first} private and restricted API endpoints::
+
With this release, you can use {gcp-first} Private Service Connect (PSC) endpoints when installing your {product-title} cluster so that your installation meets your organization's strict regulatory policies.
+

Dell iDRAC10 supported for bare metal installation using Redfish virtual media::
+
Dell iDRAC10 versions 1.20.25.00, 1.20.60.50, and 1.20.70.50 have been tested and verified to work for installer-provisioned {product-title} clusters deployed by using Redfish virtual media. iDRAC10 has not been tested with installations that use a provisioning network. For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/ipi/ipi-install-prerequisites.adoc#ipi-install-firmware-requirements-for-installing-with-virtual-media_ipi-install-prerequisites[Firmware requirements for installing with virtual media].

Providing a local or self-signed CA certificate for Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs) when installing a cluster on bare metal::
+
With this update, you can provide your own local or self-signed CA certificate to secure communication with BMCs when installing a cluster on bare metal. You can configure this certificate using the `platform.baremetal.bmcCACert` parameter in the install-config.yaml file. If you do not use a trusted CA certificate, you can secure BMC communication by providing your own CA certificate. You can also configure a local or self-signed CA certificate after installation, whether the cluster was installed with a different BMC CA certificate or with no BMC CA certificate.
+
For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.adoc#additional-install-config-parameters_ipi-install-installation-workflow[Additional installation configuration parameters] and xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/bare-metal-postinstallation-configuration.adoc#bare-metal-self-signed-cert-post-install_bare-metal-postinstallation-configuration[Configuring a local or self-signed Baseboard Management Controller CA certificate].
Running firmware upgrades for hosts in deployed bare metal clusters (Generally Available)::
+
For hosts in deployed bare metal clusters, you can update firmware attributes and the firmware image. As a result, you can run firmware upgrades and update BIOS settings for hosts that are already provisioned without fully deprovisioning them. Performing a live update to the `HostFirmwareComponents`, `HostFirmareSettings`, or  `HostUpdatePolicy` resource can be a destructive and destabilizing action. Perform these updates only after careful consideration.
+
This feature was introduced in {product-title} 4.18 with Technology Preview status. This feature is now supported as generally available in {product-title} {product-version}.
+
For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/bare-metal-postinstallation-configuration.adoc#bmo-performing-a-live-update-to-the-hostfirmwaresettings-resource_bare-metal-postinstallation-configuration[Performing a live update to the HostFirmwareSettings resource],

For more information, see xref:../machine_configuration/index.adoc#checking-mco-node-status_machine-config-overview[About node status during updates].

{image-mode-os-caps} status reporting improvements (Technology preview)::
+
The `oc describe machineconfigpool <mcp_name>` output,  as a Technology Preview feature, now includes the following fields that report the status of machine config updates when {image-mode-os-lower} is enabled:
+
* `Spec.ConfigImage.DesiredImage`. This is the desired image for that node.
* `Status.ConfigImage.CurrentImage`. This is the current image on that node.
* `Status.Conditions.ImagePulledFromRegistry`. This reports whether an image is able to pull correctly in an image mode update.

For more information, see xref:../machine_configuration/index.adoc#checking-mco-node-status_machine-config-overview[About node status during updates].

Boot image management for control plane nodes is now supported (Technology Preview)::
+
Updating boot images is now supported as a Technology Preview feature for VMware vSphere clusters. This feature allows you to configure your cluster to update the node boot image whenever you update your cluster. Previously, updating boot images was supported for worker nodes. For more information, see xref:../machine_configuration/mco-update-boot-images.adoc#mco-update-boot-images[Boot image management].

Overriding storage or partition setup (Technology preview)::
+
You can now use a `MachineConfig` object to change the installed disk partition schema, file systems, and RAID configurations for new nodes. Previously, for security reasons, you were blocked from changing these configurations from what was established during the cluster installation. For more information, see "Overriding storage and partition setup".

[id="ocp-release-notes-nodes_{context}"]
== Nodes

Allocating specific GPUs to pods (DRA) is now generally available::
+
Attribute-Based GPU Allocation, which allows pods to request GPUs based on specific device attributes by using a Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) driver, is now generally available. For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-allocate-dra.adoc#nodes-pods-allocate-dra[Allocating GPUs to Pods].

The default `openshift` cluster image policy is now generally available::
+
The default `openshift` cluster image policy is now generally available and active by default. For more information, see xref:../nodes/nodes-sigstore-using.adoc#nodes-sigstore-using[Manage secure signatures with sigstore].
+
If your {product-title} 4.20 or earlier cluster has a cluster image policy named `openshift`, the upgrade to {product-title} marks the cluster as not updatable (`Upgradeable=False`) because of this default `openshift` cluster image policy. You must remove your `openshift` cluster image policy to clear the `Upgradeable=False` condition and proceed with the update. You can optionally create your own cluster image policy with a different name before removing your `openshift` cluster image policy.

Support for sigstore BYOPKI is now generally available::
+
Support for using a certificate from your own public key infrastructure as a Sigstore root of trust is now generally available. For more information, see xref:../nodes/nodes-sigstore-using.adoc#nodes-sigstore-using[Manage secure signatures with sigstore].

Automatically calculate and apply CPU and memory resources for system components::
+
{product-title} now automatically calculates and reserves a portion of the CPU and memory resources for use by the underlying node and system components. Previously, you needed to enable the feature by creating a `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) with the `autoSizingReserved: true` parameter. For clusters updated to {product-title} 4.21, you can enable the feature by deleting the `50-worker-auto-sizing-disabled` machine config. After you delete the machine config, the nodes reboot with the new resource settings. If you manually configured system reserved CPU or memory resources, these settings remain upon update and do not change. For more information on this new feature, see xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-resources-configuring.adoc#nodes-nodes-resources-configuring-auto_nodes-nodes-resources-configuring[Automatically allocating resources for nodes].

[id="ocp-release-notes-ocp-cli_{context}"]
== OpenShift CLI (oc)

Signature mirroring enabled by default for oc-mirror v2::
With this update, the oc-mirror v2 plugin mirrors image signatures by default. This enhancement ensures that image integrity is automatically preserved during the mirroring process without requiring additional configuration. If your environment does not require signature validation, you can manually disable this feature by using the `--remove-signatures` command-line flag. For more information, see xref:../disconnected/about-installing-oc-mirror-v2.adoc#oc-mirror-signature-mirroring_about-installing-oc-mirror-v2[Disabling signature mirroring for oc-mirror plugin v2].

== Scalability and performance

Pod-level IRQ affinity introduces housekeeping mode::
+
For latency-sensitive workloads, you can now configure the `irq-load-balancing.crio.io` pod annotation to use `housekeeping` mode. This mode enables a subset of pinned CPUs to handle system interrupts while isolating the remaining pinned CPUs for latency-sensitive workloads. This reduces the overall CPU footprint by eliminating the need for dedicated housekeeping CPUs for IRQ handling. When you configure `housekeeping` mode, the first pinned CPU and its thread siblings handle interrupts for the system.
+
