Detailed information.

Updated boot images for {azure-short} and {vmw-short} clusters promoted to GA:: 
+
Updated boot images has been promoted to GA for {azure-full} and {vmw-full} clusters. For more information, see "Updated boot images".

Configuring {image-mode-os-lower} during installation is now supported::
+
You can now apply a custom layered image to your nodes during OpenShift Container Platform installation.

{image-mode-os-lower} status reporting improvements status reporting improvements::
+
The output of the `oc get machineconfignodes` now contains an `ImageBuildDegraded` error that indicates if an {image-mode-os-lower} fails.

{image-mode-os-lower} status reporting improvements (Technology preview)::
+
The `oc describe mcp` output now includes the following fields that report the status of updates when {image-mode-os-lower} is enabled:
+
* `Spec.ConfigImage.DesiredImage`. This is the desired image annotation value that is currently a node annotation when on cluster image mode is enabled.
* `Status.ConfigImage.CurrentImage`. This is the current image annotation value that is currently a node annotation when on cluster image mode is enabled.
* `Status.Conditions[MachineConfigNodeImagePulledFromRegistry]`. This is a new condition that was added to track whether an image is able to pull correctly in an image mode update.

Updated boot images for control plane nodes is now supported (Technology Preview)::
+
Updated boot images is now supported as a Technology Preview feature for VMware vSphere clusters. This feature allows you configure your cluster to update the node boot image whenever you update your cluster. Previously, updating boot images was supported for worker nodes.

=======
Allocating specific GPUs to pods (DRA) is now generally available::
+
Attribute-Based GPU Allocation, which allows pods to request GPUs based on specific device attributes by using a Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) driver is now generally available. For more information, see "Allocating GPUs to Pods."

The default `openshift` cluster image policy is now generally available::
+
The default `openshift` cluster image policy is now generally available and active by default. For more information, see "Manage secure signatures with sigstore".
+
If your {product-title} 4.19 or earlier cluster has a cluster image policy named `openshift`, the upgrade to {product-title} marks the cluster as not updatable (`Upgradeable=False`) because of this default `openshift` cluster image policy. You must remove, recreate, and rename the conflicting cluster image policy to clear the `Upgradeable=False` condition and proceed with the update. For more information, see "Automatically allocating resources for nodes".

Support for sigstore BYOPKI is now generally available::
+
Support for using a certificate from your own public key infrastructure as a sigstore root of trust is now generally available. For more information, see "Manage secure signatures with sigstore".

The `autoSizingReserved` parameter is now enabled by default::
+
The `autoSizingReserved` parameter, which automatically determines and allocates the `system-reserved` resources on nodes, is now set to `true` by default. Previously, you needed to create a `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) to enable the feature. For more information, see "Automatically allocating resources for nodes".
