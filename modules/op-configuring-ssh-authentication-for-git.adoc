= Configuring SSH authentication for Git using a service account

[role="_abstract"]
For a pipeline to retrieve resources from repositories configured with SSH keys, you must configure the SSH-based authentication for that pipeline.

To configure SSH-based authentication for a pipeline, create an authentication secret with the SSH private key, associate this secret with a service account, and associate this service account with a `TaskRun` or `PipelineRun` resource.

.Procedure

. Generate an link:https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent[SSH private key], or copy an existing private key, which is usually available in the `~/.ssh/id_rsa` file.
. Create the YAML manifest for the secret in the `secret.yaml` file. In this manifest, set the value of `ssh-privatekey` to the content of the SSH private key file, and set the value of `known_hosts` to the content of the known hosts file.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ssh-key <1>
  annotations:
    tekton.dev/git-0: github.com
type: kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
stringData:
  ssh-privatekey: <2>
  known_hosts: <3>
----
<1> Name of the secret containing the SSH private key. In this example, `ssh-key`.
<2> The content of the SSH private key file.
<3> The content of the known hosts file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you omit the known hosts file, {pipelines-shortname} accepts the public key of any server.
====
+
. Optional: Specify a custom SSH port by adding `:<port_number>` to the end of the annotation value. For example, `tekton.dev/git-0: github.com:2222`.
. Create the YAML manifest for the service account in the `serviceaccount.yaml` file. In this manifest, associate the secret with the service account.

. In the `run.yaml` file, associate the service account with a task run or a pipeline run. Use one of the following examples:

<1> Name of the task run. In this example, `build-push-task-run-2`.
<2> Name of the service account. In this example, `build-bot`.
<3> Name of the task. In this example, `build-push`.

** To associate the service account with a pipeline run:
