= Enabling alerts on baseline violations in the network graph (2.0 preview)

You can configure {product-title-short} to detect anomalous network flows and trigger violations for traffic that is not in the baseline. This can help you determine if the network contains unwanted traffic before you block traffic with a network policy.

.Procedure

. Click the *Namespace* list and use the search field to locate a namespace or select individual namespaces.
. Click the *Deployments* list and use the search field to locate a deployment or select individual deployments to display in the network graph.
. In the network graph, click on a deployment to view the information panel.
. In the *Baseline* tab, you can view baseline flows. Use the *filter by entity name* field to further restrict the flows that are displayed.
. Toggle the *Alert on baseline violations* option.
* After you toggle the *Alert on baseline violations* option, anomalous network flows trigger violations.
* You can toggle the *Alert on baseline violations* option again to stop receiving violations for anomalous network flows.
