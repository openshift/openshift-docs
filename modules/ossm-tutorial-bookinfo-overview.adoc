= Bookinfo example application

The upstream Istio project has an example tutorial called https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo[Bookinfo], which is composed of four separate microservices used to demonstrate various Istio features. The Bookinfo application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and other information), and book reviews.

The Bookinfo application consists of these microservices:

* The `productpage` microservice calls the `details` and `reviews` microservices to populate the page.
* The `details` microservice contains book information.
* The `reviews` microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the `ratings` microservice.
* The `ratings` microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

There are three versions of the reviews microservice:

* Version v1 does not call the `ratings` Service.
* Version v2 calls the `ratings` Service and displays each rating as one to five black stars.
* Version v3 calls the `ratings` Service and displays each rating as one to five red stars.
