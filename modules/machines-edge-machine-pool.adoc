= The edge compute pool for AWS Local Zones

{product-title} 4.12 introduced a new compute pool, _edge_, that is designed for use in remote zones. The edge compute pool configuration is common between AWS Local Zone locations. However, due to the type and size limitations of resources like EC2 and EBS on Local Zone resources, the default instance type that is created can vary from the traditional worker pool.

The default Elastic Block Store (EBS) for Local Zone locations is `gp2`, which differs from the regular worker pool. The instance type used for each Local Zone on edge compute pool also might differ from worker pools, depending on the instance offerings on the zone.

The edge compute pool creates new labels that developers can use to deploy applications onto AWS Local Zone nodes. The new labels are:

* `node-role.kubernetes.io/edge=''`
* `machine.openshift.io/zone-type=local-zone`
* `machine.openshift.io/zone-group=$ZONE_GROUP_NAME`


By default, the system creates the edge compute pool manifests only if users add AWS Local Zone subnet IDs to the list `platform.aws.subnets`.

The edge compute pool's machine sets have a `NoSchedule taint` by default to prevent regular workloads from being spread out on those machines. Users can only run user workloads if the tolerations are defined on the pod spec. 

The following examples show `install-config.yaml` files that use the edge machine pool.
