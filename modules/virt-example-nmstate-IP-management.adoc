[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management_{context}"]
= Examples: IP management

The following example configuration snippets show different methods of IP management.

These examples use the `ethernet` interface type to simplify the example while showing the related context in the policy configuration. These IP management examples can be used with the other interface types.

[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-static_{context}"]
== Static

The following snippet statically configures an IP address on the Ethernet interface:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: static IP on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: false
        address:
        - ip: 192.168.122.250 <1>
          prefix-length: 24
        enabled: true
# ...
----
<1> Replace this value with the static IP address for the interface.

[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-no-ip_{context}"]
== No IP address

The following snippet ensures that the interface has no IP address:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: No IP on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        enabled: false
# ...
----

[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-dhcp_{context}"]
== Dynamic host configuration

The following snippet configures an Ethernet interface that uses a dynamic IP address, gateway address, and DNS:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: DHCP on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        enabled: true
# ...
----

The following snippet configures an Ethernet interface that uses a dynamic IP address but does not use a dynamic gateway address or DNS:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: DHCP without gateway or DNS on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        auto-gateway: false
        auto-dns: false
        enabled: true
# ...
----

[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-dns_{context}"]
== DNS

By default, the `nmstate` API stores DNS values globally as against storing them in a network interface. For certain situations, you must configure a network interface to store DNS values.

[TIP]
====
Setting a DNS configuration is comparable to modifying the `/etc/resolv.conf` file.
====

To define a DNS configuration for a network interface, you must initially specify the `dns-resolver` section in the network interface's YAML configuration file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot use `br-ex` bridge, an OVNKubernetes-managed Open vSwitch bridge, as the interface when configuring DNS resolvers unless you manually configured a customized `br-ex` bridge.

For more information, see "Creating a manifest object that includes a customized br-ex bridge" in the _Deploying installer-provisioned clusters on bare metal_ document or the _Installing a user-provisioned cluster on bare metal_ document.
====

The following example shows a default situation that stores DNS values globally:

* Configure a static DNS without a network interface. Note that when updating the `/etc/resolv.conf` file on a host node, you do not need to specify an interface, IPv4 or IPv6, in the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) manifest.

# ...
----

The following examples show situations that require configuring a network interface to store DNS values:

* If you want to rank a static DNS name server over a dynamic DNS name server, define the interface that runs either the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or the IPv6 Autoconfiguration (`autoconf`) mechanism in the network interface YAML configuration file.
+

interfaces:
  - name: eth1
    type: ethernet
    state: up
    ipv4:
      enabled: true
      dhcp: true
      auto-dns: true
# ...
----

* If you need to configure a network interface to store DNS values instead of adopting the default method, which uses the `nmstate` API to store DNS values globally, you can set static DNS values and static IP addresses in the network interface YAML file.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Storing DNS values at the network interface level might cause name resolution issues after you attach the interface to network components, such as an Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge, a Linux bridge, or a bond.

* If you want to set static DNS search domains and dynamic DNS name servers for your network interface, define the dynamic interface that runs either the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or the IPv6 Autoconfiguration (`autoconf`) mechanism in the network interface YAML configuration file.

<1> The static IP address for the Ethernet interface.
<2> Next hop address for the node traffic. This must be in the same subnet as the IP address set for the Ethernet interface.
