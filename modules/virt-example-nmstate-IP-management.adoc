[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management_{context}"]
= Examples: IP management

The following example configuration snippets show different methods of IP management.

These examples use the `ethernet` interface type to simplify the example while showing the related context in the policy configuration. These IP management examples can be used with the other interface types.

[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-static_{context}"]
== Static

The following snippet statically configures an IP address on the Ethernet interface:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: static IP on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: false
        address:
        - ip: 192.168.122.250 <1>
          prefix-length: 24
        enabled: true
# ...
----
<1> Replace this value with the static IP address for the interface.

[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-no-ip_{context}"]
== No IP address

The following snippet ensures that the interface has no IP address:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: No IP on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        enabled: false
# ...
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always set the `state` parameter to `up` when you set both the `ipv4.enabled` and the `ipv6.enabled` parameter to `false` to disable an interface. If you set `state: down` with this configuration, the interface receives a DHCP IP address because of automatic DHCP assignment. 
====

[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-dhcp_{context}"]
== Dynamic host configuration

The following snippet configures an Ethernet interface that uses a dynamic IP address, gateway address, and DNS:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: DHCP on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        enabled: true
# ...
----

The following snippet configures an Ethernet interface that uses a dynamic IP address but does not use a dynamic gateway address or DNS:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: DHCP without gateway or DNS on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        auto-gateway: false
        auto-dns: false
        enabled: true
# ...
----


[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-dns_{context}"]
== DNS

By default, the `nmstate` API stores DNS values globally as against storing them in a network interface. For certain situations, you must configure a network interface to store DNS values.

[TIP]
====
Setting a DNS configuration is comparable to modifying the `/etc/resolv.conf` file.
====

To define a DNS configuration for a network interface, you must initially specify the `dns-resolver` section in the network interface's YAML configuration file. To apply an NNCP configuration to your network interface, you need to run the `oc apply -f <nncp_file_name>` command.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot use the `br-ex` bridge, an OVN-Kubernetes-managed Open vSwitch bridge, as the interface when configuring DNS resolvers unless you manually configured a customized `br-ex` bridge.

For more information, see "Creating a manifest object that includes a customized br-ex bridge" in the _Deploying installer-provisioned clusters on bare metal_ document or the _Installing a user-provisioned cluster on bare metal_ document.
====

The following example shows a default situation that stores DNS values globally:

* Configure a static DNS without a network interface. Note that when updating the `/etc/resolv.conf` file on a host node, you do not need to specify an interface, IPv4 or IPv6, in the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) manifest.

apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
 name: worker-0-dns-testing
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: <target_node>
  desiredState:

        - example.com
        - example.org
        server:
        - 2001:db8:f::1
        - 192.0.2.251
# ...
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You can specify DNS options under the `dns-resolver.config` section of your NNCP file as demonstrated in the following example:

[source,terminal]
----
# ...
desiredState:
    dns-resolver:
      config:
        options:
         - timeout:2
         - attempts:3
# ...
----

If you want to remove the DNS options from your network interface, apply the following configuration to your NNCP and then run the `oc apply -f <nncp_file_name>` command: 

[source,terminal]
----
# ...
    dns-resolver:
      config: {}
    interfaces: []
# ...
----
====

The following examples show situations that require configuring a network interface to store DNS values:

* If you want to rank a static DNS name server over a dynamic DNS name server, define the interface that runs either the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or the IPv6 Autoconfiguration (`autoconf`) mechanism in the network interface YAML configuration file.
+
.Example configuration that adds `192.0.2.1` to DNS name servers retrieved from the DHCPv4 network protocol
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
dns-resolver:
  config:
    server:
    - 192.0.2.1
interfaces:
  - name: eth1
    type: ethernet
    state: up
    ipv4:
      enabled: true
      dhcp: true
      auto-dns: true
# ...
----

* If you need to configure a network interface to store DNS values instead of adopting the default method, which uses the `nmstate` API to store DNS values globally, you can set static DNS values and static IP addresses in the network interface YAML file.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Storing DNS values at the network interface level might cause name resolution issues after you attach the interface to network components, such as an Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge, a Linux bridge, or a bond.

      - ip: 192.0.2.251 <1>
        prefix-length: 24
routes:
  config:
  - destination: 198.51.100.0/24
    metric: 150
    next-hop-address: 192.0.2.1 <2>
    next-hop-interface: eth1
    table-id: 254
# ...
----
<1> The static IP address for the Ethernet interface.
<2> The next hop address for the node traffic. This must be in the same subnet as the IP address set for the Ethernet interface.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot use the OVN-Kubernetes `br-ex` bridge as the next hop interface when configuring a static route unless you manually configured a customized `br-ex` bridge.

For more information, see "Creating a manifest object that includes a customized br-ex bridge" in the _Deploying installer-provisioned clusters on bare metal_ document or the _Installing a user-provisioned cluster on bare metal_ document.
