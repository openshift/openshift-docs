[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management_{context}"]
= Examples: IP management

The following example configuration snippets demonstrate different methods of IP management. 

These examples use the `ethernet` interface type to simplify the example while showing the related context in the Policy configuration. These IP management examples can be used with the other interface types. 

[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-static_{context}"]
== Static

The following snippet statically configures an IP address on the Ethernet interface:

[source,yaml]
----
...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: static IP on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        address:
        - ip: 192.168.122.250 <1>
          prefix-length: 24
        enabled: true
...
----
<1> Replace this value with the static IP address for the interface.

[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-no-ip_{context}"]
== No IP address

The following snippet ensures that the interface has no IP address:

[source,yaml]
----
...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: No IP on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        enabled: false
...
----

[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-dhcp_{context}"]
== Dynamic host configuration

The following snippet configures an Ethernet interface that uses a dynamic IP address, gateway address, and DNS:

[source,yaml]
----
...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: DHCP on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        enabled: true
...
----

The following snippet configures an Ethernet interface that uses a dynamic IP address but does not use a dynamic gateway address or DNS:

[source,yaml]
----
...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: DHCP without gateway or DNS on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        auto-gateway: false
        auto-dns: false
        enabled: true
...
----

[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-dns_{context}"]
== DNS

The following snippet sets DNS configuration on the host.

[source,yaml]
----
...
    interfaces:
       ...
    dns-resolver:
      config:
        search:
        - example.com
        - example.org
        server:
        - 8.8.8.8
...
----

[id="virt-example-nmstate-IP-management-static-routing_{context}"]
== Static routing

The following snippet configures a static route and a static IP on interface `eth1`. 

[source,yaml]
----
...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: Static routing on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        address:
        - ip: 192.0.2.251 <1>
          prefix-length: 24
        enabled: true
    routes:
      config:
      - destination: 198.51.100.0/24
        metric: 150
        next-hop-address: 192.0.2.1 <2>
        next-hop-interface: eth1
        table-id: 254
...
----
<1> The static IP address for the Ethernet interface.
<2> Next hop address for the node traffic. This must be in the same subnet as the IP address set for the Ethernet interface.
