= Create the EFS PersistentVolumeClaim

EFS PersistentVolumeClaims are created to allow Pods
to mount the underlying EFS storage.

.Prerequisites

* Create the EFS provisioner pod.

.Procedure (UI)

. In the {product-title} console, click *Storage* -> *Persistent Volume Claims*.

. In the persistent volume claims overview, click *Create Persistent Volume
Claim*.

. Define the required options on the resulting page.

.. Select the storage class that you created from the list.

.. Enter a unique name for the storage claim.

.. Select the access mode to determine the read and write access for the
created storage claim.

.. Define the size of the storage claim.
+
[NOTE]
====
Although you must enter a size, every Pod that access the EFS volume has
unlimited storage. Define a value, such as `1Mi`, that will remind you that
the storage size is unlimited.
====

. Click *Create* to create the persistent volume claim and generate a
persistent volume.

.Procedure (CLI)

. Alternately, you can define EFS PersistentVolumeClaims by creating a file, `pvc.yaml`, with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: efs-claim <1>
  namespace: test-efs
  annotations:
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner: openshift.org/aws-efs
  finalizers:
    - kubernetes.io/pvc-protection
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce <2>
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi <3>
  storageClassName: aws-efs <4>
  volumeMode: Filesystem
----
<1> A unique name for the PVC.
<2> The access mode to determine the read and write access for the created PVC.
<3> Defines the size of the PVC.
<4> Name of the StorageClass for the EFS provisioner.

. After the file has been configured, create it in your cluster by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc create -f pvc.yaml
