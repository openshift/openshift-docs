= Getting cluster version, status, and update details

You can view the cluster version and status by running the `oc get clusterversion` command. If the status shows that the installation is still progressing, you can review the status of the Operators for more information.

You can also list the current update channel and review the available cluster updates.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion

.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
