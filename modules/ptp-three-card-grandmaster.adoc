= 3-card Intel E810 PTP grandmaster clock

{product-title} supports cluster hosts with 3 Intel E810 NICs as PTP grandmaster clocks (T-GM).

3-card grandmaster clock::
+
--
You can use a cluster host that has 3 NICs as PTP grandmaster clock.
One NIC receives timing information from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS).
The second and third NICs receive the timing information from the first by using the SMA1 Tx/Rx connections on the E810 NIC faceplate.
The system clock on the cluster host is synchronized from the NIC that is connected to the GNSS satellite.

3-card NIC grandmaster clocks can be used for distributed RAN (D-RAN) configurations where the Radio Unit (RU) is connected directly to the distributed unit (DU) without a front haul switch, for example, if the RU and DU are located in the same radio cell site.
D-RAN distributes radio functions across multiple sites, with backhaul connections linking them to the core network.

[NOTE]
====
In a 3-card T-GM configuration, a single `ts2phc` process reports as 3 `ts2phc` instances in the system.
