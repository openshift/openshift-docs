= Overriding the Git resolver configuration for the authenticated SCM API

While the TektonConfig sets up the initial configuration, you can override these settings in specific pipeline runs or tasks. This flexibility allows you to tailor the resolver settings for particular use cases.

To override the default token, SCM type, and server URL during a pipeline run, edit the relevant spec section. Here's how you can do it

When you configure the Git resolver in your pipeline, you can explicitly set parameters such as the SCM type, the server URL, and the authentication token. This configuration enables secure and controlled interactions with the desired Git repository, using the specified credentials and connection settings.

You can edit the `pipeline.git-resolver-config` spec to override the default token, SCM type, and server URL previously configured:
