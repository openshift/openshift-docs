Configure three static IP addresses for the {product-title} cluster and create DNS entries for two of these addresses.

This document uses three example IP addresses:
** `10.35.1.19` for the cluster’s REST API
** `10.35.1.20` for the cluster’s apps (ingress/load balancer)
** `10.35.1.21` for the cluster’s internal DNS

NOTE: Replace all example values with real ones for your network environment.

== Reserving static IP addresses

. On the network where you plan to install {product-title}, identify three static IP addresses that are outside the DHCP lease pool.
. Connect to a host on this network and verify that each of the IP addresses is not in use. For example, use arp to check that none of the IP addresses have entries:

----
$ arp 10.35.1.19
10.35.1.19 (10.35.1.19) -- no entry
----

. Reserve three static IP addresses following the standard practices for your network environment.

== Configuring DNS

Create DNS entries for the {product-title} REST API and apps domain names using this format:

----
api.<cluster-name>.<base-domain>		<ip-address> <1>
*.apps.<cluster-name>.<base-domain>	<ip-address> <2>
----
<1> For `<cluster-name>`, `<base-domain>`, and `<ip-address>`, specify the cluster name (e.g., `ocp-cluster`), base domain (e.g., `virtlab.example.com`), and static IP address (e.g., `10.35.1.19`) of your {product-title} API.
<1> Specify the cluster name, base domain, and static IP address (e.g., `10.35.1.20`) of your {product-title} apps (ingress/load balancer).

For example:

----
api.ocp-cluster.virtlab.example.com	10.35.1.19
*.apps.ocp-cluster.virtlab.example.com	10.35.1.20
----

The third static IP address, `10.35.1.21` in our examples, does not require a DNS entry. The {product-title} cluster uses that address for its internal DNS service.
