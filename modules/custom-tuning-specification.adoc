= Custom tuning specification

The custom resource (CR) for the Operator has two major sections. The first
section, `profile:`, is a list of Tuned profiles and their names. The second,
`recommend:`, defines the profile selection logic.

Multiple custom tuning specifications can co-exist as multiple CRs in the
Operator's namespace. The existence of new CRs or the deletion of old CRs is
detected by the Operator. All existing custom tuning specifications are merged
and appropriate objects for the containerized Tuned daemons are updated.

*Profile data*

The `profile:` section lists Tuned profiles and their names.

----
profile:
- name: tuned_profile_1
  data: |
    # Tuned profile specification
    [main]
    summary=Description of tuned_profile_1 profile

    [sysctl]
    net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    # ... other sysctl's or other Tuned daemon plug-ins supported by the containerized Tuned

# ...

- name: tuned_profile_n
  data: |
    # Tuned profile specification
    [main]
    summary=Description of tuned_profile_n profile

    # tuned_profile_n profile settings
----

*Recommended profiles*

The `profile:` selection logic is defined by the `recommend:` section of the CR:

----
recommend:
- match:                              # optional; if omitted, profile match is assumed unless a profile with a higher matches first
  <match>                             # an optional array
  priority: <priority>                # profile ordering priority, lower numbers mean higher priority (0 is the highest priority)
  profile: <tuned_profile_name>       # e.g. tuned_profile_1

# ...

- match:
  <match>
  priority: <priority>
  profile: <tuned_profile_name>       # e.g. tuned_profile_n
----

If `<match>` is omitted, a profile match (for example, `true`) is assumed.

`<match>` is an optional array recursively defined as follows:

----
- label: <label_name>     # node or Pod label name
  value: <label_value>    # optional node or Pod label value; if omitted, the presence of <label_name> is enough to match
  type: <label_type>      # optional node or Pod type (`node` or `pod`); if omitted, `node` is assumed
  <match>                 # an optional <match> array
----

If `<match>` is not omitted, all nested `<match>` sections must also evaluate to
`true`. Otherwise, `false` is assumed and the profile with the respective
`<match>` section will not be applied or recommended. Therefore, the nesting
(child `<match>` sections) works as logical AND operator. Conversely, if any
item of the `<match>` array matches, the entire `<match>` array evaluates to
`true`. Therefore, the array acts as logical OR operator.

.Example

----
- match:
  - label: tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch
    match:
    - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
    type: pod
  priority: 10
  profile: openshift-control-plane-es
- match:
  - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
  - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
  priority: 20
  profile: openshift-control-plane
- priority: 30
  profile: openshift-node
----

The CR above is translated for the containerized Tuned daemon into its
`recommend.conf` file based on the profile priorities. The profile with the
highest priority (`10`) is `openshift-control-plane-es` and, therefore, it is
considered first. The containerized Tuned daemon running on a given node looks
to see if there is a Pod running on the same node with the
`tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch` label set. If not, the entire `<match>`
section evaluates as `false`. If there is such a Pod with the label, in order for
the `<match>` section to evaluate to `true`, the node label also needs to be
`node-role.kubernetes.io/master` or `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`.

If the labels for the profile with priority `10` matched,
`openshift-control-plane-es` profile is applied and no other profile is
considered. If the node/Pod label combination did not match, the second highest
priority profile (`openshift-control-plane`) is considered. This profile is
applied if the containerized Tuned Pod runs on a node with labels
`node-role.kubernetes.io/master` or `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`.

Finally, the profile `openshift-node` has the lowest priority of `30`. It lacks
the `<match>` section and, therefore, will always match. It acts as a profile
catch-all to set `openshift-node` profile, if no other profile with higher
priority matches on a given node.
