= Custom security policies

[role="_abstract"]

With {product-title-short}, you can create custom security policies to provide security during the build, deploy, and run phases of development. You can create custom security policies by the following methods:

* You can clone a default policy and then modify it to configure specific information for your environment
* You can use the {product-title-short} portal to create and save a new policy.
* With the policy as code feature, you can create and save policies as Kubernetes custom resources (CRs) and use a Kubernetes-native continuous delivery (CD) tool such as Argo CD to apply them to clusters.

For more information, see "Creating and modifying custom security policies".

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use caution when enforcing custom policies in the `openshift-*` namespaces and for default {ocp} pods. For example, a custom policy with enforcement configured can terminate pods with possible data loss if the policy is violated.
