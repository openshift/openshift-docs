= Removing an additional network attachment definition

[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, you can remove a secondary network from your {product-title} cluster. The secondary network is not removed from any pods that it is attached to.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Edit the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) in your default text editor by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. Modify the CR by removing the configuration from the `additionalNetworks`
collection for the network attachment definition you are removing.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks: []
----
+
--
where:

`additionalNetworks`:: Specifies the secondary network attachment definition that you want to remove from the `additionalNetworks` collection. If you are removing the configuration mapping for the only secondary network attachment definition in the `additionalNetworks` collection, you must specify an empty collection.
--

. Remove a network attachment definition from the network of your cluster by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete net-attach-def <name_of_network_attachment_definition>
----
+
Replace `<name_of_network_attachment_definition>` with the name of the network attachment definition that you want to remove.

. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.

. Optional: Confirm that the additional network CR was deleted by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network-attachment-definition --all-namespaces
----
