= Removing an additional network attachment definition

As a cluster administrator, you can remove an additional network from your
{product-title} cluster. The additional network is not removed from any Pods it
is attached to.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {product-title} {product-version}, you must manually delete the additional network CR after removing it from the Cluster Network Operator configuration.
This will be fixed in a future release.
For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1755908[BZ#1755908].

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

To remove an additional network from your cluster, complete the following steps:

. Edit the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) in your default text editor by running
the following command:
+
----
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. Modify the CR by removing the configuration from the `additionalNetworks`
collection for the network attachment definition you are removing.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks: [] <1>
----
<1>  If you are removing the configuration mapping for the only additional
network attachment definition in the `additionalNetworks` collection, you must
specify an empty collection.

. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.

. Delete the NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR for the additional network by running the following command. Replace `<name>` with the name of the additional network to remove.
+
----
$ oc delete network-attachment-definition <name>
----

. Optional: Confirm that the additional network CR was deleted by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc get network-attachment-definition --all-namespaces
----
