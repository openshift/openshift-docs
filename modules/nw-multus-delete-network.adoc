= Removing a secondary network attachment definition

As a cluster administrator, you can remove a secondary network from your {product-title} cluster. The secondary network is not removed from any pods it is attached to.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

To remove a secondary network from your cluster, complete the following steps:

. Edit the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) in your default text editor by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. Modify the CR by removing the configuration that the CNO created from the `additionalNetworks` collection for the secondary network that you want to remove.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks: [] <1>
----
<1>  If you are removing the configuration mapping for the only secondary network attachment definition in the `additionalNetworks` collection, you must specify an empty collection.

. To remove a network attachment definition from the network of your cluster, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete net-attach-def <name_of_NAD> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<name_of_NAD>` with the name of your network attachment definition.

. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.

. Optional: Confirm that the secondary network CR was deleted by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network-attachment-definition --all-namespaces
----
