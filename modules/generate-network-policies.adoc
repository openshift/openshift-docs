= Generating network policies

[role="_abstract"]
A Kubernetes network policy controls which pods receive incoming network traffic, and which pods can send outgoing traffic.
By using network policies to enable and disable traffic to or from pods, you can limit your network attack surface.

These network policies are YAML configuration files.
It is often difficult to gain insights into the network flow and manually create these files.
{product-title} allows you to autogenerate these network policies based on the actual observed network communication flows in your environment.

You can generate network policies from the network graph view.

The generated policies apply to the deployments shown in the network graph and they allow all network traffic observed during the selected time.

.Procedure
. In the RHACS portal, select *Network Graph* from the left-hand navigation menu.
. Select a cluster name from the menu on the top bar, if the correct one is not already selected.
. Select one or more namespaces.
. If you want to generate policies for only some deployments, use the filter box to filter the deployments you want.
If you do not add a filter, {product-title} generates policies for all deployments in the cluster.
. Select an appropriate time from the menu on the top bar.
If the selected time is too short it leaves out periodic or infrequent network communications.
. Select *Network Policy Simulator*.
. In the panel that opens, select *Exclude ports & protocols* if you do not want ports and protocols to be scoped in {product-title} generated policies.
. Select *Generate and simulate network policies*.
The generated network policy configuration  YAML opens in the same panel, and the network graph shows the effects of the policies.
