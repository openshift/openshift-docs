= Enabling external DNS for {hcp} on {aws-short}

The control plane and the data plane are separate in {hcp}. You can configure DNS in two independent areas:

* Ingress for workloads within the hosted cluster, such as the following domain: `*.apps.service-consumer-domain.com`.

* Ingress for service endpoints within the management cluster, such as API or OAuth endpoints through the service provider domain: `*.service-provider-domain.com`.

The input for `hostedCluster.spec.dns` manages the ingress for workloads within the hosted cluster. The input for `hostedCluster.spec.services.servicePublishingStrategy.route.hostname` manages the ingress for service endpoints within the management cluster.

External DNS creates name records for hosted cluster `Services` that specify a publishing type of `LoadBalancer` or `Route` and provide a hostname for that publishing type. For hosted clusters with `Private` or `PublicAndPrivate` endpoint access types, only the `APIServer` and `OAuth` services support hostnames. For `Private` hosted clusters, the DNS record resolves to a private IP address of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoint in your VPC.

A hosted control plane exposes the following services:

* `APIServer`
* `OIDC`

You can expose these services by using the `servicePublishingStrategy` field in the `HostedCluster` specification. By default, for the `LoadBalancer` and `Route` types of `servicePublishingStrategy`, you can publish the service in one of the following ways:

* By using the hostname of the load balancer that is in the status of the `Service` with the `LoadBalancer` type.
* By using the `status.host` field of the `Route` resource.

However, when you deploy {hcp} in a managed service context, those methods can expose the ingress subdomain of the underlying management cluster and limit options for the management cluster lifecycle and disaster recovery.

When a DNS indirection is layered on the `LoadBalancer` and `Route` publishing types, a managed service operator can publish all public hosted cluster services by using a service-level domain. This architecture allows remapping on the DNS name to a new `LoadBalancer` or `Route` and does not expose the ingress domain of the management cluster. {hcp-capital} uses external DNS to achieve that indirection layer.

You can deploy `external-dns` alongside the HyperShift Operator in the `hypershift` namespace of the management cluster. External DNS watches for `Services` or `Routes` that have the `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname` annotation. That annotation is used to create a DNS record that points to the `Service`, such as a record, or the `Route`, such as a CNAME record.

You can use external DNS on cloud environments only. For the other environments, you need to manually configure DNS and services.
