= Configuring a dedicated service monitor

You can configure {product-title} core platform monitoring to use dedicated service monitors to collect metrics for the resource metrics pipeline.

When enabled, a dedicated service monitor exposes two additional metrics from the kubelet endpoint and sets the value of the `honorTimestamps` field to true.

By enabling a dedicated service monitor, you can improve the consistency of Prometheus Adapter-based CPU usage measurements used by, for example, the `oc adm top pod` command or the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
