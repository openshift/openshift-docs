[id="olmv1-cluster-extension-permissions_{context}"]
= Cluster extension permissions

In {olmv0-first}, a single service account with cluster administrator privileges manages all cluster extensions.

In {olmv1}, each cluster extension uses the service account specified in the extension's custom resource (CR). Cluster administrators can create a service account for each extension. You can then assign only the permissions needed to install and manage that extension.

You must add each permission to either a cluster role or role. Then you must bind the cluster role or role to the service account with a cluster role binding or role binding.

You can scope the RBAC to either the cluster or to a namespace. Use cluster roles and cluster role bindings to scope permissions to the cluster. Use roles and role bindings to scope permissions to a namespace.

Choose cluster or namespace scope based on your extension design.

{olmv1} halts updates if a new version needs more permissions. The update resumes when a cluster administrator grants those permissions.
