[id="olmv1-cluster-extension-permissions_{context}"]
= Cluster extension permissions

In {olmv0-first}, a single service account with cluster administrator privileges manages all Operators.

{olmv1} manages a cluster extension by using the service account specified in an extension's custom resource (CR). Cluster administrators create a service account for each cluster extension and assign role-based access controls (RBAC) to install and manage that extension.

After you assign the RBAC, you must bind the cluster role or role to the service account with a cluster role binding or role binding.
