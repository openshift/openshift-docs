[id="olmv1-cluster-extension-permissions_{context}"]
= Cluster extension permissions

In {olmv0-first}, a single service account with cluster administrator privileges manages all cluster extensions.

{olmv1} is designed to be more secure than {olmv0} by default. {olmv1} manages a cluster extension by using the service account specified in an extension's custom resource (CR). Cluster administrators can create a service account for each cluster extension. As a result, administrators can follow the principle of least privilege and assign only the role-based access controls (RBAC) to install and manage that extension.

You must add each permission to either a cluster role or role. Then you must bind the cluster role or role to the service account with a cluster role binding or role binding.

You can scope the RBAC to either the cluster or to a namespace. Use cluster roles and cluster role bindings to scope permissions to the cluster. Use roles and role bindings to scope permissions to a namespace. Whether you scope the permissions to the cluster or to a namespace depends on the design of the extension you want to install and manage.

If a new version of an installed extension requires additional permissions, {olmv1} halts the update process until a cluster administrator grants those permissions.
