= About support of IRQ affinity setting

Some IRQ controllers lack support for IRQ affinity setting and will always expose all online CPUs as the IRQ mask. These IRQ controllers effectively run on CPU 0.

The following are examples of drivers and hardware that Red Hat are aware lack support for IRQ affinity setting. The list is, by no means, exhaustive:

* Some RAID controller drivers, such as `megaraid_sas`
* Many non-volatile memory express (NVMe) drivers
* Some LAN on motherboard (LOM) network controllers
* The driver uses `managed_irqs`

[NOTE]
====
The reason they do not support IRQ affinity setting might be associated with factors such as the type of processor, the IRQ controller, or the circuitry connections in the motherboard.
====

If the effective affinity of any IRQ is set to an isolated CPU, it might be a sign of some hardware or driver not supporting IRQ affinity setting. To find the effective affinity, log in to the host and run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ find /proc/irq/ -name effective_affinity -exec sh -c 'i="$1"; mask=$(cat $i); file=$(echo $i); echo $file: $mask' _ {} \;
----

Some drivers use `managed_irqs`, whose affinity is managed internally by the kernel and userspace cannot change the affinity. In some cases, these IRQs might be assigned to isolated CPUs. For more information about `managed_irqs`, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4819541[Affinity of managed interrupts cannot be changed even if they target isolated CPU].
