== Fixed issues

* Before this update, Argo CD monitoring worked automatically when deployed in any namespace and user-workload monitoring support for workloads did not require any manual configuration. With this update, if you deploy Argo CD in a non-{OCP} namespace, you must enable user-workload monitoring in {OCP}. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/latest/html/monitoring/configuring-user-workload-monitoring#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects-uwm_preparing-to-configure-the-monitoring-stack-uwm[Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects]. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-7037[GITOPS-7037]

* Before this update, the {gitops-title} Operator did not correctly handle regular expressions in `sourceNamespaces`, leading to an unexpected behavior when matching namespace patterns. With this update, the {gitops-title} Operator now uses the correct regex option, `glob.REGEXP`, instead of `glob.GLOB` when processing `getSourceNamespaces`, ensuring that regular expressions are evaluated and matched accurately. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6675[GITOPS-6675]

* Before this update, the `gitops-plugin` deployment created by the {gitops-title} Operator did not include a security context, causing the plugin pod to fail in environments that enforce the `PodSecurity` restricted policy. With this update, the {gitops-title} Operator now sets the required security context for the `gitops-plugin` deployment, ensuring compliance with the `PodSecurity` restricted policy. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6777[GITOPS-6777]
