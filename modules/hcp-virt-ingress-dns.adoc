[id="hcp-virt-ingress-dns_{context}"]
= Configuring the default ingress and DNS for {hcp} on {VirtProductName}

Every {product-title} cluster includes a default application Ingress Controller, which must have an wildcard DNS record associated with it. By default, hosted clusters that are created by using the HyperShift KubeVirt provider automatically become a subdomain of the {product-title} cluster that the KubeVirt virtual machines run on.

For example, your {product-title} cluster might have the following default ingress DNS entry:

[source,terminal]
----
*.apps.mgmt-cluster.example.com
----

As a result, a KubeVirt hosted cluster that is named `guest` and that runs on that underlying {product-title} cluster has the following default ingress:

[source,terminal]
----
*.apps.guest.apps.mgmt-cluster.example.com
----

.Procedure

For the default ingress DNS to work properly, the cluster that hosts the KubeVirt virtual machines must allow wildcard DNS routes. 

* You can configure this behavior by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch ingresscontroller -n openshift-ingress-operator default --type=json -p '[{ "op": "add", "path": "/spec/routeAdmission", "value": {wildcardPolicy: "WildcardsAllowed"}}]'
----

[NOTE]
====
When you use the default hosted cluster ingress, connectivity is limited to HTTPS traffic over port 443. Plain HTTP traffic over port 80 is rejected. This limitation applies to only the default ingress behavior.
