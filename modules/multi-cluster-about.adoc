= Multicluster console

The multicluster console provides a single interface with consistent design for the hybrid cloud console. If you enable the feature, you can switch between Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) and the cluster console in the same browser tab. It provides a simplified and consistent design that allows for shared components.
