= Creating a security policy from the system policies view

You can create new security policies from the system policies view.

.Procedure
. On the {product-title-short} portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Policy Management*.
. Click *Create policy*.
. Enter the following details about your policy in the *Policy details* section:
** Enter a *Name* for the policy.
** Optional: Attach notifiers to the policy by selecting from the available *Notifiers* under the *Attach notifiers* section.
+
[NOTE]
====
Before you can forward alerts, you must integrate {product-title-short} with your notification provider, such as webhooks, Jira, PagerDuty, Splunk, or others.
====
** Select a *Severity* level for this policy, either `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`.
** Select policy *Categories* you want to apply to this policy. For information about creating categories, see "Creating and managing policy categories" later in this document.
** Enter details about the policy in the *Description* field.
** Enter an explanation about why the policy exists in the *Rationale* field.
** Enter steps to resolve violations of this policy in the *Guidance* field.
** Optional: Under the *MITRE ATT&CK* section, select the link:https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/containers/[tactics and the techniques] you want to specify for the policy.
.. Click *Add tactic*, and then select a tactic from the drop-down list.
.. Click the *Add technique* to add techniques for the selected tactic. You can specify multiple techniques for a tactic.
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Policy behavior* section, take the following steps:
.. Select the *Lifecycle stages* to which your policy is applicable: *Build*, *Deploy*, or *Runtime*.
You can select more than one stage.
*** Build-time policies apply to image fields such as CVEs and Dockerfile instructions.
*** Deploy-time policies can include all build-time policy criteria but they can also include data from your cluster configurations, such as running in privileged mode or mounting the Docker socket.
*** Runtime policies can include all build-time and deploy-time policy criteria but they can also include data about process executions during runtime.
.. Optional: If you selected the *Runtime* lifecycle stage, select one of the following *Event sources*:
*** Deployment: {product-title-short} triggers policy violations when event sources include process and network activity, pod exec and pod port forwarding.
*** {product-title-short} triggers policy violations when event sources match Kubernetes audit log records.
. For *Response method*, select one of the following options:
.. *Inform*: include the violation in the violations list.
.. *Inform and enforce*: enforce actions.
. Optional: If you selected *Inform and enforce*, in *Configure enforcement behavior*, select the enforcement behavior for the policy by using the toggle for each lifecycle.
It is only available for the stages you select when configuring *Lifecycle stages*.
The enforcement behavior is different for each lifecycle stage.
**** *Build* - {product-title-short} fails your continuous integration (CI) builds when images match the criteria of the policy.
**** *Deploy* - {product-title-short} blocks creation of deployments that match the conditions of the policy.
In clusters with admission controller enforcement, the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server blocks all noncompliant deployments.
In other clusters, {product-title-short} edits noncompliant deployments to prevent pods from being scheduled.
**** *Runtime* - {product-title-short} deletes all pods when an event in the pods matches the criteria of the policy.
+
[WARNING]
====
Policy enforcement can impact running applications or development processes.
Before you enable enforcement options, inform all stakeholders and plan about how to respond to automated enforcement actions.
====
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Policy Criteria* section, configure the attributes that you want to trigger the policy for.
.. Click and drag policy fields into the *Policy Section* to add criteria.
+
[NOTE]
====
The policy fields that are available depend on the lifecycle stage you chose for the policy. For example, criteria under `Kubernetes access policies` or `Networking` are available when creating a policy for the runtime lifecycle, but not when creating a policy for the build lifecycle. See "Policy criteria" in the "Additional resources" section for more information about policy criteria, including information about criteria and the lifecycle phase in which they are available.
====
.. Optional: Click *Add condition* to add policy sections that contain additional criteria that will trigger the policy (for example, to trigger on old, stale images, you can configure that `image tag` *is not* `latest` *or* `image age` and specify a minimum number of days since an image is built).
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Policy scope* section, configure the following:
** Click *Add inclusion scope* to use *Restrict by scope* to enable this policy only for a specific cluster, a namespace, or a label.
You can add multiple scopes and also use regular expression in link:https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[RE2 Syntax] for namespaces and labels.
** Click *Add exclusion scope* to use *Exclude by scope* to exclude deployments, clusters, namespaces, and labels you specify. The policy will not apply to the entities that you select.
You can add multiple scopes and also use regular expression in link:https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[RE2 Syntax] for namespaces and labels.
However, you cannot use regular expression for selecting deployments.
** For *Excluded Images (Build Lifecycle only)*, select all images that you do not want to trigger a violation for.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Excluded Images* setting only applies when you check images in a continuous integration system with the *Build* lifecycle stage.
It does not have any effect if you use this policy to check running deployments in the *Deploy* lifecycle stage or runtime activities in the *Runtime* lifecycle stage.

. Click *Next*.
. In the *Review policy* section, preview the policy violations.
. Click *Save*.
