= Enabling parallel testing

As an Operator author, you can define separate stages for your tests using the scorecard configuration file. Stages run sequentially in the order they are defined in the configuration file. A stage contains a list of tests and a configurable `parallel` setting.

By default, or when a stage explicitly sets `parallel` to `false`, tests in a stage are run sequentially in the order they are defined in the configuration file. Running tests one at a time is helpful to guarantee that no two tests interact and conflict with each other.

However, if tests are designed to be fully isolated, they can be parallelized.

.Procedure

* To run a set of isolated tests in parallel, include them in the same stage and set `parallel` to `true`:

All tests in a parallel stage are executed simultaneously, and scorecard waits for all of them to finish before proceding to the next stage. This can make your tests run much faster.
