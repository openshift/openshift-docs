== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the operator stored gateway tenant secret information in a config map. With this update, the operator stores this information in a secret. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3717[LOG-3717])

* Before this update, the Fluentd collector did not capture OAuth login events stored in `/var/log/auth-server/audit.log`. With this update, Fluentd captures these OAuth login events, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3729[LOG-3729])
