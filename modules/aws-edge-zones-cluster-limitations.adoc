= Cluster limitations in {aws-service-name-full}

Some limitations exist when you attempt to deploy a cluster with a default installation configuration in Amazon Web
Services (AWS) {aws-service-name-short}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following list details limitations when deploying a cluster in {aws-service-name-full}:

- The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) between an Amazon EC2 instance in a {aws-service-name-single} and an Amazon EC2 instance in the Region
  is `1300`. This causes the cluster-wide network MTU to change according to the network plugin that is used on the deployment.
- Network resources such as Network Load Balancer (NLB), Classic Load Balancer, and Network Address Translation (NAT)
  Gateways are not globally supported in {aws-service-name-full}.
- For an {product-title} cluster on AWS, the AWS Elastic Block Storage (EBS) `gp3` type volume is the default for node
  volumes and the default for the storage class. This volume type is not globally available on {aws-service-name-single} locations.
  By default, the nodes running in {aws-service-name-short} are deployed with the `gp2` EBS volume. The `gp2-csi` `StorageClass`
  must be set when creating workloads in the nodes running on {aws-service-name-full}.
====

If you want the installation program to automatically create {aws-service-name-single} subnets for your {product-title} cluster,
specific configuration limitations apply with this method.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following configuration limitation applies when you set the installation program to automatically create subnets for
your {product-title} cluster:

- The private subnets for an {aws-service-name-full} associate with the route table of the parent zone, so that each private subnet
  can route egress traffic to the internet. If this route table does not exist during cluster installation, the private subnet
  associates with the first available private route table in the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This approach is valid only
  for {aws-service-name-full} subnets in an {product-title} cluster.
