= Configuring IPv6 dual-stack networking before {microshift-short} starts

You can configure your {microshift-short} cluster to run on dual-stack networking that supports IPv4 and IPv6 address families by using the configuration file before starting the service.

* The first IP family in the configuration is the primary IP stack in the cluster.
* After the cluster is running with dual-stack networking, enable application pods and add-on services for dual-stack by restarting them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin requires that both IPv4 and IPv6 default routes be on the same network device. IPv4 and IPv6 default routes on separate network devices is not supported.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using dual-stack networking where IPv6 is required, you cannot use IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, such as `::FFFF:198.51.100.1`.
====

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have root access to the cluster.
* Your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* The host has both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and routes, including a default for each.
* The host has at least two L3 networks, IPv4 and IPv6.

.Procedure

. If you have not done so, make a copy of the provided `config.yaml.default` file in the `/etc/microshift/` directory, renaming it `config.yaml`.

. Keep the new {microshift-short} `config.yaml` in the `/etc/microshift/` directory. Your `config.yaml` file is read every time the {microshift-short} service starts.
+
[NOTE]
====
After you create it, the `config.yaml` file takes precedence over built-in settings.
====

. If you have not started {microshift-short}, replace the default values in the `network` section of the {microshift-short} YAML with your valid values.

<1> Specify an IPv6 `clusterNetwork` with a CIDR value that is less than `64`.
<2> Specify an IPv6 CIDR with a prefix of `112`. Kubernetes uses only the lowest 16 bits. For a prefix of `112`, IP addresses are assigned from `112` to `128` bits.
<3> Example node IP address. Must be an IPv4 address family.
<4> Example node IP address for dual-stack configuration. Must be an IPv6 address family. Configurable only with dual-stack networking.

. Complete any other {microshift-short} configurations you require, then start {microshift-short} by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl start microshift

. Reset the IP family policy for application pods and services as needed, then restart those application pods and services to enable dual-stack networking. See "Resetting the IP family policy for application pods and services" for a simple example.

.Verification

. You can verify that all of the system services and pods to have two IP addresses, one for each family, by using the following steps:
