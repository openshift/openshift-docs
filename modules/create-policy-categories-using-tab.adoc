= Creating policy categories using the Policy categories tab

{product-title-short} version 3.74 provides a new method to create and manage policy categories in {product-title} if you have the PostgreSQL database (Technology Preview) enabled. All policy workflows other than policy creation remain unchanged when using this feature.

You can also configure policy categories by using the `PolicyCategoryService` API object. For more information, navigate to *Help* -> *API reference* in the {product-title-short} portal.
