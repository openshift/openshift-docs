= Creating an HTTP-based route

A route allows you to host your application at a public URL. It can either be secure or unsecured, depending on the network security configuration of your application. An HTTP-based route is an unsecured route that uses the basic HTTP routing protocol and exposes a service on an unsecured application port.

The following procedure describes how to create a simple HTTP-based route to a web application, using the `hello-openshift` application as an example.
//link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/hello-openshift[hello-openshift]

.Prerequisites


* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in as an administrator.
* You have a web application that exposes a port and a TCP endpoint listening for traffic on the port.

.Procedure

. Create a project called `hello-openshift` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project hello-openshift
----

. Create a pod in the project by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/hello-openshift/hello-pod.json
----

. Create a service called `hello-openshift` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose pod/hello-openshift
----

. Create an unsecured route to the `hello-openshift` application by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose svc hello-openshift
----
+
If you examine the resulting `Route` resource, it should look similar to the following:
+
.YAML definition of the created unsecured route:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: hello-openshift
spec:
  host: hello-openshift-hello-openshift.<Ingress_Domain> <1>
  port:
    targetPort: 8080
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: hello-openshift
----
<1> `<Ingress_Domain>` is the default ingress domain name.
+
[NOTE]
====
To display your default ingress domain, run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ingresses.config/cluster -o jsonpath={.spec.domain}
----
