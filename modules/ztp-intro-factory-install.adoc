= An introduction to the factory install pipeline

The factory install pipeline is used to build out your factory environment (hub and spoke clusters) in readiness for the spoke cluster to be shipped off-site. Red Hat has created a set of community scripts to help you get started wit this task. 

All the relevant scripts and YAML files needed to factory provision the hub and spoke cluster are included in a GitHub repo.

The spoke cluster installation is done using zero touch provisioning (ZTP) facilitated by {rh-rhacm-first} (ACM) using the assisted installer (AI) installed as part of running the factory install pipeline.

With ZTP and AI, you can provision many {product-title} spoke clusters in a factory-type setting. ACM manages clusters in a hub and spoke architecture, where a single hub cluster manages many spoke clusters. A hub cluster running ACM provision and deploys the spoke clusters using ZTP and AI. The AI service handles provisioning of {product-title} of the spoke compact clusters (3 control plane nodes and 1 worker node) running on bare metal.
