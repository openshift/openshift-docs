[role="_abstract"]
{product-title-short} has some system requirements that must be met before you can install it.

[WARNING]
====
You must not install {product-title} on:

* Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). Use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) with the default *gp2* volume type instead.
* Older CPUs that do not have the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) 4.2 instruction set.
For example, Intel processors older than _Sandy Bridge_ and AMD processors older than _Bulldozer_.
(These processors were released in 2011.)
====

To install {product-title}, you must have one of the following systems:

* {ocp} version {ocp-supported-version} or later, and cluster nodes with a supported operating system of {op-system-first} or {op-system-base-full}.
* a supported managed Kubernetes platform, and cluster nodes with a supported operating system of Amazon Linux, CentOS, Container-Optimized OS from Google, {op-system-first}, Debian, {op-system-base-full}, or Ubuntu.
+
For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/node/5822721[{product-title} Support Policy].

Cluster nodes minimum requirements:

* *Architecture*: `amd64`, `ppc64le`, or `s390x`
+
[NOTE]
====
For `ppc64le`, or `s390x` architectures, you can only install {product-title-short} secured cluster services on {ibm-power}, {ibm-z}, and {ibm-linuxone} clusters.
====
* *Processor*: 3 CPU cores
* *Memory*: 6 GiB of RAM
+
[NOTE]
====
See the default memory and CPU requirements for each component and ensure that the node size can support them.
====

Persistent storage by using persistent volume claim (PVC):

* Use Solid-State Drives (SSDs) for best performance. However, you can use another storage type if you do not have SSDs available.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must not use Ceph FS storage with {product-title}. Red Hat recommends using RBD block mode PVCs for {product-title}.
====


To install using Helm charts:

* You must have Helm command-line interface (CLI) v3.2 or newer, if you are installing or configuring {product-title} using Helm charts.
Use the `helm version` command to verify the version of Helm you have installed.
ifdef::op[]
* You must have the required permissions to configure deployments in the Central cluster.
endif::op[]
* You must have access to the Red Hat Container Registry. For information about downloading images from `registry.redhat.io`, see link:https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[Red Hat Container Registry Authentication].
