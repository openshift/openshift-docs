To install {product-title}, you must have:

* {ocp} version {ocp-supported-version} or later.
+
[WARNING]
====
You must not install {product-title} on:

* Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). Use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) with the default *gp2* volume type instead.
* Older CPUs that do not have the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) 4.2 instruction set.
For example, Intel processors older than _Sandy Bridge_ and AMD processors older than _Bulldozer_.
(These processors were released in 2011.)
* You must not use Ceph FS storage with {product-title}.
====

* Cluster nodes with a supported operating system.
See the link:https://access.redhat.com/node/5822721[{product-title} Support Policy] for additional information.
** *Operating system*: Amazon Linux, CentOS, Container-Optimized OS from Google, {op-system-first}, Debian, {op-system-base-full}, or Ubuntu.
** *Processor and memory*: 2 CPU cores and at least 3GiB of RAM.
+
[NOTE]
====
For deploying Central, use a machine type with 4 or more cores and apply scheduling policies to launch Central on such nodes.
====

* Persistent storage by using persistent volume claim (PVC).
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat recommends using RBD block mode PVCs for {product-title}.
====
** Use Solid-State Drives (SSDs) for best performance.
However, you can use another storage type if you do not have SSDs available.

* Helm command-line interface (CLI) v3.2 or newer.
Use the `helm version` command to verify the version of Helm you have installed.
* The {ocp} CLI (`oc`).
* You must have the required permissions to configure deployments in the Central cluster.
* You must have access to the Red Hat Container Registry. See link:https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[Red Hat Container Registry Authentication] for information about downloading images from `registry.redhat.io`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are not a Red Hat customer and purchased the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform before the acquisition, you can use StackRox’s container registry at `stackrox.io`. Contact mailto:support@stackrox.com[support@stackrox.com] to enable access to the registry.
