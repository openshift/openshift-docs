Before you can install {product-title-short}, your system must meet several requirements.

[WARNING]
====
You must not install {product-title-short} on:

* Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). Use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) with the default *gp2* volume type instead.
* Older CPUs that do not have the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) 4.2 instruction set.
For example, Intel processors older than _Sandy Bridge_ and AMD processors older than _Bulldozer_.
These processors were released in 2011.
====

To install {product-title-short}, you must have one of the following systems:

* {ocp} version {ocp-supported-version} or later, and cluster nodes with a supported operating system of {op-system-first} or {op-system-base-full}
* A supported managed Kubernetes platform, and cluster nodes with a supported operating system of Amazon Linux, CentOS, Container-Optimized OS from Google, {op-system-first}, Debian, {op-system-base-full}, or Ubuntu
+
For information about supported platforms and architecture, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7045053[{product-title} Support Matrix]. For life cycle support information for {product-title-short}, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhacs[{product-title} Support Policy].

The following minimum requirements and suggestions apply to cluster nodes.

Architecture:: `amd64`, `ppc64le`, or `s390x`
+
[NOTE]
====
Starting with {product-title-short} 4.3, both Central and secured cluster services are supported on {ibm-power}(`ppc64le`), {ibm-z}(`s390x`), and {ibm-linuxone}(`s390x`) clusters.
====

Processor:: 3 CPU cores are required.

Memory:: 6 GiB of RAM is required.
+
[NOTE]
====
See the default memory and CPU requirements for each component and ensure that the node size can support them.
====

Storage:: A persistent volume claim (PVC) is required on the cluster where Central is installed. It is strongly recommended on the secured clusters where Scanner V4 is enabled. Use Solid-State Drives (SSDs) for best performance. However, you can use another storage type if you do not have SSDs available.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must not use Ceph FS storage with {product-title}. Red{nbsp}Hat recommends using RBD block mode PVCs for {product-title}.
====

If you plan to install {product-title-short} by using Helm charts, you must meet the following requirements:

* You must have Helm command-line interface (CLI) v3.2 or newer, if you are installing or configuring {product-title-short} using Helm charts.
Use the `helm version` command to verify the version of Helm you have installed.
ifdef::op[]
* You must have the required permissions to configure deployments in the Central cluster.
endif::op[]
* You must have access to the Red{nbsp}Hat Container Registry. For information about downloading images from `registry.redhat.io`, see link:https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[Red{nbsp}Hat Container Registry Authentication].
