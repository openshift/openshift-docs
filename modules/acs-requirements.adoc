* {ocp} version 4.1 or later.

[WARNING]
====
We do not support installing {product-title} on:

* link:https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/[Minikube] and other similar single-node clusters.
* Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). Use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) with the default *gp2* volume type instead.
* Older CPUs that do not have the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) 4.2 instruction set.
For example, Intel processors older than _Sandy Bridge_ and AMD processors older than _Bulldozer_.
(These processors were released in 2011.)
====

* Cluster nodes with a supported operating system.
See the link:https://access.redhat.com/node/5822721[{product-title} Support Policy] for additional information.
** *Operating system*: Amazon Linux, CentOS, Container-Optimized OS from Google, CoreOS, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Ubuntu.
** *Processor and memory*: 2 CPU cores and at least 3GiB of RAM.

[NOTE]
====
For deploying _Central_, use a machine type with 4 or more cores and apply scheduling policies to launch _Central_ on such nodes.
====

* Persistent storage by using PersistentVolumeClaim (pvc) or hostPath.
** Use the host-mounted storage only if all your hosts (or a group of hosts) mount a shared filesystem, such as an NFS share or a storage appliance.
Otherwise, your data is only saved on a single node.
** Use Solid-State Drives (SSDs) for best performance.
However, you can use another storage type if you do not have SSDs available.
* Helm command-line interface (CLI) v3.2 or newer.
Use the `helm version` command to verify the version of Helm you have installed.
* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You must have the required permissions to configure Deployments in the central cluster.
