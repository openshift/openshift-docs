= How to plan your RAN policies

Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) uses {rh-rhacm-first} to apply the radio access network (RAN) configuration using a policy-based governance approach to apply the configuration.

The policy generator or `PolicyGen` is a part of the GitOps ZTP tooling that facilitates creating {rh-rhacm} policies from a set of predefined custom resources. There are three main items: policy categorization, source CR policy, and the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR. `PolicyGen` uses these to generate the policies and their placement bindings and rules.

The following diagram shows how the RAN policy generator interacts with GitOps and {rh-rhacm}.

RAN policies are categorized into three main groups:

Common:: A policy that exists in the `Common` category is applied to all clusters to be represented by the site plan. Cluster types include single node, three-node, and standard clusters.

Groups:: A policy that exists in the `Groups` category is applied to a group of clusters. Every group of clusters could have their own policies that exist under the
`Groups` category. For example, `Groups/group1` can have its own policies that are applied to the clusters belonging to `group1`.
You can also define a group for each cluster type: single node, three-node, and standard clusters.

Sites:: A policy that exists in the `Sites` category is applied to a specific cluster. Any cluster
could have its own policies that exist in the `Sites` category.
For example, `Sites/cluster1` has its own policies applied to `cluster1`.
You can also define an example site-specific configuration for each cluster type: single node, three-node, and standard clusters.
