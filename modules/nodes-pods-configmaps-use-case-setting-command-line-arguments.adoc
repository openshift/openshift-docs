= Setting command-line arguments for container commands with config maps

You can use a config map to set the value of the commands or arguments in a container by using the Kubernetes substitution syntax `$(VAR_NAME)`.

As an example, consider the following config map:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: special-config
  namespace: default
data:
  special.how: very
  special.type: charm
----

.Procedure

* To inject values into a command in a container, you must consume the keys you want to use as environment variables. Then you can refer to them in a container's command using the `$(VAR_NAME)` syntax.
