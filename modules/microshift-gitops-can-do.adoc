= What you can do with the GitOps agent

[role="_abstract"]
You can manage application lifecycles and use automated processes to manage application changes with {gitops-title}.

{gitops} with Argo CD for {microshift-short} is a lightweight, optional add-on controller derived from the {gitops} Operator.

The {gitops} agent for {microshift-short} uses the command-line interface (CLI) of Argo CD to interact with the {gitops} controller. The controller acts as the declarative {gitops} engine. By using the {gitops} with Argo CD agent for {microshift-short}, you can use the following principles:

* Implement application lifecycle management:

** Create and manage your node and application configuration files using the core principles of developing and maintaining software in a Git repository.
** You can update the single repository and GitOps automates the deployment of new applications or updates to existing ones.
** For example, if you have 1,000 edge devices, each using {microshift-short} and a local GitOps agent, you can easily add or update an application on all 1,000 devices with just one change in your central Git repository.

* The Git repository contains a declarative description of the infrastructure you need in your specified environment and contains an automated process to make your environment match the described state.

* You can also use the Git repository as an audit trail of changes so that you can create processes based on Git flows such as review and approval for merging pull requests that implement configuration changes.
