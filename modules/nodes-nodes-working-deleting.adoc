= Deleting nodes from a cluster

When you delete a node using the CLI, the node object is deleted in Kubernetes,
but the pods that exist on the node are not deleted. Any bare pods not
backed by a replication controller become inaccessible to {product-title}.
Pods backed by replication controllers are rescheduled to other available
nodes. You must delete local manifest pods.

.Procedure

To delete a node from the {product-title} cluster, edit the appropriate `MachineSet` object:

[NOTE]
====
If you are running cluster on bare metal, you cannot delete a node by editing
`MachineSet` objects. Machine sets are only available when a cluster is integrated with a cloud provider. Instead you must unschedule and drain the node before manually
deleting it.
====

. View the machine sets that are in the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
The machine sets are listed in the form of <clusterid>-worker-<aws-region-az>.

. Scale the machine set:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to scale the machine set:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  name: <machineset>
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  replicas: 2
