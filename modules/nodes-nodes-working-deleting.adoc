= Deleting nodes from a cluster

When you delete a node using the CLI, the node object is deleted in Kubernetes,
but the pods that exist on the node are not deleted. Any bare pods not
backed by a replication controller become inaccessible to {product-title}.
Pods backed by replication controllers are rescheduled to other available
nodes. You must delete local manifest pods.

[NOTE]
====
To delete a node in an {product-title} environment that does not have a MachineSet,
such as a baremetal deployment, use the `oc delete node <node>` command.
====

.Procedure

To delete a node from the {product-title} cluster edit the appropriate MachineSet:

. View the MachineSets that are in the cluster:
+
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
The MachineSets are listed in the form of <clusterid>-worker-<aws-region-az>.

. Scale the MachineSet:
+
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----

For more information on scaling your cluster using a MachineSet, see Manually scaling a MachineSet.
