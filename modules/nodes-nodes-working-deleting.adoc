= Deleting nodes from a cluster

When you delete a node using the CLI, the node object is deleted in Kubernetes,
but the pods that exist on the node are not deleted. Any bare pods not
backed by a replication controller become inaccessible to {product-title}.
Pods backed by replication controllers are rescheduled to other available
nodes. You must delete local manifest pods.

.Procedure

To delete a node from the {product-title} cluster, edit the appropriate MachineSet:

[NOTE]
====
If you are running cluster on bare metal, you cannot delete a node by editing
MachineSets. MachineSets are only available when a cluster is integrated with a
cloud provider. Instead you must unschedule and drain the node before manually
deleting it.
====

. View the MachineSets that are in the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
The MachineSets are listed in the form of <clusterid>-worker-<aws-region-az>.

. Scale the MachineSet:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----

For more information on scaling your cluster using a MachineSet, see Manually scaling a MachineSet.
