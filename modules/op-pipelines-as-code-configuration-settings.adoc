max-keep-days

The number of the day to keep the PipelineRuns runs in the pipelines-as-code namespace. We install by default a cronjob that cleans up the PipelineRuns generated on events in pipelines-as-code namespace. Note that these PipelineRuns are internal to Pipelines-as-code are separate from the PipelineRuns that exist in the user's GitHub repository.

This configmap setting doesn't affect the cleanups of the user's PipelineRuns which are controlled by the annotations on the PipelineRun definition in the user's GitHub repository.
