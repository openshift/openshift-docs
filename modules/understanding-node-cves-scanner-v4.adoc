= Understanding differences in scanning results between the Stackrox Scanner and Scanner V4

Scanning {op-system} node hosts with Scanner V4 reports significantly more CVEs for the same operating system version. For example, Scanner V4 reports about 390 CVEs, compared to about 50 CVEs that are reported by StackRox Scanner. A manual review of selected vulnerabilities revealed the following causes:

* The Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) data used in Scanner V4 is more accurate.
* The VEX data includes granular statuses, such as "no fix planned" and "fix deferred".
* Some vulnerabilities reported by StackRox Scanner were false positives.

As a result, Scanner V4 provides a more accurate and realistic vulnerability assessment.

Users might find discrepancies in reported vulnerabilities surprising, especially if some secured clusters still use older {product-title-short} versions with StackRox Scanner while others use Scanner V4. To help you understand this difference, the following example provides an explanation and guidance on how to manually verify reported vulnerabilities.

== Example of discrepancies in reported vulnerabilities

In this example, we analyzed the differences in reported CVEs for three arbitrarily selected {op-system} versions. This example presents findings for {op-system} version `417.94.202501071621-0`.
For this version, {product-title-short} provided the following scan results:

* StackRox Scanner reported 49 CVEs.
* Scanner V4 reported 389 CVEs.

The breakdown is as follows:

* 1 CVE is reported only by the StackRox Scanner.
* 48 CVEs are reported by both scanners.
* 341 CVEs are reported only by Scanner V4.

=== CVEs reported only by the StackRox Scanner

The single CVE reported exclusively by StackRox Scanner was a false positive. CVE-2022-4122 was flagged for the `podman` package in version `5:5.2.2-1.rhaos4.17.el9.x86_64`. However, a manual review of VEX data from link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9102[RHSA-2024:9102] indicated that this vulnerability was fixed in version `5:5.2.2-1.el9`. Therefore, the package version scanned was the first to contain the fix and was no longer affected.

=== CVEs reported only by Scanner V4

We randomly selected 10 CVEs from the 341 unique to Scanner V4 and conducted a detailed analysis using VEX data. The vulnerabilities fell into two categories:

* Affected packages with a fine-grained status indicating that no fix is planned
* Affected packages with no additional status details regarding a fix

For example, the following results were analyzed:

* The `git-core` package (version `2.43.5-1.el9_4`) was flagged for CVE-2024-50349 (link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-50349[VEX data]) and marked as "Affected" with a fine-grained status of "Fix deferred." This means a fix is not guaranteed due to higher-priority development work. The package is affected by three CVEs in total.

* The `vim-minimal` package (version `2:8.2.2637-20.el9_1`) was flagged for 109 CVEs, 108 of which have low CVSS scores. Most are marked as "Affected" with a fine-grained status of "Will not fix."

* The `krb5-libs` package (version `1.21.1-2.el9_4.1`) was flagged for CVE-2025-24528 (link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2025-24528[VEX data]), but no fine-grained status was available. Given that this CVE was recently discovered at the time of this analysis, its status might be updated soon.

=== CVEs reported by both scanners

We manually verified three randomly selected packages, finding that the OVAL v2 data used in the StackRox Scanner and the VEX data used in Scanner V4 provided consistent explanations for the detected CVEs. In some cases, CVSS scores differed slightly, which is expected due to variations in VEX publisher data.

== Verifying the status of vulnerabilities

As a best practice, verify the fine-grained statuses of vulnerabilities in node host components that are critical to your environment using publicly available VEX data. VEX data is accessible in both human-readable and machine-readable formats.
