= Switching the Ingress Controller from using a Network Load Balancer to a Classic Load Balancer

You can switch the Ingress Controller that is using a Network Load Balancer (NLB) to one that uses a Classic Load Balancer (CLB) on AWS.

Switching between these load balancers will not delete the `IngressController` object.

[WARNING]
====
This procedure might cause an outage that can last several minutes due to new DNS records propagation, new load balancers provisioning, and other factors. IP addresses and canonical names of the Ingress Controller load balancer might change after applying this procedure.
====

.Procedure

. Modify the existing Ingress Controller that you want to switch to using a CLB. This example assumes that your default Ingress Controller has an `External` scope and no other customizations:
+
.Example `ingresscontroller.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    loadBalancer:
      scope: External
      providerParameters:
        type: AWS
        aws:
          type: Classic
    type: LoadBalancerService
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify a value for the `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.loadBalancer.providerParameters.aws.type` field, the Ingress Controller uses the `spec.loadBalancer.platform.aws.type` value from the cluster `Ingress` configuration that was set during installation.
====
+
[TIP]
====
If your Ingress Controller has other customizations that you want to update, such as changing the domain, consider force replacing the Ingress Controller definition file instead.
====

. Apply the changes to the Ingress Controller YAML file by running the command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ingresscontroller.yaml
----
+
Expect several minutes of outages while the Ingress Controller updates.
