= Understanding workload hints

The following table describes how combinations of power consumption and real-time settings impact on latency.
[NOTE]
====
The following workload hints can be configured manually. See "Creating a performance profile" for further information. You can also work with workload hints using the Performance Profile Creator. See "Creating a performance profile" for further information.

    | Performance Profile creator setting| Hint | Environment | Description

    | Default
    a|[source,terminal]
----
workloadHints:
highPowerConsumption: false
realtime: false
----
    | High throughput cluster without latency requirements
    | Performance achieved through CPU partitioning only.



    | Low-latency
    a|[source,terminal]
----
workloadHints:
highPowerConsumption: false
realtime: true
----
    | Regional datacenters
    | Both energy savings and low-latency are desirable: compromise between power management, latency and throughput.


    | Ultra-low-latency
    a|[source,terminal]
----
workloadHints:
highPowerConsumption: true
realtime: true
----
    | Far edge clusters, latency critical workloads
    | Optimized for absolute minimal latency and maximum determinism at the cost of increased power consumption.
