= Preparing your cluster to gather support data

Clusters using a restricted network must import the default must-gather image to gather debugging data for Red Hat support. The must-gather image is not imported by default, and clusters on a restricted network do not have access to the internet to pull the latest image from a remote repository.

.Procedure

. If you have not added your mirror registry's trusted CA to your cluster's image configuration object as part of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration, perform the following steps:
.. Create the cluster's image configuration object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap registry-config --from-file=${MIRROR_ADDR_HOSTNAME}..5000=$path/ca.crt -n openshift-config
----

.. Add the required trusted CAs for the mirror in the cluster's image
configuration object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"registry-config"}}}' --type=merge
----

. Import the default must-gather image from your installation payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc import-image is/must-gather -n openshift
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you run the `oc adm must-gather` command, you must use the `--image` flag and point to the payload image, as in the following example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=$(oc adm release info --image-for must-gather)
----
====
