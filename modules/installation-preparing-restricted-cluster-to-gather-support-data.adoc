= Preparing your cluster to gather support data

Clusters using a restricted network must import the default must-gather image in order to gather debugging data for Red Hat support. The must-gather image is not imported by default, and clusters on a restricted network do not have access to the internet to pull the latest image from a remote repository.

.Procedure
