[id="installation-preparing-restricted-cluster-to-gather-support-data_{context}"]
= Preparing your cluster to gather support data

Clusters using a restricted network must import the default must-gather image in order to gather debugging data for Red Hat support. The must-gather image is not imported by default, and clusters on a restricted network do not have access to the internet to pull the latest image from a remote repository.

.Procedure

* Import the default must-gather image from your installation payload:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc import-image is/must-gather -n openshift
----

When running the `oc adm must-gather` command, use the `--image` flag and point to the payload image, as in the following example:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=$(oc adm release info --image-for must-gather)
----
