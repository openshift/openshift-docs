= Creating an Ingress route with a custom certificate
The `route.openshift.io/destination-ca-certificate-secret` annotation can be used to define an Ingress route with a custom certificate (CA).

.Prerequisites
* You must have a certificate/key pair in PEM-encoded files, where the certificate is valid for the route host.
* You may have a separate CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file that completes the certificate chain.
* You must have a separate destination CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file.
* You must have a service that you want to expose.


.Procedure

. Add the `route.openshift.io/destination-ca-certificate-secret` to the Ingress object annotations:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: frontend
  annotations:
    route.openshift.io/termination: "reencrypt"
    route.openshift.io/destination-ca-certificate-secret: secret-ca-cert <1>
...
----
<1> The annotation references a kubernetes secret.

+
. The Ingress-to-route controller inserts the value of the secret object into the target route
+
