= Viewing Node CVEs

You can identify vulnerabilities in your nodes by using {product-title-short}. The vulnerabilities that are identified include the following:

* Vulnerabilities in core Kubernetes components
* Vulnerabilities in container runtimes such as Docker, CRI-O, runC, and containerd

For more information about operating systems that {product-title-short} can scan, see "Supported operating systems".

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, click *Vulnerability Management* -> *Node CVEs*.
. To view the data, do any of the following tasks:
* To view a list of all the CVEs affecting all of your nodes, select *<number> CVEs*.
* To view a list of nodes that contain CVEs, select *<number> Nodes*.
. Optional: You can filter CVEs according to entity by using the appropriate filters and attributes. To add more filtering criteria, follow these steps:
.. Select the entity or attribute from the list.
.. Depending on your choices, enter the appropriate information such as text, or select a date or object.
.. Click the right arrow icon.
.. Optional: Select additional entities and attributes, and then click the right arrow icon to add them.
The filter entities and attributes are listed in the following table.
