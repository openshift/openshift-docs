. In the *General* section:
.. In the *Perspective* field, you can set the default perspective you want to be logged in to. You can select the *Administrator* or the *Developer* perspective as required. If a perspective is not selected, you are logged into the perspective you last visited.
.. In the *Project* field, select a project you want to work in. The console will default to the project every time you log in.
.. In the *Topology* field, you can set the topology view to default to the graph or list view. If not selected, the console defaults to the last view you used.
.. In the *Create/Edit resource method* field, you can set a preference for creating or editing a resource. If both the form and YAML options are available, the console defaults to your selection.
. In the Language section, select *Default browser language* to use the default browser language settings. Otherwise, select the language that you want to use for the console.
