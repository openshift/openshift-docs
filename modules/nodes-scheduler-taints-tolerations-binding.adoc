= Binding a user to a Node using taints and tolerations

You can configure a node so that particular users can use only the dedicated nodes.

.Procedure

To configure a node so that users can use only that node:

. Add a taint to those nodes:
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 dedicated=groupName:NoSchedule
----

. Add a corresponding toleration to the pods by writing a custom admission controller.
+
The admission controller should add a node affinity to require that the pods can only schedule onto nodes labeled with the `key:value` label (`dedicated=groupName`).

. Add a label similar to the taint (such as the `key:value` label) to the dedicated nodes.
