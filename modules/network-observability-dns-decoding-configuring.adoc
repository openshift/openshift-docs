= Configuring DNS domain tracking for network observability

[role="_abstract"]
Enable DNS tracking in the Network Observability Operator to monitor DNS query names, response codes, and latency for network flows within the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* The Network Observability Operator is installed.
* You have `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You are familiar with the `FlowCollector` custom resource.

.Procedure

. Edit the `FlowCollector` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit flowcollector cluster
----

. Configure the eBPF agent to enable the DNS tracking feature:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1alpha1
kind: FlowCollector
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  agent:
    type: eBPF
    ebpf:
      features:
        - DNSTracking
----
+
where:

`spec.agent.type.ebpf.features`:: Specifies the list of features to enable for the eBPF agent. To enable DNS tracking, add `DNSTracking` to this list.

. Optional: If your environment uses a non-standard port for DNS, such as a custom service mesh or local proxy, specify the port and increase the cache capacity:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1alpha1
kind: FlowCollector
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  agent:
    type: eBPF
    ebpf:
      features:
        - DNSTracking
      dnsTrackingPort: 53
  processor:
    logTypes: Flows
    advanced:
      env:
        - name: CACHE_MAX_FLOWS
          value: "100000"
----
+
where:

`spec.agent.typle.ebpf.features`:: Specifies the list of features to enable for the eBPF agent. To enable DNS tracking, add `DNSTracking` to this list.

`spec.agent.ebpf.dnsTrackingPort`:: Specifies a custom port for DNS tracking. Use this field if your environment uses a DNS proxy or a service mesh, such as Istio.

`spec.processor.advanced.env`:: Defines environment variables for the flow processor. For example, use the `CACHE_MAX_FLOWS` variable to ensure the collector is configured to store enriched metadata for high-volume traffic.

. Save and exit the editor.

.Verification
. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Observe* -> *Network Traffic*.
. In the *Traffic Flows* view, click the *Manage columns* icon.
. Ensure that the *DNS Query Name*, *DNS Response Code*, and *DNS Latency* columns are selected.
. Filter the results by setting *Port* to `53`.
. Confirm that the flow table columns are populated with domain names and DNS metadata.
