= {ProductName}'s sidecar injection

{ProductName} relies on a proxy sidecar within the application's pod to provide {ProductShortName} capabilities to the application. You can enable automatic sidecar injection or manage it manually. Red Hat recommends automatic injection using the annotation with no need to label projects. This ensures that your application contains the appropriate configuration for the {ProductShortName} upon deployment. This method requires fewer privileges and does not conflict with other OpenShift capabilities such as builder pods.

[NOTE]
====
The upstream version of Istio injects the sidecar by default if you have labeled the project. {ProductName} requires you to opt in to having the sidecar automatically injected to a deployment, so you are not required to label the project. This avoids injecting a sidecar if it is not wanted (for example, in build or deploy pods).

The webhook checks the configuration of pods deploying into all projects to see if they are opting in to injection with the appropriate annotation.

== Setting environment variables on the proxy in applications through annotations

You can set environment variables on the sidecar proxy for applications by adding pod annotations in the deployment in the `injection-template.yaml` file. The environment variables are injected to the sidecar.
