[id="secondary-scheduler-1.4.1-new-features_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

* This release of the {secondary-scheduler-operator} updates the Kubernetes version to 1.32.

[id="secondary-scheduler-1.4.1-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes

* This release of the {secondary-scheduler-operator} addresses several Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).
* Previously, some secondary scheduler plugins could not be deployed if they needed to create temporary files. This was due to more restricted permissions that were introduced in a previous release. With this update, secondary schedulers deployed through the Operator can create temporary files again and these secondary scheduler plugins can now be deployed successfully. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-58154[*OCPBUGS-58154*])

[id="secondary-scheduler-operator-1.4.1-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

* Currently, you cannot deploy additional resources, such as config maps, CRDs, or RBAC policies through the {secondary-scheduler-operator}. Any resources other than roles and role bindings that are required by your custom secondary scheduler must be applied externally. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WRKLDS-645[WRKLDS-645])
