= Pruning DeploymentConfig objects

In order to prune `DeploymentConfig` objects that are no longer required by the system due to age and status, administrators can run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune deployments [<options>]
----

.Prune deployments CLI configuration options

|Option |Description

.^|`--confirm`
|Indicate that pruning should occur, instead of performing a dry-run.

.^|`--orphans`
|Prune all deployments that no longer have a `DeploymentConfig` object, has status of `Complete` or `Failed`, and has a replica count of zero.

.^|`--keep-complete=<N>`
|Per the `DeploymentConfig` object, keep the last `N` deployments that have a status of `Complete` and replica count of zero. (default `5`)

.^|`--keep-failed=<N>`
|Per the `DeploymentConfig` object, keep the last `N` deployments that have a status of `Failed` and replica count of zero. (default `1`)

.^|`--keep-younger-than=<duration>`
|Do not prune any object that is younger than `<duration>` relative to the current time. (default `60m`) Valid units of measurement include nanoseconds (`ns`), microseconds (`us`), milliseconds (`ms`), seconds (`s`), minutes (`m`), and hours (`h`).
|===

To see what a pruning operation would delete:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune deployments --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m
----

To actually perform the prune operation:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune deployments --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m --confirm
----
