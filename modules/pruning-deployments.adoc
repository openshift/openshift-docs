= Pruning deployment resources

You can prune resources associated with deployments that are no longer required by the system, due to age and status.

The following command prunes replication controllers associated with `DeploymentConfig` objects:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune deployments [<options>]
----

[NOTE]
====
To also prune replica sets associated with `Deployment` objects, use the `--replica-sets` flag. This flag is currently a Technology Preview feature.

|Option |Description

.^|`--confirm`
|Indicate that pruning should occur, instead of performing a dry-run.

.^|`--keep-complete=<N>`
|Per the `DeploymentConfig` object, keep the last `N` replication controllers that have a status of `Complete` and replica count of zero. The default is `5`.

.^|`--keep-failed=<N>`
|Per the `DeploymentConfig` object, keep the last `N` replication controllers that have a status of `Failed` and replica count of zero. The default is `1`.

.^|`--keep-younger-than=<duration>`
|Do not prune any replication controller that is younger than `<duration>` relative to the current time. Valid units of measurement include nanoseconds (`ns`), microseconds (`us`), milliseconds (`ms`), seconds (`s`), minutes (`m`), and hours (`h`). The default is `60m`.

.^|`--orphans`
|Prune all replication controllers that no longer have a `DeploymentConfig` object, has status of `Complete` or `Failed`, and has a replica count of zero.

ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
.^|`--replica-sets=true\|false`
|If `true`, replica sets are included in the pruning process. The default is `false`.

.Procedure

. To see what a pruning operation would delete, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune deployments --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m
----

. To actually perform the prune operation, add the `--confirm` flag:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune deployments --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m --confirm
----
