By using global search you can search across all resources in your environment. Based on the resource type you use in your search query, the results are grouped in the following categories:

* All results (Lists matching results across all categories)
* Clusters
* Deployments
* Images
* Namespaces
* Nodes
* Policies
* Policy categories ^[1]^
* Roles
* Role bindings
* Secrets
* Service accounts
* Users and groups
* Violations

1. The *Policy categories* option is only available if you use the following:
* PostgreSQL as a backend database in {rh-rhacscs-first}.
* {rh-rhacscs-first}.

These categories are listed as a table on the {product-title-short} portal global search page and you can click on the category name to identify results belonging to the selected category.

To do a global search, in the {product-title-short} portal, select *Search* on the top right side.
