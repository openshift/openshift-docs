= Release Notes for Red Hat {ServerlessProductName} 1.17.0

[id="new-features-1-17-0_{context}"]
== New features

* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving 0.23.0.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Eventing 0.23.0.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Kourier 0.23.0.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative `kn` CLI 0.23.0.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Kafka 0.23.0.
* The `kn func` CLI plug-in now uses `func` 0.17.0.
* In the upcoming {ServerlessProductName} 1.19.0 release, the URL scheme of external routes will default to HTTPS for enhanced security.
+
If you do not want this change to apply for your workloads, you can override the default setting before upgrading to 1.19.0, by adding the following YAML to your `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR):
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  config:
    network:
      defaultExternalScheme: "http"
...
----

* mTLS functionality is now Generally Available (GA).

* TypeScript templates are now available when you create a function using `kn func`.

* Changes to API versions in Knative Eventing 0.23.0:

** The `v1alpha1` version of the `KafkaChannel` API, which was deprecated in {ServerlessProductName} version 1.14.0, has been removed. If the `ChannelTemplateSpec` parameters of your config maps contain references to this older version, you must update this part of the spec to use the correct API version.

[id="known-issues-1-17-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

* If you try to use an older version of the Knative `kn` CLI with a newer {ServerlessProductName} release, the API is not found and an error occurs.
+
For example, if you use the 1.16.0 release of the `kn` CLI, which uses version 0.22.0, with the 1.17.0 {ServerlessProductName} release, which uses the 0.23.0 versions of the Knative Serving and Knative Eventing APIs, the CLI does not work because it continues to look for the outdated 0.22.0 API versions.
+
Ensure that you are using the latest `kn` CLI version for your {ServerlessProductName} release to avoid issues.

* Kafka channel metrics are not monitored or shown in the corresponding web console dashboard in this release. This is due to a breaking change in the Kafka dispatcher reconciling process.

* If you create a new subscription for a Kafka channel, or a new Kafka source, there might be a delay in the Kafka data plane becoming ready to dispatch messages after the newly created subscription or sink reports a ready status.
+
As a result, messages that are sent during the time when the data plane is not reporting a ready status might not be delivered to the subscriber or sink.
+
For more information about this issue and possible workarounds, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6343981[Knowledge Article #6343981].

* The Camel-K 1.4 release is not compatible with {ServerlessProductName} version 1.17.0. This is because Camel-K 1.4 uses APIs that were removed in Knative version 0.23.0. There is currently no workaround available for this issue. If you need to use Camel-K 1.4 with {ServerlessProductName}, do not upgrade to {ServerlessProductName} version 1.17.0.
+
[NOTE]
====
The issue has been fixed, and Camel-K version 1.4.1 is compatible with {ServerlessProductName} 1.17.0.
