= Configuring router ports

You can control which ports your devices use by configuring the router ingress fields.

.Prerequisites

* You installed {microshift-short}.
* You created a {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file.
* The {oc-first} is installed.

[TIP]
====
If you complete all the configurations that you need to make in the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file at the same time, you can minimize system restarts.

.Procedure
