= Removing obsolete content

If a change to the `PolicyGenTemplate` configuration results in obsolete policies, for example policies are
renamed, use the following procedure to remove those policies in an automated way.

.Procedure

. Remove the affected PolicyGenTemplates from the Git repository, commit and push to the remote repository.

. Wait for the changes to synchronize through the application and the affected policies to be removed from the
hub cluster.

. Add the updated PolicyGenTemplates back to  the Git repository, commit and push to the remote repository.

Removing the zero touch provisioning (ZTP) distributed unit (DU) profile policies from the Git repository,
and as a result also removing them from the hub cluster, does not affect any configuration of the managed
spoke clusters. Removing a policy from the hub does not delete from the spoke cluster the custom resources (CRs)
managed by that policy.

As an alternative, after making changes to PolicyGenTemplates that result in obsolete policies, you can
remove these policies from the hub cluster manually. You can delete policies under the *Governance* tab
in the {rh-rhacm} UI  or by using the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete policy -n <namespace> <policyName>
----
