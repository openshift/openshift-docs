[id="accessing-metrics-from-outside-cluster_{context}"]
= Accessing metrics from outside the cluster for custom applications

You can query Prometheus metrics from outside the cluster when monitoring your own services with user-defined projects. Access this data from outside the cluster by using the `thanos-querier` route.

This access only supports using a bearer token for authentication.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed your own service, following the "Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects" procedure.
* You are logged in to an account with the `cluster-monitoring-view` cluster role, which provides permission to access the Thanos Querier API.
* You are logged in to an account that has permission to get the Thanos Querier API route.
+
[NOTE]
====
If your account does not have permission to get the Thanos Querier API route, a cluster administrator can provide the URL for the route.

.Procedure

. Extract an authentication token to connect to Prometheus by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ TOKEN=$(oc whoami -t)
----

. Extract the `thanos-querier` API route URL by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ HOST=$(oc -n openshift-monitoring get route thanos-querier -ojsonpath={.status.ingress[].host})
----

. Set the namespace to the namespace in which your service is running by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ NAMESPACE=ns1
----

. Query the metrics of your own services in the command line by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -k "https://$HOST/api/v1/query?" --data-urlencode "query=up{namespace='$NAMESPACE'}"
----
+
The output shows the status for each application pod that Prometheus is scraping:
