= An overview of the Ingress options for a cluster

{product-title} provides the following methods for communicating from
outside the cluster with services running in the cluster.

The methods are recommended, in order or preference:

* If you have HTTP/HTTPS, use an Ingress Controller with Route objects.
* If you have a TLS-encrypted protocol other than HTTPS, use an Ingress Controller with Route objects using TLS passthrough.
* If you have neither HTTP nor TLS with an SNI header, use a Load Balancer, Node Port, or Host Port.
