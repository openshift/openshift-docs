= Using cookies to keep route statefulness

{product-title} provides sticky sessions, which enables stateful application
traffic by ensuring all traffic hits the same endpoint. However, if the endpoint
Pod terminates, whether through restart, scaling, or a change in configuration,
this statefulness can disappear.

{product-title} can use cookies to configure session persistence. The Ingress
controller selects an endpoint to handle any user requests, and creates a cookie
for the session. The cookie is passed back in the response to the request and
the user sends the cookie back with the next request in the session. The cookie
tells the Ingress Controller which endpoint is handling the session, ensuring
that client requests use the cookie so that they are routed to the same pod.
