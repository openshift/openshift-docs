= Customizing the member roll for a cluster-wide mesh

In cluster-wide mode, when you create the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource is also created. You can modify the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource after it gets created. After you modify the resource, the {SMProductShortName} operator no longer changes it. If you modify the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource by using the {product-title} web console, accept the prompt to overwrite the modifications.

Alternatively, you can create a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource before deploying the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. When you create the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, the {SMProductShortName} Operator will not modify the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`.

[NOTE]
====
The `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource name must be named `default` and must be created in the same project namespace as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.
====

There are two ways to add a namespace to the mesh. You can either add the namespace by specifying its name in the `spec.members` list, or configure a set of namespace label selectors to include or exclude namespaces based on their labels.

[NOTE]
====
Regardless of how members are specified in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource, you can also add members to the mesh by creating the `ServiceMeshMember` resource in each namespace.
