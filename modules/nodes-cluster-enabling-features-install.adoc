= Enabling feature sets at installation

[role="_abstract"]
You can enable feature sets for all nodes in the cluster by editing the `install-config.yaml` file before you deploy the cluster. This allows you to use non-default features in your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have an `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

. Use the `featureSet` parameter to specify the name of the feature set you want to enable, such as `TechPreviewNoUpgrade`:

[WARNING]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on your cluster cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. You should not enable this feature set on production clusters.
