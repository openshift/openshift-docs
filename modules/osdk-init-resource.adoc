= Initializing required custom resources

An Operator might require the user to instantiate a custom resource before the
Operator can be fully functional. However, it can be challenging for a user to
determine what is required or how to define the resource.

As an Operator developer, you can specify a single required custom resource that
must be created at the time that the Operator is installed by adding the
`operatorframework.io/initialization-resource` annotation to the
ClusterServiceVersion (CSV). The annotation must include a template that
contains a complete YAML definition that is required to initialize the resource
during installation.

If this annotation is defined, after installing the Operator from the
{product-title} web console, the user is prompted to create the resource using
the template provided in the CSV.

.Procedure

* Add the `operatorframework.io/initialization-resource` annotation to the CSV of
your Operator to specify a required custom resource. For example, the following
annotation requires the creation of a `StorageCluster` resource and provides a
full YAML definition:
