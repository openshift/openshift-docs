= Initializing required custom resources

An Operator might require the user to instantiate a custom resource before the Operator can be fully functional. However, it can be challenging for a user to determine what is required or how to define the resource.

As an Operator developer, you can specify a single required custom resource that must be created at the time that the Operator is installed by adding the `operatorframework.io/initialization-resource` annotation to the cluster service version (CSV). The annotation must include a template that contains a complete YAML definition that is required to initialize the resource during installation.

If this annotation is defined, after installing the Operator from the {product-title} web console, the user is prompted to create the resource using the template provided in the CSV.

.Procedure

* Add the `operatorframework.io/initialization-resource` annotation to the CSV of your Operator to specify a required custom resource. For example, the following annotation requires the creation of a `StorageCluster` resource and provides a full YAML definition:
