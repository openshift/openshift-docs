= Setting environment variables on the proxy in applications through annotations

You can set environment variables on the sidecar proxy for applications by adding pod annotations in the deployment in the `injection-template.yaml` file. The environment variables are injected to the sidecar.

[WARNING]
====
`maistra.io/` labels and annotations should never be included in user-created resources, because they indicate that the resources are generated and managed by the Operator. If you are copying content from an Operator-generated resource when creating your own resources, do not include labels or annotations that start with `maistra.io/` or your resource will be overwritten or deleted by the Operator during the next reconciliation.
