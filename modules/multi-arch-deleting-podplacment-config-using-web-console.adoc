= Deleting the ClusterPodPlacementConfig object by using the web console

You can create only one instance of the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object. If you want to re-create this object, you must first delete the existing instance.

You can delete this object by using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.
* You have created the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators*.

. On the *Installed Operators* page, click *Multiarch Tuning Operator*. 

. Click the *Cluster Pod Placement Config* tab.

. Select *Delete ClusterPodPlacementConfig* from the options menu.

. Click *Delete*.

.Verification

* On the *Cluster Pod Placement Config* page, check that the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object has been deleted.

.Next steps

* After deleting the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object, ensure that none of the pods are in the `Pending` phase due to the `SchedulingGated` reason. You can delete the scheduling gate from all the gated pods by running the following command in the {oc-first}:
