= Checking the compliance status of your infrastructure

By performing a compliance scan, you can check the compliance status of your entire infrastructure for all compliance standards. When you run a compliance scan, {rh-rhacs-first} creates a data snapshot of your environment. The data snapshot includes alerts, images, network policies, deployments, and related host-based data.

Central collects the host-based data from Sensors running in your clusters. Central then collects further data from the compliance container running in each Collector pod. 

The compliance container collects the following data about your environment:

* Configurations for the container daemon, container runtime and container image.
* Information about container networks.
* Command-line arguments and processes for the container runtime, Kubernetes, and {ocp}.
* Permissions for specific file paths.
* Configuration files for Kubernetes and {ocp} core services.
* After data collection is complete, Central checks the data to determine the results. You can view the results in the compliance dashboard and create compliance reports based on the results.


[NOTE]
====
* The following terms are associated with a compliance scan:
Control:: Describes a single line item in an industry or regulatory standard that an auditor uses to evaluate an information system for compliance with that standard. {product-title-short} verifies evidence of compliance with a single control by performing one or more checks.
Check:: Is the single test performed during a single control assessment.
* Some controls have multiple checks associated with them. If one of the associated checks for a control fails, the entire control state is marked as Fail.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, click *Compliance -> Dashboard*.
. Optional: By default, information on all standards is displayed in the compliance results. 
+
To display information about specific standards only, perform the following steps:

.. Click *Manage standards*.
.. By default, all standards are selected. Clear the checkbox for any specific standard that you do not want to display.
.. Click *Save*.
+
Standards that are not selected do not appear in the dashboard display, including the widgets, in the compliance results tables accessible from the dashboard, and in the PDF files created by using the *Export* button. However, when exporting the results as a CSV file, all default standards are included. 

. Click *Scan environment*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Scanning the entire environment takes about 2 minutes to complete. This time might vary depending on the number of clusters and nodes in your environment.
====

.Verification

. In the {product-title-short} portal, click *Configuration Management*.
. In the *CIS Kubernetes v1.5* widget, click *Scan*.
. {product-title-short} displays a message which indicates that a compliance scan is in progress.
