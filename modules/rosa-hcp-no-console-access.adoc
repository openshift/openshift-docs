= Troubleshooting access to {hybrid-console}

In {product-title} clusters, the {product-title} OAuth server is hosted in the Red Hat service's AWS account while the web console service is published using the cluster's default ingress controller in the cluster's AWS account. If you can log in to your cluster using the OpenShift CLI (oc) but cannot access the {product-title} web console, verify the following criteria are met:

* The console workloads are running.
* The default ingress controller's load balancer is active.
* You are accessing the console from a machine that has network connectivity to the cluster's VPC network.
