= Verifying the supported architecture for an Agent-based installation

Before installing an {product-title} cluster using the Agent-based Installer, you can verify the supported architecture on which you can install the cluster. This procedure is optional.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {oc-first}.
* You have downloaded the installation program.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {oc-first}.

. Check your release payload by running the following command:
[source,terminal]
+
----
$ ./openshift-install version
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
./openshift-install 4.17.0
built from commit abc123def456
release image quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:123abc456def789ghi012jkl345mno678pqr901stu234vwx567yz0
release architecture amd64
----
+
If you are using the release image with the `multi` payload, the `release architecture` displayed in the output of this command is the default architecture.

. To check the architecture of the payload, run the following command:
[source,terminal]
+
----
$ oc adm release info <release_image> -o jsonpath="{ .metadata.metadata}" <1>
----
<1> Replace `<release_image>` with the release image. For example: `quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:123abc456def789ghi012jkl345mno678pqr901stu234vwx567yz0`.
+
.Example output when the release image uses the `multi` payload
[source,terminal]
----
{"release.openshift.io architecture":"multi"}
----
+
If you are using the release image with the `multi` payload, you can install the cluster on different architectures such as `arm64`, `amd64`, `s390x`, and `ppc64le`. Otherwise, you can install the cluster only on the `release architecture` displayed in the output of the `openshift-install version` command.
