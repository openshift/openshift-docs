= Troubleshooting cluster creation with an AWSNATGatewayLimitExceeded error

If a cluster creation action fails, you might receive the following error messages.

.Example install logs output
[source,terminal]
----
Failed to create cluster: Error creating NAT Gateway: NatGatewayLimitExceeded: Performing this operation would exceed the limit of 5 NAT gateways.
----

.Example {cluster-manager} output
[source,terminal]
----
Provisioning Error Code:    OCM3019
Provisioning Error Message: NAT gateway limit exceeded. Clean unused NAT gateways or increase quota and try again.
----

This error indicates that you have reached the quota for the number of NAT gateways for that availability zone.

.Procedure

. To fix this issue, try one of the following methods:

* Request an increase in the **NAT gateways per Availability Zone quota** page by using the **Service Quotas** console (AWS).

* Check the status of your NAT gateway. A status of `Pending`, `Available`, or `Deleting` counts against your quota. If you have recently deleted a NAT gateway, wait a few minutes for the status to go from `Deleting` to `Deleted`. Then try creating a new NAT gateway.

* If you do not need your NAT gateway in a specific availability zone, try creating a NAT gateway in an availability zone where you have not reached your quota.
