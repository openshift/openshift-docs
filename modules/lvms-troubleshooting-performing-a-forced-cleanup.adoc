= Performing a forced cleanup

If disk- or node-related problems persist after you complete the troubleshooting procedures, it might be necessary to perform a forced cleanup procedure. A forced cleanup is used to comprehensively address persistent issues and ensure the proper functioning of the LVMS.

.Prerequisites

. All of the persistent volume claims (PVCs) created using the logical volume manager storage (LVMS) driver have been removed.

. The pods using those PVCs have been stopped.


.Procedure

. Switch to the `openshift-storage` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project openshift-storage
----

. Ensure there is no `Logical Volume` custom resource (CR) remaining by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get logicalvolume
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
No resources found
----

.. If there are any `LogicalVolume` CRs remaining, remove their finalizers by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch logicalvolume <name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge <1>
----
<1> Replace `<name>` with the name of the CR.

.. After removing their finalizers, delete the CRs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete logicalvolume <name> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<name>` with the name of the CR.

. Make sure there are no `LVMVolumeGroup` CRs left by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get lvmvolumegroup
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
No resources found
----

.. If there are any `LVMVolumeGroup` CRs left, remove their finalizers by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch lvmvolumegroup <name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge <1>
----
<1> Replace `<name>` with the name of the CR.

.. After removing their finalizers, delete the CRs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete lvmvolumegroup <name> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<name>` with the name of the CR.

. Remove any `LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus` CRs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete lvmvolumegroupnodestatus --all
----

. Remove the `LVMCluster` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete lvmcluster --all
----
