= Performing a forced clean-up

If the disk or node-related problems persist even after you have completed the troubleshooting procedures, you must perform a forced clean-up. A forced clean-up is used to address persistent issues and ensure the proper functioning of {lvms-first}.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

* You have logged in to the {oc-first} as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

* You have deleted all the persistent volume claims (PVCs) that were created by using {lvms}.

* You have stopped the pods that are using the PVCs that were created by using {lvms}.


.Procedure

. Switch to the `openshift-storage` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project openshift-storage
----

. Check if the `LogicalVolume` custom resources (CRs) are present by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get logicalvolume
----

.. If the `LogicalVolume` CRs are present, delete them by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete logicalvolume <name> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<name>` with the name of the `LogicalVolume` CR.

.. After deleting the `LogicalVolume` CRs, remove their finalizers by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch logicalvolume <name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge <1>
----
<1> Replace `<name>` with the name of the `LogicalVolume` CR.

. Check if the `LVMVolumeGroup` CRs are present by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get lvmvolumegroup
----

.. If the `LVMVolumeGroup` CRs are present, delete them by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete lvmvolumegroup <name> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<name>` with the name of the `LVMVolumeGroup` CR.

.. After deleting the `LVMVolumeGroup` CRs, remove their finalizers by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch lvmvolumegroup <name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge <1>
----
<1> Replace `<name>` with the name of the `LVMVolumeGroup` CR. 

. Delete any `LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus` CRs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete lvmvolumegroupnodestatus --all
----

. Delete the `LVMCluster` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete lvmcluster --all
----

.. After deleting the `LVMCluster` CR, remove its finalizer by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch lvmcluster <name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge <1>
----
<1> Replace `<name>` with the name of the `LVMCluster` CR.
