= Searching for results

[role="_abstract"]
You can search for results using Common Expression Language (CEL) queries. For example, you can find results for pipeline runs that did not succeed. However, most of the relevant information is not contained in result objects; to search by the names, completion times, and other data, search for records.

.Prerequisites

* You installed {tekton-results}.
* You installed the `opc` utility and prepared its environment to query {tekton-results}.

.Procedure

* Search for results using a CEL query by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ opc results list --addr ${RESULTS_API} --filter="<cel_query>" <namespace-name>
----

Replace `<namespace_name>` with the namespace in which the pipeline runs or task runs were created.

.Example CEL queries for results
|===
| Purpose | CEL query

| The results of all runs that failed
| `!(summary.status == SUCCESS)`

| The results all pipeline runs that contained the annotations `ann1` and `ann2`
| `summary.annotations.contains('ann1') && summary.annotations.contains('ann2') && summary.type=='PIPELINE_RUN'`
|===
