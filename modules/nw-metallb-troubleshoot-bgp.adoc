= Troubleshooting BGP issues

The BGP implementation that Red Hat supports uses FRRouting (FRR) in a container in the `speaker` pods.
As a cluster administrator, if you need to troubleshoot BGP configuration issues, you need to run commands in the FRR container.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Display the names of the `speaker` pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n metallb-system pods -l app.kubernetes.io/component=speaker
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]

speaker-gvfnf   4/4     Running   0          56m
...

. Display the running configuration for FRR:

$ oc exec -n metallb-system speaker-66bth -c frr -- vtysh -c "show running-config"

<.> The `router bgp` section indicates the ASN for MetalLB.
<.> Confirm that a `neighbor <ip-address> remote-as <peer-ASN>` line exists for each BGP peer custom resource that you added.
<.> If you configured BFD, confirm that the BFD profile is associated with the correct BGP peer and that the BFD profile appears in the command output.
<.> Confirm that the `network <ip-address-range>` lines match the IP address ranges that you specified in address pool custom resources that you added.

<1> Confirm that the output includes a line for each BGP peer custom resource that you added.
<2> Output that shows `0` messages received and messages sent indicates a BGP peer that does not have a BGP session.
Check network connectivity and the BGP configuration of the BGP peer.
