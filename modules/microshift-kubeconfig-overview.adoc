= Kubeconfig files for configuring cluster access

The two categories of `kubeconfig` files used in {microshift-short} are local access and remote access. Every time {microshift-short} starts, a set of `kubeconfig` files for local and remote access to the API server are generated. These files are generated in the `/var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/` directory using preexisting configuration information.

Each access type requires a different authentication certificate signed by different Certificate Authorities (CAs). The generation of multiple `kubeconfig` files accommodates this need.

You can use the appropriate `kubeconfig` file for the access type needed in each case to provide authentication details. The contents of {microshift-short} `kubeconfig` files are determined by either default built-in values or a `config.yaml` file.

[NOTE]
====
A `kubeconfig` file must exist for the cluster to be accessible. The values are applied from built-in default values or a `config.yaml`, if one was created.
