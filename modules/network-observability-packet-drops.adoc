[id="network-observability-packet-drops_{context}"]
= Working with packet drops
Packet loss occurs when one or more packets of network flow data fail to reach their destination. You can track these drops by editing the `FlowCollector` to the specifications in the following YAML example.

.Procedure
. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster*, and then select the *YAML* tab.
. Configure the `FlowCollector` custom resource for packet drops, for example:

<1> You can start reporting the packet drops of each network flow by listing the `PacketDrop` parameter in the `spec.agent.ebpf.features` specification list.
<2> The `spec.agent.ebpf.privileged` specification value must be `true` for packet drop tracking.

.Verification
* When you refresh the *Network Traffic* page, the *Overview*, *Traffic Flow*, and *Topology* views display new information about packet drops:
.. Select new choices in *Manage panels* to choose which graphical visualizations of packet drops to display in the *Overview*.
.. Select new choices in *Manage columns* to choose which packet drop information to display in the *Traffic flows* table.
... In the *Traffic Flows* view, you can also expand the side panel to view more information about packet drops.
.. In the *Topology* view, red lines are displayed where drops are present.
