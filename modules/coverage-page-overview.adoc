= OpenShift Coverage page overview

When you view the *Coverage* page and apply a filter to a schedule, all results are filtered accordingly. This filter remains active for all coverage pages until you delete it. You can always view the results based on a single profile. 

You can select profiles grouped according to their associated benchmarks by using the toggle group. You calculate the compliance percentage based on the number of passed checks in relation to the total number of checks.

[NOTE]
====
The *Coverage* page now only shows the results of the last scan. If the last scan fails, the {rh-rhacs-first} deletes the previous results and you cannot see any information for this scan on the *Coverage* page.
====

The *Checks* view lists the profile checks and enables you to easily navigate and understand your compliance status.

The profile check information is organized into the following groups:

Check:: The name of the profile check.
Controls:: Shows the various controls associated with each check.
Fail status:: Shows the checks that have failed and require your attention.
Pass status:: Shows the checks that have been successfully passed.
Manual status:: Shows the checks that require a manual review because additional organizational or technical knowledge is required that you cannot automate.
Other status:: Shows the checks with a status other than pass or fail, such as warnings or informational statuses.
Compliance:: Shows the overall compliance status and helps you to ensure that your environment meets the required standards.

The *Clusters* view lists the clusters and enables you to effectively monitor and manage your clusters.

The cluster information is organized into the following groups:

Cluster:: The name of the cluster.
Last scanned:: Indicates when the individual clusters were last scanned.
Fail status:: Shows the clusters whose scan has failed and which require your attention.
Pass status:: Shows the clusters that have successfully passed all checks.
Manual status:: Shows the checks that require a manual review because additional organizational or technical knowledge is required that you cannot automate.
Other status:: Shows the clusters that have a status other than pass or fail, such as warnings or informational alerts.
Compliance:: Shows the overall compliance status of your clusters and helps you to ensure that they meet the required standards.
