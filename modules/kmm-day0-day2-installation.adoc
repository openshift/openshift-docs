= Day 0 through Day 2 kmod installation

You can install some kernel modules (kmods) during Day 0 through Day 2 operations without Kernel Module Management (KMM). This could assist in the transition of the kmods to KMM.

Use the following criteria to determine suitable kmod installations.

Day 0:: The most basic kmods that are required for a node to become `Ready` in the cluster. Examples of these types of kmods include:
+
* A storage driver that is required to mount the rootFS as part of the boot process
* A network driver that is required for the machine to access `machine-config-server` on the bootstrap node to pull the ignition and join the cluster

Day 1:: Kmods that are not required for a node to become `Ready` in the cluster but cannot be unloaded when the node is `Ready`.
+
An example of this type of kmod is an out-of-tree (OOT) network driver that replaces an outdated in-tree driver to exploit the full potential of the NIC while `NetworkManager` depends on it. When the node is `Ready`, you cannot unload the driver because of the `NetworkManager` dependency.

Day 2:: Kmods that can be dynamically loaded to the kernel or removed from it without interfering with the cluster infrastructure, for example, connectivity.
+
Examples of these types of kmods include:
+
* GPU operators
* Secondary network adapters
* field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)
