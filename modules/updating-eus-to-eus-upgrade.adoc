[id="updating-eus-to-eus-upgrade_{context}"]
= EUS-to-EUS update

The following procedure pauses all non-master machine config pools and performs updates from {product-title} <4.y> to <4.y+1> to <4.y+2>, then unpauses the previously paused machine config pools.
Following this procedure reduces the total update duration and the number of times worker nodes are restarted.

.Prerequisites

* Review the release notes for {product-title} <4.y+1> and <4.y+2>
* Review the release notes and product lifecycles for any layered products and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operators. Some may require updates either before or during an EUS-to-EUS update.
* Ensure that you are familiar with version-specific prerequisites, such as the removal of deprecated APIs, that are required prior to updating from {product-title} <4.y+1> to <4.y+2>.
