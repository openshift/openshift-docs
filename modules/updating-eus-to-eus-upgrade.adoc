[id="updating-eus-to-eus-upgrade_{context}"]
= EUS-to-EUS update

The following procedure pauses all non-master MachineConfigPools and performs updates from {product-title} 4.8 to 4.9 to 4.10, then unpauses the previously paused MachineConfigPools.
Following this procedure reduces the total update duration and the number of times worker nodes are restarted.

.Prerequisites

* Review the release notes for {product-title} 4.9 and 4.10
* Review the release notes and product lifecycles for any layered products and OLM Operators. Some may require updates either before or during an EUS-to-EUS update.
* Ensure that you are familiar with version-specific prerequisites, such as link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/updating/updating-cluster-prepare.html#update-preparing-migrate_updating-cluster-prepare[administrator acknowledgement] that is required prior to upgrading from {product-title} 4.8 to 4.9.
* Verify that your cluster is not running a version earlier than {product-title} 4.8.14.
If your cluster is running a version than {product-title} 4.8.14, you must update to a later 4.8.z version prior to upgrading to 4.9.
The update to 4.8.14 or later is necessary to fulfill the minimum version requirements that must be performed without pausing MachineConfigPools.
* Verify that MachineConfigPools is unpaused.

.Procedure

. Upgrade any OLM Operators to versions that are compatible with both versions you are updating to.

. Verify that all MachineConfigPools display a status of `UPDATED` and no MachineConfigPools display a status of `UPDATING`.
To view the status of all MachineConfigPools, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp
----
+
.Example output

Output is trimmed for clarity:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     CONFIG                                         	UPDATED   UPDATING
master   rendered-master-ecbb9582781c1091e1c9f19d50cf836c       True  	  False
worker   rendered-worker-00a3f0c68ae94e747193156b491553d5       True  	  False
----

. To pause the MachineConfigPools you wish to skip reboots on, run the following commands:
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot pause the master pool.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch mcp/worker --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"paused":true}}'
----

. To change to the `eus-4.10` channel and update to 4.9, run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade channel eus-4.10
$ oc adm upgrade --to-latest
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
Updating to latest version 4.9.18
----

. To ensure the 4.9 updates are completed successfully retrieve the cluster version, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME  	  VERSION  AVAILABLE  PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.9.18   True       False         6m29s   Cluster version is 4.9.18
----

. If necessary, upgrade OLM operators using the Administrator perspective on the web console.

. To update to 4.10, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --to-latest
----

. To ensure the 4.10 update is completed successfully retrieve the cluster version, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME  	  VERSION  AVAILABLE  PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.10.1   True       False         6m29s   Cluster version is 4.10.1
----

. To unpause all previously paused MachineConfigPools, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch mcp/worker --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"paused":false}}'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If pools are not unpaused, the cluster is not permitted to update to any future minors and maintenance tasks such as certificate rotation are inhibited. This puts the cluster at risk for future degradation.
====

. To verify that your previously paused pools have updated and your cluster completed the update to 4.10, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]

$ oc get mcp
