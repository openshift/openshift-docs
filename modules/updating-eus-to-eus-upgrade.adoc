[id="updating-eus-to-eus-upgrade_{context}"]
= EUS-to-EUS update

The following procedure pauses all non-master MachineConfigPools and performs updates from {product-title} 4.8 to 4.9 to 4.10, then unpauses the previously paused MachineConfigPools.
Following this procedure reduces the total update duration and the number of times worker nodes are restarted.

.Prerequisites

* Review the release notes for {product-title} 4.9 and 4.10
* Review the release notes and product lifecycles for any layered products and OLM Operators. Some may require updates either before or during an EUS-to-EUS update.
* Ensure that you are familiar with version-specific prerequisites, such as link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/updating/updating-cluster-prepare.html#update-preparing-migrate_updating-cluster-prepare[administrator acknowledgement] that is required prior to updating from {product-title} 4.8 to 4.9.
* Verify that your cluster is running {product-title} version 4.8.14 or later.
If your cluster is running a version earlier than {product-title} 4.8.14, you must update to a later 4.8.z version before updating to 4.9.
The update to 4.8.14 or later is necessary to fulfill the minimum version requirements that must be performed without pausing MachineConfigPools.
* Verify that MachineConfigPools is unpaused.
* Update OpenShift CLI `oc` to the target version before each update.

.Procedure

. Upgrade any OLM Operators to versions that are compatible with both versions you are updating to.

. Verify that all machine config pools display a status of `UPDATED` and that no machine config pool displays a status of `UPDATING`.
To view the status of all machine config pools, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp
----
+
.Example output

Output is trimmed for clarity:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     CONFIG                                         	UPDATED   UPDATING
master   rendered-master-ecbb9582781c1091e1c9f19d50cf836c       True  	  False
worker   rendered-worker-00a3f0c68ae94e747193156b491553d5       True  	  False
----

. Change to the `eus-4.10` channel. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade channel eus-4.10
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `oc adm upgrade channel` command is only present in 4.9 or later.

If you receive an error message indicating that `eus-4.10` is not one of the
available channels, this indicates that Red Hat is still rolling out 4.8 to 4.10 EUS upgrades.
This rollout process generally takes 45-90 days starting at the GA date.

. Pause the machine config pools that you want to skip reboots on. Run the following commands:
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot pause the master pool.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch mcp/worker --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"paused":true}}'
----

. Update to version 4.9. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --to-latest
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
Updating to latest version 4.9.18
----

. Ensure that the 4.9 updates completed by reviewing the cluster version. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME  	  VERSION  AVAILABLE  PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.9.18   True       False         6m29s   Cluster version is 4.9.18
----

. If necessary, upgrade OLM Operators by using the Administrator perspective on the web console.

. Update to version 4.10. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --to-latest
----

. Ensure that the 4.10 update completed by retrieving the cluster version. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME  	  VERSION  AVAILABLE  PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.10.1   True       False         6m29s   Cluster version is 4.10.1
----

. Unpause all previously paused machine config pools. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch mcp/worker --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"paused":false}}'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If pools are not unpaused, the cluster is not permitted to update to any future minor versions, and maintenance tasks such as certificate rotation are inhibited. This puts the cluster at risk for future degradation.
====

. Verify that your previously paused pools updated and that your cluster completed the update to version 4.10. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp
