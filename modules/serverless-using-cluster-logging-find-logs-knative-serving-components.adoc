= Using cluster logging to find logs for Knative Serving components

.Procedure

. To open the Kibana UI, the visualization tool for Elasticsearch, use the following command to get the Kibana route:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-logging get route kibana
----

. Use the route's URL to navigate to the Kibana dashboard and log in.

. Ensure the index is set to *.all*. If the index is not set to *.all*, only the {product-title} system logs will be listed.

. You can filter the logs by using the `knative-serving` namespace. Enter `kubernetes.namespace_name:knative-serving` in the search box to filter results.
+
[NOTE]
====
Knative Serving uses structured logging by default. You can enable the parsing of these logs by customizing the cluster logging Fluentd settings. This makes the logs more searchable and enables filtering on the log level to quickly identify issues.
