= Deploying the dual-stack cluster

.Procedure

. Create a network with IPv4 and IPv6 subnets. The available address modes for the `ipv6-ra-mode` and `ipv6-address-mode` fields are: `dhcpv6-stateful`, `dhcpv6-stateless`, and `slaac`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The dualstack network MTU must accommodate both the minimum MTU for IPv6, which is 1280, and the OVN-Kubernetes encapsulation overhead, which is 100.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
DHCP must be enabled on the subnets.
====

. Create the API and Ingress VIPs ports.

. Add the IPv6 subnet to the router to enable router advertisements. If you are using a provider network, you can enable router advertisements by adding the network as an external gateway, which also enables external connectivity.


. To configure IPv4 and IPv6 address endpoints for cluster nodes, edit the `install-config.yaml` file. The following is an example of an `install-config.yaml` file:

[NOTE]
====
When using an installation host in an isolated dual-stack network, the IPv6 address may not be reassigned correctly upon reboot. 

To resolve this problem on {op-system-base-full} 8, create a file called `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/required-rhel8-ipv6.conf` that contains the following configuration:

[source,text]
----
[connection]
type=ethernet
[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=eui64
method=auto
----

To resolve this problem on {op-system-base} 9, create a file called `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/required-rhel9-ipv6.conf` that contains the following configuration:

[source,text]
----
[connection]
ipv6.addr-gen-mode=0
----

After you create and edit the file, reboot the installation host.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `ip=dhcp,dhcp6` kernel argument, which is set on all of the nodes, results in a single Network Manager connection profile that is activated on multiple interfaces simultaneously.
Because of this behavior, any additional network has the same connection enforced with an identical UUID. If you need an interface-specific configuration, create a new connection profile for that interface so that the default connection is no longer enforced on it.
