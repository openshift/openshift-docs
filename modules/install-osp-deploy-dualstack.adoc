= Deploying the dual-stack cluster

For dual-stack networking in {product-title} clusters, you can configure IPv4 and IPv6 address endpoints for cluster nodes. 

.Prerequisites

* You enabled Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) on the subnets.

.Procedure

. Create a network with IPv4 and IPv6 subnets. The available address modes for the `ipv6-ra-mode` and `ipv6-address-mode` fields are: `dhcpv6-stateful`, `dhcpv6-stateless`, and `slaac`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The dual-stack network MTU must accommodate both the minimum MTU for IPv6, which is `1280`, and the OVN-Kubernetes encapsulation overhead, which is `100`.
====
+

. Create the API and Ingress VIPs ports.

. Add the IPv6 subnet to the router to enable router advertisements. If you are using a provider network, you can enable router advertisements by adding the network as an external gateway, which also enables external connectivity.

. Choose one of the following `install-config.yaml` configurations:
+
.. For an IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack cluster where you set IPv4 as the primary endpoint for your cluster nodes, edit the `install-config.yaml` file in a similar way to the following example:

. Optional: When you use an installation host in an isolated dual-stack network, the IPv6 address might not be reassigned correctly upon reboot. To resolve this problem on {op-system-base-full} 8, complete the following steps:

.. Create a file called `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/required-rhel8-ipv6.conf` that includes the following configuration:

----
[connection]
type=ethernet
[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=eui64
method=auto
----
+
.. Reboot the installation host.
