= Deploying the dual-stack cluster

.Procedure

. Create a network with IPv4 and IPv6 subnets. The available address modes for `ipv6-ra-mode` and `ipv6-address-mode` fields are: `stateful`, `stateless` and `slaac`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The dualstack network MTU must accommodate both the minimum MTU for IPv6, which is 1280, and the OVN-Kubernetes encapsulation overhead, which is 100.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
DHCP must be enabled on the subnets.
====

. Create the API and Ingress VIPs ports.

. Add the IPv6 subnet to the router to enable router advertisements. If you are using a provider network, you can enable router advertisements by adding the network as an external gateway, which also enables external connectivity.


. To configure IPv4 and IPv6 address endpoints for cluster nodes, edit the `install-config.yaml` file. The following is an example of an `install-config.yaml` file.

<1> Dual-stack clusters are supported only with the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` value.
<2> You must specify an IP address range in the `cidr` field for both IPv4 and IPv6 address families.
<3> Specify the virtual IP (VIP) address endpoints for the Ingress VIP services to provide an interface to the cluster.
<4> Specify the virtual IP (VIP) address endpoints for the API VIP services to provide an interface to the cluster.
<5> Specify the dual-stack network details that are used by all the nodes across the cluster.
<6> The CIDR of any subnet specified in this field must match the CIDRs listed on `networks.machineNetwork`.
<7> You can specify a value for either `name` or `id`, or both.
