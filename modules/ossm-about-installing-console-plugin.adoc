You can install the {SMPluginShort} with the Kiali Operator by creating a `OSSMConsole` resource with the corresponding plugin settings. It is recommended to install the latest version of the Kiali Operator, even while installing a previous {SMPluginShort} version, as it includes the latest z-stream release.
