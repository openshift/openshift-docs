= Creating and associating an OpenShift Cluster Manager role

[role="_abstract"]

You need the OpenShift Cluster Manager role to create your cluster. 

.Procedure
. Run the following command to see if an OpenShift Cluster Manager role exists:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list ocm-role
----

. The UI displays the commands to create an OpenShift Cluster Manager role with two different levels of permissions:
+
* *Basic OpenShift Cluster Manager role:* Allows the OpenShift Cluster Manager to have read-only access to the account to check if the roles and policies that are required by {product-title} are present before creating a cluster. You will need to manually create the required roles, policies, and OIDC provider using the CLI.
* *Admin OpenShift Cluster Manager role:* Grants the OpenShift Cluster Manager additional permissions to create the required roles, policies, and OIDC provider for {product-title}. Using this makes the deployment of a {product-title} cluster quicker since the OpenShift Cluster Manager will be able to create the required resources for you.
+
To read more about these roles, see the "OpenShift Cluster Manager roles and permissions" documentation in the _Additional resources_.
+
For the purposes of this tutorial, use the *Admin OpenShift Cluster Manager role* for the simplest and quickest approach.

. Copy the command to create the Admin OpenShift Cluster Manager role from the sidebar or switch to your terminal and enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create ocm-role --mode auto --admin --yes
----
+
This command creates the OpenShift Cluster Manager role and associates it with your Red{nbsp}Hat account.
+
**Example output**
