= Choosing a base image

The base image you choose to build your application on contains a set of software that looks like a Linux system to your application. When you build your own image, your software is placed into that file system and sees that file system as though it were looking at its operating system. Choosing this base image has major impact on how secure, efficient and upgradeable your container is in the future.

Red Hat provides a new set of base images referred to as https://www.google.com/url?q=https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/getting_started_with_containers/index%23using_red_hat_base_container_images_standard_and_minimal&sa=D&ust=1557950770712000[Red Hat Universal Base Images] (UBI). These RHEL-based images are similar to base images Red Hat has offered in the past, with one major difference: they are freely redistributable without a Red Hat subscription. As a result, you can build your application on UBI images without having to worry about how they are shared. No need to create different images for different environments.

These UBI images have standard, init, and minimal versions. There is also a set of https://www.google.com/url?q=https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_software_collections/3/html-single/using_red_hat_software_collections_container_images/index&sa=D&ust=1557950770713000[Red Hat Software Collections] images that can be used as a foundation for applications that rely on specific runtime environments (such as Node.js, perl, python and other runtimes). Special versions of some of these runtime base images referred to as Source-to-image (S2I) images. With S2I images, you can insert your code into a base image environment that is ready to run that code.

S2I images are available for you to use directly from the OpenShift web UI by selecting Catalog → Developer Catalog, as shown in the following figure:
