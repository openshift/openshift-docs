= Creating an event sink for Apache Kafka by using the {product-title} web console

You can create a Kafka sink that sends events to a Kafka topic by using the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console. By default, a Kafka sink uses the binary content mode, which is more efficient than the structured mode.


As a developer, you can create an event sink to receive events from a particular source and send them to a Kafka topic.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName}, with Knative Serving, Knative Eventing, and Knative broker for Apache Kafka APIs, from the OperatorHub.
* You have created a Kafka topic in your Kafka environment.

.Procedure

. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to the *+Add* view.
. Click *Event Sink* in the *Eventing catalog*.
. Search for `KafkaSink` in the catalog items and click it.
. Click *Create Event Sink*.
. In the form view, type the URL of the bootstrap server, which is a combination of host name and port.

.Verification

. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to the *Topology* view.
. Click the created event sink to view its details in the right panel.
