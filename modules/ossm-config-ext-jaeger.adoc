. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Select the project where you installed the control plane, for example `istio-system`, from the Project menu.

. Click the {ProductName} Operator. In the *Istio Service Mesh Control Plane* column, click the name of your `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, for example `basic`.
