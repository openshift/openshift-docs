= Pausing the reconciliation of a hosted cluster and hosted control plane

If you are a cluster instance administrator, you can pause the reconciliation of a hosted cluster and hosted control plane. You might want to pause reconciliation when you back up and restore an etcd database or when you need to debug problems with a hosted cluster or hosted control plane.

.Procedure

. To pause reconciliation for a hosted cluster and hosted control plane, populate the `pausedUntil` field of the `HostedCluster` resource, as shown in the following examples. In the examples, the value for `pausedUntil` is defined in an environment variable prior to the command.
+
** To pause the reconciliation until a specific time, specify an RFC339 timestamp:
+
[source,terminal]
----
PAUSED_UNTIL="2022-03-03T03:28:48Z"
oc patch -n <hosted-cluster-namespace> hostedclusters/<hosted-cluster-name> -p '{"spec":{"pausedUntil":"'${PAUSED_UNTIL}'"}}' --type=merge
----
+
The reconciliation is paused until the specified time is passed.
+
** To pause the reconciliation indefinitely, pass a Boolean value of `true`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
PAUSED_UNTIL="true"
oc patch -n <hosted-cluster-namespace> hostedclusters/<hosted-cluster-name> -p '{"spec":{"pausedUntil":"'${PAUSED_UNTIL}'"}}' --type=merge
----
+
The reconciliation is paused until you remove the field from the `HostedCluster` resource.
+
When the pause reconciliation field is populated for the `HostedCluster` resource, the field is automatically added to the associated `HostedControlPlane` resource.

. To remove the `pausedUntil` field, enter the following patch command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc patch -n <hosted-cluster-namespace> hostedclusters/<hosted-cluster-name> -p '{"spec":{"pausedUntil":null}}' --type=merge
