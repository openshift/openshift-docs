= Configuring Scheduling Overrides for CertManager Components

After installing the {cert-manager-operator}, you can configure the scheduling of {cert-manager} components by configuring the `overrideScheduling` field in the {cert-manager} custom resource. This allows you to define `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` for the `controllerConfig`, `webhookConfig`, and `cainjectorConfig` sections.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {product-title} cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {cert-manager-operator} 1.12.0 or later.

.Procedure

. To configure scheduling overrides, modify the {cert-manager} custom resource. Use the `overrideScheduling` field within `controllerConfig`, `webhookConfig`, or `cainjectorConfig` to specify `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` for the respective component.

<1> Replace <key1>, <key2> and <value1> with the specific key-value pairs for `nodeSelector` and `tolerations`.

.Verification

. After applying the updated {cert-manager} custom resource, verify that the scheduling overrides are active:

.. Check the pod specifications for the {cert-manager} components:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl get pods -n openshift-cert-manager -o yaml | grep -A 10 "nodeSelector"
----

.. Confirm that the `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` settings match the configuration.
