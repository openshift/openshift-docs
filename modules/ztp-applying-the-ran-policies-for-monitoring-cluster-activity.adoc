= Applying the RAN policies for monitoring cluster activity

Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) uses {rh-rhacm-first} to apply the radio access network (RAN) policies using a policy-based governance approach to automatically monitor cluster activity.

The policy generator (PolicyGen) is a Kustomize plugin that facilitates creating {rh-rhacm}
policies from predefined custom resources.
There are three main items: Policy Categorization, Source CR policy, and PolicyGenTemplate.
PolicyGen relies on these to generate the policies and their placement bindings and rules.

The following diagram shows how the RAN policy generator interacts with GitOps and {rh-rhacm}.

RAN policies are categorized into three main groups:

Common:: A policy that exists in the Common category is applied to all cluster types to be represented by
the site plan. Cluster types include single node, three-node, and standard clusters.

Groups:: A policy that exists in the `Groups` category is applied to a group of clusters. Every group of clusters could have their own policies that exist under the
Groups category. For example, `Groups/group1` could have its own policies that are applied to the
clusters belonging to `group1`.
You can also define a group for each cluster type: single node, three-node, and standard clusters.

Sites:: A policy that exists in the `Sites` category is applied to a specific cluster. Any cluster could have its own policies that exist in the `Sites` category.
For example, `Sites/cluster1` will have its own policies applied to `cluster1`.
You can also define an example site-specific configuration for each cluster type: single node, three-node, and standard clusters.
