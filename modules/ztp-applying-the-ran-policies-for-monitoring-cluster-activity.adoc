= Applying the RAN policies for monitoring cluster activity

Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) uses {rh-rhacm-first} to apply the radio access network (RAN) policies using a policy-based governance approach to automatically monitor cluster activity.

The policy generator (PolicyGen) is a Kustomize plugin that facilitates creating ACM policies from predefined custom resources.
There are three main items: Policy Categorization, Source CR policy, and PolicyGenTemplate. PolicyGen relies on these to generate the policies and
their placement bindings and rules.

The following diagram shows how the RAN policy generator interacts with GitOps and ACM.

RAN policies are categorized into three main groups:

Common:: A policy that exists in the `Common` category is applied to all clusters to be represented by the site plan.

Groups:: A policy that exists in the `Groups` category is applied to a group of clusters. Every group of clusters could have their own policies that exist under the
Groups category. For example, `Groups/group1` could have its own policies that are applied to the clusters belonging to `group1`.

Sites:: A policy that exists in the `Sites` category is applied to a specific cluster. Any cluster could have its own policies that exist in the `Sites` category.
For example, `Sites/cluster1` will have its own policies applied to `cluster1`.

The following diagram shows how policies are generated.
