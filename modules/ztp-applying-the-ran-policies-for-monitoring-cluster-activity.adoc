= Applying the RAN policies for monitoring cluster activity

Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) uses {rh-rhacm-first} as an orchestrator to apply the radio access network (RAN) policies using a policy-based governance approach to automatically monitor cluster activity.

The policy generator (PolicyGen) is a Kustomize plugin that facilitates creating ACM policies from predefined custom resources.
There are three main items: Policy Categorization, Source CR policy, and PolicyGenTemplate. PolicyGen relies on these to generate the policies and
their placement bindings and rules.

RAN policies are categorized into three main groups:

Common:: A policy that exists in the `Common` category is applied to all clusters to be represented by the site plan.

Groups:: A policy that exists in the `Groups` category is applied to a group of clusters. Every group of clusters could have their own policies that exist under the
Groups category. For example, `Groups/group1` could have its own policies that are applied to the clusters belonging to `group1`.

Sites:: A policy that exists in the `Sites` category is applied to a specific cluster. Any cluster could have its own policies that exist in the `Sites` category.
For example, `Sites/cluster1` will have its own policies applied to `cluster1`.
