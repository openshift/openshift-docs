= Installing the {cert-manager-operator} using the web console

You can use the web console to install the {cert-manager-operator}.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Enter *{cert-manager-operator}* into the filter box.

. Select the *{cert-manager-operator}* and click *Install*.
+
[NOTE]
====
From the {cert-manager-operator} `1.12.0` and later, the z-stream versions of the upstream cert-manager operands such as cert-manager controller, CA injector, Webhook, and {cert-manager-operator} are decoupled. For example, for the {cert-manager-operator} `1.12.0`, the cert-manager operand version is `v1.12.4`.
====

. On the *Install Operator* page:
.. Update the *Update channel*, if necessary. The channel defaults to *stable-v1*, which installs the latest stable release of the {cert-manager-operator}.
.. Choose the *Installed Namespace* for the Operator. The default Operator namespace is `cert-manager-operator`.
+
If the `cert-manager-operator` namespace does not exist, it is created for you.

.. Select an *Update approval* strategy.
+
* The *Automatic* strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
+
* The *Manual* strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.

.. Click *Install*.

.Verification

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Verify that *{cert-manager-operator}* is listed with a *Status* of *Succeeded* in the `cert-manager-operator` namespace.
. Verify that cert-manager pods are up and running by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n cert-manager
