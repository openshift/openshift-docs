= Prerequisites for deploying cluster logging

Before deploying cluster logging into {product-title} perform the following tasks:

[procedure]

. Be familiar with the following:
+
.. An Ansible playbook is available to deploy and upgrade aggregated logging. You
should familiarize yourself with the {product-title} installation process. The installation process
includes information for preparing to use Ansible and using the Ansible inventory file to configure
various areas of cluster logging.
+
.. Review the *Storage Considerations for EFK Logging and {product-title}* to determine how best to configure your deployment.

. Make sure your environment meets the following requirements:
+
.. Ensure that you have deployed a router for the cluster.
+
.. Ensure that you have the necessary persistent storage for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch node
requires its own storage volume. 

. Specify a node selector
+
In order for the logging pods to spread evenly across your cluster, an empty
node selector should be used.
