= Enabling Operator conditions

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) provides Operators with a channel to communicate complex states that influence OLM behavior while managing the Operator. By default, OLM creates an `OperatorCondition` custom resource definition (CRD) when it installs an Operator. Based on the conditions set in the `OperatorCondition` custom resource (CR), the behavior of OLM changes accordingly.

To support Operator conditions, an Operator must be able to read the `OperatorCondition` CR created by OLM and have the ability to:

* Get the specific condition.
* Set the status of a specific condition.

This can be accomplished by using the link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lib/tree/v0.3.0[`operator-lib`] library. An Operator author can provide a link:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/tree/master/pkg/client[`controller-runtime` client] in their Operator for the library to access the `OperatorCondition` CR owned by the Operator in the cluster.

The library provides a generic `Conditions` interface, which has the following methods to `Get` and `Set` a `conditionType` in the `OperatorCondition` CR:

`Get`:: To get the specific condition, the library uses the `client.Get` function from `controller-runtime`, which requires an `ObjectKey` of type `types.NamespacedName` present in `conditionAccessor`.

`Set`:: To update the status of the specific condition, the library uses the `client.Update` function from `controller-runtime`. An error occurs if the `conditionType` is not present in the CRD.

The Operator is allowed to modify only the `status` subresource of the CR. Operators can either delete or update the `status.conditions` array to include the condition. For more details on the format and description of the fields present in the conditions, see the upstream link:https://godoc.org/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1#Condition[Condition GoDocs].

[NOTE]
====
Operator SDK v1.10.1 supports `operator-lib` v0.3.0.

.Prerequisites

* An Operator project generated using the Operator SDK.

.Procedure

To enable Operator conditions in your Operator project:

. In the `go.mod` file of your Operator project, add `operator-framework/operator-lib` as a required library:
+
[source,go]
----
module github.com/example-inc/memcached-operator

go 1.15

require (
  k8s.io/apimachinery v0.19.2
  k8s.io/client-go v0.19.2
  sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime v0.7.0
  operator-framework/operator-lib v0.3.0
)
----

. Write your own constructor in your Operator logic that:
+
--
* Accepts a `controller-runtime` client.
* Accepts a `conditionType`.
* Returns a `Condition` interface to update or add conditions.
--
+
Because OLM currently supports the `Upgradeable` condition, you can create an interface that has methods to access the `Upgradeable` condition. For example:
+
[source,go]
----
import (
  ...
  apiv1 "github.com/operator-framework/api/pkg/operators/v1"
)

func NewUpgradeable(cl client.Client) (Condition, error) {
  return NewCondition(cl, "apiv1.OperatorUpgradeable")
}

cond, err := NewUpgradeable(cl);
----
+
In this example, the `NewUpgradeable` constructor is further used to create a variable `cond` of type `Condition`. The `cond` variable would in turn have `Get` and `Set` methods, which can be used for handling the OLM `Upgradeable` condition.
