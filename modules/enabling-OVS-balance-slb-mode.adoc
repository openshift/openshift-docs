[id="enabling-OVS-balance-slb-mode_{context}"]
= Enabling OVS balance-slb mode for your cluster

You can enable the Open vSwitch (OVS) `balance-slb` mode so that two or more physical interfaces can share their network traffic. A `balance-slb` mode interface can give source load balancing (SLB) capabilities to a cluster that runs virtualization workloads, without requiring load balancing negotiation with the network switch.

Currently, source load balancing runs on a bond interface, where the interface connects to an auxiliary bridge, such as  `br-phy`. Source load balancing balances only across different Media Access Control (MAC) address and virtual local area network (VLAN) combinations. Note that all OVN-Kubernetes pod traffic uses the same MAC address and VLAN, so this traffic cannot be load balanced across many physical interfaces.

The following diagram shows `balance-slb` mode on a simple cluster infrastructure layout. Virtual machines (VMs) connect to specific localnet `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) custom resource definition (CRDs), `NAD 0` or `NAD 1`. Each NAD provides VMs with access to the underlying physical network, supporting VLAN-tagged or untagged traffic. A `br-ex` OVS bridge receives traffic from VMs and passes the traffic to the next OVS bridge, `br-phy`. The `br-phy` bridge functions as the controller for the SLB bond. The SLB bond balances traffic from different VM ports over the physical interface links, such as `eno0` and `eno1`. Additionally, ingress traffic from either physical interface can pass through the set of OVS bridges to reach the VMs.

[NOTE]
====
Consider that an OVS bond with `balance-slb` mode enabled might experience issues if the bond forwards unknown unicast traffic from one physical network interface controller (NIC) into the phsycial network through another NIC. This situation can result in an Layer 2 loop, or _bridge loop_, that in turn causes _MAC flapping_. 

MAC flapping causes the same MAC address to exist in many network locations for a period of time. For example, a remote switch does not learn the MAC address for the destination of a unicast packet and this causes the packet to exist on all links available on the SLB bond configuration. As a workaround for this issue, you can set the bond to `active-backup` mode during MAC address assignment and then switch the bond to use `balance-slb` mode.
====

You can integrate the `balance-slb` mode interface into primary or secondary network types by using OVS bonding. Note the following points about OVS bonding:

* Supports the OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin and easily integrates with the plugin.
* Natively supports `balance-slb` mode. 

.Prerequisites

* You have more than one physical interface attached to your primary network and you defined the interfaces in a `MachineConfig` file.
* You created a manifest object and defined a customized `br-ex` bridge in the object configuration file.
* You have more than one physical interfaces attached to your primary network and you defined the interfaces in a NAD CRD file.

.Procedure

. For each bare-metal host that exists in a cluster, in the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster define a `networkConfig` section similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
networkConfig:
  interfaces:
    - name: enp1s0 <1>
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        enabled: true
      ipv6:
        enabled: false
    - name: enp2s0 <2>
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      mtu: 1500 <3>
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        enabled: true
      ipv6:
        dhcp: true
        enabled: true
    - name: enp3s0 <4>
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      mtu: 1500
      ipv4:
        enabled: false
      ipv6:
        enabled: false
# ...

<1> The interface for the provisioned network interface controller (NIC). 
<2> The first bonded interface that pulls in the Ignition config file for the bond interface.
<3> Manually set the `br-ex` maximum transmission unit (MTU) on the bond ports.
<4> The second bonded interface is part of a minimal configuration that pulls ignition during cluster installation.

. Define each network interface in an NMState configuration file:

<1> Manually set the `br-ex` MTU on the bond ports.

. Use the `base64` command to encode the interface content of the NMState configuration file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ base64 -w0  <nmstate_configuration>.yml <1>
----
<1> Where the `-w0` option prevents line wrapping during the base64 encoding operation.

. Create `MachineConfig` manifest files for the `master` role and the `worker` role. Ensure that you embed the base64-encoded string from an earlier command into each `MachineConfig` manifest file. The following example manifest file configures the `master` role for all nodes that exist in a cluster. You can also create a manifest file for `master` and `worker` roles specific to a node.

<2> Writes the encoded base64 information to the specified path.
<3> Specify the path to the `cluster.yml` file. For each node in your cluster, you can specify the short hostname path to your node, such as `<node_short_hostname>`.yml.

. Save each `MachineConfig` manifest file to the `./<installation_directory>/manifests` directory, where `<installation_directory>` is the directory in which the installation program creates files.
+
The Machine Config Operator (MCO) takes the content from each manifest file and consistently applies the content to all selected nodes during a rolling update.
