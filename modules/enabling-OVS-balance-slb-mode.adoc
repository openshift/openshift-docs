[id="enabling-OVS-balance-slb-mode_{context}"]
= Enabling OVS balance-slb mode for your cluster

You can enable the Open vSwitch (OVS) `balance-slb` mode on infrastructure where your cluster runs so that two or more physical interfaces can share their network traffic. A `balance-slb` mode interface provides source load balancing (SLB) capabilities for a cluster that runs virtualization workloads, where the interface can act independently without needing to communicate with a network switch.

Currently, source load balancing works by assigning a Media Access Control (MAC) address and a virtual local area network (vLAN), if required, to a bond interface, such as `br-phy`. Because of the shared MAC address and vLAN between interfaces, using `balance-slb` mode to share pod traffic has no benefit.

The following diagram shows `balance-slb` mode on a simple cluster infrastructure layout. Virtual machines (VMs) connect to specific localnet `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) custom resource definition (CRDs), `NAD 0` or `NAD 1`. Each NAD provides VMs with access to network traffic, such as VLAN ID tags. A `br-ex` OVS bridge receives traffic from VMs and passes the traffic to the next OVS bridge, `br-phy`. The `br-phy` bridge functions as the controller for the SLB bond. The SLB bond balances traffic from different VM ports over the physical interface links, such as `eno0` and `eno1`. Additionally, ingress traffic from either physical interface can pass through the set of OVS bridges to reach the VMs.

You can integrate the `balance-slb` mode interface into primary or secondary network types by using OVS bonding. Note the following points about OVS bonding:

* Supports the OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin and easily integrates with the plugin.
* Natively supports `balance-slb` mode. 
* Cannot use the method external to your {product-title} cluster. 

.Prerequisites

* You have more than one physical interface attached to your primary network and you defined the interfaces in a `MachineConfig` file.
* You created a manifest object and defined a customized `br-ex` bridge in the object configuration file.
* You have more than one physical interfaces attached to your primary network and you defined the interfaces in a NAD file.

.Procedure

. For each bare-metal host that exists in a cluster, in the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster define a `networkConfig` section similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
networkConfig:
  interfaces:
    - name: enp1s0 <1>
      type: interface
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        enabled: true
      ipv6:
        enabled: false
    - name: enp2s0 <2>
      type: interface
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        enabled: true
      ipv6:
        enabled: false
    - name: enp3s0 <3>
      type: interface
      state: up
      ipv4:
        enabled: false
      ipv6:
        enabled: false
# ...
----
<1> The interface for the provisioned network interface card (NIC). 
<2> The first bonded interface that pulls in the Ignition config file for the bond interface.
<3> The second bonded interface is part of a minimal configuration that pulls ignition during cluster installation.

. Define each network interface in a `MachineConfig` manifest file:

. Use the `cat` command to base64-encode the interface content of the `MachineConfig` manifest file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat machineconfig.yaml | base64 -w0 <1>
----
<1> Where the `-w0` option prevents line wrapping during the base64 encoding operation.

. Create `MachineConfig` manifest files for the `master` role and the `worker` role. The following example manifest file configures the `master` role for all nodes that exist in a cluster. You can also create a manifest file for `master` and `worker` roles specific to a node.

<2> Writes the encoded base64 information to the specified path.
<3> Specify the path to the `cluster.yml` file. For each node in your cluster, you can specify the short hostname path to your node, such as `<node_short_hostname>`.yml.

. Save the `MachineConfig` manifest file to the `./<installation_directory>/manifests` directory, where `<installation_directory>` is the directory in which the installation program creates files.
