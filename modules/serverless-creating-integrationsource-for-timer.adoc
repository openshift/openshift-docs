= Creating an IntegrationSource for timer

To create an `IntegrationSource` API that produces periodic messages with a custom payload, apply a YAML manifest.

.Prerequisites

* You have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed and are logged in to the target cluster.
* You know the namespace where the `IntegrationSource` resource will be created.
* A Knative broker or another event sink exists to receive the SQS events.

.Procedure

. Save the following YAML manifest as `integration-source-timer.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationSource
metadata:
  name: integration-source-timer
  namespace: knative-samples
spec:
  timer:
    period: 2000
    message: "Hello from Timer source"
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Broker
      name: default
----

. Apply the manifest by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f integration-source-timer.yaml
----
+
This manifest configures the `IntegrationSource` to emit a message `"Hello from Timer source"` every 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). The generated messages are sent to the `default` Knative broker defined in the sink section.
