= Seed image guidelines

The seed image targets a set of {sno} clusters with the same hardware and similar configuration.
This means that the seed cluster must match the configuration of the target clusters for the following items:

* CPU topology
** Number of CPU cores
** Tuned performance configuration, such as number of reserved CPUs
* `MachineConfig` resources for the target cluster
* IP version
+
[NOTE]
====
Dual-stack networking is not supported in this release.
====

* Set of Day 2 Operators, including the {lcao} and the {oadp-short} Operator
* Disconnected registry
* FIPS configuration

The following configurations only have to partially match on the participating clusters:

* If the target cluster has a proxy configuration, the seed cluster must have a proxy configuration too but the configuration does not have to be the same.
* A dedicated partition on the primary disk for container storage is required on all participating clusters. However, the size and start of the partition does not have to be the same. Only the `spec.config.storage.disks.partitions.label: varlibcontainers` label in the `MachineConfig` CR must match on both the seed and target clusters.
For more information about how to create the disk partition, see "Configuring a shared container partition between ostree stateroots" or "Configuring a shared container partition between ostree stateroots when using {ztp}".

For more information about what to include in the seed image, see "Seed image configuration" and "Seed image configuration using the RAN DU profile".
