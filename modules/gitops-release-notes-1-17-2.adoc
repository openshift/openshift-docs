== Fixed issues

SSH Git fix in FIPS clusters::
Before this update, SSH-based Git repository URLs in FIPS-enabled clusters could cause connection failures and result in the `repo-server` pod crashing. This issue occurred because a non-FIPS-compliant cryptographic algorithm was being used. With this update, the algorithm is disabled when running in a FIPS environment, restoring full functionality and stability.

Redis HA Proxy Pod upgrade issue fixed::
Before this update, when upgrading the {gitops-title} Operator from version 1.15.x to 1.16.x or later with high availability (HA) enabled, the `redis-ha-proxy` pod could become uncresponsive during the automatic rollout. With this update, the issue is resolved by updating the Operator resource management logic to properly reconcile the required permissions and security context fields during the upgrade. As a result, the `redis-ha-proxy` pod rolls out successfully and automatically when the {gitops-title} Operator is upgraded, eliminating the need for manual intervention, such as deleting the deployment.

gitops-must-gather fix::
Before this update, the `gitops-must-gather` feature produced an empty bundle due to a bug. With this update, diagnostics are collected correctly. Additionally, `gitops-must-gather` in version 1.17.2 can be used to gather details of deployments from earlier versions.

Bitbucket server connection leak fixed::
Before this update, a new connection was created on every reconciliation cycle and never closed, causing resource exhaustion on the Bitbucket server. With this update, HTTP connections are properly cached and reused, preventing the leak and ensuring efficient communication.

Misleading error logs when the ConsoleLink resource is disabled::
Before this update, when the `DISABLE_DEFAULT_ARGOCD_CONSOLELINK` variable was set to `true` and the `ConsoleLink` resource did not exist, the {gitops-title} Operator logged an error even though functionality was not affected. With this update, the {gitops-title} Operator does not log an error in this scenario, preventing misleading error messages.
