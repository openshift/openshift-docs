= Triggering the installation of the Kata runtime

You must create one `KataConfig` custom resource (CR) to trigger the {sandboxed-containers-operator} to do the following:

* Install the needed {op-system} extensions, such as QEMU and `kata-containers`, on your {op-system} node.
* Ensure that the runtime, link:https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o[CRI-O], is configured with the correct Kata runtime handlers.
* Create a `RuntimeClass` custom resource with necessary configurations for additional overhead caused by virtualization and the required additional processes.

.Prerequisites

* You have {product-title} {product-version} installed on your cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Create the `KataConfig` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file name>.yaml
----
+
.Example
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kataconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KataConfig
metadata:
  name: cluster-kataconfig
----

. Monitor the installation progress.
** You can describe the `KataConfig` installation:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe kataconfig
----
+
*** Verify the *Completed nodes* field in the status.
*** If the value of *Completed nodes* matches the number of worker nodes, then the installation is completed. The status also contains a list of nodes where the installation is completed.
** You can check the progress of the installation by watching the `KataConfig` resource:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ watch -n 10 oc describe kataconfig
----
+
Alternatively, you can check the status of the `KataConfig` resource. This can be done by running `oc get KataConfig <name> -oyaml` and inspecting the `status` field in the output.

The Kata runtime is now installed on the cluster and ready for use as a secondary runtime.  Verify that you see a newly created `RuntimeClass` for Kata on your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{sandboxed-containers-first} installs Kata only as a secondary optional runtime on the cluster and not as the primary runtime.
====

.Verification

* You can monitor the values of the `KataConfig` custom resource by running:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ watch oc describe KataConfig cluster-kataconfig
----
