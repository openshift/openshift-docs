= Viewing conditional updates in the web console

You can view and assess the risks associated with particular updates with conditional updates.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have access to the {product-title} web console.

* Pause all `MachineHealthCheck` resources.

* You have updated all Operators previously installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to a version that is compatible with your target release. Updating the Operators ensures they have a valid update path when the default OperatorHub catalogs switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster update. See "Updating installed Operators" in the "Additional resources" section for more information on how to check compatibility and, if necessary, update the installed Operators.

* Your machine config pools (MCPs) are running and not paused. Nodes associated with a paused MCP are skipped during the update process. You can pause the MCPs if you are performing an advanced update strategy, such as a canary rollout, an EUS update, or a control-plane update.

.Procedure

. From the web console, click *Administration* -> *Cluster settings* page and review the contents of the *Details* tab.
. You can enable the `Include versions with known issues` feature in the *Select new version* dropdown of the *Update cluster* modal to populate the dropdown list with conditional updates.
