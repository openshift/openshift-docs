= Viewing conditional updates in the web console

You can view and assess the risks associated with particular updates with conditional updates.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have access to the {product-title} web console.

* Pause all `MachineHealthCheck` resources.

* Your Operators that were previously installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) are updated to their latest version in their latest channel. Updating the Operators ensures they have a valid update path when the default OperatorHub catalogs switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster update.

* Your machine config pools (MCPs) are running and not paused. Nodes associated with a paused MCP are skipped during the update process. You can pause the MCPs if you are performing an advanced update strategy, such as a canary rollout, an EUS update, or a control-plane update.

.Procedure

. From the web console, click *Administration* -> *Cluster settings* page and review the contents of the *Details* tab.

. You can enable `Include supported but not recommended versions` in the `Select new version` dropdown of the *Update cluster* modal to populate the dropdown list with conditional updates.
