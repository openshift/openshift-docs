= Persistent volumes

Each PV contains a `spec` and `status`, which is the specification and status of the volume, for example:

[id="pv-capacity_{context}"]
== Capacity

Generally, a persistent volume (PV) has a specific storage capacity. This is set by using the `capacity` attribute of the PV.

Currently, storage capacity is the only resource that can be set or requested. Future attributes may include IOPS, throughput, and so on.

ifndef::microshift[]
[id="pv-access-modes_{context}"]
== Access modes

A persistent volume can be mounted on a host in any way supported by the resource provider. Providers have different capabilities and each PV's access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular volume. For example, NFS can support multiple read-write clients, but a specific NFS PV might be exported on the server as read-only. Each PV gets its own set of access modes describing that specific PV's capabilities.

Claims are matched to volumes with similar access modes. The only two matching criteria are access modes and size. A claim's access modes represent a request. Therefore, you might be granted more, but never less. For example, if a claim requests RWO, but the only volume available is an NFS PV (RWO+ROX+RWX), the claim would then match NFS because it supports RWO.

Direct matches are always attempted first. The volume's modes must match or contain more modes than you requested. The size must be greater than or equal to what is expected. If two types of volumes, such as NFS and iSCSI, have the same set of access modes, either of them can match a claim with those modes. There is no ordering between types of volumes and no way to choose one type over another.

All volumes with the same modes are grouped, and then sorted by size, smallest to largest. The binder gets the group with matching modes and iterates over each, in size order, until one size matches.

ifndef::microshift[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Volume access modes describe volume capabilities. They are not enforced constraints. The storage provider is responsible for runtime errors resulting from invalid use of the resource. Errors in the provider show up at runtime as mount errors.

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
For example, NFS offers `ReadWriteOnce` access mode. If you want to use the volume's ROX capability, mark the claims as `ReadOnlyMany`.

iSCSI and Fibre Channel volumes do not currently have any fencing mechanisms. You must ensure the volumes are only used by one node at a time. In certain situations, such as draining a node, the volumes can be used simultaneously by two nodes. Before draining the node, delete the pods that use the volumes.

1. ReadWriteOnce (RWO) volumes cannot be mounted on multiple nodes. If a node fails, the system does not allow the attached RWO volume to be mounted on a new node because it is already assigned to the failed node. If you encounter a multi-attach error message as a result, force delete the pod on a shutdown or crashed node to avoid data loss in critical workloads, such as when dynamic persistent volumes are attached.

2. ReadWriteOncePod is a Technology Preview feature.

3. Use a recreate deployment strategy for pods that rely on AWS EBS.

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
4. If the underlying vSphere environment supports the vSAN file service, then the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator installed by
{product-title} supports provisioning of ReadWriteMany (RWX) volumes. If you do not have vSAN file service configured, and you request RWX, the volume fails to get created and an error is logged. For more information, see "Using Container Storage Interface" -> "VMware vSphere CSI Driver Operator".

[id="pv-restrictions_{context}"]
== Restrictions

The following restrictions apply when using PVs with {product-title}:
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-online[]
 * PVs are provisioned with EBS volumes (AWS).
 * Only RWO access mode is applicable, as EBS volumes and GCE Persistent Disks cannot be mounted to multiple nodes.
 * Docker volumes are disabled.
   ** VOLUME directive without a mapped external volume fails to be
instantiated
.
 * *emptyDir* is restricted to 512 Mi per project (group) per node.
   ** A single pod for a project on a particular node can use up to 512 Mi
of *emptyDir* storage.
   ** Multiple pods for a project on a particular node share the 512 Mi of
*emptyDir* storage.
 *  *emptyDir* has the same lifecycle as the pod:
   ** *emptyDir* volumes survive container crashes/restarts.
   ** *emptyDir* volumes are deleted when the pod is deleted.

[id="pv-phase_{context}"]
== Phase

Volumes can be found in one of the following phases:

.Volume phases
[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===

|Phase
|Description

|Available
|A free resource not yet bound to a claim.

|Bound
|The volume is bound to a claim.

|Released
|The claim was deleted, but the resource is not yet reclaimed by the
cluster.

|Failed
|The volume has failed its automatic reclamation.

You can view the name of the PVC that is bound to the PV by running the following command:

[id="pv-mount-options_{context}"]
=== Mount options

You can specify mount options while mounting a PV by using the attribute `mountOptions`.

For example:

ifndef::microshift[]
.Mount options example

metadata:
  name: pv0001

    path: /tmp
    server: 172.17.0.2
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  claimRef:
    name: claim1
    namespace: default
----
<1> Specified mount options are used while mounting the PV to the disk.

The following PV types support mount options:

// - GlusterFS
// - Ceph RBD
- AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
- Azure Disk

- VMware vSphere

[NOTE]
====
Fibre Channel and HostPath PVs do not support mount options.
