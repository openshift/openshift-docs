= Opting out of Telemetry for {microshift-short}

If your cluster is not connected to a network, or you do not want Telemetry gathered, you can easily opt out of Telemetry by disabling the parameter in the {microshift-short} configuration file.

.Prerequisties

* You installed {oc-first}.
* You have root access to the cluster.

.Procedure

. If you have not done so, make a copy of the provided `config.yaml.default` file in the `/etc/microshift/` directory, renaming it `config.yaml`.

. Keep the new {microshift-short} `config.yaml` in the `/etc/microshift/` directory. Your `config.yaml` file is read every time the {microshift-short} service starts.
+
[NOTE]
====
After you create it, the `config.yaml` file takes precedence over built-in settings.
====

. Optional: Use a configuration snippet if you are using an existing {microshift-short} YAML. See "Using configuration snippets" in the _Additional resources_ section for more information.

. Set the `telemetry.status` section of the {microshift-short} YAML with the `Disabled` value.
