= Machine Config Operator node updates
The Machine Config Operator (MCO) applies a new machine configuration to each control plane and compute node. During this process, the MCO performs the following sequential actions on each node of the cluster:

. Cordon and drain all the nodes
. Update the operating system (OS)
. Reboot the nodes
. Uncordon all nodes and schedule workloads on the node

[NOTE]
====
When a node is cordoned, workloads cannot be scheduled to it.
====

The time to complete this process depends on several factors including the node and infrastructure configuration. This process might take 5 or more minutes to complete per node.

In addition to MCO, you should consider the impact of the following parameters:

* The control plane node update duration is predictable and oftentimes shorter than compute nodes, because the control plane workloads are tuned for graceful updates and quick drains.

* You can update the compute nodes in parallel by setting the `maxUnavailable` field to greater than `1` in the Machine Config Pool (MCP). The MCO cordons the number of nodes specified in `maxUnavailable` and marks them unavailable for update.

* When you increase `maxUnavailable` on the MCP, it can help the pool to update more quickly. However, if `maxUnavailable` is set too high, and several nodes are cordoned simultaneously, the pod disruption budget (PDB) guarded workloads could fail to drain because a schedulable node cannot be found to run the replicas. If you increase `maxUnavailable` for the MCP, ensure that you still have sufficient schedulable nodes to allow PDB guarded workloads to drain.

* Before you begin the update, you must ensure that all the nodes are available. Any unavailable nodes can significantly impact the update duration because the node unavailability affects the `maxUnavailable` and pod disruption budgets.

If the status of the node is `NotReady` or `SchedulingDisabled`, then the node is not available and this impacts the update duration.

You can check the status of nodes from the *Administrator* perspective in the web console by expanding **Compute** → **Nodes**.
