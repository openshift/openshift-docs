[id="security-model-buildah-ns-task_{context}"]
= Security model of the `buildah-ns` task

The `buildah-ns` task applies user namespace isolation to provide privilege separation between containers and the host system.

== UID mapping behavior

When the task runs with namespace annotations, user IDs (UIDs) are mapped as follows:

* **Inside the container**: Processes run as UID 0, which appears as the root user.  
* **Outside the container**: The same processes run as a non-zero UID on the host system.  

This mapping allows processes inside the container to behave as if they have root privileges while restricting their privileges on the host system.

== Security benefits

User namespace isolation provides the following security advantages:

* **Kernel-level isolation**: Adds an extra isolation boundary between containers.  
* **Reduced privilege exposure**: Limits the impact of compromised workloads by running them as non-root users on the host.  
* **Container escape protection**: Helps mitigate potential vulnerabilities that allow escaping from the container runtime environment.
