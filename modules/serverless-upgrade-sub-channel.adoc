= Upgrading the Subscription Channel

To upgrade to the latest version of {ServerlessProductName} on {product-title} 4.4, you must update the channel to *4.4*.

If you are upgrading from {ServerlessProductName} version 1.5.0, or earlier, to version 1.7.0, you must complete the following steps:

* Upgrade to {ServerlessProductName} version 1.5.0, by selecting the *techpreview* channel.
* After you have upgraded to 1.5.0, upgrade to 1.6.0 by selecting the *preview-4.3* channel.
* Finally, after you have upgraded to 1.6.0, upgrade to the latest version by selecting the *4.4* channel.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After each channel change, wait for the pods in the `knative-serving` namespace to get upgraded before changing the channel again.
