* You have installed a previous version of {ServerlessOperatorName}, and have selected Automatic updates during the installation process.

[NOTE]
====
If you have selected Manual updates, you will need to complete additional steps after updating the channel as described in this guide. The Subscription's upgrade status will remain *Upgrading* until you review and approve its Install Plan. Information about the Install Plan can be found in the {product-title} Operators documentation.

* You have logged in to the {product-title} web console.

. Wait until all pods have been upgraded in the `knative-serving` namespace and the `KnativeServing` custom resource reports the latest Knative Serving version.

.Verification

To verify that the upgrade has been successful, you can check the status of pods in the `knative-serving` namespace, and the version of the `KnativeServing` custom resource.

. Check the status of the pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get knativeserving.operator.knative.dev knative-serving -n knative-serving -o=jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status}'
----
+
This command should return a status of `True`.

. Check the version of the `KnativeServing` custom resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get knativeserving.operator.knative.dev knative-serving -n knative-serving -o=jsonpath='{.status.version}'
----

This command should return the latest version of Knative Serving. You can check the latest version in the {ServerlessOperatorName} release notes.
