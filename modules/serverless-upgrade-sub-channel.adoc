== Upgrading the Subscription Channel

In {ServerlessProductName} versions 1.6.0 and older, the only available Subscription Update Channel was `preview-4.3`.
To upgrade to the latest version, you must update the channel to `4.3`.

[NOTE]
====
If you have selected Manual updates, you will need to complete additional steps after updating the channel as described in this guide. The Subscription’s upgrade status will remain *Upgrading* until you review and approve its Install Plan. Information about the Install Plan can be found in the {product-title} Operators documentation.
