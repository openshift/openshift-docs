= About checking machine config node status

If you make changes to a machine config pool (MCP) that results in a new machine config, for example by using a `MachineConfig` or `KubeletConfig` object, you can get detailed information about the progress of the node updates by using the machine config nodes custom resource. 

The `MachineConfigNode` custom resource allows you to monitor the progress of individual node updates as they move through the update phases. This information can be helpful with troubleshooting if one of the nodes has an issue during the update. The custom resource reports where in the update process the node is at the moment, the phases that have completed, and the phases that are remaining.

The node update process consists of the following phases and subphases that are tracked by the machine config node custom resource, explained with more detail later in this section:

* *Update Prepared*. The MCO stops the configuration drift monitoring process and verifies that the newly-created machine config can be applied to a node.
* *Update Executed*. The MCO cordons and drains the node and applies the new machine config to the node files and operating system, as needed. It contains the following sub-phases:
** *Cordoned*
** *Drained*
** *AppliedFilesAndOS*
* *PinnedImageSetsProgressing* The MCO is performing the steps needed to pin and pre-load container images. 
* *PinnedImageSetsDegraded* The pinned image process failed. You can view the reason for the failure by using the `oc describe machineconfignode` command, as described later in this section.
* *NodeDegraded* The node update failed. You can view the reason for the failure by using the `oc describe machineconfignode` command, as described later in this section.
* *Update Post update action* The MCO is reloading CRI-O, as needed.
* *Rebooted Node* The MCO is rebooting the node, as needed.
* *Update Complete*. The MCO is uncordoning the node, updating the node state to the cluster, and resumes producing node metrics. It contains the following sub-phase:
** *Uncordoned*
* *Updated* The MCO completed a node update and the current config version of the node is equal to the desired updated version.
* *Resumed*. The MCO restarted the config drift monitor process and the node returns to operational state.

As the update moves through these phases, you can query the `MachineConfigNode` custom resource, which reports one of the following conditions for each phase:

* `True`. The phase is complete on that node.
* `False`.  The phase has not yet started or will not be executed on that node.
* `Unknown`. The phase is either being executed on that node or has an error. If the phase has an error, you can use the `oc describe machineconfignodes` command for more information, as described later in this section.

For example, consider a cluster with a newly-created machine config:

$ oc get machineconfig
