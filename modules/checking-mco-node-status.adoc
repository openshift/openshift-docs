= Checking machine config node status

During updates you might want to monitor the progress of individual nodes in case issues arise and you need to troubleshoot a node.

To see the status of the Machine Config Operator (MCO) updates to your cluster, use the following `oc` commands:

:FeatureName: Improved MCO state reporting
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

.Prerequisites
* You set `featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade` in your `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR) to enable the feature set capability for your cluster.

.Procedure
. Get a summary of update statuses for all nodes in all machine config pools by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfignodes

where:
+
UPDATED:: The `True` status indicates that the MCO has applied the current machine config to that particular node. The `False` status indicates that the node is currently updating. The `Unknown` status means the operation is processing.
UPDATEPREPARED:: The `False` status indicates that the MCO has not started reconciling the new machine configs to be distributed. The `True` status indicates that the MCO has completed this phase of the update. The `Unknown` status means the operation is processing.
UPDATEEXECUTED:: The `False` status indicates that the MCO has not started cordoning and draining the node. It also indicates that the disk state and operating system have not started updating. The `True` status indicates that the MCO has completed this phase of the update. The `Unknown` status means the operation is processing.
UPDATEPOSTACTIONCOMPLETED:: The `False` status indicates that the MCO has not started rebooting the node or closing the daemon. The `True` status indicates that the MCO has completed reboot and updating the node status. The `Unknown` status indicates either that an error has occurred during the update process at this phase, or that the MCO is currently applying the update.
UPDATECOMPLETED:: The `False` status indicates that the MCO has not started uncordoning the node and updating the node state and metrics. The `True` status indicates that the MCO has finished updating the node state and available metrics.
RESUMED:: The `False` status indicates that the MCO has not started the config drift monitor. The `True` status indicates that the node has resumed operation. The `Unknown` status means the operation is processing.

[NOTE]
====
Within the primary phases previously described, you can have secondary phases which you can use to see the update progression in more detail. You can get more information that includes secondary phases of updates by using the `-o wide` option of the preceding command. This provides the additional `UPDATECOMPATIBLE`, `UPDATEFILESANDOS`, `DRAINEDNODE`, `CORDONEDNODE`, `REBOOTNODE`, `RELOADEDCRIO` and `UNCORDONED` columns. These secondary phases do not always occur and depend on the type of update you want to apply.

. Check the update status of nodes in a specific machine config pool by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfignodes $(oc get machineconfignodes -o json | jq -r '.items[]|select(.spec.pool.name=="<pool_name>")|.metadata.name') <1>
----
<1> The name of the pool is the `MachineConfigPool` object name.

<1> The desired configuration specified in the `spec.configversion.desired` field updates immediately when a new configuration is detected on the node.
<2> The desired configuration specified in the `status.configversion.desired` field updates only when the new configuration is validated by the Machine Config Daemon (MCD). The MCD performs validation by checking the current phase of the update. If the update successfully passes the `UPDATEPREPARED` phase, then the status adds the new configuration.
