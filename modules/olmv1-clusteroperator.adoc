== Purpose

ifdef::cluster-caps[]
{olmv1} provides the features for the `OperatorLifecycleManagerV1` capability.
endif::[]

Starting in {product-title} 4.18, {olmv1} is enabled by default alongside {olmv0}. This next-generation iteration provides an updated framework that evolves many of {olmv0} concepts that enable cluster administrators to extend capabilities for their users.

{olmv1} manages the lifecycle of the new `ClusterExtension` object, which includes Operators via the `registry+v1` bundle format, and controls installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of extensions within a cluster.

In {product-title}, {olmv1} is provided by the `olm` cluster Operator.

[NOTE]
====
The `olm` cluster Operator informs cluster administrators if there are any installed extensions blocking cluster upgrade, based on their `olm.maxOpenShiftVersion` properties. For more information, see "Compatibility with {product-title} versions".

== Components

{olmv1-first} comprises the following component projects:

Operator Controller:: The central component of {olmv1} that extends Kubernetes with an API through which users can install and manage the lifecycle of Operators and extensions. It consumes information from catalogd.

Catalogd:: A Kubernetes extension that unpacks file-based catalog (FBC) content packaged and shipped in container images for consumption by on-cluster clients. As a component of the {olmv1} microservices architecture, catalogd hosts metadata for Kubernetes extensions packaged by the authors of the extensions, and as a result helps users discover installable content.
