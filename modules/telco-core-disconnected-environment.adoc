= Disconnected environment

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Descrption::
Telco core clusters are expected to be installed in networks without direct access to the internet.
All container images needed to install, configure, and operate the cluster must be available in a disconnected registry.
This includes {product-title} images, Day 2 OLM Operator images, and application workload images.
The use of a disconnected environment provides multiple benefits, including:

* Security - limiting access to the cluster
* Curated content â€“ the registry is populated based on curated and approved updates for clusters

Limits and requirements::
* A unique name is required for all custom `CatalogSource` resources.
Do not reuse the default catalog names.

Engineering considerations::
* A valid time source must be configured as part of cluster installation
