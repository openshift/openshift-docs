.Alerting rule considerations

* The default alerting rules are used specifically for the {ocp} cluster.

* Some alerting rules intentionally have identical names. They send alerts about the same event with different thresholds, different severity, or both.

* Inhibition rules prevent notifications for lower severity alerts that are firing when a higher severity alert is also firing.
