= Managing alerting rules for user-defined projects

{product-title} monitoring ships with a set of default alerting rules. As a cluster administrator, you can view the default alerting rules.

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can create, view, edit, and remove alerting rules in user-defined projects.

.Alerting rule considerations

* The default alerting rules are used specifically for the {product-title} cluster.

* Some alerting rules intentionally have identical names. They send alerts about the same event with different thresholds, different severity, or both.

* Inhibition rules prevent notifications for lower severity alerts that are firing when a higher severity alert is also firing.
