The following enhancements are included in this z-stream release:

* With this update, the Cluster Network Operator now supports `KubeVirt` as a platform for dual-stack networking in {VirtProductName}, resolving a previous issue where `KubeVirt` was not recognized as a supported platform for dual-stack. This enhancement enables successful deployment of a Hosted Control Plane on {VirtProductName} with IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking. This improvement reduces deployment failures and ensure a smoother experience for users deploying {VirtProductName} with `KubeVirt`.
