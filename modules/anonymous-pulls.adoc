= Anonymous pulls

In some cases, administrators might want to enable anonymous pulls from the image registry, for example, when using CI/CD pipelines to streamline access to base images or reduce authentication overhead. To enable anonymous pulls, administrators must add unauthenticated groups to the `self-access-review` Cluster Role and grant the `system:image-puller` role to the `system:unauthenticated` group.
