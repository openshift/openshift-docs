= Support router to load external certificate

Currently, users of OpenShift cannot easily integrate OpenShift Routes with third-party certificate management solutions like {cert-manager}. The existing design of the Routes API mandates that certificate data be embedded within the Route object, rather than referenced. This creates challenges for seamless integration and automated lifecycle management.

You can now integrate {product-title} Routes more effectively with third-party certificate management solutions like {cert-manager}. This integration eliminates the need for manual certificate management, reducing the potential for errors and streamlining the overall process.

.Prerequisites

The end user must have generated the serving certificate generated as a prerequisite using third-party systems like cert-manager.
In cert-manager's case, the Certificate CR must be created in the same namespace where the Route is going to be created.
The end user must create a role in the same namespace as the secret containing the certificate which was generated by the cert-manager from earlier.

oc create role secret-reader --verb=get,list,watch --resource=secrets --resource-name=<secret-name>

The end user must create a rolebinding in the same namespace as the secret and bind the router serviceaccount to the above created role.

oc create rolebinding foo-secret-reader --role=secret-reader --serviceaccount=openshift-ingress:router --namespace=<current-namespace>

To expose a user workload, the user would create a new Route with the .spec.tls.externalCertificate referencing the generated secret that was created in the previous step.
If the secret that is referenced exists and has a successfully generated cert/key pair, the router will serve this certificate if all preconditions (listed below) are met.
