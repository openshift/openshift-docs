= Required AWS service quotas

The table below describes the AWS service quotas and levels required to create and run one {product-title} cluster. Although most default values are suitable for most workloads, you might need to request additional quota for the following cases:

* ROSA clusters require a minimum AWS EC2 service quota of
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
100{nbsp}vCPUs
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
32{nbsp}vCPUs
endif::[]
to provide for cluster creation, availability, and upgrades. The default maximum value for vCPUs assigned to Running On-Demand Standard Amazon EC2 instances is `5`. Therefore if you have not created a ROSA cluster using the same AWS account previously, you must request additional EC2 quota for `Running On-Demand Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) instances`.

//TODO OSDOCS-11789 confirm number of secgroups on HCP clusters - Bala says 10, who can confirm?
* Some optional cluster configuration features, such as custom security groups, might require you to request additional quota. For example, because ROSA associates 1 security group with network interfaces in worker machine pools by default, and the default quota for `Security groups per network interface` is `5`, if you want to add 5 custom security groups, you must request additional quota, because this would bring the total number of security groups on worker network interfaces to 6.

[NOTE]
====
The AWS SDK allows ROSA to check quotas, but the AWS SDK calculation does not account for your existing usage. Therefore, it is possible that the quota check can pass in the AWS SDK yet the cluster creation can fail. To fix this issue, increase your quota.
====

If you need to modify or increase a specific quota, see Amazon's documentation on link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html[requesting a quota increase]. Large quota requests are submitted to Amazon Support for review, and take some time to be approved. If your quota request is urgent, contact AWS Support.
