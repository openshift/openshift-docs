= Required AWS service quotas

The table below describes the AWS service quotas and levels required to create and run an {product-title} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The AWS SDK allows ROSA to check quotas, but the AWS SDK calculation does not include your existing usage. Therefore, it is possible that the quota check can pass in the AWS SDK yet the cluster creation can fail. To fix this issue, increase your quota.
====

If you need to modify or increase a specific quota, see Amazon's documentation on link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html[requesting a quota increase].

|100
|100
| Maximum number of vCPUs assigned to the Running On-Demand Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) instances.

The default value of 5 vCPUs is not sufficient to create ROSA clusters. ROSA has a minimum requirement of 100 vCPUs for cluster creation.

|VPCs per Region
|vpc
|L-F678F1CE
|5
|5
| The maximum number of VPCs per Region. This quota is directly tied to the maximum number of internet gateways per Region.

|Internet gateways per Region
|vpc
|L-A4707A72
|5
|5
| The maximum number of internet gateways per Region. This quota is directly tied to the maximum number of VPCs per Region. To increase this quota, increase the number of VPCs per Region.
