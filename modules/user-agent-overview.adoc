= About the user agent

{product-title} implements a user agent that can be used to prevent an
application developer's CLI accessing the {product-title} API. If a client uses
a particular library or binary file, they cannot access the {product-title} API.

You construct user agents for the {product-title} CLI from a set of values
within {product-title}:

[source,terminal]
----
<command>/<version> (<platform>/<architecture>) <client>/<git_commit>
----

For example, when:

* <command> = `oc`
* <version> = The client version. For example, `v4.3.0`. Requests made against the Kubernetes
API at `/api` receive the Kubernetes version, while requests made against the
{product-title} API at `/oapi` receive the {product-title} version (as specified
by `oc version`)
* <platform> = `linux`
* <architecture> = `amd64`
* <client> = `openshift`, or `kubernetes` depending on if the request is made against the Kubernetes API at `/api`, or the {product-title} API at `/oapi`
* <git_commit> = The Git commit of the client version (for example, `f034127`)

the user agent is:

[source,terminal]
----
oc/v3.3.0 (linux/amd64) openshift/f034127
