= Creating a hosted cluster separately

You can create a hosted cluster separately on {aws-first}.

To create a hosted cluster separately, enter the following command:

[source,terminal]
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ hcp create cluster aws \
    --infra-id <infra_id> \// <1>
    --name <hosted_cluster_name> \// <2>
    --sts-creds <path_to_sts_credential_file> \// <3>
    --pull-secret <path_to_pull_secret> \// <4>
    --generate-ssh \// <5>
    --node-pool-replicas 3
    --role-arn <role_name> <6>
----
<1> Replace `<infra_id>` with the same ID that you specified in the `create infra aws` command. This value identifies the IAM resources that are associated with the hosted cluster.
<2> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.
<3> Replace `<path_to_sts_credential_file>` with the same name that you specified in the `create infra aws` command.
<4> Replace `<path_to_pull_secret>` with the name of the file that contains a valid {ocp-short} pull secret.
<5> The `--generate-ssh` flag is optional, but is good to include in case you need to SSH to your workers. An SSH key is generated for you and is stored as a secret in the same namespace as the hosted cluster.
<6> Replace `<role_name>` with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), for example, `arn:aws:iam::820196288204:role/myrole`. Specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), for example, `arn:aws:iam::820196288204:role/myrole`. For more information about ARN roles, see "Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions".

You can also add the `--render` flag to the command and redirect output to a file where you can edit the resources before you apply them to the cluster.

After you run the command, the following resources are applied to your cluster:

* A namespace
* A secret with your pull secret
* A `HostedCluster`
* A `NodePool`
* Three AWS STS secrets for control plane components
* One SSH key secret if you specified the `--generate-ssh` flag.
