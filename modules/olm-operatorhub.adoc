= Understanding the OperatorHub

The _OperatorHub_ is available via the {product-title} web console and is the
interface that cluster administrators use to discover and install Operators.
With one click, an Operator can be pulled from their off-cluster source,
installed and subscribed on the cluster, and made ready for engineering teams to
self-service manage the product across deployment environments using the
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

Cluster administrators can choose from OperatorSources grouped into
the following categories:

[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Category |Description

|Red Hat Operators
|Red Hat products packaged and shipped by Red Hat. Supported by Red Hat.

|Certified Operators
|Products from leading independent software vendors (ISVs). Red Hat partners with
ISVs to package and ship. Supported by the ISV.

|Community Operators
|Optionally-visible software maintained by relevant representatives in the
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators[operator-framework/community-operators]
GitHub repository. No official support.

|Custom Operators
|Operators you add to the cluster yourself.
If you have not added any Custom Operators, the Custom category does not appear in
the Web console on your OperatorHub.
|===

The OperatorHub component is installed and run as an Operator by default on
{product-title} in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace.

== OperatorHub Architecture

The OperatorHub component's Operator manages two Custom Resource Definitions
(CRDs): an
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace/blob/release-4.1/deploy/crds/operators_v1_operatorsource_crd.yaml[OperatorSource]
and a
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace/blob/release-4.1/deploy/crds/operators_v1_catalogsourceconfig_crd.yaml[CatalogSourceConfig].

[NOTE]
====
Although some OperatorSource and CatalogSourceConfig information is exposed
through the OperatorHub user interface, those files are only used directly
by those who are creating their own Operators.

[id="olm-operatorhub-arch-operatorsource_{context}"]
== OperatorSource

For each Operator, the OperatorSource is used to define the external data store
used to store Operator bundles. A
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace/blob/master/deploy/examples/community.operatorsource.cr.yaml[simple OperatorSource]
includes:

[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Field
|Description

|`type`
|To identify the data store as an application registry, `type` is set to `appregistry`.

|`endpoint`
|Currently, Quay is the external data store used by the OperatorHub, so
the endpoint is set to `https://quay.io/cnr` for the Quay.io `appregistry`.

|`registryNamespace`
|For a Community Operator, this is set to `community-operator`.

|`displayName`
|Optionally set to a name that appears in the OperatorHub user interface for the
Operator.

|`publisher`
|Optionally set to the person or organization publishing the Operator, so it
can be displayed on the OperatorHub.

|===

[id="olm-operatorhub-arch-catalogsourceconfig_{context}"]
== CatalogSourceConfig

An Operator's CatalogSourceConfig is used to enable an Operator present in the
OperatorSource on the cluster.

A
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace/blob/master/deploy/examples/catalogsourceconfig.cr.yaml[simple CatalogSourceConfig]
must identify:

[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Field
|Description

|`targetNamespace`
|The location where the Operator would be deployed and updated, such as
`openshift-operators`. This is a namespace that the OLM watches.

|`packages`
|A comma-separated list of packages that make up the content of the Operator.
