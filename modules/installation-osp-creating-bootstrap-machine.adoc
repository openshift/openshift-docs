= Creating the bootstrap machine on {rh-openstack}

Create a bootstrap machine and give it the network access it needs to run on {rh-openstack-first}. Red Hat provides an Ansible playbook that you run to simplify this process.

.Prerequisites
* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies".
* You downloaded the playbooks in "Downloading the installation playbooks".
* The `inventory.yaml`, `common.yaml`, and `bootstrap.yaml` Ansible playbooks are in a common directory.
* The `metadata.json` file that the installation program created is in the same directory as the Ansible playbooks.

.Procedure

. On a command line, change the working directory to the location of the playbooks.

. On a command line, run the `bootstrap.yaml` playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml bootstrap.yaml
----

. After the bootstrap server is active, view the logs to verify that the Ignition files were received:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack console log show "$INFRA_ID-bootstrap"
----
