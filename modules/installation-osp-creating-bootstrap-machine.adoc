= Creating the bootstrap machine

Create a bootstrap machine and give it the network access it needs to run on {rh-openstack-first}. Red Hat provides an Ansible playbook that you run to simplify this process.

.Prerequisites
* The `inventory.yaml` and `common.yaml` Ansible playbooks in a common directory
** If you need these files, copy them from *Creating network resources*
* The `metadata.yaml` file that the installation program created is in the same directory as the Ansible playbooks

.Procedure

. On a command line, change the working directory to the location of the `inventory.yaml` and `common.yaml` files.

. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `bootstrap.yaml`:
+
.`bootstrap.yaml`

----
====

. On a command line, run the playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml bootstrap.yaml
----

. After the bootstrap server is active, view the logs to verify that the Ignition files were received:
+
[source,terminal]

$ openstack console log show "$INFRA_ID-bootstrap"
