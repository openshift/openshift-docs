= Creating worker nodes for the hosted cluster

If you are working on a bare metal platform, creating worker nodes is crucial to ensure that the details in the `BareMetalHost` are correctly configured.

If you are working with virtual machines, you can complete the following steps to create empty worker nodes for the Metal3 Operator to consume. To do so, you use the `kcli` tool.

.Procedure

. If this is not your first attempt to create worker nodes, you must first delete your previous setup. To do so, delete the plan by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kcli delete plan <hosted_cluster_name> <1>
----
+
<1> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

.. When you are prompted to confirm whether you want to delete the plan, type `y`.

.. Confirm that you see a message stating that the plan was deleted.

. Create the virtual machines by entering the following commands:

.. Enter the following command to create the first virtual machine:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kcli create vm \
  -P start=False \// <1>
  -P uefi_legacy=true \// <2>
  -P plan=<hosted_cluster_name> \// <3>
  -P memory=8192 -P numcpus=16 \// <4>
  -P disks=[200,200] \// <5>
  -P nets=["{\"name\": \"<network>\", \"mac\": \"aa:aa:aa:aa:11:01\"}"] \// <6>
  -P uuid=aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaa1101 \
  -P name=<hosted_cluster_name>-worker0 // <7>
----
+
<1> Include `start=False` if you do not want the virtual machine (VM) to automatically start upon creation.
<2> Include `uefi_legacy=true` to indicate that you will use UEFI legacy boot to ensure compatibility with previous UEFI implementations.
<3> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster. The `plan=<hosted_cluster_name>` statement indicates the plan name, which identifies a group of machines as a cluster.
<4> Include the `memory=8192` and `numcpus=16` parameters to specify the resources for the VM, including the RAM and CPU.
<5> Include `disks=[200,200]` to indicate that you are creating two thin-provisioned disks in the VM.
<6> Include `nets=[{"name": "<network>", "mac": "aa:aa:aa:aa:02:13"}]` to provide network details, including the network name to connect to, the type of network (`ipv4`, `ipv6`, or `dual`), and the MAC address of the primary interface.
<7> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

.. Enter the following command to create the second virtual machine:

<7> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Enter the `restart ksushy` command to restart the `ksushy` tool to ensure that the tool detects the VMs that you added:

$ systemctl restart ksushy
