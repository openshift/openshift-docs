= Configuring security context for event listeners

You can configure a custom security context directly in your `EventListener` custom resource (CR) to meet your security requirements. A custom security context can help ensure that containers run with restricted privileges and comply with {OCP} security context constraints (SCCs).

.Procedure

* Create a YAML file that defines your `EventListener` CR:

<1> Specify the pod-level security context settings. The example setting sets the pod-level security context to prevent the containers from running as the root user.
<2> Specify the container-level security context settings. The example setting restricts the container root filesystem to read-only to limit potential file system modifications at runtime.
