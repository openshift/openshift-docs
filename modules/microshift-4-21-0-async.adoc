== Enhancement

* Before this update, the readiness detection mechanism in MicroShift had inefficient polling intervals and redundant client creation that delayed startup confirmation and resource readiness detection. With this release, the mechanism has been enhanced to reduce polling intervals and eliminate redundant client creation. As a result, deployment readiness is confirmed faster, which reduces startup delays and improves resource readiness detection. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65846[OCPBUGS-65846])
