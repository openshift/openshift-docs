= About cluster logging components 

There are currently 5 different types of cluster logging components:

* logStore - This is where the logs will be stored. The current implementation is Elasticsearch.
* collection - This is the component that collects logs from the node, formats them, and stores them in the logStore. The current implementation is Fluentd.
* visualization - This is the UI component used to view logs, graphs, charts, and so forth. The current implementation is Kibana.
* curation - This is the component that trims logs by age. The current implementation is Curator.
* event routing - This is the component forwards events to cluster logging. The current implementation is Event Router.

In this document, we may refer to logStore or Elasticsearch, visualization or Kibana, curation or Curator, collection or Fluentd, interchangeably, except where noted.
