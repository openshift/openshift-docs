= About limit ranges

A limit range, defined by a LimitRange object, restricts resource
consumption in a project. In the project you can set specific resource
limits for a pod, container, image, image stream, or
persistent volume claim (PVC).

All requests to create and modify resources are evaluated against each
LimitRange object in the project. If the resource violates any of the
enumerated constraints, the resource is rejected.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For {product-title} Pro, the maximum Pod memory is 3Gi. The minimum Pod or
container memory that you can specify is 100Mi.

The following shows a limit range object for all components: pod, container,
image, image stream, or PVC. You can configure limits for any or all of these
components in the same object. You create a different limit range object for
each project where you want to control resources.
