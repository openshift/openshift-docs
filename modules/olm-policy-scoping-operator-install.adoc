= Scoping Operator installations

To provide scoping rules to Operator installations and upgrades on OLM,
associate a service account with an OperatorGroup.

Using this example, a cluster administrator can confine a set of Operators to a
designated namespace.

.Procedure

. Create a new namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: scoped
EOF
----

. Allocate permissions that you want the Operator(s) to be confined to. This
involves creating a new service account, relevant Role(s), and RoleBinding(s).
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
EOF
----
+
The following example grants the service account permissions to do anything in
the designated namespace for simplicity. In a production environment, you should
create a more fine-grained set of permissions:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: scoped-bindings
  namespace: scoped
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: scoped
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
EOF
----

. Create an OperatorGroup in the designated namespace. This OperatorGroup targets
the designated namespace to ensure that its tenancy is confined to it. In
addition, OperatorGroups allow a user to specify a service account. Specify the
ServiceAccount created in the previous step:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
spec:
  serviceAccountName: scoped
  targetNamespaces:
  - scoped
EOF
----
+
Any Operator installed in the designated namespace is tied to this OperatorGroup
and therefore to the service account specified.

. Create a Subscription in the designated namespace to install an Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: etcd
  namespace: scoped
spec:
  channel: singlenamespace-alpha
  name: etcd
  source: <catalog_source_name> <1>
  sourceNamespace: <catalog_source_namespace> <2>
EOF
----
<1> Specify a CatalogSource that already exists in the designated namespace or one
that is in the global catalog namespace.
<2> Specify a CatalogSourceNamespace where the CatalogSource was created.
+
Any Operator tied to this OperatorGroup is confined to the permissions granted
to the specified service account. If the Operator requests permissions that are
outside the scope of the service account, the installation fails with
appropriate errors.
