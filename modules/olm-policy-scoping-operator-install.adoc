= Scoping Operator installations

To provide scoping rules to Operator installations and upgrades on Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), associate a service account with an Operator group.

Using this example, a cluster administrator can confine a set of Operators to a designated namespace.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a new namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: scoped
EOF
----

. Allocate permissions that you want the Operator(s) to be confined to. This involves creating a new service account, relevant role(s), and role binding(s).
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
EOF
----
+
The following example grants the service account permissions to do anything in the designated namespace for simplicity. In a production environment, you should create a more fine-grained set of permissions:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: scoped-bindings
  namespace: scoped
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: scoped
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
EOF
----

. Create an `OperatorGroup` object in the designated namespace. This Operator group targets the designated namespace to ensure that its tenancy is confined to it.
+
In addition, Operator groups allow a user to specify a service account. Specify the service account created in the previous step:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
spec:
  serviceAccountName: scoped
  targetNamespaces:
  - scoped
EOF
----
+
Any Operator installed in the designated namespace is tied to this Operator group and therefore to the service account specified.

. Create a `Subscription` object in the designated namespace to install an Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: etcd
  namespace: scoped
spec:
  channel: singlenamespace-alpha
  name: etcd
  source: <catalog_source_name> <1>
  sourceNamespace: <catalog_source_namespace> <2>
EOF
----
<1> Specify a catalog source that already exists in the designated namespace or one that is in the global catalog namespace.
<2> Specify a namespace where the catalog source was created.
+
Any Operator tied to this Operator group is confined to the permissions granted to the specified service account. If the Operator requests permissions that are outside the scope of the service account, the installation fails with relevant errors.
