= Understanding the Prometheus trigger

You can scale pods based on Prometheus metrics, which can use the installed {product-title} monitoring or an external Prometheus server as the metrics source. See "Configuring the custom metrics autoscaler to use {product-title} monitoring" for information on the configurations required to use the {product-title} monitoring as a source for metrics.

[NOTE]
====
If Prometheus is collecting metrics from the application that the custom metrics autoscaler is scaling, do not set the minimum replicas to `0` in the custom resource. If there are no application pods, the custom metrics autoscaler does not have any metrics to scale on.

----
<1> Specifies Prometheus as the trigger type.
<2> Specifies the address of the Prometheus server. This example uses  {product-title} monitoring.
<3> Optional: Specifies the namespace of the object you want to scale. This parameter is mandatory if using {product-title} monitoring as a source for the metrics.
<4> Specifies the name to identify the metric in the `external.metrics.k8s.io` API. If you are using more than one trigger, all metric names must be unique.
<5> Specifies the value that triggers scaling. Must be specified as a quoted string value.
<6> Specifies the Prometheus query to use.
<7> Specifies the authentication method to use. Prometheus scalers support bearer authentication (`bearer`), basic authentication (`basic`), or TLS authentication (`tls`). You configure the specific authentication parameters in a trigger authentication, as discussed in a following section. As needed, you can also use a secret.
<8> Optional: Passes the `X-Scope-OrgID` header to multi-tenant link:https://cortexmetrics.io/[Cortex] or link:https://grafana.com/oss/mimir/[Mimir] storage for Prometheus. This parameter is required only with multi-tenant Prometheus storage, to indicate which data Prometheus should return.
<9> Optional: Specifies how the trigger should proceed if the Prometheus target is lost.
     * If `true`, the trigger continues to operate if the Prometheus target is lost. This is the default behavior.
     * If `false`, the trigger returns an error if the Prometheus target is lost.
<10> Optional: Specifies whether the certificate check should be skipped. For example, you might skip the check if you are running in a test environment and using self-signed certificates at the Prometheus endpoint.
     * If `false`, the certificate check is performed. This is the default behavior.
     * If `true`, the certificate check is not performed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Skipping the check is not recommended.
