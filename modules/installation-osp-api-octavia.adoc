= Scaling clusters for application traffic by using Octavia

[role="_abstract"]
To distribute traffic across multiple virtual machines (VMs), configure your cluster that runs on {rh-openstack-first} to use the Octavia load balancing service. By using this feature, you can mitigate the bottleneck that single machines or addresses create.

You must create your own Octavia load balancer to use it for application network scaling.
