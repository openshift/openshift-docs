= Scaling clusters for application traffic by using Octavia

{product-title} clusters that run on {rh-openstack-first} can use the Octavia load balancing service to distribute traffic across multiple virtual machines (VMs) or floating IP addresses. This feature mitigates the bottleneck that single machines or addresses create.

You must create your own Octavia load balancer to use it for application network scaling.
