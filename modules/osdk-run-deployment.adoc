= Testing an Ansible-based Operator on the cluster

After you have tested your custom Ansible logic locally inside of an Operator, you can test the Operator inside of a pod on an {product-title} cluster, which is prefered for production use.
endif::[]

You can run your Operator project as a deployment on your cluster.

ifdef::golang[]
.Prerequisites

* Prepared your Go-based Operator to run on {product-title} by updating the project to use supported images
endif::[]

.Procedure

. Run the following `make` commands to build and push the Operator image. Modify the `IMG` argument in the following steps to reference a repository that you have access to. You can obtain an account for storing containers at repository sites such as Quay.io.

.. Build the image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make docker-build IMG=<registry>/<user>/<image_name>:<tag>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The Dockerfile generated by the SDK for the Operator explicitly references `GOARCH=amd64` for `go build`. This can be amended to `GOARCH=$TARGETARCH` for non-AMD64 architectures. Docker will automatically set the environment variable to the value specified by `–platform`. With Buildah, the `–build-arg` will need to be used for the purpose. For more information, see link:https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/advanced-topics/multi-arch/#supporting-multiple-architectures[Multiple Architectures].
====

.. Push the image to a repository:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make docker-push IMG=<registry>/<user>/<image_name>:<tag>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The name and tag of the image, for example `IMG=<registry>/<user>/<image_name>:<tag>`, in both the commands can also be set in your Makefile. Modify the `IMG ?= controller:latest` value to set your default image name.
====

. Run the following command to deploy the Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make deploy IMG=<registry>/<user>/<image_name>:<tag>
----
+
By default, this command creates a namespace with the name of your Operator project in the form `<project_name>-system` and is used for the deployment. This command also installs the RBAC manifests from `config/rbac`.

. Verify that the Operator is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment -n <project_name>-system
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
<project_name>-controller-manager       1/1     1            1           8m
