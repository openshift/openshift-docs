== New features

In addition to the fixes and stability improvements, the following sections highlight what is new in {pipelines-title} 1.6.

[id="new-features-cli-0-21-0-release-1-6_{context}"]
=== CLI

* With this update, you can configure a pipeline or task `start` command to return a YAML or JSON-formatted string by using the `--output <string>`, where `<string>` is `yaml` or `json`. Otherwise, without the `--output` option, the `start` command returns a human-friendly message that is hard for other programs to parse. Returning a YAML or JSON-formatted string is useful for continuous integration (CI) environments.  For example, after a resource is created, you can use `yq` or `jq` to parse the YAML or JSON-formatted message about the resource and wait until that resource is terminated without using the `showlog` option.
// (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1326[#1326])

* With this update, you can authenticate to a registry with Podman's `auth.json` authentication file. For example, you can use `tkn bundle push` to push to a remote registry using podman instead of docker CLI.
// (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1430[#1430])

* With this update, if you use the `tkn taskrun delete --all` command, you can preserve runs that are younger than a specified number of minutes by using the new `--keep-since <minutes>` option. For example, to keep task runs that are less than five minutes old, you enter `tkn taskrun delete -all --keep-since 5`.
// (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1435[#1435])

* With this update, when you delete task runs or pipeline runs, you can use the `--parent-resource` and `--keep-since` options together. For example, the `tkn pipelinerun delete --pipeline pipelinename --keep-since 5` command preserves pipeline runs whose parent resource is named `pipelinename` and whose age is five minutes or less. The `tkn tr delete -t <taskname> --keep-since 5` and `tkn tr delete --clustertask <taskname> --keep-since 5` commands work similarly for task runs.
// (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1443[#1443])

* This update adds support for the triggers resources to work with `v1beta1` resources.

// (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1446[#1446], link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1449[#1449], link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1450[#1450], link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1454[#1454], link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1455[#1455])

* This update adds an `ignore-running` option to the `tkn pipelinerun delete` and `tkn taskrun delete` commands.
// (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1445[#1445])

* This update adds a `create` subcommand to the `tkn task` and `tkn clustertask` commands.
// (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1359[#1359])

* With this update, if you use the `tkn pipelinerun delete --all` command, you can preserve runs that are younger than a specified number of minutes by using the new `--keep-since <minutes>` option.
// (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1392[#1392])

$ tkn pipelinerun delete -all --keep-since 5
----

* With this update, when you use the `tkn pipelinerun delete --all` command, you can use the new `--label <string>` option to filter the pipeline runs by label. Optionally, you can use the `--label` option with `=` and `==` as equality operators, or `!=` as an inequality operator. For example, the `tkn pipelinerun delete --all --label asdf` and  `tkn pipelinerun delete --all --label==asdf` commands both delete all the pipeline runs that have the `asdf` label.
// (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1402[#1402])

* With this update, you can fetch the version of installed Tekton components from the config map or, if the config map is not present, from the deployment controller.
//  (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1393[#1393])

[id="new-features-tekton-triggers-0-16-0-release-1-6_{context}"]
=== Tekton Triggers

* With this update, triggers support the `feature-flags` and `config-defaults` config map to configure feature flags and to set default values respectively.
//  (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1182[#1182], link:https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1110[#1110])

* This update adds a new metric, `eventlistener_event_count`, that you can use to count events received by the `EventListener` resource.
//  (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1160[#1160])

* This update adds `v1beta1` Go API types. With this update, triggers now support the `v1beta1` API version.
+
With the current release, the `v1alpha1` features are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Begin using `v1beta1` features instead.
//  (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1103[#1103])

[id="new-features-pipelines-operator-1-6_{context}"]
=== {pipelines-title} Operator

* The current release enables you to configure node selection by specifying the `nodeSelector` and `toleration` values in the `TektonConfig` custom resource (CR). The Operator adds these values to all deployments it creates.
+
To configure node selection for the Operator's controller and webhook deployment, you edit the `config.nodeSelector` and `config.toleration` fields in the specification for the `Subscription` CR after installing the Operator.
+
To deploy on an infra node, you update the `TektonConfig` and `Subscription` CRs with the infra label as `nodeSelector` and `toleration` so that these labels are applied to the infra node.

== Deprecated features

[id="deprecated-cli-0-21-0-release-1-6_{context}"]
=== CLI

* In CLI 0.21.0, support for all `v1alpha1` resources for `clustertask`, `task`, `taskrun`, `pipeline`, and `pipelinerun` commands are deprecated. These resources are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

[id="deprecated-tekton-0-16-0-1-6_{context}"]
=== Tekton Triggers

* In Tekton Triggers v0.16.0, the redundant `status` label is removed from the metrics for the `EventListener` resource.
//  (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1166[#1166])
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Breaking change: The `status` label has been removed from the `eventlistener_http_duration_seconds_*` metric.
Remove queries that are based on the `status` label.
====

* With the current release, the `v1alpha1` features are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. With this update, you can begin using the `v1beta1` Go API types instead. Triggers now supports the `v1beta1` API version.
//  (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1103[#1103])

* With the current release, the `EventListener` resource sends a response before the triggers finish processing.
//  (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1132[#1132])
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Breaking change: With this change, the `EventListener` resource stops responding with a `201 Created` status code when it creates resources. Instead, it responds with a `202 Accepted` response code.
====

* The current release removes the `podTemplate` field from the `EventListener` resource.
//  (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1118[#1118])
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Breaking change: The `podTemplate` field, which was deprecated as part of link:https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1100[#1100], has been removed.
====

* The current release removes the deprecated `replicas` field from the specification for the `EventListener` resource.
//  (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1113[#1113])
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Breaking change: The deprecated `replicas` field has been removed.

[id="deprecated-features-pipelines-operator-1-6_{context}"]
=== {pipelines-title} Operator

* In {pipelines-title} 1.6, the values of `HOME="/tekton/home"` and `workingDir="/workspace"` are removed from the `Steps` specification.
+
Instead, {pipelines-title} sets `HOME` and `workingDir` to the values defined by your `Steps` containers. You can override these values in your `Steps` specification.
+
To use the older behavior, you can change the `disable-working-directory-overwrite` and `disable-home-env-overwrite` fields in the `TektonConfig` CR to `false`:
+

== Known issues

* When you run Maven and Jib-Maven cluster tasks, the default container image is supported only on Intel (x86) architecture. Therefore, tasks will fail on IBM Power Systems (ppc64le), IBM Z, and LinuxONE (s390x) clusters. As a workaround, you can specify a custom image by setting the `MAVEN_IMAGE` parameter value to `maven:3.6.3-adoptopenjdk-11`.
// issue # is unknown.

* On IBM Power Systems, IBM Z, and LinuxONE, the `s2i-dotnet` cluster task is unsupported.
// issue # is unknown.

* Before you install tasks based on Tekton Catalog on IBM Power Systems (ppc64le), IBM Z, and LinuxONE(s390x) using `tkn hub`, verify if the task can be executed on these platforms. To check if `ppc64le` and `s390x` are listed in the "Platforms" section of the task information, you can run the following command: `tkn hub info task <name>`
// issue # is unknown.

* You cannot use the `nodejs:14-ubi8-minimal` image stream because doing so generates the following errors:
+

Workaround: <workaround>.

[id="fixed-issues-1-6_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* The `tkn hub` command is now supported on IBM Power Systems, IBM Z, and LinuxONE.
// issue # is unknown.

[id="fixed-cli-0-21-0-1-6_{context}"]
=== CLI

* Before this update, the terminal was not available after the user ran a `tkn` command, and the pipeline run was done, even if `retries` were specified. Specifying a timeout in the task run or pipeline run had no effect. This update fixes the issue so that the terminal is available after running the command.
//  (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/issues/1459[#1459])

* Before this update, using the `tkn version --component=<component>` command did not return the component version. This update fixes the issue so that this command returns the component version.
//  (https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1408[#1408])

* Before this update, when you used the `tkn pr logs` command, it displayed the pipelines output logs in the wrong task order. This update resolves the issue so that logs of completed `PipelineRuns` are listed in the appropriate `TaskRun` execution order.
//  (link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1385[#1385])

[id="fixed-pipelines-operator-1-6_{context}"]
=== {pipelines-title} Operator

* Before this update, editing the specification of a running pipeline might prevent the pipeline run from stopping when it was complete. This update fixes the issue by fetching the definition only once and then using the specification stored in the status as the source of truth. This change reduces the probability of a race condition when a `PipelineRun` or a `TaskRun` refers to a `Pipeline` or `Task` that changes while it is running.
