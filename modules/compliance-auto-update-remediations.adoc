[id="automatically-update-remediations_{context}"]
=  Automatically update remediations

In some cases, a scan with newer content might mark remediations as `OUTDATED`. As an administrator, you can apply the `compliance.openshift.io/remove-outdated` annotation to apply new remediations and remove the outdated ones.

.Procedure

* Apply the `compliance.openshift.io/remove-outdated` annotation:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-compliance \
annotate compliancesuites/workers-compliancesuite compliance.openshift.io/remove-outdated=
----

Alternatively, set the `autoUpdateRemediations` flag in a `ScanSetting` or `ComplianceSuite` object to update the remediations automatically.
