= Applying update policies to managed clusters

The Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator remediates a set of `inform` policies for the clusters specified in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. Then, TALO makes enforced copies of the managed {rh-rhacm} policies. Each copied policy has its own corresponding {rh-rhacm} placement rule and {rh-rhacm} placement binding. 

One by one, TALO adds each cluster from the current batch to the placement rule that corresponds with the applicable managed policy. If a cluster is already compliant with a policy, TALO skips applying that policy on the compliant cluster. TALO then moves on to applying the next policy, with which the cluster is non-compliant. After a batch is updated, all clusters are removed from the placement rules associated with the copied policies. Then, the update of the next batch starts.

For more information about {rh-rhacm} policies, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html-single/governance/index#policy-overview[Policy overview].

.Prerequisites

* Install the Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator.
* Provision one or more managed clusters using ZTP.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Create {rh-rhacm} policies in the Hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Create the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR, and then save the YAML in the `cgu.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: du-upgrade-4915
  namespace: ztp-group-du-sno
spec:
  actions:
    afterCompletion:
      deleteObjects: true
  clusters: <1>
  - cnfdb1
  - cnfdb2
  enable: true
  managedPolicies:
  - du-upgrade-platform-upgrade <2>
  remediationStrategy:
    maxConcurrency: 2 <3>
    timeout: 240 <4>
----
<1> The list of clusters to update.
<2> The name of the policy to apply.
<3> The `maxConcurrency` field signifies the number of clusters updated at the same time.
<4> The update timeout in minutes.

. Create the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f cgu.yaml
----

.Verification

. Check if the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR was created in the Hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu -A -w
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE          NAME              AGE
ztp-group-du-sno   du-upgrade-4915   5s
----

. Check the status of the policies by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies -A | grep upgrade
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
ztp-group-du-sno      du-upgrade-4915-du-upgrade-platform-upgrade                    enforce              Compliant          24s <1>
ztp-group-du-sno      du-upgrade-platform-upgrade                                    inform               NonCompliant       3d19h
----
<1> The status of policies currently applied on the cluster is set `enforce`. The managed policies in `inform` mode from the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR remain in `inform` mode during the update.

. Check the status of the update by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion,node
----

.Example output
