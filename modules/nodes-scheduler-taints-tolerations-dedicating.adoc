= Dedicating a Node for a User using taints and tolerations

You can specify a set of nodes for exclusive use by a particular set of users.

.Procedure

To specify dedicated nodes:

. Add a taint to those nodes:
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 dedicated=groupName:NoSchedule
----

. Add a corresponding toleration to the pods by writing a custom admission controller.
+
Only the pods with the tolerations are allowed to use the dedicated nodes.
