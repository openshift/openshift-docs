= {gitops-shortname} and {ztp} plugins

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
{gitops-shortname} and {ztp} plugins provide a {gitops-shortname}-based infrastructure for managing cluster deployment and configuration.
Cluster definitions and configurations are maintained as a declarative state in Git.
ZTP plugins provide support for generating installation CRs from the `SiteConfig` CR and automatic wrapping of configuration CRs in policies based on `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs.
+
You can deploy and manage multiple versions of {product-title} on managed clusters using the baseline reference configuration CRs.
You can also use custom CRs alongside the baseline CRs.

Limits::
* 300 `SiteConfig` CRs per ArgoCD application.
You can use multiple applications to achieve the maximum number of clusters supported by a single hub cluster.

* Content in the `/source-crs` folder in Git overrides content provided in the {ztp} plugin container.
Git takes precedence in the search path.

* Add the `/source-crs` folder in the same directory as the `kustomization.yaml` file, which includes the `PolicyGenTemplate` as a generator.
+
[NOTE]
====
Alternative locations for the `/source-crs` directory are not supported in this context.
====

Engineering considerations::
* To avoid confusion or unintentional overwriting of files when updating content, use unique and distinguishable names for user-provided CRs in the `/source-crs` folder and extra manifests in Git.

* The `SiteConfig` CR allows multiple extra-manifest paths. When files with the same name are found in multiple directory paths, the last file found takes precedence.
This allows you to put the full set of version-specific Day 0 manifests (extra-manifests) in Git and reference them from the `SiteConfig` CR.
With this feature, you can deploy multiple {product-title} versions to managed clusters simultaneously.

* The `extraManifestPath` field of the `SiteConfig` CR is deprecated from {product-title} 4.15 and later.
Use the new `extraManifests.searchPaths` field instead.
