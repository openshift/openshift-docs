= {gitops-shortname} and {ztp} plugins

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
{gitops-shortname} and {ztp} plugins provide a {gitops-shortname}-based infrastructure for managing cluster deployment and configuration.
Cluster definitions and configurations are maintained as a declarative state in Git.
You can apply `ClusterInstance` CRs to the hub cluster where the `SiteConfig` Operator renders them as installation CRs.
Alternatively, you can use the {ztp} plugin to generate installation CRs directly from `SiteConfig` CRs.
The {ztp} plugin supports automatic wrapping of configuration CRs in policies based on `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can deploy and manage multiple versions of {product-title} on managed clusters using the baseline reference configuration CRs.
You can use custom CRs alongside the baseline CRs.

To maintain multiple per-version policies simultaneously, use Git to manage the versions of the source CRs and policy CRs (`PolicyGenTemplate` or `PolicyGenerator`).

Keep reference CRs and custom CRs under different directories.
Doing this allows you to patch and update the reference CRs by simple replacement of all directory contents without touching the custom CRs.
====

Limits::
* 300 `SiteConfig` CRs per ArgoCD application.
You can use multiple applications to achieve the maximum number of clusters supported by a single hub cluster.

* Content in the `/source-crs` folder in Git overrides content provided in the {ztp} plugin container.
Git takes precedence in the search path.

* Add the `/source-crs` folder in the same directory as the `kustomization.yaml` file, which includes the `PolicyGenTemplate` as a generator.
+
[NOTE]
====
Alternative locations for the `/source-crs` directory are not supported in this context.
====

* The `extraManifestPath` field of the `SiteConfig` CR is deprecated from {product-title} 4.15 and later.
Use the new `extraManifests.searchPaths` field instead.

Engineering considerations::
* For multi-node cluster upgrades, you can pause `MachineConfigPool` (`MCP`) CRs during maintenance windows by setting the `paused` field to `true`.
You can increase the number of nodes per `MCP` updated simultaneously by configuring the `maxUnavailable` setting in the `MCP` CR.
The `MaxUnavailable` field defines the percentage of nodes in the pool that can be simultaneously unavailable during a `MachineConfig` update.
Set `maxUnavailable` to the maximum tolerable value.
This reduces the number of reboots in a cluster during upgrades which results in shorter upgrade times.
When you finally unpause the `MCP` CR, all the changed configurations are applied with a single reboot.

* During cluster installation, you can pause custom `MCP` CRs by setting the `paused` field to `true` and setting `maxUnavailable` to 100% to improve installation times.

* To avoid confusion or unintentional overwriting of files when updating content, use unique and distinguishable names for user-provided CRs in the `/source-crs` folder and extra manifests in Git.

* The `SiteConfig` CR allows multiple extra-manifest paths. When files with the same name are found in multiple directory paths, the last file found takes precedence.
This allows you to put the full set of version-specific Day 0 manifests (extra-manifests) in Git and reference them from the `SiteConfig` CR.
With this feature, you can deploy multiple {product-title} versions to managed clusters simultaneously.
