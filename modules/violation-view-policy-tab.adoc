== Policy overview section

The *Policy overview* section lists the following information:

* *Severity*: A ranking of the policy (critical, high, medium, or low) for the amount of attention required.
* *Categories*: The policy category of the policy. Policy categories are listed in *Platform Configuration* -> *Policy Management* in the *Policy categories* tab.
* *Type*: Whether the policy is user generated (policies created by a user) or a system policy (policies built into {product-title-short} by default).
* *Description*: A detailed explanation of what the policy alert is about.
* *Rationale*: Information about the reasoning behind the establishment of the policy and why it matters.
* *Guidance*: Suggestions on how to address the violation.
* *MITRE ATT&CK*: Indicates if there are MITRE link:https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/containers/[tactics and techniques] that apply to this policy.

== Policy behavior

The *Policy behavior* section provides the following information:

* *Lifecycle Stage*: Lifecycle stages that the policy belongs to, `Build`, `Deploy`, or `Runtime`.
* *Event source*: This field is only applicable if the lifecycle stage is `Runtime`. It can be one of the following:
** *Deployment*: {product-title-short} triggers policy violations when event sources include process and network activity, pod exec, and pod port forwarding.
** *Audit logs*: {product-title-short} triggers policy violations when event sources match Kubernetes audit log records.
* *Response*: The response can be one of the following:
** *Inform*: Policy violations generate a violation in the violations list.
** *Inform and enforce*: The violation is enforced.
* *Enforcement*: If the response is set to *Inform and enforce*, lists the type of enforcement that is set for the following stages:
** *Build*: {product-title-short} fails your continuous integration (CI) builds when images match the criteria of the policy.
** *Deploy*: {product-title-short} blocks creation of deployments that match the conditions of the policy. In clusters with admission controller enforcement, the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server blocks all noncompliant deployments. In other clusters, {product-title-short} edits noncompliant deployments to prevent pods from being scheduled.
** *Runtime*: {product-title-short} deletes all pods when an event in the pods matches the criteria of the policy.
