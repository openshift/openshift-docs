[id="openshift-logging-5-6-4-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes
* Before this update, when LokiStack was deployed as the log store, the logs generated by Loki pods were collected and sent to LokiStack. With this update, the logs generated by Loki are excluded from collection and will not be stored. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3280[LOG-3280])

* Before this update, when the query editor on the Logs page of the OpenShift Web Console was empty, the drop-down menus did not populate. With this update, if an empty query is attempted, an error message is displayed and the drop-down menus now populate as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3454[LOG-3454])

* Before this update, when the `tls.insecureSkipVerify` option was set to `true`, the Cluster Logging Operator would generate incorrect configuration. As a result, the operator would fail to send data to Elasticsearch when attempting to skip certificate validation. With this update, the Cluster Logging Operator generates the correct TLS configuration even when `tls.insecureSkipVerify` is enabled. As a result, data can be sent successfully to Elasticsearch even when attempting to skip certificate validation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3475[LOG-3475])

* Before this update, when structured parsing was enabled and messages were forwarded to multiple destinations, they were not deep copied. This resulted in some of the received logs including the structured message, while others did not. With this update, the configuration generation has been modified to deep copy messages before JSON parsing. As a result, all received messages now have structured messages included, even when they are forwarded to multiple destinations. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3640[LOG-3640])

* Before this update, if the `collection` field contained `{}` it could result in the Operator crashing. With this update, the Operator will ignore this value, allowing the operator to continue running smoothly without interruption. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3733[LOG-3733])

* Before this update, the `nodeSelector` attribute for the Gateway component of LokiStack did not have any effect. With this update, the `nodeSelector` attribute functions as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3783[LOG-3783])

* Before this update, the static LokiStack memberlist configuration relied solely on private IP networks. As a result, when the {product-title} cluster pod network was configured with a public IP range, the LokiStack pods would crashloop. With this update, the LokiStack administrator now has the option to use the pod network for the memberlist configuration. This resolves the issue and prevents the LokiStack pods from entering a crashloop state when the {product-title} cluster pod network is configured with a public IP range. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3814[LOG-3814])

* Before this update, if the `tls.insecureSkipVerify` field was set to `true`, the Cluster Logging Operator would generate an incorrect configuration. As a result, the Operator would fail to send data to Elasticsearch when attempting to skip certificate validation. With this update, the Operator generates the correct TLS configuration even when `tls.insecureSkipVerify` is enabled. As a result, data can be sent successfully to Elasticsearch even when attempting to skip certificate validation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3838[LOG-3838])

* Before this update, if the Cluster Logging Operator (CLO) was installed without the Elasticsearch Operator, the CLO pod would continuously display an error message related to the deletion of Elasticsearch. With this update, the CLO now performs additional checks before displaying any error messages. As a result, error messages related to Elasticsearch deletion are no longer displayed in the absence of the Elasticsearch Operator.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3763[LOG-3763])
