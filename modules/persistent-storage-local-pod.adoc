= Attach the local claim

After a local volume has been mapped to a persistent volume claim
it can be specified inside of a resource.

.Prerequisites

* A persistent volume claim exists in the same namespace.

.Procedure

. Include the defined claim in the resource spec. The following example
declares the persistent volume claim inside a pod:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  ...
  containers:
    volumeMounts:
    - name: local-disks <1>
      mountPath: /data <2>
  volumes:
  - name: localpvc
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: local-pvc-name <3>
----
<1> The name of the volume to mount.
<2> The path inside the pod where the volume is mounted. Do not mount to the container root, `/`, or any path that is the same in the host and the container. This can corrupt your host system if the container is sufficiently privileged, such as the host `/dev/pts` files. It is safe to mount the host by using `/host`.
<3> The name of the existing persistent volume claim to use.

. Create the resource in the {product-title} cluster, specifying the file
you just created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <local-pod>.yaml
----
