= Testing an Operator catalog image

You can validate Operator catalog image content by running it as a container and
querying its gRPC API. To further test the image, you can then resolve an OLM
Subscription by referencing the image in a CatalogSource. For this example, the
procedure uses a custom `redhat-operators` catalog image previously built and
pushed to a supported registry.

.Prerequisites

* A custom Operator catalog image pushed to a supported registry
* `podman` version 1.5.1+
* `oc` version 4.3+
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2], which
must be exposed with a certificate that is trusted by the workstation
* link:https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl[`grpcurl`]

.Procedure

. Pull the Operator catalog image:
+
----
$ podman pull <registry_host_name>:<port>/<namespace>/redhat-operators:v1
----

. Run the image:
+
----
$ podman run -p 50051:50051 \
    -it <registry_host_name>:<port>/<namespace>/redhat-operators:v1
----

. Query the running image for available packages using `grpcurl`:
+
----
$ grpcurl -plaintext localhost:50051 api.Registry/ListPackages
{
  "name": "3scale-operator"
}
{
  "name": "amq-broker"
}
{
  "name": "amq-online"
}
----

. Get the latest Operator bundle in a channel:
+
----
$  grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"pkgName":"kiali-ossm","channelName":"stable"}' localhost:50051 api.Registry/GetBundleForChannel
{
  "csvName": "kiali-operator.v1.0.7",
  "packageName": "kiali-ossm",
  "channelName": "stable",
...
----

. Get the digest of the image:
+
----
$ podman inspect \
    --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' \
    <registry_host_name>:<port>/<namespace>/redhat-operators:v1

example_registry:5000/openshift/redhat-operators@sha256:f73d42950021f9240389f99ddc5b0c7f1b533c054ba344654ff1edaf6bf827e3
----

. Assuming an OperatorGroup exists in namespace `my-ns` that supports your
Operator and its dependencies, create a CatalogSource object using the image
digest. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: custom-redhat-operators
  namespace: my-ns
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: example_registry:5000/openshift/redhat-operators@sha256:f73d42950021f9240389f99ddc5b0c7f1b533c054ba344654ff1edaf6bf827e3
  displayName: Red Hat Operators
----

. Create a Subscription that resolves the latest available `servicemeshoperator`
and its dependencies from your catalog image:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: servicemeshoperator
  namespace: my-ns
spec:
  source: custom-redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: my-ns
  name: servicemeshoperator
  channel: 1.0
----

Updates to Red Hat's App Registry catalogs can be captured by building and
pushing a new Operator catalog image, testing it, and introducing it to existing
clusters by swapping out the CatalogSource's `spec.image` field with the new
image digest.
