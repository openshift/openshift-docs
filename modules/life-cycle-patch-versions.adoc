= Patch Versions [.small]#x.y.Z#

During the period in which a minor release is supported all
OpenShift Container Platform patch releases will be supported
unless otherwise specified.

For reasons of platform security and stability a patch release
may be deprecated, which would prevent installations of that
release and trigger mandatory upgrades off that release.

Example:
____
4.7.6 is found to contain a critical CVE.

Any releases impacted by the CVE will be removed from the
supported patch release list. And any clusters running
4.7.6 will be scheduled for automatic upgrades within 48 hours.
