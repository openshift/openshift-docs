= Patch versions (x.y.Z)

During the period in which a minor release is supported, all OpenShift Container Platform patch releases are supported unless otherwise specified.

For reasons of platform security and stability, a patch release might be deprecated, which would prevent installations of that release and trigger mandatory upgrades off that release.

.Example
. 4.7.6 is found to contain a critical CVE.
. Any releases impacted by the CVE will be removed from the supported patch release list. In addition, any clusters running 4.7.6 will be scheduled for automatic upgrades within 48 hours.
