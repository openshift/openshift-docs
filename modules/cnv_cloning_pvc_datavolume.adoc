=== Cloning the PVC of an existing virtual machine disk

You can clone a PVC of an existing virtual machine disk into a new DataVolume. The new DataVolume can then be used for a new virtual machine.

To clone a DataVolume, examine it to identify the associated PVC. Use the details of the identified PVC as the `source`.

[NOTE]
When a DataVolume is created independently of a virtual machine, the lifecycle of the DataVolume is independent of the virtual machine: If the virtual machine is deleted, neither the DataVolume nor its associated PVC will be deleted.

.Prerequisites
* A PVC of an existing virtual machine disk. The associated virtual machine must be powered down, or the clone process will be queued until the PVC is available. 

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for a DataVolume object that specifies the following parameters:
[horizontal]
`metadata: name`:: The name of the new DataVolume
`source: pvc: namespace`:: The namespace in which the source PVC exists
`source: pvc: name`:: The name of the source PVC
`storage`:: The size of the new DataVolume. Be sure to allocate enough space or the cloning operation will not complete.  The size should be the same or larger as the source PVC.

For example:
+
----
apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataVolume
metadata:
  name: cloner-datavolume
spec:
  source:
    pvc:
      namespace: "source-namespace"
      name: "my-favorite-vm-disk"
  pvc:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
storage: 500Mi
----

. Start the PVC clone by creating the DataVolume:
+
----
oc create -f <datavolume>.yaml
----

DataVolumes prevent a virtual machine from being started before the PVC has been prepared so you can link:#createvm[create a virtual machine] that references the new DataVolume while the PVC is being cloned.
