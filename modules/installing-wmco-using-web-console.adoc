= Installing the Windows Machine Config Operator using the web console

You can use the {product-title} web console to install the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO).

[NOTE]
====
Dual NIC is not supported on WMCO-managed Windows instances.
====

.Procedure

. From the *Administrator* perspective in the {product-title} web console, navigate to the *Operators -> OperatorHub* page.

. Use the *Filter by keyword* box to search for `Windows Machine Config Operator` in the catalog. Click the *Windows Machine Config Operator* tile.

. Review the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

.. Select the *stable* channel as the *Update Channel*. The *stable* channel enables the latest stable release of the WMCO to be installed.

.. The *Installation Mode* is preconfigured because the WMCO must be available in a single namespace only.

.. For *Installed Namespace*, you must select `openshift-windows-machine-config-operator`.

.. Click the *Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on the Namespace* checkbox to enable cluster monitoring for the WMCO.

.. Select an *Approval Strategy*.
+
* The *Automatic* strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
+
* The *Manual* strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.

//TODO after step 4, add image of Installation page when official Operator is available.

. Click *Install*. The WMCO is now listed on the *Installed Operators* page.
+
[NOTE]
====
The WMCO is installed automatically into the namespace you defined, like `openshift-windows-machine-config-operator`.
====

. Verify that the *Status* shows *Succeeded* to confirm successful installation of the WMCO.
