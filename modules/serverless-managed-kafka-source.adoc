= Integrating {RHOSAK} with an Apache Kafka event source

You can integrate your {RHOSAK} with {ServerlessProductName} by using an Apache Kafka event source.

.Prerequisites

* You have credentials from the {RHOSAK} instance you want to integrate, including the bootstrap server, names of your Apache Kafka topics, client ID, and client password.
* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Eventing, and Knative Kafka are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* You have enabled Apache Kafka sources on your cluster in the Knative Kafka custom resource (CR) settings.
* You are logged into the {product-title} web console.
* You have access to or have created an event sink.

.Procedure

. In the *Developer* perspective of the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Secrets*.

. Select *Key/value secret* from the *Create* drop-down to go to the *Create Key/Value Secret* page.

. Enter a *Secret Name*.

. Add two keys.
.. For the first key:
... In the *Key* field, enter `user`.
... Add the client ID from your {RHOSAK} cluster credentials as the *Value*.
.. Click *Add Key/Value* to add the next key.
.. For the second key:
... In the *Key* field, enter `password`.
