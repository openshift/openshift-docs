= Example: Controlling service-to-pod communication

A cluster is running a microservices-based application with two components: a front-end and a backend. The front-end needs to communicate with the backend to fetch data.

.Procedure

. Create a backend service.
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
----

. Configure backend pods.
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: backend-pod
  labels:
    app: backend
spec:
  containers:
    - name: backend-container
      image: my-backend-image
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
----

. Establish front-end communication.
+
The front-end pods can now use the DNS name `backend.default.svc.cluster.local` to communicate with the backend service. The service ensures that the traffic is routed to one of the backend pods. 

Service-to-pod communication abstracts the complexity of managing pod IPs and ensures reliable and efficient communication within the cluster.
