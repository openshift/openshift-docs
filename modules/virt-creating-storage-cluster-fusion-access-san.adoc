= Creating a storage cluster with {FusionSAN}

[role="_abstract"]
Once you have installed the {FusionSAN} Operator, you can create a storage cluster with shared storage nodes.

The wizard for creating the storage cluster in the {product-title} web console provides easy-to-follow steps and lists the relevant worker nodes with shared disks.

.Prerequisites

* You have bare-metal worker nodes with visible and attached shared LUNs.
+
A shared LUN is a shared disk that is accessed by all workers simultaneously.
* You installed the {FusionSAN} Operator.
* You created the `FusionAccess` custom resource (CR) in the `ibm-fusion-access` namespace.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Storage* -> *{FusionSAN}*.

. Click *Create storage cluster*.

. Select the worker nodes that have shared LUNs.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can only select worker nodes with a minimum of 20 GB of RAM from the list.
====

. Click *Create storage cluster*.
+
The page reloads, opening the {FusionSAN} page for the new storage cluster.
