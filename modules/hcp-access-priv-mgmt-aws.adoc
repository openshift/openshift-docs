= Accessing a private management cluster on {aws-short}

You can access your private management cluster by using the command-line interface (CLI).

.Procedure

. Find the private IPs of nodes by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws ec2 describe-instances --filter="Name=tag:kubernetes.io/cluster/<infra_id>,Values=owned" | jq '.Reservations[] | .Instances[] | select(.PublicDnsName=="") | .PrivateIpAddress'
----

. Create a `kubeconfig` file for the hosted cluster that you can copy to a node by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ hcp create kubeconfig > <hosted_cluster_kubeconfig>
----

. To SSH into one of the nodes through the bastion, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh ec2-user@<bastion_ip> -W %h:%p" core@<node_ip>
----

. From the SSH shell, copy the `kubeconfig` file contents to a file on the node by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mv <path_to_kubeconfig_file> <new_file_name>
----

. Export the `kubeconfig` file by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=<path_to_kubeconfig_file>
----

. Observe the hosted cluster status by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]

$ oc get clusteroperators clusterversion
