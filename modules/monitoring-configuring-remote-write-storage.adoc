= Configuring remote write storage

You can configure remote write storage to enable Prometheus to send ingested metrics to remote systems for long-term storage. Doing so has no impact on how or for how long Prometheus stores metrics.

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* *If you are configuring core {product-title} monitoring components:*
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:*
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* The `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object exists. This object is created by default when the cluster is created.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have set up a remote write compatible endpoint (such as Thanos) and know the endpoint URL. See the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage[Prometheus remote endpoints and storage documentation] for information about endpoints that are compatible with the remote write feature.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat only provides information for configuring remote write senders and does not offer guidance on configuring receiver endpoints. Customers are responsible for setting up their own endpoints that are remote-write compatible. Issues with endpoint receiver configurations are not included in Red{nbsp}Hat production support.
====
* You have set up authentication credentials in a `Secret` object for the remote write endpoint. You must create the secret in the
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
same namespace as the Prometheus object for which you configure remote write: the `openshift-monitoring` namespace for default platform monitoring or the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace for user workload monitoring.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
`openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

[WARNING]
====
To reduce security risks, use HTTPS and authentication to send metrics to an endpoint.

.Procedure

. Edit the `ConfigMap` object:
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
** *To configure remote write for the Prometheus instance that monitors core {product-title} projects*:
.. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

.. Add a `remoteWrite:` section under `data/config.yaml/prometheusK8s`.

.. Add an endpoint URL and authentication credentials in this section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com" <1>
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials> <2>
----
+
<1> The URL of the remote write endpoint.
<2> The authentication method and credentials for the endpoint.
Currently supported authentication methods are AWS Signature Version 4, authentication using HTTP in an `Authorization` request header, Basic authentication, OAuth 2.0, and TLS client.
See _Supported remote write authentication settings_ for sample configurations of supported authentication methods.

.. Add write relabel configuration values after the authentication credentials:
+

  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring

        <your_write_relabel_configs> <1>
----
<1> The write relabel configuration settings.
+
For `<your_write_relabel_configs>` substitute a list of write relabel configurations for metrics that you want to send to the remote endpoint.
+
The following sample shows how to forward a single metric called `my_metric`:
