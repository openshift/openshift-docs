You can configure remote write storage to enable Prometheus to send ingested metrics to remote systems for long-term storage. Doing so has no impact on how or for how long Prometheus stores metrics.

.Prerequisites

// tag::CPM[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
// end::CPM[]
// tag::UWM[]
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* The `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object exists. This object is created by default when the cluster is created.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
// end::UWM[]
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have set up a remote write compatible endpoint (such as Thanos) and know the endpoint URL. See the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage[Prometheus remote endpoints and storage documentation] for information about endpoints that are compatible with the remote write feature.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat only provides information for configuring remote write senders and does not offer guidance on configuring receiver endpoints. Customers are responsible for setting up their own endpoints that are remote-write compatible. Issues with endpoint receiver configurations are not included in Red{nbsp}Hat production support.
====
* You have set up authentication credentials in a `Secret` object for the remote write endpoint. You must create the secret in the `{namespace-name}` namespace.
+
[WARNING]
====
To reduce security risks, use HTTPS and authentication to send metrics to an endpoint.

.Procedure

. Edit the `{configmap-name}` config map in the `{namespace-name}` project:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc -n {namespace-name} edit configmap {configmap-name}
----

. Add a `remoteWrite:` section under `data/config.yaml/{component}`, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com" # <1>
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials> # <2>
----
<1> The URL of the remote write endpoint.
<2> The authentication method and credentials for the endpoint.
Currently supported authentication methods are AWS Signature Version 4, authentication using HTTP in an `Authorization` request header, Basic authentication, OAuth 2.0, and TLS client.
See _Supported remote write authentication settings_ for sample configurations of supported authentication methods.

. Add write relabel configuration values after the authentication credentials:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - <your_write_relabel_configs> #<1>
----
<1> Add configuration for metrics that you want to send to the remote endpoint.
+
.Example of forwarding a single metric called `my_metric`
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - sourceLabels: [__name__]
          regex: 'my_metric'
          action: keep
----
+
.Example of forwarding metrics called `my_metric_1` and `my_metric_2` in `my_namespace` namespace
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - sourceLabels: [__name__,namespace]
          regex: '(my_metric_1|my_metric_2);my_namespace'
          action: keep 
----

. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.

// Unset the source code block attributes just to be safe.
