= Network configuration parameters

You can modify your cluster network configuration parameters in the
`install-config.yaml` configuration file. The following table describes the
parameters.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot modify these parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file after installation.

|Parameter|Description|Value

ifdef::ovn-preview[]
|`networking.networkType`
|The Pod network provider plug-in to deploy. The `OpenShiftSDN` plug-in is the
only plug-in supported in {product-title} {product-version}. The `OVNKubernetes`
plug-in is available as a Technology Preview in {product-title}
{product-version}.
|Either `OpenShiftSDN` or `OVNKubernetes`. The default value is `OpenShiftSDN`.
endif::ovn-preview[]

ifndef::ovn-preview[]
|`networking.networkType`
|The Pod network provider plug-in to deploy. The `OpenShiftSDN` plug-in is the
only plug-in supported in {product-title} {product-version}.
|The default value is `OpenShiftSDN`.
endif::[]

|`networking.clusterNetwork.cidr`
|A block of IP addresses from which Pod IP addresses are allocated. The
`OpenShiftSDN` network plug-in supports multiple cluster networks. The address
blocks for multiple cluster networks must not overlap. Select address pools
large enough to fit your anticipated workload.
|An IP address allocation in CIDR format. The default value is `10.128.0.0/14`.

|`networking.clusterNetwork.hostPrefix`
|The subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if
`hostPrefix` is set to `23`, then each node is assigned a `/23` subnet out of
the given `cidr`, allowing for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) Pod IP addresses.
|A subnet prefix. The default value is `23`.

|`networking.serviceNetwork`
|A block of IP addresses for services. `OpenShiftSDN` allows only one
`serviceNetwork` block. The address block must not overlap with any other
network block.
|An IP address allocation in CIDR format. The default value is `172.30.0.0/16`.

|`networking.machineCIDR`
|A block of IP addresses used by the {product-title} installation program while
installing the cluster. The address block must not overlap with any other
network block.
|An IP address allocation in CIDR format. The default value is `10.0.0.0/16`.
