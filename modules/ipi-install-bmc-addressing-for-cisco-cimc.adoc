= BMC addressing for Cisco Integrated Management Controller

[role="_abstract"]
You can connect to a Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC) system using the Redfish virtual media protocol. The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the {product-title} cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

For Cisco UCS C-Series and X-Series servers, Red Hat supports Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC).

|Protocol|Address Format
|Redfish virtual media| `redfish-virtualmedia://<server_kvm_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/<serial_number>`
|====

To enable Redfish virtual media for Cisco UCS C-Series and X-Series servers, use `redfish-virtualmedia://` in the `address` setting. The following example demonstrates using Redfish virtual media within the `install-config.yaml` file.

  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:

          username: <user>
          password: <password>

While it is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the out-of-band management addresses, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration by using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.
