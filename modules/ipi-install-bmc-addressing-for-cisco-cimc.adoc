= BMC addressing for Cisco CIMC

The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the {product-title} cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: <hostname>
        role: <master | worker>
        bmc:

<1> The `address` configuration setting specifies the protocol.

For Cisco UCS UCSX-210C-M6 hardware, Red Hat supports Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC).

To enable Redfish virtual media for Cisco UCS UCSX-210C-M6 hardware, use `redfish-virtualmedia://` in the `address` setting. The following example demonstrates using Redfish virtual media within the `install-config.yaml` file.

    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master

          username: <user>
          password: <password>

While it is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the out-of-band management addresses, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration by using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.
