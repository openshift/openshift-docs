= Generic logger sink with IntegrationSink

The Log Sink Kamelet allows you to output CloudEvents from Knative Eventing directly to the application log. This sink is primarily used for debugging or testing event flows, as it provides visibility into the event payloads and metadata without requiring an external system.

To configure a `IntegrationSink` API resource for the logger, you can set the logging level and optionally display event headers.
