= About the Poison Pill Operator

The Poison Pill Operator runs on the cluster nodes and reboots nodes that are identified as unhealthy. The Operator uses the `MachineHealthCheck` controller to detect the health of a node in the cluster. When a node is identified as unhealthy, the `MachineHealthCheck` resource creates the `PoisonPillRemediation` custom resource (CR), which triggers the Poison Pill Operator. 

The Poison Pill Operator provides the following capabilities:

* Minimizes downtime for stateful applications and restores compute capacity if transient failures occur.
* Independent of any management interface, such as IPMI or an API to provision a node.

== Understanding the Poison Pill Operator configuration

The Poison Pill Operator creates the `PoisonPillConfig` CR with the name `poison-pill-config` in the Poison Pill Operator's namespace. You can edit this CR. However, you cannot create a new CR for the Poison Pill Operator.

A change in the `PoisonPillConfig` CR re-creates the Poison Pill daemon set.

The `PoisonPillConfig` CR resembles the following YAML file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: poison-pill.medik8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: PoisonPillConfig
metadata:
  name: poison-pill-config
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  safeTimeToAssumeNodeRebootedSeconds: 180 <1>
  watchdogFilePath: /test/watchdog1 <2>
----

<1> Specify the timeout duration for the surviving peer, after which the Operator can assume that an unhealthy node has been rebooted. The Operator automatically calculates the lower limit for this value. However, if different nodes have different watchdog timeouts, you must change this value to a higher value.
<2> Specify the file path of the watchdog device in the nodes. If a watchdog device is unavailable, the `PoisonPillConfig` CR uses a software reboot.
