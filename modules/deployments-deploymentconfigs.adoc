= DeploymentConfigs

Building on ReplicationControllers, {product-title} adds expanded support for
the software development and deployment lifecycle with the concept of
_DeploymentConfigs_. In the simplest case, a DeploymentConfig creates a new
ReplicationController and lets it start up pods.

However, {product-title} deployments from DeploymentConfigs also provide the
ability to transition from an existing deployment of an image to a new one and
also define hooks to be run before or after creating the ReplicationController.

The DeploymentConfig deployment system provides the following capabilities:

- A DeploymentConfig, which is a template for running applications.
- Triggers that drive automated deployments in response to events.
- User-customizable deployment strategies to transition from the previous version
to the new version. A strategy runs inside a Pod commonly referred as the
deployment process.
- A set of hooks (lifecycle hooks) for executing custom behavior in different
points during the lifecycle of a deployment.
- Versioning of your application in order to support rollbacks either manually or
automatically in case of deployment failure.
- Manual replication scaling and autoscaling.

When you create a DeploymentConfig, a ReplicationController is created
representing the DeploymentConfig's Pod template. If the DeploymentConfig
changes, a new ReplicationController is created with the latest Pod template,
and a deployment process runs to scale down the old ReplicationController and
scale up the new one.

Instances of your application are automatically added and removed from both
service load balancers and routers as they are created. As long as your
application supports graceful shutdown when it receives the `TERM` signal, you
can ensure that running user connections are given a chance to complete
normally.

The {product-title} `DeploymentConfig` object defines the following details:

. The elements of a `ReplicationController` definition.
. Triggers for creating a new deployment automatically.
. The strategy for transitioning between deployments.
. Lifecycle hooks.

Each time a deployment is triggered, whether manually or automatically, a
deployer Pod manages the deployment (including scaling down the old
ReplicationController, scaling up the new one, and running hooks). The
deployment pod remains for an indefinite amount of time after it completes the
Deployment in order to retain its logs of the Deployment. When a deployment is
superseded by another, the previous ReplicationController is retained to enable
easy rollback if needed.

.Example DeploymentConfig definition
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    name: frontend
  template: { ... }
  triggers:
  - type: ConfigChange <1>
  - imageChangeParams:
      automatic: true
      containerNames:
      - helloworld
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: hello-openshift:latest
    type: ImageChange  <2>
  strategy:
    type: Rolling      <3>
----
<1> A `ConfigChange` trigger causes a new Deployment to be created any time the ReplicationController template changes.
<2> An `ImageChange` trigger causes a new Deployment to be created each time a new version of the backing image is available in the named imagestream.
<3> The default `Rolling` strategy makes a downtime-free transition between Deployments.
