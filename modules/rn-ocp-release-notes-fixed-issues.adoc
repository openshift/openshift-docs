* Before this update, an incorrect private key containing certificate data caused HAProxy reload failure in OpenShift 4.14. As a consequence, incorrect certificate configuration caused HAProxy router pods to fail reloads, which led to a partial outage. With this release, `haproxy` now validates certificates. As a result, router reload failures with invalid certificates are prevented. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-49769[OCPBUGS-49769])

* To maintain compatibility with Kubernetes 1.34, CoreDNS has been updated to version 1.13.1. This update resolves intermittent DNS resolution issues reported in previous versions and includes upstream performance fixes and security patches.
