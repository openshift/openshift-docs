* Before this update, the vSphere platform configuration lacked a validation check to prevent the simultaneous definition of both a custom virtual machine template and a `clusterOSImage` parameter. As a consequence, users could provide both parameters in the installation configuration, leading to ambiguity and potential deployment failures. With this release, the vSphere validation logic has been updated to ensure that template and `clusterOSImage` parameters are treated as mutually exclusive, returning a specific error message if both fields are populated. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-63584[OCPBUGS-63584])

* Before this update, a race condition occurred when multiple reconciliation loops or concurrent processes attempted to add a virtual machine (VM) to a vSphere Host Group simultaneously due to the provider lacking a check to see if the VM was already a member. Consequently, the vSphere API could return errors during the cluster reconfiguration task, leading to reconciliation failures and preventing the VM from being correctly associated with its designated zone or host group. With this release, the zonal logic has been updated to verify the VM's membership within the target host group before initiating a reconfiguration task, ensuring the operation is only performed if the VM is not already present.

[id="rn-ocp-release-note-kube-controller-manager-fixed-issues_{context}"]
== Kube Controller Manager

* Before this update, `relatedObjects` in the `ClusterOperator` Custom Resource object omitted the `ClusterRoleBinding` object, resulting in incomplete debugging information. With this release, the related objects for `ClusterOperator` are expanded to include `ClusterRoleBinding`. As a result, the `kube-controller-manager` `ClusterRoleBinding` is included in the `ClusterOperator` output. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65502[OCPBUGS-65502])

[id="rn-ocp-release-note-kube-scheduler-fixed-issues_{context}"]
== Kube Scheduler

* Before this update, the `ClusterOperator` object failed to reference `ClusterRoleBinding` in the `relatedObjects` array, and caused the `Kube-scheduler` `ClusterRoleBinding` to be omitted in the `ClusterOperator` output. As a consequence, debugging difficulties occurred. With this release, the `ClusterRoleBinding` for the `kube-scheduler` Operator is added to the `ClusterOperator` `relatedObjects`.

== Networking

* Before this update, an incorrect private key containing certificate data caused HAProxy reload failure in {product-title} 4.14. As a consequence, incorrect certificate configuration caused HAProxy router pods to fail reloads, which led to a partial outage. With this release, `haproxy` now validates certificates. As a result, router reload failures with invalid certificates are prevented. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-49769[OCPBUGS-49769])

* To maintain compatibility with Kubernetes 1.34, CoreDNS has been updated to version 1.13.1. This update resolves intermittent DNS resolution issues reported in previous versions and includes upstream performance fixes and security patches.

[id="clock-state-metrics_{context}"]
== Clock state metrics degrade correctly after upstream clock loss

* Previously, when the upstream clock connection was lost and the clock entered the `unlocked` state, the `ptp4l` and `ts2phc` clock state metrics did not degrade as expected. This behavior caused inconsistent time synchronization state reporting. This issue has been fixed. When the upstream clock connection is lost, the `ptp4l` and `ts2phc` clock state metrics now degrade correctly, providing consistent time synchronization state reporting.

[id="rn-ocp-release-note-node-tuning-operator-fixed-issues_{context}"]
== Node Tuning Operator

* Before this update, the Performance Profile Creator tool failed to analyze a `must-gather` archive if the archive contained a custom namespace directory ending with the suffix `nodes`. With this release, the PPC now correctly excludes the `namespaces` directory when processing the must-gather data to create a suggested `PerformanceProfile`.

* Before this update, when adding a worker node by using the `oc adm node-image create` command to generate an ISO image, the ISO generation might fail with an error message stating `context deadline exceeded`. With this release, the issue is resolved and the ISO image is successfully generated. (link:http://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-63354[OCPBUGS-63354])


[id="rn-ocp-release-note-ocp-api-server-fixed-issues_{context}"]
== OpenShift API Server

* Before this update, there was an incorrect error field path for `hostUsers` when validating a security context constraint. It was shown as `.spec.securityContext.hostUsers`, but `hostUsers` is not in the security context. With this release, the error field path is now `.spec.hostUsers`.
