{ServerlessProductName} 1.32 is now available. New features, updates, and known issues that pertain to {ServerlessProductName} on {ocp-product-title} are included in the following notes.

[id="new-features-1-32-0_{context}"]
== New features

* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving 1.11.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Eventing 1.11.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Kourier 1.11.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative (`kn`) CLI 1.11.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative for Apache Kafka 1.11.
* The `kn func` CLI plugin now uses `func` 1.13.

* Serverless Logic, which is available as a Technology Preview (TP) feature, has been updated.

See link:https://openshift-knative.github.io/docs/docs/latest/serverless-logic/about.html[the Serverless Logic documentation] for usage instructions.

* You can configure the {FunctionsProductName} readiness and liveness probe settings for the `user` container and `queue-proxy` container.

* {FunctionsProductName} now supports {pipelines-shortname} versions from `1.10` till `1.14` (latest). The older versions of {pipelines-shortname} are no longer compatible with {FunctionsProductName}. 

* On-cluster function building, including using {pac} is now supported on IBM zSystems (s390x) and IBM Power (ppc64le) on {rh-storage} storage only.

* You can now subscribe a function to a set of events by using the `func subscribe` command. This links your function to `CloudEvent` objects defined by your filters and enables automated responses.

* The Knative Serving TLS encryption feature for internal traffic is now deprecated. It was a Tech Preview feature. The functionality with the `internal-encryption` configuration flag is no longer available and it will be replaced by new configuration flags in a future release.

* The secret filtering is enabled by default on the {ServerlessOperatorName} side. An environment variable `ENABLE_SECRET_INFORMER_FILTERING_BY_CERT_UID=true`, is added by default to the `net-istio` and `net-kourier` controller pods.

* The `domain-mapping` and `domain-mapping-webhook` deployments functionality in the `knative-serving` namespace is now removed. They are now integrated with Serving Webhook and Serving Controller.

* If you set `spec.config.domain` field in the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR), the default external domain will no longer auto-populates the `config-domain` config map in the `knative-serving` namespace. Now, you must configure the `config-domain` config map manually to ensure accurate domain settings.

* You can now use the gRPC health probe for `net-kourier` deployments. The the Kourier Controller now uses a standard Kubernetes gRPC health probe for both readiness and liveness, replacing its previous use of exec and custom commands. The `timeoutSeconds` value has been adjusted from 100 milliseconds to 1 second to ensure more reliable probe responses.

* The new trigger filters feature is now available as a Technology Preview. The new trigger filters are now enabled by default. It allows users to specify a set of filter expressions, where each expression evaluates to either true or false for each event.

* Knative Eventing now offers support for data in transit encryption (Eventing TLS) as a developer preview. You can configure Knative Eventing components to expose HTTPS addresses as well as add user-provided CA trust bundles to clients. 

* {ServerlessProductName} now supports custom OpenShift CA bundle injection for system components. For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/networking/configuring-a-custom-pki.html#certificate-injection-using-operators_configuring-a-custom-pki[Configuring a custom PKI].

* You can now use the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator to autoscale Knative Eventing sources for Apache Kafka sources. This functionality is available as a developer preview, offering enhanced scalability and efficiency for Kafka-based event sources within Knative Eventing.

* You can now explore the Knative Eventing monitoring dashboards directly within the *Observe* tab of the Developer view in the OpenShift Developer Console. 

* The support for EventTypes `v1beta1` in Knative shipped is deprecated in {ServerlessProductName} 1.32. In {ServerlessProductName} 1.32, the Knative CLI uses the EventType `v1beta2` API to facilitate the new reference model. In previous releases, the `kn` CLI is not backward compatible with the EventType API `v1beta1` and is limited to the `kn eventtypes` sub-commands group. Therefore, it is recommended to use a matching `kn` version for the best user experience.

== Fixed issues

* The default CPU limit is now increased for `3scale-kourier-gateways` from `500m` to `1s`. When more than 500 Knative Service instances are created, it could lead to readiness and liveness probe failures in the `3scale-kourier-gateways` pod due to CPU resource exhaustion. This adjustment aims to reduce such failures and ensures smoother operation even under heavy loads.

[id="known-issues-1-32-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

* Due to different mount point permissions, direct upload on a cluster build does not work on IBM zSystems (s390x) and IBM Power (ppc64le).

* Building and deploying a function using Podman version 4.6 fails with the `invalid pull policy "1"` error.
+
To work around this issue, use Podman version 4.5.
