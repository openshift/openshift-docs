= Accessing an example Node Tuning Operator specification

Use this process to access an example Node Tuning Operator specification.

.Procedure

 . Run:
+
----
$ oc get Tuned/default -o yaml -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
----

Note the default CR is meant for delivering standard node-level tuning for
the {product-title} platform and any custom changes to the default CR will be
overwritten by the Operator. For custom tuning, create your own tuned CRs.
Newly created CRs will be combined with the default CR and custom tuning
applied to {product-title} nodes based on node/pod labels and profile priorities.

While in certain situations the support for pod labels can be a convenient
way of automatically delivering required tuning, this practice is discouraged
and strongly advised against especially in large-scale clusters. The default
tuned CR ships without pod label matching. If a custom profile is created
with pod label matching the functionality will be enabled at that time.
The pod label functionality may be deprecated in the future versions of the
Node Tuning Operator.
