= Accessing an example Node Tuning Operator specification

Use this process to access an example Node Tuning Operator specification.

.Procedure

 . Run:
+
----
$ oc get Tuned/default -o yaml -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
----

Note the default CR is meant for delivering standard node-level tuning for
the OpenShift platform and any custom changes to the the default CR will be
overwritten by the Operator. For custom tuning, create your own tuned CRs.
Newly created CRs will be combined with the default CR and custom tuning
applied to OpenShift nodes based on node/pod labels and profile priorities.
