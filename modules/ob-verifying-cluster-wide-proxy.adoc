= Verifying cluster-wide proxy

[role="_abstract"]
If you operate your cluster behind a proxy, you must verify that the {builds-title} use the {ocp-product-title}'s cluster-wide proxy settings. This ensures that all the {builds-shortname} traffic, including cloning Git repositories for application source code and pulling container base images, is correctly routed through your existing, monitored corporate egress gateway. As a cluster administrator, you can verify the cluster-wide proxy settings.

.Procedure

* To verify if the cluster-wide proxy is correctly configured, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe proxy/cluster
----
+
The cluster proxy object displays the proxy server and certificate information.
