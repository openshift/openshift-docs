= Obtaining a FIPS-capable installation program using `oc adm extract`

{product-title} requires the use of a FIPS-capable installation binary to install a cluster in FIPS mode. You can obtain this binary by extracting it from the release image by using the {oc-first}. After you have obtained the binary, you proceed with the cluster installation, replacing all instances of the `openshift-install` command with `openshift-install-fips`.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first} with version 4.16 or newer.

.Procedure

. Extract the FIPS-capable binary from the installation program by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract --registry-config "${pullsecret_file}" --command=openshift-install-fips --to "${extract_dir}" ${RELEASE_IMAGE}
----
+
where:
+
--
`<pullsecret_file>`:: Specifies the name of a file that contains your pull secret.
`<extract_dir>`:: Specifies the directory where you want to extract the binary.
`<RELEASE_IMAGE>`:: Specifies the Quay.io URL of the {product-title} release you are using. For more information on finding the release image, see _Extracting the {product-title} installation program_.
--
. Proceed with cluster installation, replacing all instances of the `openshift-install` command with `openshift-install-fips`.
