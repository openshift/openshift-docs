= Enabling memory optimization in the spod daemon

The controller running inside of `spod` daemon process watches all pods available in the cluster when profile recording is enabled. This can lead to very high memory usage in large clusters, resulting in the `spod` daemon running out of memory or crashing.

To prevent crashes, the `spod` daemon can be configured to only load the pods labeled for profile recording into the cache memory.

[NOTE]
====
SPO memory optimization is not enabled by default.

.Procedure

. Enable memory optimization by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-security-profiles patch spod spod --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"enableMemoryOptimization":true}}'
----

. To record a security profile for a pod, the pod must be labeled with `spo.x-k8s.io/enable-recording: "true"`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-recording-pod
  labels:
    spo.x-k8s.io/enable-recording: "true"
# ...
