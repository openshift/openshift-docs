[id="olmv1-clusterextension-api_{context}"]
= ClusterExtension API

Operator Controller provides a new `ClusterExtension` API object that is a single resource representing an instance of an installed extension, which includes Operators via the `registry+v1` bundle format. This `clusterextension.olm.operatorframework.io` API streamlines management of installed extensions by consolidating user-facing APIs into a single object.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {olmv1}, `ClusterExtension` objects are cluster-scoped. This differs from {olmv0} where Operators could be either namespace-scoped or cluster-scoped, depending on the configuration of their related `Subscription` and `OperatorGroup` objects.

For more information about the earlier behavior, see _Multitenancy and Operator colocation_.
