= Understanding EgressIP failover control

The `reachabilityTotalTimeoutSeconds` parameter controls how quickly the system detects a failing `egressIP` node and initiates a failover. This parameter directly determines the maximum time the platform waits before declaring a node unreachable.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you configure `egressIP` with multiple egress nodes, the complete failover time from node failure to recovery on a new node is expected to be on the order of seconds or longer. This is because the new IP assignment can only begin after the `reachabilityTotalTimeoutSeconds` period has fully elapsed without a successful check.
====

To ensure traffic uses the correct external path, `egressIP` traffic on a node will always egress through the network interface on which the `egressIP` address has been assigned.

// Next step: The user must perform a task to implement this configuration.
