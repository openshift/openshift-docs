+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-signer -oyaml > signer_backup_secret.yaml
----

. Delete the existing signer certificate by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-signer
----

. Wait for the static pod roll out by running the following command. The static pod roll out can take a few minutes to complete.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait --for=condition=Progressing=False --timeout=15m clusteroperator/etcd
