= Scaling up the storage of clusters

{product-title} supports additional worker nodes for clusters on bare metal user-provisioned infrastructure. You can scale up the storage of clusters either by adding new worker nodes with available storage or by adding new devices to the existing worker nodes. 

{lvms-first} detects and uses additional worker nodes when the nodes become active.

To add a new device to the existing worker nodes on a cluster, you must add the path to the new device in the `deviceSelector` field of the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR).

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can add the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR only while creating the `LVMCluster` CR. If you have not added the `deviceSelector` field while creating the `LVMCluster` CR, you must delete the `LVMCluster` CR and create a new `LVMCluster` CR containing the `deviceSelector` field.
====

If you do not add the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR, {lvms} automatically adds the new devices when the devices are available.
[NOTE]
====
{lvms} adds only the supported devices. For information about unsupported devices, see "Devices not supported by LVM Storage" in the "Additional resources" section.
