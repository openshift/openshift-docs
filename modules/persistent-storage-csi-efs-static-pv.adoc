[id="efs-create-static-pv_{context}"]
= Creating static PVs with Amazon Elastic File Storage

It is possible to use an Amazon Elastic File Storage (Amazon EFS) volume as a single PV without any dynamic provisioning. The whole volume is mounted to pods.

.Prerequisites

* You have created Amazon EFS volumes.

.Procedure

* Create the PV using the following YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: efs-pv
spec:
  capacity: <1>
    storage: 5Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  csi:
    driver: efs.csi.aws.com
    volumeHandle: fs-ae66151a <2>
    volumeAttributes:
      encryptInTransit: "false" <3>
----
<1> `spec.capacity` does not have any meaning and is ignored by the CSI driver. It is used only when binding to a PVC. Applications can store any amount of data to the volume.
<2> `volumeHandle` must be the same ID as the EFS volume you created in AWS. If you are providing your own access point, `volumeHandle` should be ``<EFS volume ID>::<access point ID>``. For example: `fs-6e633ada::fsap-081a1d293f0004630`.
<3> If desired, you can disable encryption in transit. Encryption is enabled by default.
