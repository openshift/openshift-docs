= Launching the log visualizer

{product-title} uses Kibana as the log visualizer. Kibana is a browser-based console to query, discover, and visualize your logs through histograms, line graphs,
pie charts, heat maps, built-in geospatial support, and other visualizations.

.Prerequisites

* To list the *infra* and *audit* indices in Kibana, a user must have the `cluster-admin` role, the `cluster-reader` role, or both roles. The default `kubeadmin` user has proper permissions to list these indices. 
+
If you can view the pods and logs in the `default` project, you should be able to access the these indices. You can use the following command to check if the current user has proper permissions:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc auth can-i get pods/logs -n default
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
yes
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The audit logs are not stored in the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance by default. To view the audit logs in Kibana, you must use the Log Forwarding API to configure a pipeline that uses the `default` output for audit logs.
====

.Procedure

To launch Kibana:

. In the {product-title} console, click the Application Launcher {launch} and select *Logging*.

. Log in using the same credentials you use to log in to the {product-title} console.
+
The Kibana interface launches.

[NOTE]
====
If you get a *security_exception* error in the Kibana console and cannot access your Kibana indices, you might have an expired OAuth token. If you see this error, log out of the Kibana console, and then log back in. This refreshes your OAuth tokens and you should be able to access your indices.
