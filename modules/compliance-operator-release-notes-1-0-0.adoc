== Bug fixes

// 4.13 only, commenting out for now
// * Before this update, the `rhcos4-ensure-logrotate-activated` rule failed after auto-remediation was applied in {product-title} 4.13 environments. With this update, rules with auto-remediation available have a `PASS` result after the auto-remedations are applied. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-10769[*OCPBUGS-10769*])

* Before this update, the compliance_operator_compliance_scan_error_total metric had an ERROR label with a different value for each error message. With this update, the compliance_operator_compliance_scan_error_total metric does not increase in values. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1803[*OCPBUGS-1803*])

* Before this update, the `ocp4-api-server-audit-log-maxsize` rule would result in a `FAIL` state. With this update, the error message has been removed from the metric, decreasing the cardinality of the metric in line with best practices. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-7520[*OCPBUGS-7520*])

* Before this update, the `rhcos4-enable-fips-mode` rule description was misleading that FIPS could be enabled after installation. With this update, the `rhcos4-enable-fips-mode` rule description clarifies that FIPS must be enabled at install time. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8358[*OCPBUGS-8358*])
