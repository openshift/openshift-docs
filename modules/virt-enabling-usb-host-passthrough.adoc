= Enabling USB host passthrough

You can enable USB host passthrough at the cluster level.

You specify a resource name and USB device name for each device you want first to add and then assign to a virtual machine (VM). You can allocate more than one device, each of which is known as a `selector` in the HyperConverged (HCO) custom resource (CR), to a single resource name. If you have multiple, identical USB devices on the cluster, you can choose to allocate a VM to a specific device.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster as a user who has the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Identify the USB device vendor and product by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ lsusb
----

. Open the HCO CR by running the following commmand:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv
----

. Add a USB device to the `permittedHostDevices` stanza, as shown in the following example:

----
<1> Lists the host devices that have permission to be used in the cluster.
<2> Lists the available USB devices.
<3> Uses `resourceName: deviceName` for each device you want to add and assign to the VM. In this example, the resource is bound to three devices, each of which is identified by `vendor` and `product` and is known as a `selector`.
