= Common and expected errors

A common issue that may occur during the ZTP pipelines run is a failure during the check hub stage.

Another expected error occurs during the running of **deploy registry** stage of the hub cluster pipeline `kubelet` is restarted and access to the Kubernetes API is temporarily interrupted. This is normal behavior and an error message similar to the following is printed.
