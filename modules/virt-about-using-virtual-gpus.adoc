= About using virtual GPUs with {VirtProductName}

[role="_abstract"]
Some graphics processing unit (GPU) cards support the creation of virtual GPUs (vGPUs). {VirtProductName} can automatically create vGPUs and other mediated devices if an administrator provides configuration details in the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

This automation is especially useful for large clusters.

[NOTE]
====
Refer to your hardware vendor's documentation for functionality and support details.

Mediated device:: A physical device that is divided into one or more virtual devices. A vGPU is a type of mediated device (mdev); the performance of the physical GPU is divided among the virtual devices. You can assign mediated devices to one or more virtual machines (VMs), but the number of guests must be compatible with your GPU. Some GPUs do not support multiple guests.
