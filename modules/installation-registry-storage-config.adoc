[id="installation-registry-storage-config_{context}"]
= Image registry storage configuration

ifdef::aws[]
Amazon Web Services provides default storage, which means the `image-registry`
Operator is available after installation. However, if the Registry Operator
cannot create an S3 bucket and automatically configure storage, you must
manually configure registry storage.
endif::aws[]
ifndef::aws[]
The `image-registry` Operator is not initially available for platforms that do
not provide default storage. After installation, you must configure your
registry to use storage so the Registry Operator is made available.
endif::aws[]

Instructions for both configuring a PersistentVolume, which is required
for production clusters, and for configuring an empty directory as the storage
location, which is available for only non-production clusters, are shown.
