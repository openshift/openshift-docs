[id="installation-registry-storage-config_{context}"]
= Image registry storage configuration

ifdef::aws[]
Amazon Web Services provides default storage, which means the `image-registry`
Operator is available after installation. However, if the Registry Operator
cannot create an S3 bucket and automatically configure storage, you must
manually configure registry storage.
endif::aws[]
ifndef::aws[]
The `image-registry` Operator is not initially available for platforms that do
not provide default storage. After installation, you must configure your
registry to use storage so that the Registry Operator is made available.
endif::aws[]

Instructions are shown for configuring a PersistentVolume, which is required for production clusters. Where applicable, instructions are shown for configuring an empty directory as the storage location, which is available for only non-production clusters.

Additional instructions are provided for allowing the image registry to use block storage types by using the `Recreate` rollout strategy during upgrades.
