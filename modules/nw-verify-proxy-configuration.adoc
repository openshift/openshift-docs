= Verifying the cluster-wide proxy configuration

After the cluster-wide proxy configuration is deployed, you can verify that it is working as expected. Follow these steps to check the logs and validate the implementation.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions.
* You have the {product-title} `oc` CLI tool installed.

.Procedure

. Check the proxy configuration status using the `oc` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get proxy/cluster -o yaml
----

. Verify the proxy fields in the output to ensure they match your configuration. Specifically, check the `spec.httpProxy`, `spec.httpsProxy`, `spec.noProxy`, and `spec.trustedCA` fields.

. Inspect the status of the `Proxy` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get proxy/cluster -o jsonpath='{.status}'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{
status:
    httpProxy: http://user:xxx@xxxx:3128
    httpsProxy: http://user:xxx@xxxx:3128
    noProxy: .cluster.local,.svc,10.0.0.0/16,10.128.0.0/14,127.0.0.1,169.254.169.254,172.30.0.0/16,localhost,test.no-proxy.com
}
----

. Check the logs of the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to ensure that the configuration changes were applied successfully:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n openshift-machine-config-operator $(oc get pods -n openshift-machine-config-operator -l k8s-app=machine-config-operator -o name)
----

. Look for messages that indicate the proxy settings were applied and the nodes were rebooted if necessary.

. Verify that system components are using the proxy by checking the logs of a component that makes external requests, such as the Cluster Version Operator (CVO):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n openshift-cluster-version $(oc get pods -n openshift-cluster-version -l k8s-app=machine-config-operator -o name)
----

. Look for log entries that show that external requests have been routed through the proxy.
