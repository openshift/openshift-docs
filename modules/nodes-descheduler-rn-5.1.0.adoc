== New features and enhancements

* Two new descheduler profiles are now available:

** `CompactAndScale`: This profile attempts to evict pods from underutilized nodes to allow a workload to run on a smaller set of nodes.
** `LongLifecycle`: This profile balances resource usage between nodes and enables the `RemovePodsHavingTooManyRestarts` and `LowNodeUtilization` strategies.

* For the `CompactAndScale` profile, you can use the Technology Preview field `devHighNodeUtilizationThresholds` to adjust the underutilized threshold value.
