= Enabling Kuryr

You can enable Kuryr in your project by editing a parameter in `install-config.yaml`.

.Prerequisites

* Kuryr requires greater than the minimum recommended resources. As an administrator, increase OpenStack's resource quotas:
+
----
$ openstack quota set --secgroups 100 --secgroup-rules 500 --ports 500 --subnets 100 --networks 100 <project>
----

* Enable the `trunks` extension on your OpenStack project

* Install and configure Octavia components in the OpenStack environment
** Depending on your OpenStack environment, Octavia may not support UDP listeners. If it doesn't, your deployment will not support UDP services.

* If the default ML2/OVS Neutron driver is used, set the firewall to `openvswitch` intead of `ovs_hybrid`

* Have a valid `install-config.yaml` file

To deploy with Kuryr SDN instead of the default OpenShift SDN:

.Procedure

. Modify the `install-config.yaml` file to include `Kuryr` as the desired `networking.networkType`:
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
...
networking:
  networkType: Kuryr
  ...
platform:
  openstack:
    ...
    trunkSupport: true
    octaviaSupport: true
    ...
----
====

At deployment, the Kuryr SDN is used in place of the OpenShift SDN.

[NOTE]
The installer automatically discovers both `trunkSupport` and `octaviaSupport`, so you don't need to set them.
