Removed support for Keycloak in {gitops-title}::
In {gitops-title} 1.18, the support for Keycloak-based authentication is removed. As an alternative, you can migrate to Dex or configure a self-managed Red Hat Build of Keycloak (RHBK) instance. Dex is the default authentication provider in {gitops-title}. It integrates with the OpenShift OAuth server, enabling users to log in to Argo CD with their existing OpenShift users and groups. For more information, see "Configuring SSO for Argo CD using Dex". If you still want to use Keycloak, you must deploy and manage the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_keycloak/26.0/html/operator_guide/installation-[Red Hat Build of Keycloak (RHBK)] instance and manually configure the integration in the Argo CD custom resource. For more information about configuring Argo CD with keycloak, see the upstream documentation for link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/user-management/keycloak/[Keycloak].
