export KUADRANT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxx
export KUADRANT_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxx
export KUADRANT_AWS_DNS_PUBLIC_ZONE_ID=xxxx
export KUADRANT_ZONE_ROOT_DOMAIN=example.com
export KUADRANT_CLUSTER_ISSUER_NAME=self-signed
----

These environment variables are described as follows:

* `KUADRANT_GATEWAY_NS`: Namespace for your example gateway in {ocp}.
* `KUADRANT_GATEWAY_NAME`: Name of your example gateway in {ocp}.
* `KUADRANT_DEVELOPER_NS`: Namespace for the example Toystore app in {ocp}.
