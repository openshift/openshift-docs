= Creating a Linux bridge using a node network configuration policy

As a network administrator, you can create a Linux bridge interface on nodes in the cluster by applying a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest to the cluster.

.Procedure

. Create the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest. This YAML file is an example of a manifest for a Linux bridge interface.
It includes samples values that you must replace with your own information.
