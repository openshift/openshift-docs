[id="monitoring-stack-components-and-monitored-targets-{context}"]
= Stack components and monitored targets

The monitoring stack includes these components:

* Cluster Monitoring Operator
* Prometheus Operator
* Prometheus
* Prometheus Adapter
* Alertmanager
* `kube-state-metrics`
* `node-exporter`
* Grafana

The {product-title} Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) is the central component of the stack. It controls the deployed monitoring components and resources and ensures that they are always up to date.

The Prometheus Operator (PO) creates, configures, and manages Prometheus and Alertmanager instances. It also automatically generates monitoring target configurations based on familiar Kubernetes label queries.

The Prometheus Adapter exposes cluster resource metrics API for horizontal pod autoscaling. Resource metrics are CPU and memory utilization.

`node-exporter` is an agent deployed on every node to collect metrics about it.

The `kube-state-metrics` exporter agent converts Kubernetes objects to metrics that Prometheus can use.

All the components of the monitoring stack are monitored by the stack and are automatically updated when {product-title} is updated.

In addition to the components of the stack itself, the monitoring stack monitors:

* `cluster-version-operator`
* `image-registry`
* `kube-apiserver`
* `kube-apiserver-operator`
* `kube-controller-manager`
* `kube-controller-manager-operator`
* `kube-scheduler`
* `kubelet`
* `monitor-sdn`
* `openshift-apiserver`
* `openshift-apiserver-operator`
* `openshift-controller-manager`
* `openshift-controller-manager-operator`
* `openshift-svcat-controller-manager-operator`
* `telemeter-client`

Other {product-title} framework components might be exposing metrics as well. For details, see their respective documentation.
