= Stack components and monitored targets

The monitoring stack includes these components:

.Monitoring stack components
[options="header"]
|===

|Component|Description

|Cluster Monitoring Operator
|The {product-title} Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) is the central component of the stack. It controls the deployed monitoring components and resources and ensures that they are always up to date.

|Prometheus Operator
|The Prometheus Operator (PO) creates, configures, and manages Prometheus and Alertmanager instances. It also automatically generates monitoring target configurations based on familiar Kubernetes label queries.

|Prometheus
|The Prometheus is the systems and service monitoring system, around which the monitoring stack is based.

|Prometheus Adapter
|The Prometheus Adapter exposes cluster resource metrics API for horizontal pod autoscaling. Resource metrics are CPU and memory utilization.

|Alertmanager
|The Alertmanager service handles alerts sent by Prometheus.

|`kube-state-metrics`
|The `kube-state-metrics` exporter agent converts Kubernetes objects to metrics that Prometheus can use.

|`node-exporter`
|`node-exporter` is an agent deployed on every node to collect metrics about it.

|Grafana
|The Grafana analytics platform provides dashboards for analyzing and visualizing the metrics. The Grafana instance that is provided with the monitoring stack, along with its dashboards, is read-only.

|===

All the components of the monitoring stack are monitored by the stack and are automatically updated when {product-title} is updated.

In addition to the components of the stack itself, the monitoring stack monitors:

* CoreDNS
* Elasticsearch (if Logging is installed)
* etcd
* Fluentd (if Logging is installed)
* HAProxy
* Image registry
* Kubelets
* Kubernetes apiserver
* Kubernetes controller manager
* Kubernetes scheduler
* Metering (if Metering is installed)
* OpenShift apiserver
* OpenShift controller manager
* Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
* Telemeter client

[NOTE]
====
Each {product-title} component is responsible for its monitoring configuration. For problems with a component's monitoring, open a bug in Bugzilla against that component, not against the general monitoring component.
====

Other {product-title} framework components might be exposing metrics as well. For details, see their respective documentation.
