= Fine grained access for Loki logs
In {logging} 5.8 and later, the ClusterLogging Operator does not grant all users access to logs by default.  As an administrator, you need to configure your users access unless the Operator was upgraded and prior configurations are in place. Depending on your configuration and need, you can configure fine grain access to logs using the following:

* Cluster wide policies
* Namespace scoped policies
* Creation of custom admin groups

As an administrator, you need to create the role bindings and cluster role bindings appropriate for your deployment. The ClusterLogging Operator provides the following cluster roles:

* `cluster-logging-application-view` grants permission to read application logs.
* `cluster-logging-infrastructure-view` grants permission to read infrastructure logs.
* `cluster-logging-audit-view` grants permission to read audit logs.

If you have upgraded from a prior version, an additional cluster role `logging-application-logs-reader` and associated cluster role binding `logging-all-authenticated-application-logs-reader` provide backward compatibility, allowing any authenticated user read access in their namespaces.

[NOTE]
====
Users with access by namespace must provide a namespace when querying application logs.
====

== Cluster wide access
Cluster role binding resources reference cluster roles, and set permissions cluster wide.

.Example ClusterRoleBinding
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: logging-all-application-logs-reader
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-logging-application-view # <1>
subjects: # <2>
- kind: Group
  name: system:authenticated
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
----
<1> Additional `ClusterRoles` are `cluster-logging-infrastructure-view`, and `cluster-logging-audit-view`.
<2> Specifies the users or groups this object applies to.

== Namespaced access

`RoleBinding` resources can be used with `ClusterRole` objects to define the namespace a user or group has access to logs for.

.Example RoleBinding
[source,yaml]
----
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-read-logs
  namespace: log-test-0 # <1>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-logging-application-view
subjects:
- kind: User
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  name: testuser-0
----
<1> Specifies the namespace this `RoleBinding` applies to.

== Custom admin group access

If you have a large deployment with a number of users who require broader permissions, you can create a custom group using the `adminGroup` field. Users who are members of any group specified in the `adminGroups` field of the LokiStack CR are considered admins. Admin users have access to all application logs in all namespaces, if they also get assigned the `cluster-logging-application-view` role.

.Example LokiStack CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
  name: logging-loki
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  tenants:
    mode: openshift-logging # <1>
    openshift:
      adminGroups: # <2>
      - cluster-admin
      - custom-admin-group # <3>
----
<1> Custom admin groups are only available in this mode.
<2> Entering an empty list `[]` value for this field disables admin groups.
<3> Overrides the default groups (`system:cluster-admins`, `cluster-admin`, `dedicated-admin`)
