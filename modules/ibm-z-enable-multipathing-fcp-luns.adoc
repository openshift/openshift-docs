= Enabling multipathing for FCP LUNs

Tasks in this section describe how to manually configure additional devices in an {ibm-z-name} or {ibm-linuxone-name} environment. This configuration method is persistent over node restarts but not {product-title} native and you need to redo the steps if you replace the node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
On {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}, you can enable multipathing only if you configured your cluster for it during installation. For more information, see "Installing {op-system} and starting the {product-title} bootstrap process" in _Installing a cluster with z/VM on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}_.
====

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.
* You have configured multiple paths to a LUN with either method explained above.

.Procedure

. Connect to the node via SSH by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh <user>@<node_ip_address>
----
+
You can also start a debug session to the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----

. To enable multipathing, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo /sbin/mpathconf --enable
----

. To start the `multipathd` daemon, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo multipath
----

. Optional: To format your multipath device with fdisk, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo fdisk /dev/mapper/mpatha
----

.Verification

* To verify that the devices have been grouped, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo multipath -ll
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
