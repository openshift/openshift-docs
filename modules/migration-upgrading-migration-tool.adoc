You can upgrade your Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool on your source and target clusters.

If you are upgrading from CAM 1.1 to 1.2, you must update the service account token in the CAM web console.

[id='upgrading-cam-ocp-4_{context}']
== Upgrading the CAM tool on an {product-title} 4 cluster

You can upgrade the CAM tool on an {product-title} 4 cluster with the Operator Lifecycle Manager.

If you selected the *Automatic* approval option when you subscribed to the Cluster Application Migration Operator, the CAM tool is updated automatically.

The following procedure enables you to change the *Manual* approval option to *Automatic* or to change the release channel.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} console, navigate to *Operators* > *Installed Operators*.
. Click *Cluster Application Migration Operator*.
. In the *Subscription* tab, change the *Approval* option to *Automatic*.
. Optional: Edit the *Channel*.
+
Updating the subscription deploys the updated Cluster Application Migration Operator and updates the CAM tool components.

+
----
$ oc replace -f operator.yml
----

ifeval::["{mtc-version}" == "1.2.4"]
. If you are upgrading the {mtc-short} on an {product-title} 3.7 cluster, delete the Velero and Restic objects:
+
----
$ oc delete --ignore-not-found=true deployment migration-controller migration-ui velero && oc delete --ignore-not-found=true daemonset restic
----
+
The upgrade is applied when the Velero and Restic Pods restart.

[id='updating-service-account-token_{context}']
== Updating the service account token

If you are upgrading from CAM 1.1 to 1.2, you must update the service account token in the CAM web console.

CAM 1.1 uses the `mig` service account, while CAM 1.2 uses the `migration-controller` service account.

.Procedure

. Log in to a cluster and obtain the `migration-controller` service account token:
+
----
$ oc sa get-token -n openshift-migration migration-controller
----

. Log in to the CAM web console and click *Clusters*.
. Click the Options menu {kebab} of the cluster and select *Edit*.
. Copy the new token to the *Service account token* field.
. Click *Update cluster* and then click *Close*.
+
The service account token is updated for the cluster.
