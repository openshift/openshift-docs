= Upgrading the Cluster Application Migration Tool

You can upgrade your Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool on your source and target clusters.

If you are upgrading from CAM 1.1 to 1.2, you must update the service account token in the CAM web console.

[id='upgrading-cam-ocp-4_{context}']
== Upgrading the CAM tool on an {product-title} 4 cluster

You can upgrade the CAM tool on an {product-title} 4 cluster with the Operator Lifecycle Manager.

If you selected the *Automatic* approval option when you subscribed to the Cluster Application Migration Operator, the CAM tool is updated automatically.

The following procedure enables you to change the *Manual* approval option to *Automatic* or to change the release channel.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} console, navigate to *Operators* > *Installed Operators*.
. Click *Cluster Application Migration Operator*.
. In the *Subscription* tab, change the *Approval* option to *Automatic*.
. Optional: Edit the *Channel*.
+
Updating the subscription deploys the updated Cluster Application Migration Operator and updates the CAM tool components.

== Upgrading the CAM tool on an {product-title} 3 cluster

You can upgrade the CAM tool on an {product-title} 3 cluster by downloading the latest `operator.yml` file and replacing the existing Cluster Application Migration Operator CR object.

[NOTE]
====
If you remove and re-create the namespace, you must update the cluster's service account token in the CAM web console.

+
----
$ sudo podman login registry.redhat.io
----

. Download the latest `operator.yml` file:
+
----
$ sudo podman cp $(sudo podman create registry.redhat.io/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-rhel7-operator:v1.2):/operator.yml ./
----

. Log in to your {product-title} 3 cluster.

. Deploy the updated Cluster Application Migration Operator CR object:
+
----
$ oc replace -f operator.yml
----

. Get the Restic Pod:
+
----
$ oc get pod -n openshift-migration | grep restic
----

. Delete the Restic Pod so that the upgrade is applied when it restarts:
+
----
$ oc delete pod <restic_pod>
----

ifeval::["{mtc-version}" == "1.2.4"]
. If you are upgrading from {product-title} 3.7, delete the Velero and Restic objects by running the following command:
+
----
$ "oc delete --ignore-not-found=true deployment migration-controller migration-ui velero && oc delete --ignore-not-found=true daemonset restic

[id='updating-service-account-token_{context}']
== Updating the service account token

If you are upgrading from CAM 1.1 to 1.2, you must update the service account token in the CAM web console.

CAM 1.1 uses the `mig` service account, while CAM 1.2 uses the `migration-controller` service account.

.Procedure

. Log in to a cluster and obtain the `migration-controller` service account token:
+
----
$ oc sa get-token -n openshift-migration migration-controller
----

. Log in to the CAM web console and click *Clusters*.
. Click the Options menu {kebab} of the cluster and select *Edit*.
. Copy the new token to the *Service account token* field.
. Click *Update cluster* and then click *Close*.
+
The service account token is updated for the cluster.
