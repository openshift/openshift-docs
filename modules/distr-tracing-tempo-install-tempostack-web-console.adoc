= Installing a TempoStack instance by using the web console

You can install a `TempoStack` instance from the *Administrator* view of the web console.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

* For {product-dedicated}, you must be logged in using an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

* You have completed setting up the required object storage by a supported provider: link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation[{odf-full}], link:https://min.io/[MinIO], link:https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3], link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/[Azure Blob Storage], link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/[{gcp-full} Storage]. For more information, see "Object storage setup".
+
[WARNING]
====
Object storage is required and not included with the {TempoShortName}. You must choose and set up object storage by a supported provider before installing the {TempoShortName}.
====

* You have defined one or more tenants and configured the read and write permissions. For more information, see "Configuring the read permissions for tenants" and "Configuring the write permissions for tenants".
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
TempoStack instances without configured tenants provide no authentication or authorization on the ingest or query paths, and are *not supported on OpenShift*.
====

.Procedure

. Go to *Home* -> *Projects* -> *Create Project* to create a permitted project of your choice for the `TempoStack` instance that you will create in a subsequent step. Project names beginning with the `openshift-` prefix are not permitted.

. Go to *Workloads* -> *Secrets* -> *Create* -> *From YAML* to create a secret for your object storage bucket in the project that you created for the `TempoStack` instance. For more information, see "Object storage setup".

[NOTE]
====
You can create multiple `TempoStack` instances in separate projects on the same cluster.
====

.. Go to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators*.

.. Select *TempoStack* -> *Create TempoStack* -> *YAML view*.

.. In the *YAML view*, customize the `TempoStack` custom resource (CR):

.. Select *Create*.


.Verification

. Use the *Project:* dropdown list to select the project of the `TempoStack` instance.

. Go to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators* to verify that the *Status* of the `TempoStack` instance is *Condition: Ready*.

. Go to *Workloads* -> *Pods* to verify that all the component pods of the `TempoStack` instance are running.

. Access the Tempo console:

.. Go to *Networking* -> *Routes* and kbd:[Ctrl+F] to search for `tempo`.

.. In the *Location* column, open the URL to access the Tempo console.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Tempo console initially shows no trace data following the Tempo console installation.
