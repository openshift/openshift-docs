= Installing a TempoStack instance by using the web console

You can install a TempoStack instance from the *Administrator* view of the web console.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

* For {product-dedicated}, you must be logged in using an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

* You have completed setting up the required object storage by a supported provider: link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation[{odf-full}], link:https://min.io/[MinIO], link:https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3], link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/[Azure Blob Storage], link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Google Cloud Storage]. For more information, see "Object storage setup".

[WARNING]
====
Object storage is required and not included with the {TempoShortName}. You must choose and set up object storage by a supported provider before installing the {TempoShortName}.
====

.Procedure

. Go to *Home* -> *Projects* -> *Create Project* to create a project of your choice for the TempoStack instance that you will create in a subsequent step.

. Go to *Workloads* -> *Secrets* -> *Create* -> *From YAML* to create a secret for your object storage bucket in the project that you created for the TempoStack instance. For more information, see "Object storage setup".

. Create a TempoStack instance.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can create multiple TempoStack instances in separate projects on the same cluster.
====

.. Go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

.. Select *TempoStack* -> *Create TempoStack* -> *YAML view*.

.. In the *YAML view*, customize the `TempoStack` custom resource (CR):

<1> In this example, the object storage was set up as one of the prerequisites, and the object storage secret was created in step 2.
<2> Must be set to `openshift`.
<3> The list of tenants.
<4> The tenant name. Must be provided in the `X-Scope-OrgId` header when ingesting the data.
<5> Defines a universally unique identifier of the tenant. Unlike the tenantName, which must be unique at a given time, the tenantId must be unique over the entire lifetime of the Tempo deployment. Tempo uses this ID to prefix objects in the object storage. This could be a UUID, or can match the tempoName
<6> Enables a gateway that performs authentication and authorization. The Jaeger UI is exposed at `http://<gateway-ingress>/api/traces/v1/<tenant-name>/search`.
<7> The stack deployed in this example is configured to receive Jaeger Thrift over HTTP and OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), which permits visualizing the data with the Jaeger UI.

.. Select *Create*.


.Verification

. Use the *Project:* dropdown list to select the project of the *TempoStack* instance.

. Go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* to verify that the *Status* of the *TempoStack* instance is *Condition: Ready*.

. Go to *Workloads* -> *Pods* to verify that all the component pods of the *TempoStack* instance are running.

. Access the Tempo console:

.. Go to *Networking* -> *Routes* and kbd:[Ctrl+F] to search for `tempo`.

.. In the *Location* column, open the URL to access the Tempo console.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Tempo console initially shows no trace data following the Tempo console installation.
