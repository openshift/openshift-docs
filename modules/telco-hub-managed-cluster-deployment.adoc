= Managed cluster deployment

Description::
As of {rh-rhacm-first} 2.12, using the SiteConfig Operator is the recommended method for deploying managed clusters.
The SiteConfig Operator introduces a unified ClusterInstance API that decouples the parameters that define the cluster from the manner in which it is deployed.
The SiteConfig Operator uses a set of cluster templates that are instantiated using the data from a `ClusterInstance` custom resource (CR) to dynamically generate installation manifests.
Following the GitOps methodology, the `ClusterInstance` CR is sourced from a Git repository through ArgoCD.
The `ClusterInstance` CR can be used to initiate cluster installation by using either Assisted Installer, or the image-based installation available in multicluster engine.

Limits and requirements::
* The SiteConfig ArgoCD plugin which handles `SiteConfig` CRs is deprecated from {product-title} 4.18.


Engineering considerations::
* You must create a `Secret` CR with the login information for the cluster baseboard management controller (BMC).
This `Secret` CR is then referenced in the `SiteConfig` CR.
Integration with a secret store, such as Vault, can be used to manage the secrets.
* Besides offering deployment method isolation and unification of Git and non-Git workflows, the SiteConfig Operator provides better scalability, greater flexibility with the use of custom templates, and an enhanced troubleshooting experience.
