= Uninstall {SMProduct} by using the CLI

Uninstalling {SMProductName} Operator 3 and the {Istio} control plane from an existing {ocp-product-title} instance requires removing the following:

* `Istio` resource
* `IstioCNI` resource
* {SMProductName} Operator 3
* `istio-system` project
* `istio-cni` project

Optionally, you can remove the Istio custom resource definitions (CRDs).

You can uninstall the {SMProductName} Operator 3 either by using the {ocp-product-title} command line interface (CLI).
