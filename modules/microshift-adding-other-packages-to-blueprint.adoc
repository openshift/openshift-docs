= Adding other packages to a blueprint

Add the references for optional RPM packages to your OSTree blueprint to enable them.

.Prerequisites

* You created an Image Builder blueprint file.

.Procedure

. Edit your OSTree blueprint by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vi <microshift_blueprint.toml> <1>
----
<1> Replace _<microshift_blueprint.toml>_ with the name of the blueprint file used for the {microshift-short} service.

. Add the following example text to your blueprint:
+
[source,text]
----
[[packages]] <1>
name = "<microshift-additional-package-name>" <2>
version = "*"
----
<1> Include one stanza for each additional service that you want to add.
<2> Replace _<microshift-additional-package-name>_ with the name the RPM for the service you want to include. For example, `microshift-olm`.

.Next steps
. Add custom certificate authorities to the blueprint as needed.
. After you are done adding to your blueprint, you can apply the manifests to an active cluster by building a new OSTree system and deploying it on the client:
** Create the ISO.
** Add the blueprint and build the ISO.
** Download the ISO and prepare it for use.
** Do any provisioning that is needed.
