= Adding other packages to a blueprint

[role="_abstract"]
Add the references for optional RPM packages to your `ostree` blueprint to enable them.

.Prerequisites

* You created an image builder blueprint file.

.Procedure

. Edit your `ostree` blueprint by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ vi __<microshift_blueprint.toml>__
----
+
Replace `_<microshift_blueprint.toml>_` with the name of the blueprint file used for the {microshift-short} service.

. Add the following example text to your blueprint:
+
[source,text,subs="+quotes"]
----
[[packages]]
name = "__<microshift-additional-package-name>__"
version = "*"
----
+
* `\[[packages]] name =` Include one stanza for each additional service that you want to add. For example, replace `_<microshift-additional-package-name>_` in with the name the RPM for the service you want to include such as `microshift-olm`. Add another stanza as needed.

.Next steps

. Add custom certificate authorities to the blueprint as needed. For more information, see the following links:

. After you finish adding to your blueprint, you can apply the manifests to an active node by building a new {op-system-ostree} system and deploying it on the client:

* Create the ISO.
* Add the blueprint and build the ISO.
* Download the ISO and prepare it for use.
* Do any provisioning that is needed.
