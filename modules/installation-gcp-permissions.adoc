[id="installation-gcp-permissions_{context}"]
= Required GCP permissions

When you attach the `Owner` role to the service account that you create, you
grant that service account all permissions, including those that are required to
install {product-title}. To deploy an {product-title} cluster, the service
account requires the following permissions. If you deploy your cluster into an existing VPC, the service account does not require certain networking permissions, which are noted in the following lists:

.Required roles for the installation program
[cols="3,7"options="header"]
|===
|Role|Description

|Compute Admin
|Gives full control of all compute resources. This role is needed by the service account to manage virtual machine instances. {product-title} is a self-managed platform that requires permission to create cloud infrastructure to automatically scale and failover during normal operation.

|Security Admin
|Allows the service account to create, modify, and delete firewall rules and SSL certificates within the GCP project.

|Service Account Admin
|Creates and manages service accounts. This permission is required when managing your GCP credentials using mint mode.

|Service Account User
|Runs operations as the service account.

|Storage Admin
|Grants full control of storage objects and buckets, and is needed to help provide persistent storage to the cluster.

.Required roles for creating network resources during installation
[cols="3,7"options="header"]
|===
|Role|Description

|DNS Administrator
|Provides the service account read-write access to all Cloud DNS resources. To install {product-title}, your GCP account must have a dedicated public hosted zone in the same project that you host the cluster. This zone must be authoritative for the domain. The DNS service provides cluster DNS resolution and name lookup for external connections to the cluster. A cluster also needs this permission to add new DNS entries for the Ingress Operator through the Kubernetes cloud integration.
