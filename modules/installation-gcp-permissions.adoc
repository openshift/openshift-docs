= Required GCP permissions

When you attach the `Owner` role to the service account that you create, you
grant that service account all permissions, including those that are required to
install {product-title}. To deploy an {product-title} cluster, the service
account requires the following permissions:

.Required roles for the installation program
* Compute Admin
* DNS Administrator
* Security Admin
* Service Account Admin
* Service Account User
* Storage Admin

ifeval::["{context}" == "installing-gcp-user-infra"]
.Required roles for user-provisioned GCP infrastructure
* Deployment Manager Editor
* Service Account Key Admin
endif::[]

.Optional roles
For the cluster to create new limited credentials for its Operators, add
the following role:

* Service Account Key Admin

machines use:
