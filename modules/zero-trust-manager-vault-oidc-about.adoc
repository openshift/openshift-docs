= About Vault OpenID Connect

Vault OpenID Connect (OIDC) with SPIRE creates a secure authentication method where Vault uses SPIRE as a trusted OIDC provider. A workload requests a JWT-SVID from its local SPIRE Agent, which has a unique SPIFFE ID. The workload then presents this token to Vault, and Vault validates it against the public keys on the SPIRE Server. If all conditions are met, Vault issues a short-lived Vault token to the workload which the workload can now use to access secrets and perform actions within Vault.
