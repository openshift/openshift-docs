Reference configuration scaling target::

The resource requirements for the hub cluster are directly dependent on the number of clusters being managed by the hub, the number of policies used per managed cluster, and the set of features that are configured in {rh-rhacm}.

The hub cluster reference configuration can support up to 3500 managed {sno} clusters under the following conditions:

* 5 policies per cluster with link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.12/html-single/governance/index#template-comparison-table[hub-side templating] configured with a 10 minute evaluation interval

* Only the following {rh-rhacm} add-ons are enabled:
** Policy controller
** Observability with default configuration

* Managed cluster deployments aredone using {ztp} in batches of up to 500 clusters at a time

The reference configuration is also validated for deployment and management of a mix of managed cluster topologies.
The specific limits depend on the mix of cluster topologies, enabled {rh-rhacm} features, and so on.
In a mixed topology scenario, the reference hub configuration is validated with a combination of 1200 {sno} clusters, 400 compact clusters, and 230 standard clusters (3 control plane and 2 worker nodes).

[NOTE]
====
Specific dimensioning requirements are highly dependent on the cluster topology and workload.
See "Storage Requirements" for details.
Adjust cluster dimensions for the specific characteristics of your fleet of managed clusters.

Resource utilization::

The following resource utilization values were measured for hub clusters in the following scenario:

* Under reference load managing 3500 {sno} clusters
* 3-node compact cluster for management hub running on dual socket bare-metal servers.
* Network impairment of 50ms round-trip latency, 100Mbps bandwidth limit and 0.02% packet loss.
