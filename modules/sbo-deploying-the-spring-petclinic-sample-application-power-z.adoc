= Deploying the Spring PetClinic sample application

[role="_abstract"]
To deploy the Spring PetClinic sample application on an {product-title} cluster, you must use a deployment configuration and configure your local environment to be able to test the application.

.Procedure

. Deploy the `spring-petclinic` application with the `PostgresCluster` custom resource (CR) by running the following command in shell:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -n my-petclinic -f - << EOD
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spring-petclinic
  labels:
    app: spring-petclinic
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: spring-petclinic
  template:

      labels:
        app: spring-petclinic
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: quay.io/service-binding/spring-petclinic:latest
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          env:
          - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
            value: postgres
          - name: org.springframework.cloud.bindings.boot.enable
            value: "true"
          ports:
          - name: http
            containerPort: 8080

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

  labels:
    app: spring-petclinic
  name: spring-petclinic
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 80
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8080

The output verifies that the Spring PetClinic sample application is created and deployed:

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
deployment.apps/spring-petclinic created
service/spring-petclinic created
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are deploying the application using *Container images* in the *Developer* perspective of the web console, you must enter the following environment variables under the *Deployment* section of the *Advanced options*:

* Name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
* Value: postgres
====

. Verify that the application is not yet connected to the database service by running the following command:

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n my-petclinic
----
+
It takes take a few minutes until the `CrashLoopBackOff` status is displayed:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                READY   STATUS             RESTARTS      AGE
spring-petclinic-5b4c7999d4-wzdtz   0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   4 (13s ago)   2m25s
----
+
At this stage, the pod fails to start. If you try to interact with the application, it returns errors.

You can now use the {servicebinding-title} to connect the application to the database service.
