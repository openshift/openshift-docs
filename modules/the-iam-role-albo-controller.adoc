= The IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Controller

[role="_abstract"]
To authorize the {aws-short} Load Balancer Controller, configure the `CredentialsRequest` object with a manually provisioned IAM role. This ensures the controller functions correctly by using the specific permissions defined in your manual provisioning process.

You can create the IAM role by using the following options:

* Using the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) and a predefined `CredentialsRequest` object.
* Using the {aws-short} CLI and predefined {aws-short} manifests.

If your environment does not support the `ccoctl` `command.ws-short` CLI, use the {aws-short} CLI.
