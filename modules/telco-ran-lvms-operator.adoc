= LVMS Operator

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

[NOTE]
====
LVMS Operator is an optional component.

When you use the LVMS Operator as the storage solution, it replaces the Local Storage Operator, and the CPU required will be assigned to the management partition as platform overhead. The reference configuration must include one of these storage solutions but not both.
====

Description::
The LVMS Operator provides dynamic provisioning of block and file storage.
The LVMS Operator creates logical volumes from local devices that can be used as `PVC` resources by applications.
Volume expansion and snapshots are also possible.
+
The following example configuration creates a `vg1` volume group that leverages all available disks on the node except the installation disk:

Limits and requirements::
* In {sno} clusters, persistent storage must be provided by either LVMS or local storage, not both.

Engineering considerations::
* Ensure that sufficient disks or partitions are available for storage requirements.
