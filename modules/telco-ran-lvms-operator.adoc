= {lvms}

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

[NOTE]
====
{lvms-first} is an optional component.

When you use {lvms} as the storage solution, it replaces the Local Storage Operator.
CPU resources are assigned to the management partition as platform overhead.
The reference configuration must include one of these storage solutions, but not both.
====

Description::
{lvms} provides dynamic provisioning of block and file storage.
{lvms} creates logical volumes from local devices that can be used as `PVC` resources by applications.
Volume expansion and snapshots are also possible.

Limits and requirements::
* In {sno} clusters, persistent storage must be provided by either {lvms} or local storage, not both.
* Volume snapshots are excluded from the reference configuration.

Engineering considerations::
* {lvms} can be used as the local storage implementation for the RAN DU use case.
When {lvms} is used as the storage solution, it replaces the Local Storage Operator, and the CPU required is assigned to the management partition as platform overhead.
The reference configuration must include one of these storage solutions but not both.
* Ensure that sufficient disks or partitions are available for storage requirements.
