= Clusters that use short-term credentials: Verifying the credentials configuration

You can verify that your cluster is using short-term security credentials for individual components.

.Prerequisites

* You deployed an {product-title} cluster using the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`).

* You installed the {oc-first}.


.Procedure

. Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

. Verify that the cluster does not have `root` credentials by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secrets -n kube-system <secret_name>
----
+
where `<secret_name>` is `aws-creds` for AWS or `gcp-credentials` for GCP.
+
An error confirms that the root secret is not present on the cluster.

. Verify that the components are using short-term security credentials for individual components by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get authentication cluster \
  -o jsonpath \
  --template='{ .spec.serviceAccountIssuer }'
----
+
This command displays the value of the `.spec.serviceAccountIssuer` parameter in the cluster `Authentication` object. An output of a URL that is associated with your cloud provider indicates that the cluster is using manual mode with short-term credentials that are created and managed from outside of the cluster.
