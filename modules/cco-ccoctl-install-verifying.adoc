= Verifying that a cluster uses short-term credentials

You can verify that a cluster uses short-term security credentials for individual components by checking the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) configuration and other values in the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You deployed an {product-title} cluster using the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) to implement short-term credentials.

* You installed the {oc-first}.

* You are logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* Verify that the CCO is configured to operate in manual mode by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cloudcredentials cluster \
  -o=jsonpath={.spec.credentialsMode}
----
+
The following output confirms that the CCO is operating in manual mode:
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
Manual
----

* Verify that the cluster does not have `root` credentials by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secrets \
  -n kube-system <secret_name>
----
+
where `<secret_name>` is the name of the root secret for your cloud provider.
+

|Platform
|Secret name

|{aws-first}
|`aws-creds`

|{azure-first}
|`azure-credentials`

|{gcp-first}
|`gcp-credentials`

|===
+
An error confirms that the root secret is not present on the cluster.
+
.Example output for an {aws-short} cluster
[source,text]
----
Error from server (NotFound): secrets "aws-creds" not found
----

* Verify that the components are using short-term security credentials for individual components by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get authentication cluster \
  -o jsonpath \
  --template='{ .spec.serviceAccountIssuer }'
----
+
This command displays the value of the `.spec.serviceAccountIssuer` parameter in the cluster `Authentication` object.
An output of a URL that is associated with your cloud provider indicates that the cluster is using manual mode with short-term credentials that are created and managed from outside of the cluster.

* {azure-short} clusters: Verify that the components are assuming the {azure-short} client ID that is specified in the secret manifests by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secrets \
  -n openshift-image-registry installer-cloud-credentials \
  -o jsonpath='{.data}'
----
+
An output that contains the `azure_client_id` and `azure_federated_token_file` felids confirms that the components are assuming the {azure-short} client ID.

* {azure-short} clusters: Verify that the pod identity webhook is running by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods \
  -n openshift-cloud-credential-operator
----
+
