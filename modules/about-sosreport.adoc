= About sosreport

`sosreport` is a tool that collects configuration details, system information, and diagnostic data from {op-system-base-full} and {op-system-first} systems. `sosreport` provides a standardized way to collect diagnostic information relating to a node, which can then be provided to Red Hat Support for issue diagnosis.

In some support interactions, Red Hat Support may ask you to collect a `sosreport` archive for a specific {product-title} node. For example, it might sometimes be necessary to review system logs or other node-specific data that is not included within the output of `oc adm must-gather`.
