* **`VolumeDetachTimeout` configuration applied to machine pools for {product-title}.** {product-title} is applying a `VolumeDetachTimeout` configuration of 5 minutes to all machine pools. This prevents issues with node deletion when volumes fail to detach.

The default disk size is 300 GiB, and you can configure it from a minimum of 75 GiB to a maximum of 16,384 GiB.
