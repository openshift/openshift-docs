= Deleting a BuildConfig

You can delete a `BuildConfig` using the following command.

.Procedure

To delete a `BuildConfig`, run:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete bc <BuildConfigName>
----

This also deletes all builds that were instantiated from this `BuildConfig`.
Specify the `--cascade=false` flag if you do not want to delete the builds:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete --cascade=false bc <BuildConfigName>
----
