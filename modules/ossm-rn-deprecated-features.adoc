= Deprecated and removed features
Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed.

Deprecated functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

Removed functionality no longer exists in the product.

== Removed features {ProductName} 2.1

In Service Mesh 2.1, the Mixer component is removed. Bug fixes and support is provided through the end of the Service Mesh 2.0 life cycle.

Upgrading from a Service Mesh 2.0.x release to 2.1 will not proceed if Mixer plugins are enabled. Mixer plugins must be ported to WebAssembly Extensions.

With Mixer removed, custom metrics for telemetry must be obtained using Envoy filter.

== Deprecated features {ProductName} 2.0

The Mixer component was deprecated in release 2.0 and will be removed in release 2.1. While using Mixer for implementing extensions was still supported in release 2.0, extensions should have been migrated to the new link:https://istio.io/latest/blog/2020/wasm-announce/[WebAssembly] mechanism.

The following resource types are no longer supported in {ProductName} 2.0:

* `Policy` (authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1) is no longer supported. Depending on the specific configuration in your Policy resource, you may have to configure multiple resources to achieve the same effect.
** Use `RequestAuthentication` (security.istio.io/v1beta1)
** Use `PeerAuthentication` (security.istio.io/v1beta1)
* `ServiceMeshPolicy` (maistra.io/v1) is no longer supported.
** Use `RequestAuthentication` or `PeerAuthentication`, as mentioned above, but place in the control plane namespace.
* `RbacConfig` (rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1) is no longer supported.
** Replaced by `AuthorizationPolicy` (security.istio.io/v1beta1), which encompasses behavior of `RbacConfig`, `ServiceRole`, and `ServiceRoleBinding`.
* `ServiceMeshRbacConfig` (maistra.io/v1) is no longer supported.
** Use `AuthorizationPolicy` as above, but place in control plane namespace.
* `ServiceRole` (rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1) is no longer supported.
* `ServiceRoleBinding` (rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1) is no longer supported.
* In Kiali, the `login` and `LDAP` strategies are deprecated. A future version will introduce authentication using OpenID providers.
