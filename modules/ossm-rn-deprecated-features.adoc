= Deprecated features
Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed.

Deprecated functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

== Deprecated features {ProductName} 2.0

The Mixer component is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  While using Mixer for implementing extensions is still supported in release 2.0, you should be migrating your extensions to the new link:https://istio.io/latest/blog/2020/wasm-announce/[WebAssembly] mechanism.

The following resource types are no longer supported in {ProductName} 2.0:

* `Policy` (authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1) is no longer supported.  Depending on the specific configuration in your Policy resource, you may have to configure multiple resources to achieve the same effect.
** Use `RequestAuthentication` (security.istio.io/v1beta1)
** Use `PeerAuthentication` (security.istio.io/v1beta1)
* `ServiceMeshPolicy` (maistra.io/v1) is no longer supported.
** Use `RequestAuthentication` or `PeerAuthentication`, as mentioned above, but place in the control plane namespace.
* `RbacConfig` (rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1) is no longer supported.
** Replaced by `AuthorizationPolicy` (security.istio.io/v1beta1), which encompasses behavior of `RbacConfig`, `ServiceRole`, and `ServiceRoleBinding`.
* `ServiceMeshRbacConfig` (maistra.io/v1) is no longer supported.
** Use `AuthorizationPolicy` as above, but place in control plane namespace.
* `ServiceRole` (rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1) is no longer supported.
* `ServiceRoleBinding` (rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1) is no longer supported.
* In Kiali, the `login` and `LDAP` strategies are deprecated. A future version will introduce authentication using OpenID providers.
