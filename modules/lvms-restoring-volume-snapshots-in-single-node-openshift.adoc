= Restoring volume snapshots in {sno}

When you restore a volume snapshot, a new persistent volume claim (PVC) is created.
The restored PVC is independent of the volume snapshot and the source PVC.

.Prerequisites

* The storage class must be the same as that of the source PVC.
* The size of the requested PVC must be the same as that of the source volume of the snapshot.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
A snapshot must be restored to a PVC of the same size as the source volume of the snapshot. If a larger PVC is required, you can resize the PVC after the snapshot is restored successfully.
====

.Procedure

. Identify the storage class name of the source PVC and volume snapshot name.
. Save the following YAML to a file with a name such as `lvms-vol-restore.yaml` to restore the snapshot.
