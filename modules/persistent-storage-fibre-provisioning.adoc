= Provisioning
To provision Fibre Channel volumes using the `PersistentVolume` API
the following must be available:

* The `targetWWNs` (array of Fibre Channel target's World Wide
Names).
* A valid LUN number.
* The filesystem type.

A persistent volume and a LUN have a one-to-one mapping between them.

.Prerequisites

* Fibre Channel LUNs must exist in the underlying infrastructure.

<1> Fibre Channel WWNs are identified as
`/dev/disk/by-path/pci-<IDENTIFIER>-fc-0x<WWN>-lun-<LUN#>`,
but you do not need to provide any part of the path leading up to the `WWN`,
including the `0x`, and anything after, including the `-` (hyphen).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the value of the `fstype` parameter after the volume has been
formatted and provisioned can result in data loss and pod failure.
