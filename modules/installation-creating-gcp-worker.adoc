[id="installation-creating-gcp-worker_{context}"]
= Creating additional worker machines in GCP

You can create worker machines in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for your cluster
to use by launching individual instances discretely or by automated processes
outside the cluster, such as Auto Scaling Groups. You can also take advantage of
the built-in cluster scaling mechanisms and the machine API in {product-title}.

In this example, you manually launch one instance by using the Deployment
Manager template. Additional instances can be launched by including additional
resources of type `06_worker.py` in the file.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not use the provided Deployment Manager template to create your worker
machines, you must review the provided information and manually create
the infrastructure. If your cluster does not initialize correctly, you might
have to contact Red Hat support with your installation logs.

.Prerequisites

* Configure a GCP account.
* Generate the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* Create and configure a VPC and associated subnets in GCP.
* Create and configure networking and load balancers in GCP.
* Create control plane and compute roles.
* Create the bootstrap machine.
* Create the control plane machines.

.Procedure

. Copy the template from the *Deployment Manager template for worker machines*
section of this topic and save it as `06_worker.py` on your computer. This
template describes the worker machines that your cluster requires.

. Export the variables that the resource definition uses.
.. Export the subnet that hosts the compute machines:
+
ifndef::shared-vpc[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ export COMPUTE_SUBNET=`gcloud compute networks subnets describe ${INFRA_ID}-worker-subnet --region=${REGION} --format json | jq -r .selfLink`
----
endif::shared-vpc[]
ifdef::shared-vpc[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ export COMPUTE_SUBNET=$(gcloud compute networks subnets describe ${HOST_PROJECT_COMPUTE_SUBNET} --region=${REGION} --project ${HOST_PROJECT} --account ${HOST_PROJECT_ACCOUNT} --format json | jq -r .selfLink)`
----
endif::shared-vpc[]

.. Export the email address for your service account:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export WORKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=`gcloud iam service-accounts list | grep "^${INFRA_ID}-worker-node " | awk '{print $2}'`
----

.. Export the location of the compute machine Ignition config file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export WORKER_IGNITION=`cat worker.ign`
----

. Create a `06_worker.yaml` resource definition file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF >06_worker.yaml
imports:
- path: 06_worker.py

resources:
- name: 'w-a-0' <1>
  type: 06_worker.py
  properties:
    infra_id: '${INFRA_ID}' <2>
    zone: '${ZONE_0}' <3>

    compute_subnet: '${COMPUTE_SUBNET}' <4>
    image: '${CLUSTER_IMAGE}' <5>
    machine_type: 'n1-standard-4' <6>
    root_volume_size: '128'
    service_account_email: '${WORKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}' <7>

    ignition: '${WORKER_IGNITION}' <8>
EOF
----
<1> `name` is the name of the worker machine, for example `w-a-0`.
<2> `infra_id` is the `INFRA_ID` infrastructure name from the extraction step.
<3> `zone` is the zone to deploy the worker machine into, for example `us-central1-a`.
<4> `compute_subnet` is the `selfLink` URL to the compute subnet.
<5> `image` is the `selfLink` URL to the {op-system} image.
<6> `machine_type` is the machine type of the instance, for example `n1-standard-4`.
<7> `service_account_email` is the email address for the worker service account that you created.
<8> `ignition` is the contents of the `worker.ign` file.

. Optional: If you want to launch additional instances, include additional
resources of type `06_worker.py` in your `06_worker.yaml` resource definition
file.

. Create the deployment by using the `gcloud` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ gcloud deployment-manager deployments create ${INFRA_ID}-worker --config 06_worker.yaml
