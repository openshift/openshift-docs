ifdef::aws[= Configuring Capacity Reservations by using machine sets]

{product-title} version {product-version} and later supports

ifdef::azure[on-demand Capacity Reservation with Capacity Reservation groups on {azure-full} clusters.]
ifdef::aws[Capacity Reservations on {aws-full} clusters, including On-Demand Capacity Reservations and Capacity Blocks for ML.]

You can configure a machine set to deploy machines on any available resources that match the parameters of a capacity request that you define.
These parameters specify the 

ifdef::azure[VM size,]
ifdef::aws[instance type,]
region, and number of instances that you want to reserve.
If your 

ifdef::azure[{azure-short} subscription quota]
ifdef::aws[Capacity Reservation]
can accommodate the capacity request, the deployment succeeds.

For more information, including limitations and suggested use cases for this 

ifdef::azure[{azure-short} offering, see link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-overview[On-demand Capacity Reservation] in the {azure-full} documentation.]
ifdef::aws[{aws-short} offering, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/capacity-reservation-overview.html[On-Demand Capacity Reservations and Capacity Blocks for ML] in the {aws-short} documentation.]

[NOTE]
====
You cannot change an existing Capacity Reservation configuration for a machine set. 
To use a different Capacity Reservation group, you must replace the machine set and the machines that the previous machine set deployed.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You installed the {oc-first}.

ifdef::azure[]
* You created a Capacity Reservation group.
For more information, see link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-create[Create a Capacity Reservation] in the {azure-full} documentation.
endif::azure[]
ifdef::aws[]
* You purchased an On-Demand Capacity Reservation or Capacity Block for ML.
For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/capacity-reservation-overview.html[On-Demand Capacity Reservations and Capacity Blocks for ML] in the {aws-short} documentation.

.Procedure

. In a text editor, open the YAML file for an existing machine set or create a new one.

. Edit the following section under the `providerSpec` field:
+
--

.Sample configuration
[source,yaml]
----
tag::compute[]
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
end::compute[]
tag::controlplane[]

    spec:
      providerSpec:
        value:

ifdef::azure[]
          capacityReservationGroupID: <capacity_reservation_group> # <1>
endif::azure[]
ifdef::aws[]
          capacityReservationId: <capacity_reservation> # <1>
          marketType: <market_type> # <2>
endif::aws[]

end::compute[]

        providerSpec:
          value:

ifdef::azure[]
            capacityReservationGroupID: <capacity_reservation_group> # <1>
endif::azure[]
ifdef::aws[]
            capacityReservationId: <capacity_reservation> # <1>
            marketType: <market_type> # <2>
endif::aws[]

end::controlplane[]
# ...
----
<1> Specify the ID of the 

ifdef::azure[Capacity Reservation group]
ifdef::aws[Capacity Block for ML or On-Demand Capacity Reservation]
that you want the machine set to deploy machines on.

ifdef::aws[]
<2> Specify the market type to use.
The following values are valid:
`CapacityBlock`:: Use this market type with Capacity Blocks for ML.
`OnDemand`:: Use this market type with On-Demand Capacity Reservations.
tag::compute[]
`Spot`:: Use this market type with Spot Instances.
This option is not compatible with Capacity Reservations.
end::compute[]
endif::[]

--

.Verification

* To verify machine deployment, list the machines that the machine set created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
tag::compute[]
$ oc get machines.machine.openshift.io \
  -n openshift-machine-api \
  -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset=<machine_set_name>
end::compute[]
tag::controlplane[]
$ oc get machine \
  -n openshift-machine-api \
  -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role=master
end::controlplane[]
----
tag::compute[]
+
where `<machine_set_name>` is the name of the compute machine set.
end::compute[]
+
In the output, verify that the characteristics of the listed machines match the parameters of your 

ifdef::azure[Capacity Reservation.]
ifdef::aws[Capacity Reservation.]
