= Using the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator

You can use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA) by creating a VPA custom resource (CR). The CR indicates the pods to analyze and determines the actions for the VPA to take with those pods.

You can use the VPA to scale built-in resources such as deployments or stateful sets, and custom resources that manage pods. For more information, see "About using the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator".

.Prerequisites

* Ensure the workload object that you want to autoscale exists.

* Ensure that if you want to use an alternative recommender, a deployment including that recommender exists.

.Procedure

To create a VPA CR for a specific workload object:

. Change to the location of the project for the workload object you want to scale.

.. Create a VPA CR YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: vpa-recommender
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: "apps/v1"
    kind:       Deployment <1>
    name:       frontend <2>
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "InPlaceOrRecreate" <3>
  resourcePolicy: <4>
    containerPolicies:
    - containerName: my-opt-sidecar
      mode: "Off"
  recommenders: <5>
    - name: my-recommender
----
<1> Specify the type of workload object you want this VPA to manage: `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `Job`, `DaemonSet`, `ReplicaSet`, or `ReplicationController`.
<2> Specify the name of an existing workload object you want this VPA to manage.
<3> Specify the VPA mode:
* `InPlaceOrRecreate` to automatically apply the recommended resources on pods associated with the workload object. The VPA attempts to update the workload object with the new resources without re-creating the pod. If the VPA is unable to update the object in place, the VPA re-creates it.
* `Recreate` to automatically apply the recommended resources on pods associated with the workload object. The VPA terminates existing pods and creates new pods with the recommended resource limits and requests. Use the `Recreate` mode only if you need to ensure that the pods restart whenever the resource request changes.
* `Initial` to automatically apply the recommended resources to newly-created pods associated with the workload object. The VPA does not update the pods as it learns new resource recommendations.
* `Off` to only generate resource recommendations for the pods associated with the workload object. The VPA does not update the pods as it learns new resource recommendations and does not apply the recommendations to new pods.
<4> Optional. Specify the containers you want to opt-out and set the mode to `Off`.
<5> Optional. Specify an alternative recommender.

.. Create the VPA CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
----
+
After a few moments, the VPA learns the resource usage of the containers in the pods associated with the workload object.
+
You can view the VPA recommendations by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vpa <vpa-name> --output yaml
----
+
The output shows the recommendations for CPU and memory requests, similar to the following:

<4> `uncappedTarget` is the most recent resource recommendations.
