= Using the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator

You can use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA) by creating a VPA custom resource (CR). The CR indicates which pods it should analyze and determines the actions the VPA should take with those pods. 

.Prerequisites

* The workload object that you want to autoscale must exist.

* If you want to use an alternative recommender, a deployment including that recommender must exist.

.Procedure

To create a VPA CR for a specific workload object:

. Change to the project where the workload object you want to scale is located.

.. Create a VPA CR YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: vpa-recommender
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: "apps/v1"
    kind:       Deployment <1>
    name:       frontend <2>
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Auto" <3>
  resourcePolicy: <4>
    containerPolicies:
    - containerName: my-opt-sidecar
      mode: "Off"
  recommenders: <5>
    - name: my-recommender
----
<1> Specify the type of workload object you want this VPA to manage: `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `Job`, `DaemonSet`, `ReplicaSet`, or `ReplicationController`.
<2> Specify the name of an existing workload object you want this VPA to manage.
<3> Specify the VPA mode:
* `auto` to automatically apply the recommended resources on pods associated with the controller. The VPA terminates existing pods and creates new pods with the recommended resource limits and requests.
* `recreate` to automatically apply the recommended resources on pods associated with the workload object. The VPA terminates existing pods and creates new pods with the recommended resource limits and requests. The `recreate` mode should be used rarely, only if you need to ensure that the pods are restarted whenever the resource request changes. 
* `initial` to automatically apply the recommended resources when pods associated with the workload object are created. The VPA does not update the pods as it learns new resource recommendations.
* `off` to only generate resource recommendations for the pods associated with the workload object. The VPA does not update the pods as it learns new resource recommendations and does not apply the recommendations to new pods. 
<4> Optional. Specify the containers you want to opt-out and set the mode to `Off`.
<5> Optional. Specify an alternative recommender.

.. Create the VPA CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
----
+
After a few moments, the VPA learns the resource usage of the containers in the pods associated with the workload object.
+
You can view the VPA recommendations using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vpa <vpa-name> --output yaml
----
+
The output shows the recommendations for CPU and memory requests, similar to the following:
