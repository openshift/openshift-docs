= Restoring an external PostgreSQL database

By restoring an external PostgreSQL database, you can recover your {rh-rhacs-first} instance from a backup while maintaining your existing database setup. 

This procedure focuses on restoring the database that contains your {product-title-short} system data. You can perform a PostgreSQL database restore by using the vendor-recommended `pg_restore` command.

.Prerequisites

* You have scaled down Central to `0`.

.Procedure

. To perform a PostgreSQL restore, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ pg_restore -U <username> -d <database_name> <path_to_backup_file>
----
+
where:

`<username>`:: Specifies the actual user name.
`<database_name>`:: Specifies the name of the target database.
`<path_to_backup_file>`:: Specifies the location and name of the file you want to restore. You can use `.tar`, `.gz`, or another custom file format.

After you restore the external PostgreSQL database, you must restore the {product-title-short} Central certificates.
