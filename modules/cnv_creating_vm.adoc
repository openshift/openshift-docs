= Creating a new virtual machine from the CLI

The `spec` object of the VirtualMachine configuration file references
the virtual machine settings, such as the number of cores and the amount
of memory, the disk type, and the volumes to use.

Attach the virtual machine disk to the virtual machine by referencing
the relevant PVC `claimName` as a volume.
