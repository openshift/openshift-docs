= AdminNetworkPolicy

An `AdminNetworkPolicy` (ANP) is a cluster-scoped custom resource definition (CRD). As a {product-title} administrator, you can use ANP to secure your network by creating network policies before creating namespaces. Additionally, you can create network policies on a cluster-scoped level that is non-overridable by `NetworkPolicy` objects.

The key difference between `AdminNetworkPolicy` and `NetworkPolicy` objects are that the former is for administrators and is cluster scoped while the latter is for tenant owners and is namespace scoped.

An ANP allows administrators to specify the following:

* A `priority` value that determines the order of its evaluation. The lower the value the higher the precedence.

* A set of pods that consists of a set of namespaces or namespace.

* A list of ingress rules to be applied for all ingress traffic towards the `subject`.

* A list of egress rules to be applied for all egress traffic from the `subject`.

<1> Specify a name for your ANP.
<2> The `spec.priority` field supports a maximum of 100 ANP in the values of 0-99 in a cluster. The lower the value the higher the precedence. Creating `AdminNetworkPolicy` with the same priority creates a nondeterministic outcome.
<3> Specify the namespace to apply the ANP resource.
<4> ANP have both ingress and egress rules. ANP rules for `spec.ingress` field accepts values of `Pass`, `Deny`, and `Allow` for the `action` field.
<5> Specify a name for the `ingress.name`.
<6> Specify `podSelector.matchLabels` name of the pods to apply the ANP resource.
<7> ANPs have both ingress and egress rules. ANP rules for `spec.egress` field accepts values of `Pass`, `Deny`, and `Allow` for the `action` field.
