= About invoking Python functions

Python functions can be invoked with a simple HTTP request. When an incoming request is received, functions are invoked with a `context` object as the first parameter. The `context` object is a Python class with two attributes:

* The `request` attribute is always present, and contains the Flask `request` object.
* The second attribute, `cloud_event`, is populated if the incoming request is a `CloudEvent` object.

Developers can access any `CloudEvent` data from the context object.

    print(f"Method: {context.request.method}")
    print(f"Event data {context.cloud_event.data}")
