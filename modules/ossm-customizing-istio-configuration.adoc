= Customizing Istio configuration

The `values` field of the `Istio` custom resource definition, which was created when the control plane was deployed, can be used to customize Istio configuration using Istio's `Helm` configuration values. When you create this resource using the OpenShift Container Platform web console, it is pre-populated with configuration settings to enable Istio to run on OpenShift.

.Procedure

. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Click *Istio* in the *Provided APIs* column.
. Click the `Istio` instance, named `default`, in the *Name* column.
. Click *YAML* to view the `Istio` configuration and make modifications.

For a list of available configuration for the `values` field, refer to link:https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?org=istio&sort=relevance&page=1[Istio's artifacthub chart documentation].
