= Configuring a local or self-signed Baseboard Management Controller CA certificate

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure a local or self-signed Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) CA certificate on a cluster that already has a CA certificate, or add one to a cluster that was installed without a CA certificate. Providing a local or self-signed CA certificate gives you more control over secure communication with bare metal BMC's.
