= Enable active-backup mode for your cluster

[role="_abstract"]
The `active-backup` mode provides fault tolerance for network connections by switching to a backup link where the primary link fails.

The mode specifies the following ports for your cluster:

* An active port where one physical interface sends and receives traffic at any given time.
* A standby port where all other ports act as backup links and continously monitor their link status.

During a failover process, if an active port or its link fails, the bonding logic switches all network traffic to a standby port. This standby port becomes the new active port. For failover to work, all ports in a bond must share the same Media Access Control (MAC) address.
