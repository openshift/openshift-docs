= Creating an upload DataVolume

You can manually create a DataVolume with an `upload` data source to use for uploading
local disk images.

+

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataVolume
metadata:
  name: <upload-datavolume> <1>
spec:
  source:
      upload: {}
  pvc:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <2Gi> <2>
----
<1> The name of the DataVolume.
<2> The size of the DataVolume. Ensure that this value is greater than or equal
to the size of the disk that you upload.

+

[source,terminal]

$ oc create -f <upload-datavolume>.yaml
