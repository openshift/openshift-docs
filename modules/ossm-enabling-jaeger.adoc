= Enabling and disabling tracing

You enable tracing by specifying a tracing type and a sampling rate.

    type: Jaeger
----

Currently the only tracing type that is supported is `Jaeger`.   Jaeger is enabled by default.  To disable tracing, set `type` to `None`.

The sampling rate determines how often a trace is generated. You configure `sampling` as a scaled integer representing 0.01% increments.  For example, setting the value to `10` samples 0.1% of traces, setting the value to `500` samples 5% of traces, and a setting of `10000` samples 100% of traces.
