== Overlapped sharding example

An example of a configured Ingress Controller `devops-router` that has the label selector `spec.namespaceSelector.matchExpressions` with key values set to `dev` and `ops`:

.Example YAML definition for `devops-router`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: devops-router
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  namespaceSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: name
      operator: In
      values:
      - dev
      - ops

----

The routes in the namespaces labeled `name:dev` and `name:ops` are now serviced by two different Ingress Controllers. With this configuration, you have overlapping subsets of routes.

With overlapping subsets of routes you can create more complex routing rules. For example, you can divert higher priority traffic to the dedicated `finops-router` while sending lower priority traffic to `devops-router`.
