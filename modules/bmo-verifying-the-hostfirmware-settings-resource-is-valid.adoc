= Verifying the HostFirmware Settings resource is valid

When the user edits the `spec.settings` section to make a change to the `HostFirmwareSetting`(HFS) resource, the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) validates the change against the `FimwareSchema` resource, which is a read-only resource. If the setting is invalid, the BMO will set the `Type` value of the `status.Condition` setting to `False` and also generate an event and store it in the HFS resource. Use the following procedure to verify that the resource is valid.

.Procedure

. Get a list of `HostFirmwareSetting` resources:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get hfs -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Verify that the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource for a particular host is valid:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe hfs <host_name> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Where `<host_name>` is the name of the host.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the response returns `ValidationFailed`, there is an error in the resource configuration and you must update the values to conform to the `FirmwareSchema` resource.
