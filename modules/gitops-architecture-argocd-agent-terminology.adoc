= Architecture and Terminology

Argo CD Agent works alongside Argo CD to manage multi-cluster deployments in a hub-and-spoke architecture using a standalone agent process, enabling pull-based change management.

In this architecture, a single hub (referred to as the control plane cluster) manages the configuration for multiple spokes (known as workload clusters), each of which runs its own Argo CD instance.

* *control plane cluster* (hub) - In a hub-and-spoke architecture, the control plane functions as the hub. It provides a single pane of glass to monitor the status of all Argo CD Applications and their resources. In managed mode, it also serves as the single source of truth for Argo CD Application definitions. An Argo CD agent configuration includes only one control plane cluster. On this cluster, a single Argo CD instance runs alongside the Argo CD agent and is responsible for monitoring all Applications, even if they are deployed across multiple workload clusters. 
* *workload cluster* (spoke) - In a hub-and-spoke architecture, each workload cluster is a spoke that runs application workloads deployed by Argo CD. Every workload cluster hosts a lightweight Argo CD instance for local reconciliation, along with an Argo CD agent that monitors it. In autonomous mode, the workload cluster also holds the single source of truth for Application definitions. A single Argo CD instance and an agent are deployed in a workload cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The Argo CD Agent does not replace existing Argo CD functionality. It extends multi-cluster management capabilities by enabling pull-based synchronization and centralized observability.
