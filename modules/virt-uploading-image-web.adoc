= Uploading an image file using the web console

Use the web console to upload an image file to a new Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).
You can later use this PVC to attach the image to new virtual machines.

.Prerequisites

* You must have one of the following:
** A raw virtual machine image file in either ISO or IMG format.
** A virtual machine image file in QCOW2 format.
* For best results, compress your image file according to the following guidelines before you upload it:
** Compress a raw image file by using `xz` or `gzip`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Using a compressed raw image file results in the most efficient upload.
====
** Compress a QCOW2 image file by using the method that is recommended for your client:
*** If you use a Linux client, _sparsify_ the QCOW2 file by using the
link:https://libguestfs.org/virt-sparsify.1.html[virt-sparsify] tool.
*** If you use a Windows client, compress the QCOW2 file by using `xz` or `gzip`.

.. Select the *Attach this data to a virtual machine operating system* check box.

.. Select an operating system from the list.
