= Creating a subscription with administrator privileges

After you have created a channel and an event sink, also known as a _subscriber_, you can create a subscription to enable event delivery. Subscriptions are created by configuring a `Subscription` object, which specifies the channel and the subscriber to deliver events to. You can also specify some subscriber-specific options, such as how to handle failures.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing are installed on your {ocp-product-title} cluster.

* You have logged in to the web console.

* You have `cluster-admin` privileges on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator privileges on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.

* You have created an event sink, such as a Knative service, and a channel.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp-product-title} web console, navigate to *Serverless* -> *Eventing*.
. In the *Channel* tab, select the Options menu {kebab} for the channel that you want to add a subscription to.
. Click *Add Subscription* in the list.
. In the *Add Subscription* dialogue box, select a *Subscriber* for the subscription. The subscriber is the Knative service that receives events from the channel.
. Click *Add*.
