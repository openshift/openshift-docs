= Enabling KubeVirt VM image caching

You can use KubeVirt VM image caching to optimize both cluster startup time and storage usage. KubeVirt VM image caching supports the use of a storage class that is capable of smart cloning and the `ReadWriteMany` access mode. For more information about smart cloning, see _Cloning a data volume using smart-cloning_.

Image caching works as follows:

. The VM image is imported to a PVC that is associated with the hosted cluster.
. A unique clone of that PVC is created for every KubeVirt VM that is added as a worker node to the cluster.

Image caching reduces VM startup time by requiring only a single image import. It can further reduce overall cluster storage usage when the storage class supports copy-on-write cloning.

.Procedure

* To enable image caching, during cluster creation, use the `--root-volume-cache-strategy=PVC` argument by running the following command:
