== Upgrading from {prodname} 1.0 to {version}

You can upgrade from {prodname} 1.0.x to {prodname} {version}.x by using the OperatorHub in the OpenShift web console.

IMPORTANT: On OpenShift 4.19 or later, if you are updating your cluster from a previous OpenShift version that contains Gateway API CRDs, you must ensure that these resources exactly match the Gateway API version supported by OpenShift 4.19. For more details, see the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html-single/updating_clusters/index#nw-ingress-gateway-api-manage-succession_updating-cluster-prepare[OpenShift documentation on managing Gateway API resources].


IMPORTANT: On {ocp} 4.19 or later, if you are updating your cluster from a previous {ocp} version that contains Gateway API CRDs, you must ensure that these resources exactly match the Gateway API version supported by {ocp} 4.19. For more information, see the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html-single/updating_clusters/index#nw-ingress-gateway-api-manage-succession_updating-cluster-prepare[OpenShift documentation on managing Gateway API resources].

.Prerequisites
* You already have {prodname} 1.0.x installed on OpenShift 4.17 or later.

.Procedure
. Click *Operators > Installed Operators* > *{companyname} {prodname}*.
. Ensure that the *Update channel* is set to `stable`.
. If *Update approval* is set to *Automatic*, the upgrade will be approved and installed immediately when the *Update channel* is set to `stable`.
. If *Update approval* is set to *Manual*, click *Install*.
. Wait until the {prodname} Operator is deployed.
. Verify that {prodname} {version} is installed and that your deployment is up and running.

|Issue|Description

| https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CONNLINK-529[CONNLINK-529]
| {service-mesh} pull secret configuration is cumbersome.

Previously, for RateLimitPolicy or AuthPolicy only, you were required to authenticate to `registry.redhat.io` to access the Wasm plug-in image used with {service-mesh} as the Gateway API provider. Now, authenticating to `registry.redhat.io` to access the Wasm plug-in image is no longer required.

| https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CONNLINK-433[CONNLINK-433]
| {ocp} 4.19 Gateway API compatibility.

Previously, on {ocp} 4.19, {prodname} used an incorrect Gateway API controller name. The Gateway API controller name is required in order to enable the Gateway API CRDs, which are now provided in {ocp} 4.19. Now, {prodname} uses the correct Gateway API controller name for {ocp} 4.19.

| Namespace selector on Policies view switches user from sub-navigation item.

Previously, in the *Policies* view, in a specific policy list such as DNS policies, when you switched namespace, you returned to the *All Policies* view. Now, when you switch namespace, you stay in the original specific policy list.
