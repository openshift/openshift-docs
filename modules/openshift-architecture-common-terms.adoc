Admission plugins enforce security policies, resource limitations, or configuration requirements.

authentication::
// The following variations have only minor differences, but are separated for maintainability.
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
To control access to an {product-title} cluster, a cluster administrator can configure user authentication to ensure only approved users access the cluster. To interact with an {product-title} cluster, you must authenticate with the {product-title} API. You can authenticate by providing an OAuth access token or an X.509 client certificate in your requests to the {product-title} API.

container workloads::
Applications that are packaged and deployed in containers.

control groups (cgroups)::
Partitions sets of processes into groups to manage and limit the resources processes consume.

control plane::
A container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the life cycle of containers. Control planes are also known as control plane machines.

A Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates with the operating system to deliver an efficient Kubernetes experience.

deployment::
A Kubernetes resource object that maintains the life cycle of an application.

Dockerfile::
A text file that contains the user commands to perform on a terminal to assemble the image.
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
hosted control planes::
A {product-title} feature that enables hosting a control plane on the {product-title} cluster from its data plane and workers. This model performs the following actions:

* Optimize infrastructure costs required for the control planes.
* Improve the cluster creation time.
* Enable hosting the control plane using the Kubernetes native high level primitives. For example, deployments and stateful sets.
* Allow a strong network segmentation between the control plane and workloads.

hybrid cloud deployments::
Deployments that deliver a consistent platform across bare metal, virtual, private, and public cloud environments. This offers speed, agility, and portability.

Ignition::
A utility that {op-system} uses to manipulate disks during initial configuration. It completes common disk tasks, including partitioning disks, formatting partitions, writing files, and configuring users.

installer-provisioned infrastructure::
The installation program deploys and configures the infrastructure that the cluster runs on.

kubelet::
A primary node agent that runs on each node in the cluster to ensure that containers are running in a pod.

kubernetes manifest::
Specifications of a Kubernetes API object in a JSON or YAML format. A configuration file can include deployments, config maps, secrets, daemon sets.

Machine Config Daemon (MCD)::
A daemon that regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift.

Machine Config Operator (MCO)::
An Operator that applies the new configuration to your cluster machines.

machine config pools (MCP)::
A group of machines, such as control plane components or user workloads, that are based on the resources that they handle.

metadata::
Additional information about cluster deployment artifacts.

microservices::
An approach to writing software. Applications can be separated into the smallest components, independent from each other by using microservices.

mirror registry::
A registry that holds the mirror of {product-title} images.

monolithic applications::
Applications that are self-contained, built, and packaged as a single piece.

namespaces::
A namespace isolates specific system resources that are visible to all processes. Inside a namespace, only processes that are members of that namespace can see those resources.

networking::
Network information of {product-title} cluster.

node::
A worker machine in the {product-title} cluster. A node is either a virtual machine (VM) or a physical machine.

OpenShift CLI (`oc`)::
A command line tool to run {product-title} commands on the terminal.

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
OpenShift Dedicated::
A managed {op-system-base} {product-title} offering on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). OpenShift Dedicated focuses on building and scaling applications.

OpenShift Update Service (OSUS)::
For clusters with internet access, {op-system-base-full} provides over-the-air updates by using an OpenShift update service as a hosted service located behind public APIs.

A registry provided by {product-title} to manage images.

Operator::
The preferred method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application in
