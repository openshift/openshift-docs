= ReadWriteMany vSphere volumes support

If underlying vSphere environment supports vSAN File service, then vSphere CSI driver installed by
{product-title} supports provisioning of ReadWriteMany(RWX) volumes.

Please refer to vSphere Documentation for more details about how to configure vSAN file service in
your environment.

A user can request RWX volumes by requesting following PVC:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myclaim
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
     - ReadWriteMany
  storageClassName: thin-csi
----

Requesting a PVC of ReadWriteMany volume type should result in provisioning of Persistent Volumes
backed by vSAN file service.
