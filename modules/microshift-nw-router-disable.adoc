= Disabling the router

In use cases such as industrial IoT spaces where {microshift-short} pods only need to connect to southbound operational systems and northbound cloud-data systems, inbound services are not needed. Use this procedure to disable the router in such egress-only use cases.

.Prerequisites

* You installed {microshift-short}.
* You created a {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file.
* The {oc-first} is installed.

[TIP]
====
If you complete all the configurations that you need to make in the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file at the same time, you can minimize system restarts.
====

.Procedure

. Update the value of `ingress.status` field to `Removed` in the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file as shown in the following example:
+
.Example `config.yaml` ingress stanza
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
ingress:
  ports:
    http: 80
    https: 443
  routeAdmissionPolicy:
    namespaceOwnership: InterNamespaceAllowed
  status: Removed # <1>
# ...
----
<1> When the value is set to `Removed`, the ports listed in `ingress.ports` are automatically closed. Any other settings in the `ingress` stanza are ignored, for example, any values in the `routeAdmissionPolicy.namespaceOwnership` field.

. Restart the {microshift-short} service by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart microshift
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The {microshift-short} service outputs current configurations during restarts.
====

.Verification
* After the system restarts, verify that the router has been removed and that ingress is stopped by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ingress get svc
----
+
.Expected output
[source,text]
----
No resources found in openshift-ingress namespace.
