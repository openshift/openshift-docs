= Using tag-based placement

.Procedure

To encrypt using tag-based placement:

. In vCenter create a category for tagging datastores that will be made available to this storage class. Also, ensure that *StoragePod(Datastore clusters)*, *Datastore*, and *Folder* are selected as Associable Entities for the created category.

. In vCenter, create a tag that uses the category created earlier.

. Assign the previously created tag to each datastore that will be made available to the storage class. Make sure that datastores are shared with hosts participating in the {product-title} cluster.

. In vCenter, from the main menu, click *Policies and Profiles*.

. On the *Policies and Profiles* page, in the navigation pane, click *VM Storage Policies*.

. Click *CREATE*.

. Type a name for the storage policy.

. Select *Enable host based rules* and *Enable tag based placement rules*.

. In the *Next* tab:

.. Select *Encryption* and *Default Encryption Properties*.

.. Select the tag category created earlier, and select tag selected. Verify that the policy is selecting matching datastores.

. Create the storage policy.

. Create a storage class that uses the storage policy:
