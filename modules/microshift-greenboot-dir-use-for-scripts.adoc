= How greenboot uses directories to run scripts

Greenboot is the generic health check framework for the `systemd` service on `rpm-ostree` systems such as {op-system-ostree-first}. This framework is included in {microshift-short} installations with the `microshift-greenboot` and `greenboot-default-health-checks` RPM packages.

Greenboot health checks run at various times to assess system health and automate a rollback on `rpm-ostree` systems to the last healthy state in cases of software trouble, for example:

* Default health check scripts run each time the system starts.
* In addition the to the default health checks, you can write, install, and configure application health check scripts to also run every time the system starts.
* Greenboot can reduce your risk of being locked out of edge devices during updates and prevent a significant interruption of service if an update fails.
* When a failure is detected, the system boots into the last known working configuration using the `rpm-ostree` rollback capability. This feature is especially useful automation for edge devices where direct serviceability is either limited or non-existent.

A {microshift-short} application health check script is included in the `microshift-greenboot` RPM. The `greenboot-default-health-checks` RPM includes health check scripts verifying that DNS and `ostree` services are accessible. You can create your own health check scripts for the workloads you are running. You can write one that verifies that an application has started, for example.
