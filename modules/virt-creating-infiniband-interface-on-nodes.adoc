= Creating an IP over InfiniBand interface on nodes

[role="_abstract"]
On the {product-title} web console, you can install a Red{nbsp}Hat certified third-party Operator, such as the NVIDIA Network Operator, that supports IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB) mode. Typically, you would use the third-party Operator with other vendor infrastructure to manage resources in an {product-title} cluster.

To create an IPoIB interface on nodes in your cluster, you must define an InfiniBand (IPoIB) interface in a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) manifest file.

If you need to attach IPoIB to a bond interface, only the `active-backup` mode supports this configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {product-title} documentation describes defining only the IPoIB interface configuration in a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) manifest file. You must refer to the NVIDIA and other third-party vendor documentation for the majority of the configuring steps. Red{nbsp}Hat support does not extend to anything external to the NNCP configuration. 

For more information about the NVIDIA Operator, see link:https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/kubernetes2410/getting+started+with+red+hat+openshift[Getting Started with Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift] (NVIDIA Docs Hub).

.Prerequisites

* You installed a Red{nbsp}Hat certified third-party Operator that supports an IPoIB interface.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Create or edit a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) manifest file, and then specify an IPoIB interface in the file.

where:

`<mode>`:: `datagram` is the default mode for an IPoIB interface. This mode provides improved CPU performance and low-latency capabilitities for pod-to-pod communication. `connected` mode is a supported mode but consider only using this mode when you need to adjust the maximum transmission unit (MTU) value to improve node connectivity with surrounding network devices.

`<pkey>`:: Supports a string or an integer value. The parameter defines the protection key, or _P-key_, for the interface for the purposes of authentication and encrypted communications with a third-party vendor, such as NVIDIA. Values `None` and `0xffff` indicate the protection key for the base interface in an InfiniBand system.

`<identifier>`:: Supported values include `name`, the default value, and `mac-address`. The `name` value applies a configuration to an interface that holds a specified interface name. 

`<mac-address>`:: Holds the MAC address of an interface. For an IP-over-InfiniBand (IPoIB) interface, the address is a 20-byte string. 

`<type>`:: Sets the type of interface to `infiniband`.
--

. Apply the NNCP configuration to each node in your cluster by running the following command. The Kubernetes NMState Operator can then create an IPoIB interface on each node.
