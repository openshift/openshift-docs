= Creating an IP over InfiniBand interface on nodes

On the {product-title} web console, you can install a Red{nbsp}Hat certified third-party Operator, such as the NVIDIA Network Operator, that supports InfiniBand (IPoIB) mode. Typically, you would use the third-party Operator with other vendor infrastructure to manage resources in an {product-title} cluster. To create an IPoIB interface on nodes in your cluster, you must define an InfiniBand (IPoIB) interface in a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) manifest file. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {product-title} documentation describes defining only the IPoIB interface configuration in a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) manifest file. You must refer to the NVIDIA and other third-party vendor documentation for the majority of the configuring steps. Red{nbsp}Hat support does not extend to anything external to the NNCP configuration. 

For more information about the NVIDIA Operator, see link:https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/kubernetes2410/getting+started+with+red+hat+openshift[Getting Started with Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift] (NVIDIA Docs Hub).

.Prerequisites

* You installed a Red{nbsp}Hat certified third-party Operator that supports an IPoIB interface.


.Procedure

. Create or edit a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) manifest file, and then specify an IPoIB interface in the file.

----
<1> `datagram` is the default mode for an IPoIB interface, and this mode improves optimizes performance and latency. `connected` mode is a supported mode but consider only using this mode when you need to adjust the maximum transmission unit (MTU) value to improve node connectivity with surrounding network devices.  
<2> Supports a string or an integer value. The parameter defines the protection key, or _P-key_, for the interface for the purposes of authentication and encrypted communications with a third-party vendor, such as NVIDIA. Values `None` and `0xffff` indicate the protection key for the base interface in an InfiniBand system.
<3> Sets the type of interface to `infiniband `.

. Apply the NNCP configuration to each node in your cluster by running the following command. The Kubernetes NMState Operator can then create an IPoIB interface on each node.

[source,yaml]
----
$ oc apply -f <nncp_file_name> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<nncp_file_name>` with the name of your NNCP file.
