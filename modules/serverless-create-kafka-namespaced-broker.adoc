= Creating a Knative broker for Apache Kafka that uses an isolated data plane

:FeatureName: The Knative Broker implementation for Apache Kafka with isolated data plane
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

To create a `KafkaNamespaced` broker, you must set the `eventing.knative.dev/broker.class` annotation to `KafkaNamespaced`.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Eventing, and the `KnativeKafka` custom resource are installed on your {product-title} cluster.

* You have access to an Apache Kafka instance, such as link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/amq_streams_on_openshift_overview/kafka-concepts_str#kafka-concepts-key_str[Red Hat AMQ Streams], and have created a Kafka topic.

* You have created a project, or have access to a project, with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create an Apache Kafka-based broker by using a YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  annotations:
    eventing.knative.dev/broker.class: KafkaNamespaced <1>
  name: default
  namespace: my-namespace <2>
spec:
  config:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    name: my-config <2>
...
----
<1> To use the Apache Kafka broker with isolated data planes, the broker class value must be `KafkaNamespaced`.
<2> The referenced `ConfigMap` object `my-config` must be in the same namespace as the `Broker` object, in this case `my-namespace`.

. Apply the Apache Kafka-based broker YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `ConfigMap` object in `spec.config` must be in the same namespace as the `Broker` object:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
  namespace: my-namespace
data:
  ...
----
====

After the creation of the first `Broker` object with the `KafkaNamespaced` class, the `kafka-broker-receiver` and `kafka-broker-dispatcher` deployments are created in the namespace. Subsequently, all brokers with the `KafkaNamespaced` class in the same namespace will use the same data plane. If no brokers with the `KafkaNamespaced` class exist in the namespace, the data plane in the namespace is deleted.
