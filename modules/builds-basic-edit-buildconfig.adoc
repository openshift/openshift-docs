= Editing a BuildConfig

To edit your build configurations, you use the *Edit BuildConfig* option in the *Builds* view of the *Developer* perspective.

You can use either of the following views to edit a `BuildConfig`:

* The *Form view* enables you to edit your `BuildConfig` using the standard form fields and checkboxes.
* The *YAML view* enables you to edit your `BuildConfig` with full control over the operations.

You can switch between the *Form view* and *YAML view* without losing any data. The data in the *Form view* is transferred to the *YAML view* and vice versa.

.Procedure

. In the *Builds* view of the *Developer* perspective, click the menu {kebab} to see the *Edit BuildConfig* option.
. Click *Edit BuildConfig* to see the *Form view* option.
. In the *Git* section, enter the Git repository URL for the codebase you want to use to create an application. The URL is then validated.
* Optional: Click *Show Advanced Git Options* to add details such as:
** *Git Reference* to specify a branch, tag, or commit that contains code you want to use to build the application.
** *Context Dir* to specify the subdirectory that contains code you want to use to build the application.
** *Source Secret* to create a *Secret Name* with credentials for pulling your source code from a private repository.
. In the *Build from* section, select the option that you would like to build from. You can use the following options:
** *Image Stream tag* references an image for a given image stream and tag. Enter the project, image stream, and tag of the location you would like to build from and push to.
** *Image Stream image* references an image for a given image stream and image name. Enter the image stream image you would like to build from. Also enter the project, image stream, and tag to push to.
** *Docker image*: The Docker image is referenced through a Docker image repository. You will also need to enter the project, image stream, and tag to refer to where you would like to push to.
. Optional: In the *Environment Variables* section, add the environment variables associated with the project by using the *Name* and *Value* fields. To add more environment variables, use *Add Value*, or *Add from ConfigMap* and *Secret* .
. Optional: To further customize your application, use the following advanced options:
Trigger::
Triggers a new image build when the builder image changes. Add more triggers by clicking *Add Trigger* and selecting the *Type* and *Secret*.

Secrets::
Adds secrets for your application. Add more secrets by clicking *Add secret* and selecting the *Secret* and *Mount point*.

Policy::
Click *Run policy* to select the build run policy. The selected policy determines the order in which builds created from the build configuration must run.

Hooks::
Select *Run build hooks after image is built* to run commands at the end of the build and verify the image. Add *Hook type*, *Command*, and *Arguments* to append to the command.

. Click *Save* to save the `BuildConfig`.
