= Creating a primary network attachment by applying a YAML manifest

[role="_abstract"]
Create a primary network attachment by directly applying a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` YAML manifest. This gives you full control over the network configuration without relying on the Cluster Network Operator to manage the resource automatically.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You are working in the namespace where the NAD is to be deployed.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file with your primary network configuration, such as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: next-net
spec:
  config: |-
    {
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "name": "work-network",
      "namespace": "namespace2",
      "type": "host-device",
      "device": "eth1",
      "ipam": {
        "type": "dhcp"
      }
    }
----
+
.. Optional: You can specify a namespace to which the NAD is applied. If you are working in the namespace where the NAD is to be deployed, the `namespace` specification is not necessary.

. To create the primary network, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <file>.yaml
----
+
--
where:

`<file>`:: Specifies the name of the file contained the YAML manifest.
