The `reachabilityTotalTimeoutSeconds` parameter defines the total time limit (in seconds) for the platform's health check process before a node is declared down. 

The following table summarizes the acceptable values and their implications:

|===
|Parameter Value (Seconds) |Effect on reachability check |Failover impact and use case
|`0` |Disables the reachability check. |**No automatic failover:** Use only if an external system handles node health monitoring and failover. The platform will not automatically react to node failures.
|`1 - 60` |Sets the total time limit for reachability probing. |**Directly controls detection time:** This value defines the lower limit for your overall failover time. A smaller value leads to faster failover but might increase network traffic. Default: 1 second. The maximum accepted integer value is 60.
