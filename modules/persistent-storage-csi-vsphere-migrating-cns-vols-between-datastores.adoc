= Migrating CNS volumes between datastores for vSphere

If you are running out of space in your current datastore, or want to move to a more performant datastore, you can migrate VMware vSphere Cloud Native Storage (CNS) volumes between datastores. This applies to both attached and detached volumes.

.Limitations
* Requires VMware vSphere 8.0.2 or later.

* Only one volume can be migrated at a time.

* RWX volumes are not supported.

* CNS volume should only be migrated to a datastore that is shared with all hosts that make up the {product-title} cluster.

* Migrating volumes between different datastore in different datacenters is not supported.
