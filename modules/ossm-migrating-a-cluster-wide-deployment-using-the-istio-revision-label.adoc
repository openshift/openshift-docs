ifdef::ossm-cluster-wide-istio-revision[= Migrating a cluster-wide deployment by using the Istio revision label]
ifdef::ossm-cert-manager-istio-revision[= Migrating a cluster-wide deployment by using the Istio revision label with cert-manager]

You can perform a canary upgrade with the gradual migration of data plane namespaces for a cluster-wide deployment by using the `istio.io/rev` label.

The `bookinfo` example application is being used for demonstration purposes with a minimal example for the `Istio` resource. For more information on configuration differences between the {SMProduct} 2 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource and the {SMProduct} 3 `Istio` resource, see "Configuration fields mapping between Service Mesh 2 and Service Mesh 3".

You can follow these same steps with your own workloads.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed {ocp-product-title} 4.14 or later.
* You have logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have completed the premigration checklists.
* You have the {SMProduct} {SMv2Version} Operator installed.
* You have the {SMProduct} 3 Operator installed.
* You have created an `IstioCNI` resource.
* You have installed the `istioctl` tool.
ifdef::ossm-cluster-wide-istio-revision[]
* You are running a cluster-wide Service Mesh control plane resource.
endif::[]
ifdef::ossm-cert-manager-istio-revision[]
* You are using the cert-manager and istio-csr tools in a cluster-wide deployment.
* Your {SMProduct} {SMv2Version} `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource is configured with the cert-manager tool.
endif::[]
* You have installed the `bookinfo` application.

.Procedure

ifdef::ossm-cert-manager-istio-revision[]
. Confirm that your {SMProduct} 2 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource is configured with the cert-manager tool.
+
.Example `ServiceMeshControlPlane` cert-manager configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  ...
  security:
    certificateAuthority:
      cert-manager:
        address: cert-manager-istio-csr.istio-system.svc:443
      type: cert-manager
    dataPlane:
      mtls: true
    identity:
      type: ThirdParty
    manageNetworkPolicy: false
----

. Update the `istio-csr` deployment to include your {SMProduct} 3 control plane by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
  helm upgrade cert-manager-istio-csr jetstack/cert-manager-istio-csr \
      --install \
      --reuse-values \
      --namespace istio-system \
      --wait \
      --set "app.istio.revisions={basic,ossm-3-v1-24-3}" <1>
----
+
<1> The `app.istio.revisions` field must include your {SMProduct} 3.0 control plane revision _before_ you create your `Istio` resource so that proxies can properly communicate with the {SMProduct} 3.0 control plane. 
endif::[]

. Identify the namespaces that contain a 2.6 control plane by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get smcp -A
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE      NAME                   READY   STATUS            PROFILES      VERSION       AGE
istio-system   install-istio-system   6/6     ComponentsReady   ["default"]   2.6.6         115m
----

. Create a YAML file named `ossm-3.yaml` that creates the {istio} resource for the 3.0 installation in the same namespace as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource for the 2.6 installation.
+
[NOTE]
====
In the following example configuration, the {istio} control plane has access to all namespaces on the cluster. If you want limit the namespaces the control plan has access to, you must define discovery selectors. All data plane namespaces that you plan to migrate from version 2.6 must be matched.
====
+
.Example `Istio` resource
[source,yaml,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
apiVersion: sailoperator.io/v1
kind: Istio
metadata:
  name: ossm-3 <1>
spec:
  updateStrategy:
    type: RevisionBased
  namespace: istio-system <2>
  version: v{istio-latest}
  values:  <3>
    meshConfig:
      extensionProviders:
        - name: prometheus
          prometheus: {}
        - name: otel
          opentelemetry:
            port: 4317
            service: otel-collector.opentelemetrycollector-3.svc.cluster.local
----
<1> The `name`, `updateStrategy` and `version` fields specify how the `IstioRevision` resource name is created. For more information, see "Identifying the revision name".
<2> The 3.0 and 2.6 control planes must run in the same namespace.
<3> If you are migrating metrics and tracing, update the `extensionProviders` fields according to your tracing and metrics configurations.

. Apply the YAML file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ossm-3.yaml
----

. Verify that the new `istiod` resource uses the existing root certificate by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs deployments/istiod-ossm-3-v1-24-3 -n istio-system | grep 'Load signing key and cert from existing secret'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
