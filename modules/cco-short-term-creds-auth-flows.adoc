= Provider authentication details

The authentication flow for this authentication method has similarities across the supported cloud providers.

== AWS Security Token Service

In manual mode with STS, the individual {product-title} cluster components use the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to assign components IAM roles that provide short-term, limited-privilege security credentials. These credentials are associated with IAM roles that are specific to each component that makes AWS API calls.

== GCP Workload Identity

In manual mode with GCP Workload Identity, the individual {product-title} cluster components use the GCP workload identity provider to allow components to impersonate GCP service accounts using short-term, limited-privilege credentials.

[id="cco-short-term-creds-auth-flow-refresh_{context}"]
== Automated credential refreshing

Requests for new and refreshed credentials are automated by using an appropriately configured OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider combined with provider-specific service accounts or roles. {product-title} signs Kubernetes service account tokens that are trusted by the cloud provider. These tokens can be mounted into a pod and used for authentication. By default, tokens are refreshed after one hour.
