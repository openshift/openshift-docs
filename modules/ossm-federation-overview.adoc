= Federation overview

Federation is a set of features that let you connect services between separate meshes, allowing the use of {ProductShortName} features such as authentication, authorization, and traffic management across multiple, distinct administrative domains.

Implementing a federated mesh lets you run, manage, and observe a single service mesh running across multiple OpenShift clusters.  {ProductName} federation takes an opinionated approach to a multi-cluster implementation of Service Mesh that assumes _minimal_ trust between meshes.

Service Mesh federation assumes that each mesh is managed individually and retains its own administrator.  The default behavior is that no communication is permitted and no information is shared between meshes. The sharing of information between meshes is on an explicit opt-in basis.  Nothing is shared in a federated mesh unless it has been configured for sharing. Support functions such as certificate generation, metrics and trace collection remain local in their respective meshes.

You configure each mesh control plane to allow federation.  The federation between two meshes is declared by a `ServiceMeshPeer` resource that defines the federation from one mesh to the other. Each service that is shared between meshes must also be declared explicitly with new `ExportedServiceSet` and `ImportedServiceSet` resources. Status fields are populated on each object, which can be used to monitor the state of connections and imported/exported services between meshes.
