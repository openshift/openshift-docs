= Accelerated provisioning of {ztp}

:FeatureName: Accelerated provisioning of {ztp}
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

You can reduce the time taken for cluster installation by using accelerated provisioning of {ztp} for {sno}. 
Accelerated ZTP speeds up installation by applying Day 2 manifests derived from policies at an earlier stage. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Accelerated provisioning of {ztp} is supported only when installing {sno} with Assisted Installer. Otherwise this installation method will fail.

== Activating accelerated ZTP

You can activate accelerated ZTP using the `spec.clusters.clusterLabels.accelerated-ztp` label, as in the following example:

.Example Accelerated ZTP `SiteConfig` CR.
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v2
kind: SiteConfig
metadata:
  name: "example-sno"
  namespace: "example-sno"
spec:
  baseDomain: "example.com"
  pullSecretRef:
    name: "assisted-deployment-pull-secret"
  clusterImageSetNameRef: "openshift-4.10"
  sshPublicKey: "ssh-rsa AAAA..."
  clusters:
  # ...
    clusterLabels:
        common: true
        group-du-sno: ""
        sites : "example-sno"
        accelerated-ztp: full

----

You can use `accelerated-ztp: full` to fully automate the accelerated process. 
{ztp} updates the `AgentClusterInstall` resource with a reference to the accelerated {ztp} `ConfigMap`, and includes resources extracted from policies by {cgu-operator}, and accelerated ZTP job manifests. 

If you use `accelerated-ztp: partial`, {ztp} does not include the accelerated job manifests, but includes policy-derived objects created during the cluster installation of the following `kind` types:

* `PerformanceProfile.performance.openshift.io`
* `Tuned.tuned.openshift.io`
* `Namespace`
* `CatalogSource.operators.coreos.com`
* `ContainerRuntimeConfig.machineconfiguration.openshift.io`

This partial acceleration can reduce the number of reboots done by the node when applying resources of the kind `Performance Profile`, `Tuned`, and `ContainerRuntimeConfig`. 
{cgu-operator} installs the Operator subscriptions derived from policies after {rh-rhacm} completes the import of the cluster, following the same flow as standard {ztp}.

The benefits of accelerated ZTP increase with the scale of your deployment. 
Using `accelerated-ztp: full` gives more benefit on a large number of clusters. 
With a smaller number of clusters, the reduction in installation time is less significant.
Full accelerated ZTP leaves behind a namespace and a completed job on the spoke that need to be manually removed.

One benefit of using `accelerated-ztp: partial` is that you can override the functionality of the on-spoke job if something goes wrong with the stock implementation or if you require a custom functionality.

[id="the-accelerated-ztp-process_{context}"]
== The accelerated ZTP process

Accelerated ZTP uses an additional `ConfigMap` to create the resources derived from policies on the spoke cluster.  
The standard `ConfigMap` includes manifests that the {ztp} workflow uses to customize cluster installs. 

{cgu-operator} detects that the `accelerated-ztp` label is set and then creates a second `ConfigMap`.
As part of accelerated ZTP, the `SiteConfig` generator adds a reference to that second `ConfigMap` using the naming convention `<spoke-cluster-name>-aztp`. 

After {cgu-operator} creates that second `ConfigMap`, it finds all policies bound to the managed cluster and extracts the {ztp} profile information. 
{cgu-operator} adds the {ztp} profile information to the `<spoke-cluster-name>-aztp` `ConfigMap` custom resource (CR) and applies the CR to the hub cluster API.
