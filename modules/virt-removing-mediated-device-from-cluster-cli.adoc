= Removing mediated devices from the cluster

[role="_abstract"]
To remove a mediated device from the cluster, delete the information for that device from the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Edit the `HyperConverged` CR in your default editor by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n {CNVNamespace}
----

. Remove the device information from the `spec.mediatedDevicesConfiguration` and `spec.permittedHostDevices` stanzas of the `HyperConverged` CR. Removing both entries ensures that you can later create a new mediated device type on the same node. For example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: {CNVNamespace}
spec:
  mediatedDevicesConfiguration:
    mediatedDeviceTypes:
      - nvidia-231
  permittedHostDevices:
    mediatedDevices:
    - mdevNameSelector: GRID T4-2Q
      resourceName: nvidia.com/GRID_T4-2Q
----
** To remove the `nvidia-231` device type, delete it from the `mediatedDeviceTypes` array.
** To remove the `GRID T4-2Q` device, delete the `mdevNameSelector` field and its corresponding `resourceName` field.

. Save your changes and exit the editor.
