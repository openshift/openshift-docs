= Removing mediated devices from the cluster using the CLI

To remove a mediated device from the cluster, delete the information for that device from the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

. Edit the `HyperConverged` CR in your default editor by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv
----

. Remove the device information from the `spec.mediatedDevicesConfiguration` and `spec.permittedHostDevices` stanzas of the `HyperConverged` CR. Removing both entries ensures that you can later create a new mediated device type on the same node. For example:
+
.Example configuration file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  mediatedDevicesConfiguration:
    mediatedDevicesTypes: <1>
      - nvidia-231
  permittedHostDevices:
    mediatedDevices: <2>
    - mdevNameSelector: GRID T4-2Q
      resourceName: nvidia.com/GRID_T4-2Q
----
<1> To remove the `nvidia-231` device type, delete it from the `mediatedDevicesTypes` array.
<2> To remove the `GRID T4-2Q` device, delete the `mdevNameSelector` field and its corresponding `resourceName` field.

. Save your changes and exit the editor.
