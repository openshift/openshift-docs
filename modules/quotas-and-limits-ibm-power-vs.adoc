= Quotas and limits on {ibm-power-server-title}

The {product-title} cluster uses several {ibm-cloud-name} and {ibm-power-server-name} components, and the default quotas and limits affect your ability to install {product-title} clusters. If you use certain cluster configurations, deploy your cluster in certain regions, or run multiple clusters from your account, you might need to request additional resources for your {ibm-cloud-name} account.

For a comprehensive list of the default {ibm-cloud-name} quotas and service limits, see the {ibm-cloud-name} documentation for link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-quotas[Quotas and service limits].

[discrete]
== Virtual Private Cloud

Each {product-title} cluster creates its own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The default quota of VPCs per region is 10. If you have 10 VPCs created, you will need to increase your quota before attempting an installation.

[discrete]
== Application load balancer

By default, each cluster creates two application load balancers (ALBs):

* Internal load balancer for the control plane API server
* External load balancer for the control plane API server

You can create additional `LoadBalancer` service objects to create additional ALBs. The default quota of VPC ALBs are 50 per region. To have more than 50 ALBs, you must increase this quota.

VPC ALBs are supported. Classic ALBs are not supported for {ibm-power-server-name}.

[discrete]
== Transit Gateways

Each {product-title} cluster creates its own Transit Gateway to enable communication with a VPC. The default quota of transit gateways per account is 10. If you have 10 transit gateways created, you will need to increase your quota before attempting an installation.

[discrete]
== Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Service

There is a limit of one Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) service per {ibm-power-server-name} instance.

[discrete]
== Virtual Server Instances

By default, a cluster creates server instances with the following resources :

* 0.5 CPUs
* 32 GB RAM
* System Type: `s922`
* Processor Type: `uncapped`, `shared`
* Storage Tier: `Tier-3`

The following nodes are created:

* One bootstrap machine, which is removed after the installation is complete
* Three control plane nodes
* Three compute nodes
