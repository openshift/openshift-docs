= About API token expiration

[role="_abstract"]

You use API tokens in {product-title} ({product-title-short}) for several authentication and access functions, such as API access, CLI access, and authentication. API tokens expire one year from the creation date, and {product-title-short} alerts you when a token expires soon.

{product-title-short} provides notifications in the web interface and by sending log messages to Central when a token will expire in less than one week. The log message process runs once an hour. Once a day, the process lists the tokens that are expiring and creates a log message for each one. Log messages are issued once a day and appear in Central logs.

Logs have the format as shown in the following example:

[source,text]
----
Warn: API Token [token name] (ID [token ID]) will expire in less than X days.
----
You can change the default settings for the log message process by configuring the environment variables shown in the following table:
