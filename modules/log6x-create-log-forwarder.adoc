= Creating a log forwarder

The log forwarder provides the following functionality:

* Administrators can control which users are allowed to define log collection and which logs they are allowed to collect.
* Users who have the required permissions are able to specify additional log collection configurations.
* Administrators can deploy separate collectors that operate independently according to their collection requirements.

[NOTE]
====
You must have a `serviceAccount` in the same namespace in which you create the `ClusterLogForwarder`. Additionally, for this `ClusterLogForwarder` you must have the `collect-audit-logs`, `collect-application-logs`, and `collect-infrastructure-logs` cluster roles. For more information see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/observability/logging/log_collection_forwarding/log-forwarding.html#log-collection-rbac-permissions_log-forwarding[Authorizing log collection RBAC permissions].
