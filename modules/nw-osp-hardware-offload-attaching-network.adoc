= Attaching an OVS hardware offloading network

You can attach an Open vSwitch (OVS) hardware offloading network to your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster is installed and running.
* You provisioned an OVS hardware offloading network on {rh-openstack-first} to use with your cluster. 

.Procedure

. Create a file named `network.yaml` from the following template:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  additionalNetworks:
  - name: hwoffload1
    namespace: cnf
    rawCNIConfig: '{ "cniVersion": "0.3.1", "name": "hwoffload1", "type": "host-device","pciBusId": "0000:00:05.0", "ipam": {}}' <1>
    type: Raw
----
+
where:
+
`pciBusId`:: Specifies the device that is connected to the offloading network. If you do not have it, you can find this value by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe SriovNetworkNodeState -n openshift-sriov-network-operator
----

. From a command line, enter the following command to patch your cluster with the file:
+
[source,terminal]
