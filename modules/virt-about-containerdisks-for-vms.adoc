= About using containerDisk volumes for virtual machines

A container disk is a virtual machine image stored as a container in an
image registry. You can attach a container disk as an ephemeral containerDisk volume to
a virtual machine by using the virtual machine wizard or by adding it to a
virtual machine manifest.

Container disks are not limited to a single virtual machine and can be used
to create large numbers of virtual machine clones.

When a virtual machine with a containerDisk volume starts, the container
is pulled from the registry and hosted on the node that is hosting the virtual machine.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A containerDisk volume is ephemeral. It is discarded when
the virtual machine is stopped, restarted, or deleted. A containerDisk
is useful for read-only filesystems such as CD-ROMs or for disposable
virtual machines. It is not recommended for read-write filesystems as
the data is temporarily written to local storage on the hosting node, which
impedes live migration of the virtual machine in the case of node maintenance.
