= About using containerDisk volumes for virtual machines

A container disk is a virtual machine image stored as a container in a container
image registry. You can attach a container disk as an ephemeral containerDisk volume to
a virtual machine by using the virtual machine wizard or by adding it to a
virtual machine manifest.

Container disks can deliver the same disk images to multiple virtual machines
and can be used to create large numbers of virtual machine clones.

When a virtual machine with a containerDisk volume starts, the container
is pulled from the registry and hosted on the node that is hosting the virtual machine.

[NOTE]
====
A containerDisk volume is ephemeral. It is discarded when
the virtual machine is stopped, restarted, or deleted. A containerDisk
is useful for read-only filesystems such as CD-ROMs or for disposable
virtual machines.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Container disks are not recommended for read-write filesystems as
the data is temporarily written to local storage on the hosting node. This slows
live migration of the virtual machine, such as in the case of node maintenance,
because the data must be migrated to the destination node. Additionally,
all data is lost if the node loses power or otherwise shuts down unexpectedly.
