The Network Observability Operator is designed to be infrastructure-aware, particularly when using the OVN-Kubernetes network provider.

For clusters managing IP Address Management (IPAM) within the SDN, the Operator automatically correlates internal IP addresses with their corresponding Kubernetes resources. This is essential for monitoring {VirtProductName} workloads, where IP addresses are assigned and managed directly by the cluster's logical switches.

By centralizing IPAM visibility within the SDN, you can audit virtual machine traffic without maintaining external DHCP records or third-party IPAM solutions.
