= About CSI
Storage vendors have traditionally provided storage drivers as part of Kubernetes. With the implementation of the Container Storage Interface (CSI), third-party providers can instead deliver storage plugins by using a standard interface without ever having to change the core Kubernetes code.

CSI Operators give {builds-shortname} users storage options, such as volume snapshots, that are not possible with in-tree volume plugins.
