= Changing the custom File Integrity configuration

To change the File Integrity configuration, never change the generated
config map. Instead, change the config map that is linked to the `FileIntegrity`
object through the `spec.name`, `namespace`, and `key` attributes.

Currently, you must also annotate the `FileIntegrity` object in order to force
reconciliation of the object and its config map. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate fileintegrities/worker-fileintegrity file-integrity.openshift.io/config-version=2
----

The value of the annotation or whether it is an annotation does not really
matter; the purpose is of this operation is to force reconciliation of the
`FileIntegrity` object and re-render the processed config map with the generated
configuration.
