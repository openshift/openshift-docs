= Build secret annotation

[role="_abstract"]
Add an annotation to a build secret to ensure the build controller reconciles on create, update, or delete events for the referenced build secret.

The following example shows the usage of an annotation with a secret:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: <pull_secret>
kind: Secret
metadata:
  annotations:
    build.shipwright.io/referenced.secret: "true"
  name: secret-docker
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----
where:

`<pull_secret>`:: Specifies the Base64-encoded pull secret.
`build.shipwright.io/referenced.secret`:: Specifies the value of the `build.shipwright.io/referenced.secret` annotation.

This annotation ensures the controller ignores secret events unless the secret is explicitly referenced by a build. For example, if a secret does not include this annotation, the build controller will not reconcile when that secret changes, even if an event is triggered. Reconciling on relevant events allows the build controller to re-run build configuration validations, helping detect missing or misconfigured dependencies early.
