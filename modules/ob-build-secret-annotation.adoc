= Build secret annotation

You can add an annotation `build.shipwright.io/referenced.secret: "true"` to a build secret. Based on this annotation, the build controller takes a reconcile action when an event, such as create, update, or delete triggers for the build secret. The following example shows the usage of an annotation with a secret:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: <pull_secret> <1>
kind: Secret
metadata:
  annotations:
    build.shipwright.io/referenced.secret: "true" <2>
  name: secret-docker
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----
<1> Base64-encoded pull secret.
<2> The value of the `build.shipwright.io/referenced.secret` annotation is set to `true`.

This annotation filters secrets which are not referenced in a build instance. For example, if a secret does not have this annotation, the build controller does not reconcile even if the event is triggered for the secret. Reconciling on triggering of events allows the build controller to re-trigger validations on the build configuration, helping you to understand if a dependency is missing.
