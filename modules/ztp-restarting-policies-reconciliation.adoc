= Restarting policies reconciliation

Use the following procedure to restart policies reconciliation in the event of unexpected compliance issues.

.Procedure

. A `ClusterGroupUpgrade` custom resource (CR) is generated in the namespace `ztp-install` by the Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator (TALO) after the managed spoke cluster becomes `Ready`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTER=<clusterName>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clustergroupupgrades -n ztp-install $CLUSTER
----

. If there are unexpected issues and the policies fail to become complaint within the configured timeout, (the default is 4h), the status of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR shows `UpgradeTimedOut`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clustergroupupgrades -n ztp-install $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")]}'
----

. A `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR in the `UpgradeTimedOut` state automatically restarts its policy reconciliation every hour. If you have changed your policies, you can start a retry immediately by deleting the existing `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. This triggers the automatic creation of a new `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR that begins reconciling the policies immediately:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete clustergroupupgrades -n ztp-install $CLUSTER
----

Note that when the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR completes with status `UpgradeCompleted` and the managed spoke cluster has the label `ztp-done` applied, you can make additional configuration changes using `PolicyGenTemplate`. Deleting the existing `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR will not make TALO generate a new CR.

At this point, ZTP has completed its interaction with the cluster and any further interactions should be treated as an upgrade. See the Topology-Aware Lifecycle Operator (TALO) documentation for instructions on how to construct your own `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR to apply the new changes.
