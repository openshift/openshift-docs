= Setting limit ranges

A limit range, defined by a `LimitRange` object, defines compute resource constraints at the pod, container, image, image stream, and persistent volume claim level. The limit range specifies the amount of resources that a pod, container, image, image stream, or persistent volume claim can consume.

All requests to create and modify resources are evaluated against each `LimitRange` object in the project. If the resource violates any of the enumerated constraints, the resource is rejected. If the resource does not set an explicit value, and if the constraint supports a default value, the default value is applied to the resource.

For CPU and memory limits, if you specify a maximum value but do not specify a minimum limit, the resource can consume more CPU and memory resources than the maximum value.

== Container limits

*Supported Resources:*

* CPU
* Memory

.Supported Constraints

Per container, the following must hold true if specified:

*Container*
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Behavior

|`Min`
|`Min[<resource>]` less than or equal to `container.resources.requests[<resource>]` (required) less than or equal to `container/resources.limits[<resource>]` (optional)

If the configuration defines a `min` CPU, the request value must be greater than the CPU value. If you do not set a `min` value or you set `min` to `0`, the result is no limit and the pod can consume more of the resource than the `max` value.

|`Max`
|`container.resources.limits[<resource>]` (required) less than or equal to `Max[<resource>]`

If the configuration defines a `max` CPU, you do not need to define a CPU request value. However, you must set a limit that satisfies the maximum CPU constraint that is specified in the limit range.

|`MaxLimitRequestRatio`
|`MaxLimitRequestRatio[<resource>]` less than or equal to (`container.resources.limits[<resource>]` / `container.resources.requests[<resource>]`)

If the limit range defines a `maxLimitRequestRatio` constraint, any new containers must have both a `request` and a `limit` value. Additionally, {product-title} calculates a limit-to-request ratio by dividing the `limit` by the `request`. The result should be an integer greater than 1.

For example, if a container has `cpu: 500` in the `limit` value, and `cpu: 100` in the `request` value, the limit-to-request ratio for `cpu` is `5`. This ratio must be less than or equal to the `maxLimitRequestRatio`.
|===

*Supported Defaults:*

`Default[<resource>]`:: Defaults `container.resources.limit[<resource>]` to specified value if none.
`Default Requests[<resource>]`:: Defaults `container.resources.requests[<resource>]` to specified value if none.


== Pod limits

*Supported Resources:*

* CPU
* Memory

*Supported Constraints:*

Across all containers in a pod, the following must hold true:

.Pod
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Enforced Behavior

|`Min`
|`Min[<resource>]` less than or equal to `container.resources.requests[<resource>]` (required) less than or equal to `container.resources.limits[<resource>]`. If you do not set a `min` value or you set `min` to `0`, the result is no limit and the pod can consume more of the resource than the `max` value.

|`Max`
|`container.resources.limits[<resource>]` (required) less than or equal to `Max[<resource>]`.

|`MaxLimitRequestRatio`
|`MaxLimitRequestRatio[<resource>]` less than or equal to (`container.resources.limits[<resource>]` / `container.resources.requests[<resource>]`).

|===

== Image limits

Supported Resources:

* Storage

Resource type name:

- `openshift.io/Image`

Per image, the following must hold true if specified:

.Image
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Constraint |Behavior

|`Max`
|`image.dockerimagemetadata.size` less than or equal to `Max[<resource>]`
|===

[NOTE]
====
To prevent blobs that exceed the limit from being uploaded to the registry, the registry must be configured to enforce quota. The `REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA` environment variable must be set to `true`. By default, the environment variable is set to `true` for new deployments.
====

== Image stream limits

*Supported Resources:*

* `openshift.io/image-tags`
* `openshift.io/images`

*Resource type name:*

- `openshift.io/ImageStream`

Per image stream, the following must hold true if specified:

.ImageStream
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Constraint |Behavior

|`Max[openshift.io/image-tags]`
|`length( uniqueimagetags( imagestream.spec.tags ) )` less than or equal to `Max[openshift.io/image-tags]`

`uniqueimagetags` returns unique references to images of given spec tags.

|`Max[openshift.io/images]`
|`length( uniqueimages( imagestream.status.tags ) )` less than or equal to `Max[openshift.io/images]`

`uniqueimages` returns unique image names found in status tags. The name is equal to the digest for the image.

|===

== Counting of image references

The `openshift.io/image-tags` resource represents unique stream limits. Possible references are an `ImageStreamTag`, an `ImageStreamImage`, or a `DockerImage`. Tags can be created by using the `oc tag` and `oc import-image` commands or by using image streams. No distinction is made between internal and external references. However, each unique reference that is tagged in an image stream specification is counted just once. It does not restrict pushes to an internal container image registry in any way, but is useful for tag restriction.

The `openshift.io/images` resource represents unique image names that are recorded in image stream status. It helps to restrict several images that can be pushed to the internal registry. Internal and external references are not distinguished.


== PersistentVolumeClaim limits

*Supported Resources:*

* Storage

*Supported Constraints:*

Across all persistent volume claims in a project, the following must hold true:

.Pod
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Enforced Behavior

|`Min`
|Min[<resource>] +<=+ claim.spec.resources.requests[<resource>] (required)

|`Max`
|claim.spec.resources.requests[<resource>] (required) +<=+ Max[<resource>]
|===
