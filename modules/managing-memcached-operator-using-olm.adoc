= Managing a Memcached Operator using the Operator Lifecycle Manager

The previous section has covered manually running an Operator. In the next
sections, we will explore using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which is
what enables a more robust deployment model for Operators being run in
production environments.

The OLM helps you to install, update, and generally manage the lifecycle of all
of the Operators (and their associated services) on a Kubernetes cluster. It
runs as an Kubernetes extension and lets you use `oc` for all the lifecycle
management functions without any additional tools.

.Prerequisites

- OLM installed on a Kubernetes-based cluster (v1.8 or above to support the
`apps/v1beta2` API group), for example {product-title} {product-version}
Preview OLM enabled
- Memcached Operator built

.Procedure

. *Generate an Operator manifest.*
+
An Operator manifest describes how to display, create, and manage the
application, in this case Memcached, as a whole. It is defined by a
`ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) object and is required for the OLM to function.
+
You can use the following command to generate CSV manifests:
+
----
$ operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv --csv-version 0.0.1
----
+
NOTE: This command is run from the `memcached-operator/` directory that was created when you built the Memcached Operator.
+
For the purpose of this guide, we will continue with this
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/getting-started/blob/master/memcachedoperator.0.0.1.csv.yaml[predefined manifest file]
for the next steps. You can alter the image field within this manifest to
reflect the image you built in previous steps, but it is unnecessary.
+
[NOTE]
====
See
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/design/building-your-csv.md[Building a CSV for the Operator Framework]
for more information on manually defining a manifest file.
====

. *Deploy the Operator.*

.. Create an OperatorGroup that specifies the namespaces that the Operator will
target. Create the following OperatorGroup in the namespace where you will
create the CSV. In this example, the `default` namespace is used:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: memcached-operator-group
  namespace: default
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - default
----

.. Apply the Operator's CSV manifest to the specified namespace in the cluster:
+
----
$ curl -Lo memcachedoperator.0.0.1.csv.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operator-framework/getting-started/master/memcachedoperator.0.0.1.csv.yaml
$ oc apply -f memcachedoperator.0.0.1.csv.yaml
$ oc get csv memcachedoperator.v0.0.1 -n default -o json | jq '.status'
----
+
When you apply this manifest, the cluster does not immediately update because
it does not yet meet the requirements specified in the manifest.

.. Create the role, role binding, and service account to grant resource
permissions to the Operator, and the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to create
the Memcached type that the Operator manages:
+
----
$ oc create -f deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_crd.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/role.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
These files were generated into the `deploy/` directory by the Operator SDK when you built the Memcached Operator.
====
+
Because the OLM creates Operators in a particular namespace when a manifest is
applied, administrators can leverage the native Kubernetes RBAC permission model
to restrict which users are allowed to install Operators.

. *Create an application instance.*
+
The Memcached Operator is now running in the `default` namespace. Users
interact with Operators via instances of `CustomResources`; in this case, the
resource has the kind `Memcached`. Native Kubernetes RBAC also applies to
`CustomResources`, providing administrators control over who can interact with
each Operator.
+
Creating instances of Memcached in this namespace will now trigger the Memcached
Operator to instantiate pods running the memcached server that are managed by
the Operator. The more `CustomResources` you create, the more unique instances
of Memcached are managed by the Memcached Operator running in this namespace.

----

. *Update an application.*
+
Manually apply an update to the Operator by creating a new Operator manifest
with a `replaces` field that references the old Operator manifest. The OLM
ensures that all resources being managed by the old Operator have their
ownership moved to the new Operator without fear of any programs stopping
execution. It is up to the Operators themselves to execute any data migrations
required to upgrade resources to run under a new version of the Operator.
+
The following command demonstrates applying a new
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/getting-started/blob/master/memcachedoperator.0.0.2.csv.yaml[Operator manifest file]
using a new version of the Operator and shows that the pods remain executing:

$ curl -Lo memcachedoperator.0.0.2.csv.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operator-framework/getting-started/master/memcachedoperator.0.0.2.csv.yaml
$ oc apply -f memcachedoperator.0.0.2.csv.yaml
$ oc get pods
