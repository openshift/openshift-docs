= Network Observability Operator 1.9.1 fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the fixed issues for the Network Observability Operator 1.9.1 release.

* Before this update, network flows were not observed on {product-title} 4.15 due to an incorrect attach mode setting. This stopped users from monitoring network flows correctly, especially with certain catalogs. With this release, the default attach mode for {product-title} versions older than 4.16.0 is set to `tc`, so flows are now observed on {product-title} 4.15. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-2333[NETOBSERV-2333])

* Before this update, if an IPFIX collector restarted, configuring an IPFIX exporter could lose its connection and stop sending network flows to the collector. With this release, the connection is restored, and network flows continue to be sent to the collector. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-2315[NETOBSERV-2315])

* Before this update, when you configured an IPFIX exporter, flows without port information (such as ICMP traffic) were ignored, which caused errors in logs. TCP flags and ICMP data were also missing from IPFIX exports. With this release, these details are now included. Missing fields (like ports) no longer cause errors and are part of the exported data. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-2307[NETOBSERV-2307])

* Before this update, the User Defined Networks (UDN) Mapping feature showed a configuration issue and warning on {product-title} 4.18 because the OpenShift version was incorrectly set in the code. This impacted the user experience. With this release, UDN Mapping now supports {product-title} 4.18 without warnings, making the user experience smooth. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-2305[NETOBSERV-2305])

* Before this update, the expand function on the *Network Traffic* page had compatibility problems with {product-title} Console 4.19. This resulted in empty menu space when expanding and an inconsistent user interface. With this release, the compatibility problem in the `NetflowTraffic` part and `theme hook` is resolved. The side menu in the *Network Traffic* view is now properly managed, which improves how you interact with the user interface. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-2304[NETOBSERV-2304])
