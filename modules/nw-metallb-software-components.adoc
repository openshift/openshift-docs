= MetalLB software components

When you install the MetalLB Operator, the `metallb-operator-controller-manager` deployment starts a pod.
The pod is the implementation of the Operator.
The pod monitors for changes to the `MetalLB` custom resource and `AddressPool` custom resources.

When the Operator starts an instance of MetalLB, it starts a `controller` deployment and a `speaker` daemon set.

`controller`::
The Operator starts the deployment and a single pod.
When you add a service of type `LoadBalancer`, Kubernetes uses the `controller` to allocate an IP address from an address pool.

`speaker`::
The Operator starts a daemon set with one `speaker` pod for each node in your cluster.
+
For layer 2 mode, after the `controller` allocates an IP address for the service, each `speaker` pod determines if it is on the same node as an endpoint for the service.
An algorithm that involves hashing the node name and the service name is used to select a single `speaker` pod to announce the load balancer IP address.
// IETF treats protocol names as proper nouns.
The `speaker` uses Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to announce IPv4 addresses and Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) to announce IPv6 addresses.
+
Requests for the load balancer IP address are routed to the node with the `speaker` that announces the IP address.
After the node receives the packets, the service proxy routes the packets to an endpoint for the service.
The endpoint can be on the same node in the optimal case, or it can be on another node.
The service proxy chooses an endpoint each time a connection is established.
