* FRR-K8s is now available under the Cluster Network Operator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have custom `FRRConfiguration` CRs in the `metallb-system` namespace, you must move them under the `openshift-network-operator` namespace.

Description::
MetalLB is a load-balancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters that uses standard routing protocols.
It enables a Kubernetes service to get an external IP address which is also added to the host network for the cluster.
The MetalLB Operator deploys and manages the lifecycle of a MetalLB instance in a cluster.
Some use cases might require features not available in MetalLB, such as stateful load balancing.
Where necessary, you can use an external third party load balancer.
Selection and configuration of an external load balancer is outside the scope of this specification.
When an external third-party load balancer is used, the integration effort must include enough analysis to ensure all performance and resource utilization requirements are met.

Limits and requirements::
* Stateful load balancing is not supported by MetalLB.
An alternate load balancer implementation must be used if this is a requirement for workload CNFs.
* You must ensure that the external IP address is routable from clients to the host network for the cluster.

Engineering considerations::
* MetalLB is used in BGP mode only for telco core use models.
* For telco core use models, MetalLB is supported only with the OVN-Kubernetes network provider used in local gateway mode.
See `routingViaHost` in "Cluster Network Operator".
* BGP configuration in MetalLB is expected to vary depending on the requirements of the network and peers.
** You can configure address pools with variations in addresses, aggregation length, auto assignment, and so on.
** MetalLB uses BGP for announcing routes only.
Only the `transmitInterval` and `minimumTtl` parameters are relevant in this mode.
Other parameters in the BFD profile should remain close to the defaults as shorter values can lead to false negatives and affect performance.
