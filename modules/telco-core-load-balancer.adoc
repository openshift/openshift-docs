= Load balancer

New in this release::
//CNF-11914
* In {product-title} 4.17, `frr-k8s` is now the default and fully supported Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) backend.
The deprecated `frr` BGP mode is still available.
You should upgrade clusters to use the `frr-k8s` backend.

Description::
MetalLB is a load-balancer implementation that uses standard routing protocols for bare-metal clusters. It enables a Kubernetes service to get an external IP address which is also added to the host network for the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
Some use cases might require features not available in MetalLB, for example stateful load balancing.
Where necessary, use an external third party load balancer.
Selection and configuration of an external load balancer is outside the scope of this document.
When you use an external third party load balancer, ensure that it meets all performance and resource utilization requirements.
====

Limits and requirements::

* Stateful load balancing is not supported by MetalLB. An alternate load balancer implementation must be used if this is a requirement for workload CNFs.
* The networking infrastructure must ensure that the external IP address is routable from clients to the host network for the cluster.

Engineering considerations::
* MetalLB is used in BGP mode only for core use case models.
* For core use models, MetalLB is supported with only the OVN-Kubernetes network provider used in local gateway mode. See `routingViaHost` in the "Cluster Network Operator" section.
* BGP configuration in MetalLB varies depending on the requirements of the network and peers.
* Address pools can be configured as needed, allowing variation in addresses, aggregation length, auto assignment, and other relevant parameters.
* MetalLB uses BGP for announcing routes only.
Only the `transmitInterval` and `minimumTtl` parameters are relevant in this mode.
Other parameters in the BFD profile should remain close to the default settings. Shorter values might lead to errors and impact performance.
