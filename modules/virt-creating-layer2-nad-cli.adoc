[id="virt-creating-layer2-nad-cli_{context}"]
= Creating a NAD for layer 2 topology by using the CLI

You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) which describes how to attach a pod to the layer 2 overlay network.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Create a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: l2-network
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  config: |-
    {
            "cniVersion": "0.3.1", <1>
            "name": "my-namespace-l2-network", <2>
            "type": "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay", <3>
            "topology":"layer2", <4>
            "mtu": 1400, <5>
            "netAttachDefName": "my-namespace/l2-network" <6>
    }
----
<1> The Container Network Interface (CNI) specification version. The required value is `0.3.1`.
<2> The name of the network. This attribute is not namespaced. For example, you can have a network named `l2-network` referenced from two different `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` objects that exist in two different namespaces. This feature is useful to connect VMs in different namespaces.
<3> The name of the CNI plugin. The required value is `ovn-k8s-cni-overlay`.
<4> The topological configuration for the network. The required value is `layer2`.
<5> Optional: The maximum transmission unit (MTU) value. If you do not set a value, the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) sets a default MTU value by calculating the difference among the underlay MTU of the primary network interface, the overlay MTU of the pod network, such as the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation), and byte capacity of any enabled features, such as IPsec.
<6> The value of the `namespace` and `name` fields in the `metadata` stanza of the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object.
+
[NOTE]
====
The previous example configures a cluster-wide overlay without a subnet defined. This means that the logical switch implementing the network only provides layer 2 communication. You must configure an IP address when you create the virtual machine by either setting a static IP address or by deploying a DHCP server on the network for a dynamic IP address.
====

. Apply the manifest by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
