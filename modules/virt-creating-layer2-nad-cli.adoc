[id="virt-creating-layer2-nad-cli_{context}"]
= Creating a NAD for flat layer 2 topology using the CLI

You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) which describes how to attach a pod to the layer 2 overlay network.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: l2-network
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  config: |2
    {
            "cniVersion": "0.3.1", <1>
            "name": "my-namespace-l2-network", <2>
            "type": "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay", <3>
            "topology":"layer2", <4>
            "mtu": 1300, <5>
            "netAttachDefName": "my-namespace/l2-network" <6>
    }
----
<1> The CNI specification version. The required value is `0.3.1`.
<2> The name of the network. This attribute is not namespaced. For example, you can have a network named `l2-network` referenced from two different `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` objects that exist in two different namespaces. This feature is useful to connect VMs in different namespaces.
<3> The name of the CNI plug-in to be configured. The required value is `ovn-k8s-cni-overlay`.
<4> The topological configuration for the network. The required value is `layer2`.
<5> Optional: The maximum transmission unit (MTU) value. The default value is automatically set by the kernel.
<6> The value of the `namespace` and `name` fields in the `metadata` stanza of the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object.
+
[NOTE]
====
The above example configures a cluster-wide overlay without a subnet defined. This means that the logical switch implementing the network only provides layer 2 communication. You must configure an IP address when you create the virtual machine by either setting a static IP address or by deploying a DHCP server on the network for a dynamic IP address.

. Apply the manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
