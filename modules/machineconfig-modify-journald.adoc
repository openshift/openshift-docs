= Configuring journald settings

If you need to configure settings for the `journald` service on {product-title} nodes, you can do that by modifying the appropriate configuration file and passing the file to the appropriate pool of nodes as a machine config.

This procedure describes how to modify `journald` rate limiting settings in the `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file and apply them to worker nodes. See the `journald.conf` man page for information on how to use that file.

.Prerequisites
* Have a running {product-title} cluster.
* Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a Butane config file, `40-worker-custom-journald.bu`, that includes an `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file with the required settings.

. Use Butane to generate a `MachineConfig` object file, `40-worker-custom-journald.yaml`, containing the configuration to be delivered to the worker nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ butane 40-worker-custom-journald.bu -o 40-worker-custom-journald.yaml
----

. Apply the machine config to the pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f 40-worker-custom-journald.yaml
----

. Check that the new machine config is applied and that the nodes are not in a degraded state. It might take a few minutes. The worker pool will show the updates in progress, as each node successfully has the new machine config applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfigpool

. To check that the change was applied, you can log in to a worker node:
