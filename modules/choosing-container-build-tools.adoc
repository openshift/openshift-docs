= Choosing container build tools

When containers first really took hold, most people used the Docker Container Engine and docker command to work with containers. You can still use those tools to create containers that will run in OpenShift and any other container platform. However, with RHEL and also many other Linux system you can instead choose a different set of container tools that includes: podman, skopeo, and buildah.

Building and managing containers with buildah, podman, and skopeo results in industry standard container images that include features tuned specifically for ultimately deploying those containers in OpenShift or other Kubernetes environments. These tools are daemonless and can be run without root privileges, so there is less overhead in running them.

When you ultimately run your containers in OpenShift, the https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cri-o.io/&sa=D&ust=1557950770711000[CRI-O] container engine has replaced Docker as the container engine. CRI-O runs on every worker and master node in an OpenShift cluster, but CRI-O is not yet supported as a standalone runtime outside of OpenShift.
