= How {oadp-short} Self-Service works

The following diagram describes how {oadp-short} Self-Service works at a high level. The diagram describes the following workflow:

. A namespace admin user creates a `NonAdminBackup` (NAB) custom resource (CR) request.
. The `NonAdminController` (NAC) CR receives the NAB CR request.
. The NAC validates the request and updates the NAB CR about the request.
. The NAC creates the `Velero` backup object.
. The NAC monitors the `Velero` backup object and cascades the status back to the NAB CR.
