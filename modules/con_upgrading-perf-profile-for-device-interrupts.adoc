= Upgrading the performance profile to use device interrupt processing

[role="_abstract"]
When you upgrade performance profiles from v1 or v1alpha1 to v2, the globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing field is automatically set to true to maintain IRQ load balancing behavior for isolated CPUs.

When you upgrade the Node Tuning Operator performance profile custom resource definition (CRD) from v1 or v1alpha1 to v2, `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is set to `true` on existing profiles.

[NOTE]
====
`globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` toggles whether IRQ load balancing will be disabled for the Isolated CPU set. When the option is set to `true` it disables IRQ load balancing for the Isolated CPU set. Setting the option to `false` allows the IRQs to be balanced across all CPUs.
