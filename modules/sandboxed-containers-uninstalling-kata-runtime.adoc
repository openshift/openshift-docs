= Uninstalling the Kata runtime

This section describes how to remove and uninstall the `kata` runtime and all its related resources, such as CRI-O config and `RuntimeClass`, from from your cluster.

.Procedure

- Delete the `KataConfig` custom resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc delete kataconfig <KataConfig_CR_Name>
----

The {sandboxed-containers} removes all resources that were initially created to enable the runtime on your cluster. After you run the command above, your cluster is restored to the state prior to the installation process.
