= Troubleshooting cluster creation with a MultipleRoute53ZonesFound error

If a cluster creation action fails, you might receive the following error message.

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Provisioning Error Code:    OCM3049
Provisioning Error Message: DNS zone conflicts encountered.
----

The problem occurs because a previous cluster did not have had its Route 53 hosted zone removed during uninstallation. As a result, the existing Route 53 entries are conflicting with the cluster's DNS.

The cluster's installation is blocked because a duplicate Route 53 hosted zone already exists in your account.

.Procedure

. Verify the Route 53 configuration. If the hosted zone is no longer required, remove it.
. Attempt cluster installation again.
