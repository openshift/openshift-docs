[role="_abstract"]
The following advisory is available for the OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.61:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2023:0557[RHBA-2023:0557 - OpenShift Compliance Operator bug fix update]

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-61-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

* The Compliance Operator now supports timeout configuration for Scanner Pods. The timeout is specified in the `ScanSetting` object. If the scan is not completed within the timeout, the scan retries until the maximum number of retries is reached. See xref:../../security/compliance_operator/co-scans/compliance-operator-troubleshooting.adoc#compliance-timeout_compliance-troubleshooting[Configuring ScanSetting timeout] for more information.

== Bug fixes

* Before this update, Compliance Operator remediations required variables as inputs. Remediations without variables set were applied cluster-wide and resulted in stuck nodes, even though it appeared the remediation applied correctly. With this update, the Compliance Operator validates if a variable needs to be supplied using a `TailoredProfile` for a remediation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3864[*OCPBUGS-3864*])

* Before this update, the instructions for `ocp4-kubelet-configure-tls-cipher-suites` were incomplete, requiring users to refine the query manually. With this update, the query provided in `ocp4-kubelet-configure-tls-cipher-suites` returns the actual results to perform the audit steps. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3017[*OCPBUGS-3017*])

* Before this update, system reserved parameters were not generated in kubelet configuration files, causing the Compliance Operator to fail to unpause the machine config pool. With this update, the Compliance Operator omits system reserved parameters during machine configuration pool evaluation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4445[*OCPBUGS-4445*])

* Before this update, `ComplianceCheckResult` objects did not have correct descriptions. With this update, the Compliance Operator sources the `ComplianceCheckResult` information from the rule description. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4615[*OCPBUGS-4615*])

* Before this update, the Compliance Operator did not check for empty kubelet configuration files when parsing machine configurations. As a result, the Compliance Operator would panic and crash. With this update, the Compliance Operator implements improved checking of the kubelet configuration data structure and only continues if it is fully rendered.
//(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4621[*OCPBUGS-4621*])

* Before this update, the Compliance Operator generated remediations for kubelet evictions based on machine config pool name and a grace period, resulting in multiple remediations for a single eviction rule. With this update, the Compliance Operator applies all remediations for a single rule. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4338[*OCPBUGS-4338*])

* Before this update, a regression occurred when attempting to create a `ScanSettingBinding` that was using a `TailoredProfile` with a non-default `MachineConfigPool` marked the `ScanSettingBinding` as `Failed`. With this update, functionality is restored and custom `ScanSettingBinding` using a `TailoredProfile` performs correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6827[*OCPBUGS-6827*])

* Before this update, some kubelet configuration parameters did not have default values. With this update, the following parameters contain default values (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6708[*OCPBUGS-6708*]):
** `ocp4-cis-kubelet-enable-streaming-connections`
** `ocp4-cis-kubelet-eviction-thresholds-set-hard-imagefs-available`
** `ocp4-cis-kubelet-eviction-thresholds-set-hard-imagefs-inodesfree`
** `ocp4-cis-kubelet-eviction-thresholds-set-hard-memory-available`
** `ocp4-cis-kubelet-eviction-thresholds-set-hard-nodefs-available`

* Before this update, the `selinux_confinement_of_daemons` rule failed running on the kubelet because of the permissions necessary for the kubelet to run. With this update, the `selinux_confinement_of_daemons` rule is disabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6968[*OCPBUGS-6968*])
