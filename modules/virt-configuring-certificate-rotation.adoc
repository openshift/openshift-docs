= Configuring certificate rotation

You can do this during {VirtProductName} installation in the web console or after installation in the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

. Open the `HyperConverged` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit hco -n openshift-cnv kubevirt-hyperconverged
----

. Edit the `spec.certConfig` fields as shown in the following example. To avoid overloading the system, ensure that all values are greater than or equal to 10 minutes. Express all values as strings that comply with the link:https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration[golang `ParseDuration` format].

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
 name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
 namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  certConfig:
    ca:
      duration: 48h0m0s
      renewBefore: 24h0m0s <1>
    server:
      duration: 24h0m0s  <2>
      renewBefore: 12h0m0s  <3>
----
<1> The value of `ca.renewBefore` must be less than or equal to the value of `ca.duration`.
<2> The value of `server.duration` must be less than or equal to the value of `ca.duration`.
<3> The value of `server.renewBefore` must be less than or equal to the value of `server.duration`.

. Apply the YAML file to your cluster.
