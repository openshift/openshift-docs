// May need to re-add this after 5.8 release - check with eng later
// In logging 5.7 and later, the Cluster Logging Operator provides `alertingrule-editor-role` and `recordingrule-editor-role` cluster roles, which enable users to modify alerting and recording rules for the LokiStack.

Administrators can allow users to create and manage their own alerting rules by creating a `ClusterRole` object and binding this role to usernames. The `ClusterRole` object defines the necessary role-based access control (RBAC) permissions for users.

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Logging Operator is installed in the `openshift-logging` namespace.
* You have administrator permissions.
