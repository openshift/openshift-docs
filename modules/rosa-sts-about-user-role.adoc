= About the user-role IAM role

You need to create a `user-role` IAM role per web UI user to enable those users to create ROSA clusters.

Some considerations for your `user-role` IAM role are:

* You only need one `user-role` IAM role per Red{nbsp}Hat user account, but your Red{nbsp}Hat organization can have many of these IAM resources.
* Any user in a Red{nbsp}Hat organization may create and link an `user-role` IAM role.
* There can be numerous `user-role` IAM roles per AWS account per Red{nbsp}Hat organization.
* Red{nbsp}Hat uses the `user-role` IAM role to identify the user. This IAM resource has no AWS account permissions.
* Your AWS account can have multiple `user-role` IAM roles, but you must link each IAM role to each user in your Red{nbsp}Hat organization. No user can have more than one linked `user-role` IAM role.

[NOTE]
====
"Linking" or "associating" your IAM resources with your AWS account means creating a trust-policy with your `user-role` IAM role and the Red{nbsp}Hat {cluster-manager} AWS role. After creating and linking this IAM resource, you see a trust relationship from your `user-role` IAM role in AWS with the `arn:aws:iam::710019948333:role/RH-Managed-OpenShift-Installer` resource.
