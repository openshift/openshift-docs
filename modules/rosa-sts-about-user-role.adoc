= About the user role

You need to create a user role per web UI user to enable those users to create ROSA clusters.

Some considerations for your user role are:

* You only need one user role per Red Hat user account, but your Red Hat organization can have many of these IAM resources.
* Any user in a Red Hat organization may create and link a user role.
* There can be numerous user roles per AWS account per Red Hat organization.
* Red Hat uses the user role to identify the user. This IAM resource has no AWS account permissions.
* Your AWS account can have multiple user roles, but you must link each IAM role to each user in your Red Hat organization. No user can have more than one linked user role.

[NOTE]
====
"Linking" or "associating" your IAM resources with your AWS account means creating a trust-policy with your user role and the Red Hat {cluster-manager} AWS role. After creating and linking this IAM resource, you see a trust relationship from your user role in AWS with the `arn:aws:iam::710019948333:role/RH-Managed-OpenShift-Installer` resource.
