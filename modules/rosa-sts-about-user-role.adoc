= About the user-role IAM role

You need to create the `user-role` IAM role to enable a Red Hat organization of users to create ROSA clusters.

Some considerations for your `user-role` IAM role are:

* You only need one `user-role` IAM role per Red Hat user account, but your Red Hat organization can have many of these IAM resources.
* Any user in a Red Hat organization may create and link an `user-role` IAM role.
* There can be numerous `user-role` IAM roles per AWS account per Red Hat organization.
* Red Hat uses the `user-role` IAM role to identify the user. This IAM resource has no AWS account permissions.

[NOTE]
====
"Linking" or "associating" your IAM resources with your AWS account means creating a trust-policy with your `user-role` IAM role and the Red Hat {cluster-manager} AWS role. After creating and linking this IAM resource, you see a trust relationship from your `user-role` IAM role in AWS with the `arn:aws:iam::710019948333:role/RH-Managed-OpenShift-Installer` resource.
