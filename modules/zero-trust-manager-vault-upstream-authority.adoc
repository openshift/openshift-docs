= About the Vault upstream authority plugin

The Vault plugin integrates the SPIRE Server with the HashiCorp Vault Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) engine to manage the lifecycle of intermediate CA certificates. The SPIRE Server uses the CA certificates to sign the workload {svid-full}. The plugin enables the SPIRE Server to use the PKI for issuing and renewing intermediate signing certificates.

The plugin interacts with the PKI secret engine to request intermediate CA certificates, signs the requests, and then provides the certificates to the SPIRE Server.

[NOTE]
====
The Vault plugin does not support the `PublishJWTKey` remote procedure call (RPC) and should not be used in SPIRE configurations where JSON Web Tokens-SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Documents (JWT-SVIDs) are used.
