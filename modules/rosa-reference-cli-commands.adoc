= ROSA reference CLI commands 

After you configure the {rosa-short} clusters to use your selected log forwarder for managing control plane logs, see the following commands to run based on your specific needs. For all of these commands, you must provide the `clusterid` in the `--cluster` flag: 

* `rosa create log-forwarder -c <cluster_name|cluster_id>` Configures your ROSA cluster to use the log forwarder. 
* `rosa list log-forwarder -c <cluster_name|cluster_id>`: Displays all the log forwarder configurations attributed to that ROSA cluster. 
* `rosa describe log-forwarder -c <cluster_name|cluster_id> <log-fwd-id>`:  Provides more than the basic details for that specific log forwarder. 
* `rosa edit log-forwarder -c <cluster_name|cluster_id> <log-fwd-id>`: Enables you to make changes to the log forwarder. 
* `rosa delete log-forwarder -c <cluster_name|cluster_id> <log-fwd-id>`: Deletes the log forwarder for all specified ROSA clusters.
