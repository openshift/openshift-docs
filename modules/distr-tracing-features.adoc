= {DTProductName} features

{DTProductName} provides the following capabilities:

* Integration with Kiali – When properly configured, you can view {DTShortName} data from the Kiali console.

* High scalability – The {DTShortName} backend is designed to have no single points of failure and to scale with the business needs.

* Distributed Context Propagation – Lets you connect data from different components together to create a complete end-to-end trace.

* Backwards compatibility with Zipkin – {DTProductName} has APIs that enable it to be used as a drop-in replacement for Zipkin, but Red Hat is not supporting Zipkin compatibility in this release.
