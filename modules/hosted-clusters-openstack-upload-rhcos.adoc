= Uploading the RHCOS image to OpenStack

If you want to specify which {op-system} image to use when deploying node pools on and {hcp} and {rh-openstack-first} deployment, upload the image to the {rh-openstack} cloud. If you do not upload the image, the OpenStack Resource Controller (ORC) downloads an image from the {product-title} mirror and deletes it when the hosted cluster is deleted.

.Prerequisites

* You downloaded the {op-system} image from the {product-title} mirror.
* You have access to your {rh-openstack} cloud.

.Procedure

* Upload an {op-system} image to {rh-openstack} by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack image create --disk-format qcow2 --file <image_file_name> rhcos
----
+

where:

`<image_file_name>`:: Specifies the file name of the {op-system} image.
