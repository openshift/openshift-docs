You can store the size and digest of the image that is created by your build strategy to a set of result files. You can also store error details for debugging purposes when a `BuildRun` resource fails. You can define the following result parameters in your `BuildStrategy` or `ClusterBuildStrategy` CR:

.Result parameters
[options="header"]
|===

| Parameter | Description

| `$(results.shp-image-digest.path)`  | Denotes the path to the file that stores the digest of the image.

| `$(results.shp-image-size.path)`  | Denotes the path to the file that stores the compressed size of the image.

| `$(results.shp-error-reason.path)`  | Denotes the path to the file that stores the error reason.

| `$(results.shp-error-message.path)`  | Denotes the path to the file that stores the error message.

The following example shows the size and digest of the image in the `.status.output` field of the `BuildRun` CR:
