= About mirroring the {product-title} image repository for a disconnected registry

To use mirror images for a disconnected installation with the Agent-based Installer, you must modify the `install-config.yaml` file.

You can mirror the release image by using the output of either the `oc adm release mirror` or `oc mirror` command.
This is dependent on which command you used to set up the mirror registry.

The following example shows the output of the `oc adm release mirror` command.

[source,terminal]

$ oc adm release mirror

To use the new mirrored repository to install, add the following
section to the install-config.yaml:

imageContentSources:

mirrors:
virthost.ostest.test.metalkube.org:5000/localimages/local-release-image
source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev
mirrors:
virthost.ostest.test.metalkube.org:5000/localimages/local-release-image
source: registry.ci.openshift.org/ocp/release
----

The following example shows part of the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file generated by the oc-mirror plugin. The file can be found in the results directory, for example `oc-mirror-workspace/results-1682697932/`.
