= About mirroring the {product-title} image repository for a disconnected registry

To use mirror images for a disconnected installation with the Agent-based Installer, you must modify the `install-config.yaml` file.

You can mirror the release image by using the output of either the `oc adm release mirror` or `oc mirror` command.
This is dependent on which command you used to set up the mirror registry. The following example shows the output of the `oc adm release mirror` command.


[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror
----

.Example output

[source,terminal]
----
To use the new mirrored repository to install, add the following
section to the install-config.yaml:

imageContentSources:

mirrors:
virthost.ostest.test.metalkube.org:5000/localimages/local-release-image
source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev
mirrors:
virthost.ostest.test.metalkube.org:5000/localimages/local-release-image
source: registry.ci.openshift.org/ocp/release
----
Use the output of the command to update the `imageContentSources` field in the `install-config.yaml` file. Additionally, add the certificate file used for the mirror registry to the `additionalTrustBundle` field.

.Example `install-config.yaml` file

[source,yaml]
----
  additionalTrustBundle: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

The value must be the contents of the certificate file that you used for your mirror registry. The certificate file can be an existing, trusted certificate authority, or the self-signed certificate that you generated for the mirror registry.

If you are using the optional method of the ZTP manifests, there are two mirror configuration files: `registries.conf` and `ca- bundle.crt` . These files must be added to the `mirror/directory` path to add the mirror configuration in the agent ISO image.

You can create the `registries.conf` file from the output of either the `oc adm release mirror` or `oc mirror` command. The format of the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file has changed . It is now version 2 and in TOML format.
