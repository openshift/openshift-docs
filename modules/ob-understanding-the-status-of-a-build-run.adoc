= Build run statuses description

A `BuildRun` custom resource (CR) can have different statuses during the image building process. The following table covers the different statuses of a build run:

.Statuses of a build run
[options="header",cols="15%,30%,55%"]
|===

| Status | Cause | Description

| `Unknown` | `Pending` | The `BuildRun` resource waits for a pod in status `Pending`.

| `Unknown` | `Running` | The `BuildRun` resource has been validated and started to perform its work.

| `Unknown` | `BuildRunCanceled` | The user has requested to cancel the build run. This request triggers the build run controller to make a request for canceling the related task runs. Cancellation is still under process when this status is present.

| `True` | `Succeeded` | The pod for the `BuildRun` resource is created.

| `False` | `Failed` | The `BuildRun` resource is failed in one of the steps.

| `False` | `BuildRunTimeout` | The execution of the `BuildRun` resource is timed out.

| `False` | `UnknownStrategyKind` | The strategy type defined in the `Kind` field is unknown. You can define these strategy types: `ClusterBuildStrategy` and `BuildStrategy`.

| `False` | `ClusterBuildStrategyNotFound` | The referenced cluster-scoped strategy was not found in the cluster.

| `False` | `BuildStrategyNotFound` | The referenced namespace-scoped strategy was not found in the cluster.

| `False` | `SetOwnerReferenceFailed` | Setting the `ownerReferences` field from the `BuildRun` resource to the related `TaskRun` resource failed.

| `False` | `TaskRunIsMissing` | The `TaskRun` resource related to the `BuildRun` resource was not found.

| `False` | `TaskRunGenerationFailed` | The generation of a `TaskRun` specification has failed.

| `False` | `MissingParameterValues` | You have not provided any value for some parameters that are defined in the build strategy without any default. You must provide the values for those parameters in the `Build` or the `BuildRun` CR.

| `False` | `RestrictedParametersInUse` | A value for a system parameter was provided, which is not allowed.

| `False` | `UndefinedParameter` | A value for a parameter was provided that is not defined in the build strategy.

| `False` | `WrongParameterValueType` | A value was provided for a build strategy parameter with the wrong type. For example, if the parameter is defined as an array or a string in the build strategy, you must provide a set of values or a direct value accordingly.

| `False` | `InconsistentParameterValues` | A value for a parameter contained more than one of these values: `value`, `configMapValue`, and `secretValue`. You must provide only one of the mentioned values to maintain consistency.

| `False` | `EmptyArrayItemParameterValues` | An item inside the values of an array parameter contained none of these values: `value`,`configMapValue`, and `secretValue`. You must provide only one of the mentioned values as null array items are not allowed.

| `False` | `IncompleteConfigMapValueParameterValues` | A value for a parameter contained a `configMapValue` value where the `name` or the `value` field was empty. You must specify the empty field to point to an existing config map key in your namespace.

| `False` | `IncompleteSecretValueParameterValues` | A value for a parameter contained a `secretValue` value where the `name` or the `value` field was empty. You must specify the empty field to point to an existing secret key in your namespace.

| `False` | `ServiceAccountNotFound` | The referenced service account was not found in the cluster.

| `False` | `BuildRegistrationFailed` | The referenced build in the `BuildRun` resource is in a `Failed` state.

| `False` | `BuildNotFound` | The referenced build in the `BuildRun` resource was not found.

| `False` | `BuildRunCanceled` | The `BuildRun` and related `TaskRun` resources were canceled successfully.

| `False` | `BuildRunNameInvalid` | The defined build run name in the `metadata.name` field is invalid. You must provide a valid label value for the build run name in your `BuildRun` CR.

| `False` | `BuildRunNoRefOrSpec` | The `BuildRun` resource does not have either the `spec.build.name` or `spec.build.spec` field defined. 

| `False` | `BuildRunAmbiguousBuild` | The defined `BuildRun` resource uses both the `spec.build.name` and `spec.build.spec` fields. Only one of the parameters is allowed at a time.

| `False` | `BuildRunBuildFieldOverrideForbidden` | The defined `spec.build.name` field uses an override in combination with the `spec.build.spec` field, which is not allowed. Use the `spec.build.spec` field to directly specify the respective value.

| `False` | `PodEvicted` | The build run pod was evicted from the node it was running on.
