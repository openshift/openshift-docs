= Assigning tag revisions

A tag in a traffic block of a service creates a custom URL, which points to a referenced revision.
A user can define a unique tag for an available revision of a service which creates a custom URL by using the format `http(s)://TAG-SERVICE.DOMAIN`.

A given tag must be unique to its traffic block of the service.
`kn` supports assigning and unassigning custom tags for revisions of services as part of the `kn service update` command.

[NOTE]
====
If you have assigned a tag to a particular revision, a user can reference the revision by its tag in the `--traffic` flag as `--traffic Tag=Percent`.

.Procedure

* Assign tag revisions by updating the service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service update svc --tag @latest=candidate --tag svc-vwxyz=current
----
+
`--tag RevisionName=Tag` uses the following syntax:

** `--tag` flag requires two values separated by a `=`.
** `RevisionName` string refers to name of the `Revision`.
** `Tag` string denotes the custom tag to be given for this Revision.
** Use the identifier `@latest` for the `RevisionName` to refer to the latest ready revision of the service. You can use this identifier only once with the `--tag` flag.
** If the `service update` command is updating the configuration values for the service, along with tag flags, the `@latest` reference points to the created revision after applying the update.
** `--tag` flag can be specified multiple times.
** `--tag` flag may assign different tags to the same revision.
