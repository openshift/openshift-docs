= Assigning tag revisions

A tag in a traffic block of service creates a custom URL, which points to a referenced revision. A user can define a unique tag for an available revision of a service which creates a custom URL by using the format `http(s)://TAG-SERVICE.DOMAIN`.

A given tag must be unique to its traffic block of the service. `kn` supports assigning and unassigning custom tags for revisions of services as part of the `kn service update` command.

[NOTE]
====
If you have assigned a tag to a particular revision, a user can reference the revision by its tag in the `--traffic` flag as `--traffic Tag=Percent`.

.Procedure
* Use the following command:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service update svc --tag @latest=candidate --tag svc-vwxyz=current
----

[NOTE]
====
`--tag RevisionName=Tag` uses the following syntax:

* `--tag` flag requires two values separated by a `=`.

* `RevisionName` string refers to name of the `Revision`.

* `Tag` string denotes the custom tag to be given for this Revision.

* Use the identifier `@latest` for the RevisionName to refer to the latest ready revision of the service. You can use this identifier only once with the `--tag` flag.

* If the `service update` command is updating the configuration values for the Service (along with tag flags), `@latest` reference will be pointed to the created Revision after applying the update.

* `--tag` flag can be specified multiple times.

* `--tag` flag may assign different tags to the same revision.
