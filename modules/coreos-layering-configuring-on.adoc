= Using on-cluster layering to apply a custom layered image

To apply a custom layered image to your cluster by using the on-cluster build process, make a `MachineOSConfig` custom resource (CR) that specifies the following parameters: 

* the Containerfile to build
* the machine config pool to associate the build
* where the final image should be pushed and pulled from
* the push and pull secrets to use

When you create the object, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) creates a `MachineOSBuild` object and a `machine-os-builder` pod. The build process also creates transient objects, such as config maps, which are cleaned up after the build is complete.

When the build is complete, the MCO pushes the new custom layered image to your repository for use when deploying new nodes. You can see the digested image pull spec for the new custom layered image in the `MachineOSBuild` object and `machine-os-builder` pod.

You should not need to interact with these new objects or the `machine-os-builder` pod. However, you can use all of these resources for troubleshooting, if necessary.

You need a separate `MachineOSConfig` CR for each machine config pool where you want to use a custom layered image.

include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

.Prerequisites

* You have enabled the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set by using the feature gates. For more information, see "Enabling features using feature gates".

* You have a copy of the global pull secret in the `openshift-machine-config-operator` namespace that the MCO needs in order to pull the base operating system image.
+
For example, if you are using the global pull secret, you can run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$oc create secret docker-registry global-pull-secret-copy \
  --namespace "openshift-machine-config-operator" \
  --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<(oc get secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config -o go-template='{{index .data ".dockerconfigjson" | base64decode}}')
----
// https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42013

* You have a copy of the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace.

* You have the push secret that the MCO needs in order to push the new custom layered image to your registry.

* You have a pull secret that your nodes need to pull the new custom layered image from your registry. This should be a different secret than the one used to push the image to the repository.

* You are familiar with how to configure a Containerfile. Instructions on how to create a Containerfile are beyond the scope of this documentation.

* Optional: You have a separate machine config pool for the nodes where you want to apply the custom layered image.

.Procedure

. Create a `machineOSconfig` object:

.. Create a YAML file similar to the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: MachineOSConfig
metadata:
  name: layered
spec:
  machineConfigPool:
    name: <mcp_name> <1>
  buildInputs:
    containerFile: <2>
    - containerfileArch: noarch <3>
      content: |-
        FROM configs AS final <4>
        RUN rpm-ostree install tree && \
            ostree container commit
    imageBuilder: # <5>
      imageBuilderType: PodImageBuilder
    baseImagePullSecret: # <6>
      name: global-pull-secret-copy
    renderedImagePushspec: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/os-image:latest  # <7>
    renderedImagePushSecret: # <8>
      name: builder-dockercfg-7lzwl
  buildOutputs: # <9>
    currentImagePullSecret:
      name: builder-dockercfg-mtcl23
----
<1> Specifies the machine config pool to deploy the custom layered image.
<2> Specifies the Containerfile to configure the custom layered image. You can specify multiple build stages in the Containerfile.
<3> Specifies the architecture of the image to be built. You must set this parameter to `noarch`.
<4> Specifies the build stage as final. This field is required and applies to the last image in the build.
<5> Specifies the name of the image builder to use. You must set this parameter to `PodImageBuilder`.
<6> Specifies the name of the pull secret that the MCO needs in order to pull the base operating system image from the registry.
<7> Specifies the image registry to push the newly-built custom layered image to. This can be any registry that your cluster has access to. This example uses the internal {product-title} registry.
<8> Specifies the name of the push secret that the MCO needs in order to push the newly-built custom layered image to the registry.
<9> Specifies the secret required by the image registry that the nodes need in order to pull the newly-built custom layered image. This should be a different secret than the one used to push the image to your repository.

.. Create the `MachineOSConfig` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
----

. If necessary, when the `MachineOSBuild` object has been created and is in the `READY` state, modify the node spec for the nodes where you want to use the new custom layered image:
+
.. Check that the `MachineOSBuild` object is `READY`. When the `SUCCEEDED` value is `True`, the build is complete.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineosbuild
----
+
.Example output showing that the `MachineOSBuild` object is ready
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                                                PREPARED   BUILDING   SUCCEEDED   INTERRUPTED   FAILED
layered-rendered-layered-ad5a3cad36303c363cf458ab0524e7c0-builder   False      False      True        False         False
----

.. Edit the nodes where you want to deploy the custom layered image by adding a label for the machine config pool you specified in the `MachineOSConfig` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node_name> 'node-role.kubernetes.io/<mcp_name>='
----
+
--
where:

node-role.kubernetes.io/<mcp_name>=:: Specifies a node selector that identifies the nodes to deploy the custom layered image. 
--
+
When you save the changes, the MCO drains, cordons, and reboots the nodes. After the reboot, the node will be using the new custom layered image.
