= Ingress sharding and DNS

The cluster administrator is responsible for making a separate DNS entry for each router in a project. A router will not forward unknown routes to another router.

Consider the following example:

* Router A lives on host 192.168.0.5 and has routes with `*.foo.com`.
* Router B lives on host 192.168.1.9 and has routes with `*.example.com`.

Separate DNS entries must resolve `\*.foo.com` to the node hosting Router A and `*.example.com` to the node hosting Router B:

* `*.foo.com A IN 192.168.0.5`
* `*.example.com A IN 192.168.1.9`
