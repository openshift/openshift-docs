You must have an AWS account with certain permissions before creating your cluster.

* Create an AWS account if you do not already have one.
* Gather the credentials required to log in to your AWS account.
* Ensure that your AWS account has sufficient permissions to use the {rosa-cli}.
//OSDOCS-11789: Moving these here because it is a permission / account level enablement
* Enable {product-title} for your AWS account on the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/[AWS console].
** If your account is the management account for your organization (used for AWS billing purposes), you must have `aws-marketplace:Subscribe` permissions available on your account. See _Service control policy (SCP) prerequisites_ for more information, or see the AWS documentation for troubleshooting: link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rosa/latest/userguide/security-iam-troubleshoot.html#error-aws-orgs-scp-denies-permissions[AWS Organizations service control policy denies required AWS Marketplace permissions].
* Ensure you have not enabled restrictive tag policies. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_tag-policies.html[Tag policies] in the AWS documentation.
