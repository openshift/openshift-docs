= Understanding node affinity

Node affinity allows a pod to specify an affinity towards a group of nodes it can be placed on. The node does not have control over the placement.

For example, you could configure a pod to only run on a node with a specific CPU or in a specific availability zone.

There are two types of node affinity rules: _required_ and _preferred_.

Required rules *must* be met before a pod can be scheduled on a node. Preferred rules specify that, if the rule is met, the scheduler tries to enforce the rules, but does not guarantee enforcement.

[NOTE]
====
If labels on a node change at runtime that results in an node affinity rule on a pod no longer being met, the pod continues to run on the node.
====

You configure node affinity through the pod specification file. You can specify a required rule, a preferred rule, or both. If you specify both, the node must first meet the required rule, then attempts to meet the preferred rule.

The following example is a pod specification with a rule that requires the pod be placed on a node with a label whose key is `e2e-az-NorthSouth` and whose value is either `e2e-az-North` or `e2e-az-South`:

<1> The stanza to configure node affinity.
<2> Defines a required rule.
<3> The key/value pair (label) that must be matched to apply the rule.
<4> The operator represents the relationship between the label on the node and the set of values in the `matchExpression` parameters in the pod specification. This value can be `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, or `DoesNotExist`, `Lt`, or `Gt`.

The following example is a node specification with a preferred rule that a node with a label whose key is `e2e-az-EastWest` and whose value is either `e2e-az-East` or `e2e-az-West` is preferred for the pod:

<1> The stanza to configure node affinity.
<2> Defines a preferred rule.
<3> Specifies a weight for a preferred rule. The node with highest weight is preferred.
<4> The key/value pair (label) that must be matched to apply the rule.
<5> The operator represents the relationship between the label on the node and
the set of values in the `matchExpression` parameters in the pod specification.
This value can be `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, or `DoesNotExist`, `Lt`, or `Gt`.

There is no explicit _node anti-affinity_ concept, but using the `NotIn` or `DoesNotExist` operator replicates that behavior.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using node affinity and node selectors in the same pod configuration, note the following:

* If you configure both `nodeSelector` and `nodeAffinity`, both conditions must be satisfied for the pod to be scheduled onto a candidate node.

* If you specify multiple `nodeSelectorTerms` associated with `nodeAffinity` types, then the pod can be scheduled onto a node if one of the `nodeSelectorTerms` is satisfied.

* If you specify multiple `matchExpressions` associated with `nodeSelectorTerms`, then the pod can be scheduled onto a node only if all `matchExpressions` are satisfied.
