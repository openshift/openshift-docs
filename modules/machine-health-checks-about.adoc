= About MachineHealthChecks

MachineHealthChecks automatically repairs unhealthy Machines in a particular
MachinePool.

To monitor machine health, you create a resource to define the
configuration for a controller. You set a condition to check for, such as
staying in the `NotReady` status for 15 minutes or displaying a permanent condition
in the node-problem-detector, and a label for the set of machines to monitor.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot apply a MachineHealthCheck to a machine with the master role.
====

The controller that observes a MachineHealthCheck resource checks for the status
that you defined. If a machine fails the health check, it is automatically deleted
and a new one is created to take its place. When a machine is deleted, you
see a `machine deleted` event. To limit disruptive impact of the machine
deletion, the controller drains and deletes only one node at a time. If there
are more unhealthy machines than the `maxUnhealthy` threshold allows for in the
targeted pool of machines, remediation stops so that manual intervention can take
place.

To stop the check, you remove the resource.
