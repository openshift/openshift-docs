= About machine health checks

[NOTE]
====
You can only apply a machine health check to control plane machines on clusters that use control plane machine sets.
====

To monitor machine health, create a resource to define the configuration for a controller. Set a condition to check, such as staying in the `NotReady` status for five minutes or displaying a permanent condition in the node-problem-detector, and a label for the set of machines to monitor.

The controller that observes a `MachineHealthCheck` resource checks for the defined condition. If a machine fails the health check, the machine is automatically deleted and one is created to take its place. When a machine is deleted, you see a `machine deleted` event.

To limit disruptive impact of the machine deletion, the controller drains and deletes only one node at a time. If there are more unhealthy machines than the `maxUnhealthy` threshold allows for in the targeted pool of machines, remediation stops and therefore enables manual intervention.

[NOTE]
====
Consider the timeouts carefully, accounting for workloads and requirements.

* Long timeouts can result in long periods of downtime for the workload on the unhealthy machine.
* Too short timeouts can result in a remediation loop. For example, the timeout for checking the `NotReady` status must be long enough to allow the machine to complete the startup process.
====

To stop the check, remove the resource.

== Limitations when deploying machine health checks

There are limitations to consider before deploying a machine health check:

* Only machines owned by a machine set are remediated by a machine health check.
* If the node for a machine is removed from the cluster, a machine health check considers the machine to be unhealthy and remediates it immediately.
* If the corresponding node for a machine does not join the cluster after the `nodeStartupTimeout`, the machine is remediated.
* A machine is remediated immediately if the `Machine` resource phase is `Failed`.
