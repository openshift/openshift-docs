= About machine health checks

You can define conditions under which machines in a cluster are considered unhealthy by using a `MachineHealthCheck` resource.
Machines matching the conditions are automatically remediated.

To monitor machine health, create a `MachineHealthCheck` custom resource (CR) that includes a label for the set of machines to monitor and a condition to check, such as staying in the `NotReady` status for 15 minutes or displaying a permanent condition in the node-problem-detector.

The controller that observes a `MachineHealthCheck` CR checks for the condition that you defined. If a machine fails the health check, the machine is automatically deleted and a new one is created to take its place. When a machine is deleted, you see a `machine deleted` event.

[NOTE]
====
For machines with the master role, the machine health check reports the number of unhealthy nodes, but the machine is not deleted. For example:

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinehealthcheck example -n openshift-machine-api
----
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      MAXUNHEALTHY   EXPECTEDMACHINES   CURRENTHEALTHY
example   40%            3                  1
----

To limit the disruptive impact of machine deletions, the controller drains and deletes only one node at a time. If there are more unhealthy machines than the `maxUnhealthy` threshold allows for in the targeted pool of machines, the controller stops deleting machines and you must manually intervene.
====

To stop the check, remove the custom resource.

== MachineHealthChecks on Bare Metal

Machine deletion on bare metal cluster triggers reprovisioning of a bare metal host.
Usually bare metal reprovisioning is a lengthy process, during which the cluster
is missing compute resources and applications might be interrupted.
To change the default remediation process from machine deletion to host power-cycle,
annotate the MachineHealthCheck resource with the
`machine.openshift.io/remediation-strategy: external-baremetal` annotation.

After you set the annotation, unhealthy machines are power-cycled by using
BMC credentials.

[id="machine-health-checks-limitations_{context}"]
== Limitations when deploying machine health checks

There are limitations to consider before deploying a machine health check:

* Only machines owned by a machine set are remediated by a machine health check.
* Control plane machines are not currently supported and are not remediated if they are unhealthy.
* If the node for a machine is removed from the cluster, a machine health check considers the machine to be unhealthy and remediates it immediately.
* If the corresponding node for a machine does not join the cluster after the `nodeStartupTimeout`, the machine is remediated.
* A machine is remediated immediately if the `Machine` resource phase is `Failed`.
