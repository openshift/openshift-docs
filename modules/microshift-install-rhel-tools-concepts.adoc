= {op-system-base} installation tools and concepts

Familiarize yourself with the following {op-system-base} tools and concepts:

* A Kickstart file, which contains the configuration and instructions used during the installation of your specific operating system. For more information, see the following link:

** link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_microshift/latest/html/using_rhel_kickstarts/microshift-rhel-kickstarts[Using Kickstart files for installing {microshift-short} in {op-system-base}]

* {op-system-base} image builder is a tool for creating deployment-ready customized system images. {op-system-base} image builder uses a blueprint that you create to make the ISO. {op-system-base} image builder is best installed on a {op-system-base} VM and is built with the `composer-cli` tool. To set up these tools and review the workflow, see the following {op-system-base} documentation links:

* A blueprint file directs {op-system-base} image builder to the items to include in the ISO. An image blueprint provides a persistent definition of image customizations. You can create multiple builds from a single blueprint. You can also edit an existing blueprint to build a new ISO as requirements change. See the following link for more information:

* An ISO, which is the bootable operating system on which {microshift-short} runs. See the following links for more information:
