[id="csi-drivers-supported_{context}"]
= CSI drivers supported by {product-title}

{product-title} installs certain Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers by default, giving users storage options that are not possible with in-tree volume plug-ins.

To create CSI-provisioned persistent volumes that mount to these supported storage assets, {product-title} installs the necessary CSI driver Operator, the CSI driver, and the required storage class by default. For more details about the default namespace of the Operator and driver, see the documentation for the specific CSI Driver Operator.

The following table describes the CSI drivers that are installed with {product-title} and which CSI features they support, such as volume snapshots, cloning, and resize.
