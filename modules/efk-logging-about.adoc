= About cluster logging

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can deploy cluster logging to
aggregate logs for a range of {product-title} services.

The cluster logging components are based upon Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK).
The collector, link:http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd], is deployed to each node in the {product-title} cluster.
It collects all node and container logs and writes them to link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] (ES).
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana] is the centralized, web UI
where users and administrators can create rich visualizations and dashboards with the aggregated data.

{product-title} cluster administrators can deploy cluster logging using a few CLI commands and the {product-title} 
web console to install the Elasticsearch Operator and Cluster Logging Operator. When the operators are installed, 
create a Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) to schedule cluster logging pods and other resources necessary 
to support cluster logging. The operators are responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining cluster logging.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
{product-title} cluster administrators can deploy Cluster Logging and
Elasticsearch operators via OperatorHub and configure logging in the
openshift-logging namespace. Configuring logging will deploy Elasticsearch,
Fluentd, and Kibana in the openshift-logging namespace. The operators are
responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining cluster logging.
endif::[]

You can configure cluster logging by modifying the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR), named `instance`.
The CR defines a complete cluster logging deployment that includes all the components
of the logging stack to collect, store and visualize logs.  The Cluster Logging Operator watches the `ClusterLogging`
Custom Resource and adjusts the logging deployment accordingly.

Administrators and application developers can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access.
