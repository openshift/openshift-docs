= About cluster logging in {product-title}

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can deploy cluster logging to
aggregate logs for a range of {product-title} services. 

The cluster logging components are based upon Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK).  
The collector, link:http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd], is deployed to each node in the OpenShift cluster.  
It collects all node and container logs and writes them to link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] (ES).   
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana] is the centralized, web UI 
where users and administrators can create rich visualizations and dashboards with the aggregated data.

Administrators and application developers can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access. 

{product-title} cluster administrators prepare to deploy to cluster logging by creating a subscription from the catalogue.  
The new subscription will deploy the 'cluster-logging-operator' and associated resources.  
This operator is responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining cluster logging.
