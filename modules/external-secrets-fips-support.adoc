= About FIPS compliance for {external-secrets-operator}

The {external-secrets-operator} supports FIPS compliance. When running on {product-title} in FIPS mode, {external-secrets-operator-short} uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries submitted to NIST for FIPS validation on the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390X architectures. For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic module validation program]. For more information about the latest NIST status for the individual versions of the RHEL cryptographic libraries submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance activities and government standards].

To enable FIPS mode, install the {external-secrets-operator-short} on an {product-title} cluster that runs in FIPS mode. For more information, see "Do you need extra security for your cluster?".
