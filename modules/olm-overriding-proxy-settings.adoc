= Overriding proxy settings of an Operator

If a cluster-wide egress proxy is configured, Operators running with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) inherit the cluster-wide proxy settings on their deployments. Cluster administrators can also override these proxy settings by configuring the subscription of an Operator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Operators must handle setting environment variables for proxy settings in the pods for any managed Operands.
====

.Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
`cluster-admin` permissions.
endif::[]

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to the *Operators → OperatorHub* page.

. Select the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page, modify the `Subscription` object to include one or more of the following environment variables in the `spec` section:
+
--
* `HTTP_PROXY`
* `HTTPS_PROXY`
* `NO_PROXY`
--
+
For example:
+

[NOTE]
====
These environment variables can also be unset using an empty value to remove any previously set cluster-wide or custom proxy settings.
====
+
OLM handles these environment variables as a unit; if at least one of them is set, all three are considered overridden and the cluster-wide defaults are not used for the deployments of the subscribed Operator.

. Click *Install* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces.

. After the CSV for the Operator appears in the relevant namespace, you can verify that custom proxy environment variables are set in the deployment. For example, using the CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment -n openshift-operators \
    etcd-operator -o yaml \
    | grep -i "PROXY" -A 2
