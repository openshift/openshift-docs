[id="olm-overriding-proxy-settings_{context}"]
= Overriding an Operator's proxy settings

If a cluster-wide egress proxy is configured, applications created from
Operators using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) inherit the cluster-wide proxy
settings on their Deployments and pods. Cluster administrators can also override
these proxy settings by configuring the Operator's Subscription.

.Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
`cluster-admin` permissions.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
`dedicated-admins-cluster` permissions.
endif::[]

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to the *Operators â†’ OperatorHub* page.

. Select the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page, modify the Subscription object's
YAML to include one or more of the following environment variables in the
`spec` section:
+
--
* `HTTP_PROXY`
* `HTTPS_PROXY`
* `NO_PROXY`
--
+
For example:

[NOTE]
====
These environment variables can also be unset using an empty value to remove any
previously set cluster-wide or custom proxy settings.
====
+
OLM handles these environment variables as a unit; if at least one of them is
set, all three are considered overridden and the cluster-wide defaults are not
used for the subscribed Operator's Deployments.

. Click *Install* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces.

. After the Operator's CSV appears in the relevant namespace, you can verify that
custom proxy environment variables are set in the Deployment. For example, using
the CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment -n openshift-operators \
    etcd-operator -o yaml \
    | grep -i "PROXY" -A 2
