= Creating {op-system-first} machines using an ISO image

Before you install a cluster on bare metal infrastructure that you provision,
you must create {op-system} machines for it to use. You can use an
ISO image to create the machines.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* Have access to an HTTP server that you can access from your computer and that
the machines that you create can access.

.Procedure

. Upload the control plane, compute, and bootstrap Ignition config files that the
installation program created to your HTTP server. Note the URLs of these files.

. Obtain the {op-system} images that are required for your preferred method
of installing operating system instances from the
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[Product Downloads] page on the Red
Hat customer portal or the
link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.2/[{op-system} image mirror]
page.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The {op-system} images might not change with every release of {product-title}.
You must download images with the highest version that is less than or equal
to the {product-title} version that you install. Use the image versions
that match your {product-title} version if they are available.
====
+
You must download the ISO file and the RAW disk file.
Those file names resemble the following examples:

** ISO: `rhcos-<version>-installer.<architecture>.iso`
** Compressed metal RAW: `rhcos-<version>-metal.<architecture>.raw.gz`

. Upload either the RAW {op-system} image file to your HTTP server and
note its URL.

. Use the ISO to start the {op-system} installation. Use one of the following
installation options:
** Burn the ISO image to a disk and boot it directly.
** Use ISO redirection via a LOM interface.

. After the instance boots, press the `TAB` or `E` key to edit the kernel command line.
. Add the parameters to the kernel command line:

----
coreos.inst=yes
coreos.inst.install_dev=sda <1>
coreos.inst.image_url=<bare_metal_image_URL> <2>
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://example.com/config.ign <3>
ip=<dhcp or static IP address> <4>
----
<1> Specify the block device of the system to install to.
<2> Specify the URL of the RAW image that you uploaded to your server.
<3> Specify the URL of the Ignition config file for this machine type.
<4> Set `ip=dhcp` or set an individual static IP address (ip=) and DNS server (nameserver=) on each node. 
+
[NOTE]
====
Here is an example of a static IP entry:
----
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none nameserver=4.4.4.41
----

This example sets the:

* Node's IP address to 10.10.10.2
* Gateway address to 10.10.10.254
* Netmask to 255.255.255.0
* Hostname to core0.example.com
* Network interface card device to enp1s0
* The DNS server address to 4.4.4.41
====

. Press Enter to complete the installation. After {op-system} installs, the system
reboots. After the system reboots, it applies the Ignition config file that you
specified.

. Continue to create the machines for your cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create the bootstrap and control plane machines at this time. Because
some pods are deployed on compute machines by default, also create at least two
compute machines before you install the cluster.
