= Creating {op-system-first} machines using an ISO image

Before you install a cluster on ifndef::ibm-power[bare metal]
ifdef::ibm-power[IBM Power] infrastructure that you provision, you must create
{op-system} machines for it to use. You can use an ISO image to create the
machines.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* Have access to an HTTP server that you can access from your computer and that
the machines that you create can access.

.Procedure

. Upload the control plane, compute, and bootstrap Ignition config files that the
installation program created to your HTTP server. Note the URLs of these files.

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
. Obtain the {op-system} images that are required for your preferred method
of installing operating system instances from the
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[Product Downloads] page on the Red
Hat customer portal or the
ifndef::ibm-power[]
link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.4/[{op-system} image mirror]
endif::ibm-power[]
ifdef::ibm-power[]
link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/ppc64le/dependencies/rhcos/[{op-system} image mirror]
endif::ibm-power[]
page.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The {op-system} images might not change with every release of {product-title}.
You must download images with the highest version that is less than or equal
to the {product-title} version that you install. Use the image versions
that match your {product-title} version if they are available.
====
+
You must download the ISO file and the RAW disk file.
Those file names resemble the following examples:

** ISO: `rhcos-<version>-installer.<architecture>.iso`
** Compressed metal RAW: `rhcos-<version>-metal.<architecture>.raw.gz`
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. Obtain the {op-system} images from the
link:https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download?tab=metal_virtualized&stream=stable[{op-system} Downloads] page
endif::openshift-origin[]

. Upload either the RAW {op-system} image file to your HTTP server and
note its URL.

. Use the ISO to start the {op-system} installation. Use one of the following
installation options:
** Burn the ISO image to a disk and boot it directly.
** Use ISO redirection via a LOM interface.

. After the instance boots, press the `TAB` or `E` key to edit the kernel command line.
. Add the parameters to the kernel command line:

----
coreos.inst=yes
coreos.inst.install_dev=sda <1>
coreos.inst.image_url=<image_URL> <2>
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://example.com/config.ign <3>
ip=<dhcp or static IP address> <4> <5>
----
<1> Specify the block device of the system to install to.
<2> Specify the URL of the RAW image that you uploaded to your server.
<3> Specify the URL of the Ignition config file for this machine type.
<4> Set `ip=dhcp` or set an individual static IP address (`ip=`) and DNS server (`nameserver=`) on each node.
For example, setting
`ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none nameserver=4.4.4.41` sets:
* Node's IP address to `10.10.10.2`
* Gateway address to `10.10.10.254`
* Netmask to `255.255.255.0`
* Hostname to `core0.example.com`
* The DNS server address to `4.4.4.41`
<5>  If you use multiple network interfaces or DNS servers, you can further customize the IP address configuration in the following ways:
* If your system has multiple network interfaces, you can add multiple IP address configurations by specifying multiple `ip=` entries.
* If your system has multiple network interfaces, you can use a combination of DHCP and static IP configurations. You must specify the interface to use, for example `ip=enp1s0:dhcp ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0:none`.
* You can provide multiple DNS servers by adding a `nameserver=` entry for each server, such as `nameserver=1.1.1.1 nameserver=8.8.8.8`.

. Press Enter to complete the installation. After {op-system} installs, the system
reboots. After the system reboots, it applies the Ignition config file that you
specified.

. Continue to create the machines for your cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create the bootstrap and control plane machines at this time. Because
some pods are deployed on compute machines by default, also create at least two
compute machines before you install the cluster.
