ifeval::["{context}" == "installing-ibm-z"]
Before you install a cluster on IBM Z infrastructure that you provision, you must install {op-system} on z/VM guest virtual machines for the cluster to use. Complete the following steps to create the machines.

ifeval::["{context}" != "installing-ibm-z"]
Before you install a cluster on bare metal infrastructure that you provision,
you must create {op-system} machines for it to use. You can use an
ISO image to create the machines.
endif::[]

.Prerequisites
ifeval::["{context}" == "installing-ibm-z"]
* An FTP server running on your provisioning machine that is accessible to the machines you create.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" != "installing-ibm-z"]
* Obtain the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* Have access to an HTTP server that you can access from your computer and that
the machines that you create can access.
endif::[]

.Procedure
ifeval::["{context}" == "installing-ibm-z"]
. Log in to Linux on your provisioning machine.
. Download the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS installation files from the link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/s390x/dependencies/rhcos/4.2/latest/[{op-system} image mirror].
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" != "installing-ibm-z"]
. Upload the control plane, compute, and bootstrap Ignition config files that the
installation program created to your HTTP server. Note the URLs of these files.

. Obtain the {op-system} images that are required for your preferred method
of installing operating system instances from the
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[Product Downloads] page on the Red
Hat customer portal or the
link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.2/[{op-system} image mirror]
page.
endif::[]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The {op-system} images might not change with every release of {product-title}.
You must download images with the highest version that is less than or equal
to the {product-title} version that you install. Use the image versions
that match your {product-title} version if they are available.
====
+
ifeval::["{context}" == "installing-ibm-z"]
Download the following files:

* The initramfs: `rhcos-<version>-installer-initramfs.img`
* The kernel: `rhcos-<version>-installer-kernel`
* The operating system image for the disk on which you want to install {op-system}. This type can differ by virtual machine:
+
`rhcos-<version>-dasd.raw.gz` for DASD
+
`rhcos-<version>-metal-bios.raw.gz` for FCP

. Create parameter files. The following parameters are specific for a particular virtual machine:
** For `coreos.inst.install_dev=`, specify `dasda` for a DASD installation, or `sda` for FCP. Note that FCP requires `zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0`.
** For `rd.dasd=`, specifys the DASD where {op-system} is to be installed.
** `rd.zfcp=<adapter>,<wwpn>,<lun>` specifies the FCP disk to install {op-system} on.
** For `ip=`, specify the following seven entries:
... The IP address for the machine.
... An empty string.
... The gateway.
... The netmask.
... The machine host and domain name in the form `hostname.domainname`. Omit this value to let {op-system} decide set it.
... The network interface name. Omit this value to let {op-system} decide set it.
... If you use static IP addresses, an empty string.
** For `coreos.inst.ignition_url=`, specify the Ignition file for the machine role. The bootstrap machine ignition file is called `bootstrap-0`, the master ignition files are numbered 0 through 2, the worker ignition files from 0 upwards. All other parameters can stay as they are.
+
Example parameter file, `bootstrap-0.parm`, for the bootstrap machine:
+
----
rd.neednet=1 coreos.inst=yes coreos.inst.install_dev=dasda coreos.inst.image_url=ftp://
cl1.provide.example.com:8080/assets/rhcos-42.80.20191105.0-metal-dasd.raw.gz
coreos.inst.ignition_url=ftp://cl1.provide.example.com:8080/ignition-bootstrap-0
ip=172.18.78.2::172.18.78.1:255.255.255.0:::none nameserver=172.18.78.1
rd.znet=qeth,0.0.bdf0,0.0.bdf1,0.0.bdf2,layer2=1,portno=0 zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0 cio_ignore=all,
!condev rd.dasd=0.0.3490
----

. Transfer the initramfs, kernel, parameter files, and {op-system} images to z/VM, for example with FTP. For details about how to transfer the files with FTP and boot from the virtual reader, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/installation_guide/sect-installing-zvm-s390[Installing under Z/VM].
. Punch the files to the virtual reader of the z/VM guest virtual machine that is to become your bootstrap node.
+
For details about the PUNCH command, see https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSB27U_7.1.0/com.ibm.zvm.v710.dmsb4/pun.htm
+
[TIP]
====
You can use the CP PUNCH command or, if you use Linux, the **vmur** command to transfer files between two z/VM guest virtual machines.
====
+
. Log in to CMS on the bootstrap machine.
. IPL the bootstrap machine from the reader:
+
----
$ ipl c
----
+
See link:https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSB27U_7.1.0/com.ibm.zvm.v710.hcpb7/iplcommd.htm[IPL] in the IBM Knowledge Center.
+
. Repeat this procedure for the other machines in the cluster.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" != "installing-ibm-z"]
You must download the ISO file and either the BIOS or UEFI file.
Those file names resemble the following examples:

** ISO: `rhcos-<version>-<architecture>-installer.iso`
** Compressed metal BIOS: `rhcos-<version>-<architecture>-metal-bios.raw.gz`
** Compressed metal UEFI: `rhcos-<version>-<architecture>-metal-uefi.raw.gz`

. Upload either the BIOS or UEFI {op-system} image file to your HTTP server and
note its URL.

. Use the ISO to start the {op-system} installation. Use one of the following
installation options:
** Burn the ISO image to a disk and boot it directly.
** Use ISO redirection via a LOM interface.

. After the instance boots, press the `TAB` or `E` key to edit the kernel command line.
. Add the parameters to the kernel command line:
+
----
coreos.inst=yes
coreos.inst.install_dev=sda <1>
coreos.inst.image_url=<bare_metal_image_URL> <2>
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://example.com/config.ign <3>
----
<1> Specify the block device of the system to install to.
<2> Specify the URL of the UEFI or BIOS image that you uploaded to your server.
<3> Specify the URL of the Ignition config file for this machine type.

. Press Enter to complete the installation. After {op-system} installs, the system
reboots. After the system reboots, it applies the Ignition config file that you
specified.

. Continue to create the machines for your cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create the bootstrap and control plane machines at this time. Because
some pods are deployed on compute machines by default, also create at least two
compute machines before you install the cluster.
