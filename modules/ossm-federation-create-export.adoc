= Creating an ExportedServiceSet

You create an `ExportedServiceSet` resource to explicitly declare the services that you want to be available to a mesh peer.

Services are exported as `<export-name>.<export-namespace>.svc.<ServiceMeshPeer.name>-exports.local` and will automatically route to the target service.  This is the name by which the exported service is known in the exporting mesh. When the ingress gateway receives a request destined for this name, it will be routed to the actual service being exported. For example, if a service named `ratings.red-mesh-bookinfo` is exported to `green-mesh` as `ratings.bookinfo`, the service will be exported under the name `ratings.bookinfo.svc.green-mesh-exports.local`, and traffic received by the ingress gateway for that hostname will be routed to the `ratings.red-mesh-bookinfo` service.

.Prerequisites

* The cluster and `ServiceMeshControlPlane` have been configured for mesh federation.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

[NOTE]
====
You can configure services for export even if they don't exist yet. When a service that matches the value specified in the ExportedServiceSet is deployed, it will be automatically exported.

.Procedure from the Console
This is conjecture about what the flow might look like.

Follow this procedure to create an `ExportedServiceSet` with the web console. This example shows the red-mesh exporting the ratings service from the bookinfo application to the green-mesh.

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.
. Navigate to *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators*.
. Click the *Project* menu and select the project where you installed the {SMProductShortName} control plane for the mesh that will export services. For example, `red-mesh-system`.
. Click the {SMProductName} Operator, then click *Istio Service Mesh ExportedServiceSet*.
. On the *Istio Service Mesh ExportedServiceSet* tab, click *Create ExportedServiceSet*.
. On the *Create ExportedServiceSet* page, click *YAML* to modify your configuration.
. Modify the default configuration with values for your export.
. Click *Create*. The Operator creates the export based on your configuration parameters.
. To verify the `ExportedServiceSet` resource was created, click the *Istio Service Mesh ExportedServiceSet* tab.
.. Click the name of the new `ExportedServiceSet`; for example, `export-to-green-mesh`.
.. Click the *Resources* tab to see the `ExportedServiceSet` resource the Operator created and configured.

.Procedure from the CLI

Follow this procedure to create an `ExportedServiceSet` from the command line.

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. Enter the following command. Then, enter your username and password when prompted.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --username=<NAMEOFUSER> <API token> https://<HOSTNAME>:6443
----
+
. Change to the project where you installed the {SMProductShortName} control plane; for example, `red-mesh-system`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project red-mesh-system
----
+
. Create an `ExportedServiceSet` file based on the following example where `red-mesh` is exporting services to `green-mesh`.
+

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: federation.maistra.io/v1
kind: ExportedServiceSet
metadata:
  name: green-mesh
  namespace: red-mesh-system
spec:
  exportRules:
  - type: NameSelector
    nameSelector:

  - type: NameSelector
    nameSelector:

      name: reviews
----
+
. Run the following command to upload and create the `ExportedServiceSet` resource in the red-mesh-system namespace.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n <ControlPlaneNamespace> -f <ExportedServiceSet.yaml>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n red-mesh-system -f export-to-green-mesh.yaml
----
+
. Create additional `ExportedServiceSets` as needed for each mesh peer in your federated mesh.
//TODO - Add sample output after the validation
. To validate the services you've exported from `red-mesh` to share with `green-mesh`, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get exportedserviceset <PeerMeshExportedTo> -o yaml
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get exportedserviceset green-mesh -o yaml
----
+
. Run the following command to validate the services the red-mesh exports to share with green-mesh:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get exportedserviceset <PeerMeshExportedTo> -o yaml
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n red-mesh-system get exportedserviceset green-mesh -o yaml

----
The `status.exportedServices` array lists the services that are currently exported (these services matched the export rules in the `ExportedServiceSet object`). Each entry in the array indicates the name of the exported service and details about the local service that is exported.
+
If a service that you expected to be exported is missing, confirm the Service object exists, its name or labels match the `exportRules` defined in the `ExportedServiceSet` object, and that the Service object's namespace is configured as a member of the service mesh using the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` or `ServiceMeshMember` object.
