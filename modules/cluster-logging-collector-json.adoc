= Configuring log collection JSON parsing

You can configure the Fluentd log collector to determine if a log message is in *JSON* format and merge
the message into the JSON payload document posted to Elasticsearch. This feature is disabled by default.

You can enable or disable this feature by editing the `MERGE_JSON_LOG` environment variable in the *fluentd* daemonset.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Enabling this feature comes with risks, including:

* Possible log loss due to Elasticsearch rejecting documents due to inconsistent type mappings.
* Potential buffer storage leak caused by rejected message cycling.
* Overwrite of data for field with same names.

The features in this topic should be used by only experienced Fluentd and Elasticsearch users.
====

.Prerequisites

Set cluster logging to the unmanaged state.

.Procedure

Use the following command to enable this feature:

----
oc set env ds/fluentd MERGE_JSON_LOG=true <1>
----
<1> Set this to `false` to disable this feature or `true` to enable this feature.

////
----
oc set env ds/rsyslog MERGE_JSON_LOG=true <1>
----
////

*Setting MERGE_JSON_LOG and CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING*

If you set the `MERGE_JSON_LOG` and `CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING` enviroment variables to `true`, you might receive an Elasticsearch *400* error. The error occurs because when`MERGE_JSON_LOG=true`, Fluentd adds fields with data types other than *string*. When you set `CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING=true`, Fluentd attempts to add those fields as a *string* value resulting in the Elasticsearch *400* error. The error clears when the indices roll over for the next day.

When Fluentd rolls over the indices for the next day's logs, it will create a brand new index. The field definitions are updated and you will not get the *400* error. 

Records that have *hard* errors, such as schema violations, corrupted data, and so forth, cannot be retried. The log collector sends the records for error handling. If you link:https://docs.fluentd.org/v1.0/articles/config-file#@error-label[add a
`<label @ERROR>` section] to your Fluentd config, as the last <label>, you can handle these records as needed. 

For example:

----
data:
  fluent.conf:

....

    <label @ERROR>
      <match **>
        @type file
        path /var/log/fluent/dlq
        time_slice_format %Y%m%d
        time_slice_wait 10m
        time_format %Y%m%dT%H%M%S%z
        compress gzip
      </match>
    </label>

This section writes error records to the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/dead-letter-queues.html[Elasticsearch dead letter queue (DLQ) file]. See link:https://docs.fluentd.org/v0.12/articles/out_file[the fluentd documentation] for more information about the file output. 

Then you can edit the file to clean up the records manually, edit the file to use with the Elasticsearch `/_bulk index` API and use cURL to add those records. For more information on
Elasticsearch Bulk API, see link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/docs-bulk.html[the Elasticsearch documentation].
