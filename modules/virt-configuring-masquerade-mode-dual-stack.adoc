[id="virt-configuring-masquerade-mode-dual-stack_{context}"]
= Configuring masquerade mode with dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6)

You can configure a new virtual machine to use both IPv6 and IPv4 on the default pod network by using cloud-init.

The IPv6 network address must be statically set to `fd10:0:2::2/120` with a default gateway of `fd10:0:2::1` in the virtual machine configuration. These are used by the virt-launcher pod to route IPv6 traffic to the virtual machine and are not used externally.

When the virtual machine is running, incoming and outgoing traffic for the virtual machine is routed to both the IPv4 address and the unique IPv6 address of the virt-launcher pod. The virt-launcher pod then routes the IPv4 traffic to the DHCP address of the virtual machine, and the IPv6 traffic to the statically set IPv6 address of the virtual machine.

.Prerequisites

* The {product-title} cluster must use the OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider configured for dual-stack.

.Procedure

. In a new virtual machine configuration, include an interface with `masquerade` and configure the IPv6 address and default gateway by using cloud-init.

<1> Connect using masquerade mode.
<2> Allows incoming traffic on port 80 to the virtual machine.
<3> You must use the IPv6 address `fd10:0:2::2/120`.
<4> You must use the gateway `fd10:0:2::1`.

. Create the virtual machine in the namespace:

----
$ oc create -f example-vm-ipv6.yaml

.Verification

* To verify that IPv6 has been configured, start the virtual machine and view the interface status of the virtual machine instance to ensure it has an IPv6 address:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vmi <vmi-name> -o jsonpath="{.status.interfaces[*].ipAddresses}"
