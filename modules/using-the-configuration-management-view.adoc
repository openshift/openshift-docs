= Using the Configuration Management view

[role="_abstract"]
To open the *Configuration Management* view, select *Configuration Management* from the navigation menu.
Similar to the *Dashboard*, it displays some useful widgets.

These widgets are interactive and show the following information:

* Security policy violations by severity
* The state of CIS (Center for Information Security) Docker and Kubernetes  benchmark controls
* Users with administrator rights in the most clusters
* Secrets used most widely in your clusters

The header in the *Configuration Management* view shows you the number of policies and CIS controls in your cluster.
[NOTE]
====
Only policies in the Deploy life cycle phase are included in the policy count and policy list view.
====

The header includes drop-down menus that allow you to switch between entities.
For example, you can:

* Click *Policies* to view all policies and their severity, or select *CIS Controls* to view detailed information about all controls.
* Click *Application and Infrastructure* and select clusters, namespaces, nodes, deployments, images, and secrets to view detailed information.
* Click *RBAC Visibility and Configuration* and select users and groups, service accounts, and roles to view detailed information.
