= {title} when creating a VM from a template

ifdef::static-key[]
You can add a statically managed public SSH key when you create a virtual machine (VM) by using the {product-title} web console. The key is added to the VM as a cloud-init data source at first boot. This method does not affect cloud-init user data.

Optional: You can add a key to a project. Afterwards, this key is added automatically to VMs that you create in the project.
endif::[]
ifdef::dynamic-key[]
You can enable dynamic public SSH key injection when you create a virtual machine (VM) from a template by using the {product-title} web console. Then, you can update the key at runtime.

[NOTE]
====
Only {op-system-base-full} 9 supports dynamic key injection.
====

The key is added to the VM by the QEMU guest agent, which is installed with {op-system-base} 9.
