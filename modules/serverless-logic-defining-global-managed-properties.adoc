= Defining global-managed-properties

You can define custom global managed properties for all workflows in a specific namespace by editing the `SonataFlowPlatform` resource. These properties are defined under the `.spec.properties.flow` attribute and are automatically applied to every workflow service in the same namespace.

.Prerequisites 

* You have {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} installed on your cluster.
* You have created your {ServerlessLogicProductName} project. 
* You have access to a {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Locate the `SonataFlowPlatform` resource in the same namespace as your workflow services. 
+
This is where you will define global managed properties.

. Open the `SonataFlowPlatform` resource in your default editor by executing the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit sonataflowplatform sonataflow-platform-example
----

. Define custom global managed properties.
+
In the editor, navigate to the `spec.properties.flow` section and define your desired properties as shown in the following example:

.Example of a SonataFlowPlatform with flow properties

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform-example
spec:
    properties:
        flow: <1>
         - name: quarkus.log.category <2>
           value: INFO <3>
----
+
<1> Attribute to define a list of custom global managed properties.
<2> The property key.
<3> The property value to apply globally.
+
This configuration adds the `quarkus.log.category=INFO` property to the managed properties of every workflow service in the namespace.

. Optional: Use external `ConfigMaps` or `Secrets`.
+
You can also reference values from existing `ConfigMap` or `Secret` resources using the `valueFrom` attribute as shown in the following example:

+
.Example of a SonataFlowPlatform properties from ConfigMap and Secret

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform-example
spec:
    properties:
        flow:
         - name: my.petstore.auth.token
           valueFrom: <1>
                secretKeyRef: petstore-credentials <2>
                    keyName: AUTH_TOKEN
         - name: my.petstore.url
           valueFrom:
                configMapRef: petstore-props <3>
                    keyName: PETSTORE_URL
----

+
<1> The `valueFrom` attribute is derived from the Kubernetes `EnvVar` API and works similarly to how environment variables reference external sources.
<2> `valueFrom.secretKeyRef` pulls the value from a key named `AUTH_TOKEN` in the `petstore-credentials` secret.
<3> `valueFrom.configMapRef` pulls the value from a key named `PETSTORE_URL` in the `petstore-props` ConfigMap.
