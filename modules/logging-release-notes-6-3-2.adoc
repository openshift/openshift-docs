== New features and enhancements

* This release adds an alert to notify administrators of deprecated features that will be removed in future releases. As a result, you can make adjustments as needed. 
+
Additionally, this release provides changes to log collector deployments to promote Technology Preview configuration options introduced in link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7196[LOG-7196] to General Availability.
The change enables caching of kube API server calls and introduces a `ClusterLogForwarder` field to tune collector rollout strategy.
Administrators managing clusters with large numbers of nodes can now modify the collector upgrade behavior so that the collector requests do not overwhelm the Kubernetes API server. You can control the behavior by setting the `MaxUnavailable` field for collectors during upgrade.

[id="logging-release-notes-6-3-2-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the `clusterLogForwarder` API did not validate the URL scheme for Kafka outputs.
This could cause users to configure a Kafka output with an invalid URL that was missing the required `tcp://` or `tls://` prefix, leading to a silent failure that prevented log forwarding.
With this update, the API includes new validation rules.
The clusterLogForwarder now rejects configurations with a Kafka URL that does not have a tcp or tls scheme, preventing the misconfiguration and ensuring logs can be forwarded successfully.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7386[LOG-7386])

* Before this fix, Vector could not recover from silently closed TCP connections.
With this update, Vector uses `keepalive` probes to detect and automatically re-establish unresponsive TCP connections. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7751[LOG-7751])

* Before this update, the {ocp-product-title} web console incorrectly highlighted info-level log messages containing the `error` keyword as errors.
With this update, the web console no longer highlights info-level logs containing the `error` keyword as errors.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7777[LOG-7777])

* Before this update, the prune filter failed to remove the `.openshift.sequence` field from the log record.
With this update, the field is correctly pruned from the log record.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7805[LOG-7805])

* Before this update, the prune filter failed to remove the `.kubernetes.container_iostream` field from the log record.
With this update, the field is now correctly pruned from the log record.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7806[LOG-7806])

*  Before this update, any request that exceeded a Kafka broker's `message.max.size` value would be rejected because the collector's tuning did not correctly set an allowable producer configuration.
With this update, you can set the collector's kafka client configuration to allow message sizes that are equal to or smaller than the `MaxSize` value.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7811[LOG-7811])

* Before this update, buffer corruption following an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) event caused deserialization errors that blocked log forwarding and reduced {LoggingProductName} resilience.
This update improves the recovery logic for corrupted buffer files and prevents log forwarding issues after OOM events.
The collector now successfully recovers from OOM events and subsequent buffer corruption, ensuring continuous log forwarding.
