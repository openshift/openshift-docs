= Understanding how to use sigstore to verify container signatures

You can configure the container runtime to verify image integrity by using the sigstore signing methodology. Configuring {microshift-short} container runtimes enables the verification of image integrity. With the sigstore project, developers can digitally sign what they build, creating a safer chain of custody that traces software back to the source. Administrators can then verify signatures and monitor workflows at scale. By using sigstore, you can store signatures in the same registry as the build images.

* For user-specific images, you must update the configuration file to point to the appropriate public key, or disable signature verification for those image sources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For disconnected or offline configurations, you must embed the public key contents into the operating system image.
