= Viewing logs in the Kiali console

You can view logs for your workloads in the Kiali console.  The *Workload Detail* page includes a *Logs* tab which displays a unified logs view that displays both application and proxy logs. You can select how often you want the log display in Kiali to be refreshed.

To change the logging level on the logs displayed in Kiali, you change the logging configuration for the workload or the proxy.

// TODO once released - Kiali can also add-in trace span information to help identify important traces based on associated logging. More powerful features include substring or regex Show/Hide, full-screen, and the ability to set proxy log level without a pod restart.
