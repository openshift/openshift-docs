= Limitations of {external-secrets-operator}

The following are the limitations of {external-secrets-operator} during the installation and uninstallation of the `external-secrets` application.

* Uninstalling the {external-secrets-operator} does not delete the resources created for `external-secrets` application. you must clean up the resources manually.
* When you add `cert-manager` Operator configurations in `externalsecrets.operator.openshift.io` object after creation, delete the `external-secrets-cert-controller` deployment resource manually to prevent degradation of the `external-secrets` application.
* Enable the `BitwardenSecretManagerProvider` field in `externalsecrets.operator.openshift.io` object only when installed on OpenShift Cluster running on x86_64 and arm64 architectures .
* Ensure `cert-manager` Operator is installed and operational before deploying the {external-secrets-operator} for seamless functioning. If you install the `cert-manager` Operator later, manually restart the `external-secrets-operator` pod to apply cert-manager configurations in `externalsecrets.operator.openshift.io` object.
