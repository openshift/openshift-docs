[id="lvms-unsupported-devices_{context}"]
= Devices not supported by {lvms}

When you are adding the device paths in the `deviceSelector` field of the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR), ensure that the devices are supported by {lvms}. If you add paths to the unsupported devices, {lvms} excludes the devices to avoid complexity in managing logical volumes.

If you do not specify any device path in the `deviceSelector` field, {lvms} adds only the unused devices that it supports. 

[NOTE]
====
To get information about the devices, run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ lsblk --paths --json -o \
NAME,ROTA,TYPE,SIZE,MODEL,VENDOR,RO,STATE,KNAME,SERIAL,PARTLABEL,FSTYPE
----
====

{lvms} does not support the following devices:

Read-only devices:: Devices with the `ro` parameter set to `true`.

Suspended devices:: Devices with the `state` parameter set to `suspended`.

ROM devices:: Devices with the `type` parameter set to `rom`.

LVM partition devices:: Devices with the `type` parameter set to `lvm`. 

Devices with invalid partition labels:: Devices with the `partlabel` parameter set to `bios`, `boot`, or `reserved`.

Devices with an invalid filesystem:: Devices with the `fstype` parameter set to any value other than `null` or `LVM2_member`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
{lvms} supports devices with `fstype` parameter set to `LVM2_member` only if the devices do not contain children devices.
====

Devices that are part of another volume group:: To get the information about the volume groups of the device, run the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ pvs <device-name> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<device-name>` with the device name.

Devices with bind mounts:: To get the mount points of a device, run the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ cat /proc/1/mountinfo | grep <device-name> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<device-name>` with the device name.

Devices that contain children devices::

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to wipe the device before using it in {lvms} to prevent unexpected behavior.
