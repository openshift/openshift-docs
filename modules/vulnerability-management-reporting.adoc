= Reporting vulnerabilities to teams

[role="_abstract"]

As organizations must constantly reassess and report on their vulnerabilities, some organizations find it helpful to have scheduled communications to key stakeholders to help in the vulnerability management process.

You can use {product-title} to schedule these reoccurring communications through e-mail. These communications should be scoped to the most relevant information that the key stakeholders need.

For sending these communications, you must consider the following questions:

* What schedule would have the most impact when communicating with the stakeholders?
* Who is the audience?
* Should you only send specific severity vulnerabilities in your report?
* Should you only send fixable vulnerabilities in your report?
