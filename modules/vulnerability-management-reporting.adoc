As organizations must constantly re-assess and report on their vulnerabilites some organizations find it helpful to have scheduled communications to key stakeholers to help in the vulnerability management proccess.

You can use {product-title} to schedule these re-occuring communications through e-mail. These communications should be scoped to the most relevant information needed by that key stakeholder. 

Organizations sending these communications must answer the following questions:

* What schedule would have the most impact when communicating with these stakeholders?
* Who is the audience?
* Do I want to send only specific severity vulnerabilities in my report to reduce noise?
* Do I want to send only fixable vulnerabilities so my stakeholders can more easily take action?

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Vulnerability Management* -> *Reporting*.
. Select *Create Report* 
. Input a name for your report under *Report Name*
