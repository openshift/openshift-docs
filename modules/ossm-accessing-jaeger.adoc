The deployment process creates a route to access the Jaeger console.

.Procedure
. Log in to the {Product-title} console.

. Navigate to *Networking* -> *Routes* and
search for the Jaeger route, which is the URL listed under *Location*.

. To query for details of the route using the command line, enter the following command. In this example, `istio-system` is the {SMProductShortName} control plane namespace.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export JAEGER_URL=$(oc get route -n istio-system jaeger -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----
+
. Launch a browser and navigate to ``\https://<JAEGER_URL>``, where `<JAEGER_URL>` is the route that you discovered in the previous step.

. Log in using the same user name and password that you use to access the {Product-title} console.

. If you have added services to the service mesh and have generated traces, you can use the filters and *Find Traces* button to search your trace data.
+
If you are validating the console installation, there is no data to display until you start collecting traces.
