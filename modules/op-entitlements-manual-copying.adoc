= Using Red Hat entitlements by manually copying the etc-pki-entitlement secret

You can copy the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret from the `openshift-config-managed` namespace into the namespace of your pipeline. You can then configure your pipeline to use this secret for the Buildah task.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the `jq` package on your system. This package is available in {op-system-base-full}.

.Procedure

. Copy the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret from the `openshift-config-managed` namespace into the namespace of your pipeline by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secret etc-pki-entitlement -n openshift-config-managed -o json | \
  jq 'del(.metadata.resourceVersion)' | jq 'del(.metadata.creationTimestamp)' | \
  jq 'del(.metadata.uid)' | jq 'del(.metadata.namespace)' | \
  oc -n <pipeline_namespace> create -f - <1>
----
<1> Replace `<pipeline_namespace>` with the namespace of your pipeline.

. In your Buildah task definition, use the `buildah` task provided in the `openshift-pipelines` namespace or a copy of this task and define the `rhel-entitlement` workspace, as shown in the following example.

. In your task run or pipeline run that runs the Buildah task, assign the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret to the `rhel-entitlement` workspace, as in the following example.
