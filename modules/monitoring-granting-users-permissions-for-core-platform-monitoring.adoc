= Granting users permissions for core platform monitoring

As a cluster administrator, you can monitor all core {product-title} and user-defined projects.

You can also grant developers and other users different permissions for core platform monitoring. You can grant the permissions by assigning one of the following monitoring roles or cluster roles:

|===
|Name |Description |Project

|`cluster-monitoring-metrics-api` 
|Users with this role have the ability to access Thanos Querier API endpoints. Additionally, it grants access to the core platform Prometheus API and user-defined Thanos Ruler API endpoints.
|`openshift-monitoring`

|`cluster-monitoring-operator-alert-customization`

|`openshift-monitoring`

|`monitoring-alertmanager-edit` 
|Users with this role can manage the Alertmanager API for core platform monitoring. They can also manage alert silences in the {product-title} web console.
