= Secured cluster services

Secured cluster services contain the following components:

* Sensor
* Admission controller
* Collector

[id="default-requirements-secured-cluster-services-sensor_{context}"]
== Sensor

Sensor monitors your Kubernetes and {ocp} clusters. These services currently deploy in a single deployment, which handles interactions with the Kubernetes API and coordinates with Collector.

[discrete]
== Memory and CPU requirements

The following table lists the minimum memory and storage values required to install and run sensor on secured clusters.

|===
| Sensor | CPU | Memory

| *Request*
| 2 cores
| 4 GiB

| *Limit*
| 4 cores
| 8 GiB
|===

[id="default-requirements-secured-cluster-services-admission-controller_{context}"]
== Admission controller

The Admission controller prevents users from creating workloads that violate policies you configure.

[discrete]
== Memory and CPU requirements

By default, the admission control service runs 3 replicas. The following table lists the request and limits for each replica.

|===
| Admission controller | CPU | Memory

| *Request*
| 0.05 cores
| 100 MiB

| *Limit*
| 0.5 cores
| 500 MiB
|===

[id="default-requirements-secured-cluster-services-collector_{context}"]
== Collector

Collector monitors runtime activity on each node in your secured clusters. It connects to Sensor to report this information. The collector pod has three containers. The first container is collector, which actually monitors and reports the runtime activity on the node. The other two are compliance and node-inventory.

[discrete]
== Memory and CPU requirements

By default, the admission control service runs 3 replicas. The following table lists the request and limits for each replica.

|===
| Collector | | CPU | Memory
