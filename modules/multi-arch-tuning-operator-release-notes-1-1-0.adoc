== New features and enhancements

* The Multiarch Tuning Operator is now supported on managed offerings, including ROSA with Hosted Control Planes (HCP) and other HCP environments.

* With this release, you can configure architecture-aware workload scheduling by using the new `plugins` field in the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object. You can use the `plugins.nodeAffinityScoring` field to set architecture preferences for pod placement. If you enable the `nodeAffinityScoring` plugin, the scheduler first filters out nodes that do not meet the pod requirements. Then, the scheduler prioritizes the remaining nodes based on the architecture scores defined in the `nodeAffinityScoring.platforms` field.

== Bug fixes

* With this release, the Multiarch Tuning Operator does not update the `nodeAffinity` field for pods that are managed by a daemon set. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45885[*OCPBUGS-45885*])
