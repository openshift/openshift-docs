[id="olmv1-forcing-an-update-or-rollback_{context}"]
= Forcing an update or rollback

{olmv1} does not support automatic updates to the next major version or rollbacks to an earlier version. If you want to perform a major version update or rollback, you must verify and force the update manually.

[WARNING]
====
You must verify the consequences of forcing a manual update or rollback. Failure to verify a forced update or rollback might have catastrophic consequences such as data loss.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have a catalog installed.
* You have an Operator or extension installed.
* You have created a service account and assigned enough role-based access controls (RBAC) to install, update, and manage the extension you want to install. For more information, see _Creating a service account_.

.Procedure

. Edit the custom resource (CR) of your Operator or extension as shown in the following example:
+
.Example CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1
  kind: ClusterExtension
  metadata:
    name: <clusterextension_name>
  spec:
    namespace: <installed_namespace> <1>
    serviceAccount:
      name: <service_account_installer_name> <2>
    source:
      sourceType: Catalog
      catalog:
        packageName: <package_name>
        channels:
          - <channel_name> <3>
        version: <version_or_version_range> <4>
        upgradeConstraintPolicy: SelfCertified <5>
----
<1> Specifies the namespace where you want the bundle installed, such as `pipelines` or `my-extension`. Extensions are still cluster-scoped and might contain resources that are installed in different namespaces.
<2> Specifies the name of the service account you created to install, update, and manage your extension.
<3> Optional: Specifies channel names as an array, such as `pipelines-1.14` or `latest`.
<4> Optional: Specifies the version or version range, such as `1.14.0`, `1.14.x`, or `>=1.16`, of the package you want to install or update. For more information, see "Example custom resources (CRs) that specify a target version" and "Support for version ranges".
<5> Optional: Specifies the upgrade constraint policy. To force an update or rollback, set the field to `SelfCertified`. If unspecified, the default setting is `CatalogProvided`. The `CatalogProvided` setting only updates if the new version satisfies the upgrade constraints set by the package author.

. Apply the changes to your Operator or extensions CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <extension_name>.yaml
