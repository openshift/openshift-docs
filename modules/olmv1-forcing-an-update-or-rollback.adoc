= Forcing an update or rollback

{olmv1} does not support automatic updates to the next major version or rollbacks to an earlier version. If you want to perform a major version update or rollback, you must verify and force the update manually.

[WARNING]
====
You must verify the consequences of forcing a manual update or rollback. Failure to verify a forced update or rollback might have catastrophic consequences such as data loss.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have a catalog installed.
* You have an Operator or extension installed.
* You have created a service account and assigned enough role-based access controls (RBAC) to install, update, and manage the extension you want to install. For more information, see _Creating a service account_.
