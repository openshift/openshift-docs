= Creating the cluster

To create the {product-title} cluster, you wait for the bootstrap process to
complete on the machines that you provisoned by using the
Ignition config files that you generated with the installation program.

.Prerequisites

* Create the required infrastructure for the cluster.
* You obtained the installation program and generated the Ignition config files
for your cluster.
* You used the Ignition config files to create {op-system} machines for your
cluster.
* Your machines have direct internet access.

.Procedure

. Monitor the bootstrap process:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install --dir=<installation_directory> wait-for bootstrap-complete \ <1>
    --log-level debug <2>

INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the Kubernetes API at https://api.test.example.com:6443...
INFO API v1.14.6+c4799753c up
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the bootstrap-complete event...
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.
<2> Optionally, include the `--log-level debug` option to view installation details.
+
The command succeeds when the Kubernetes API server signals that it has been
bootstrapped on the control plane machines.

. After bootstrap process is complete, remove the bootstrap machine from the
load balancer.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must remove the bootstrap machine from the load balancer at this point. You
can also remove or reformat the machine itself.
