= Configuring the AWS account

Set up your AWS account to prepare AWS EFS for use by {product-title}.

.Procedure

. Log in to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2[AWS EC2 Console].
. Select the region that matches the cluster region.
. Filter only worker EC2 instances, and select an instance. Note the VPC ID and security group ID. These values are required later in the process.
. Click the *Security* tab, and click the Security Group Name.
. From the *Actions* dropdown menu, click *Edit Inbound Rules*. Scroll to the bottom, and click *Add Rule*.
. Add an NFS rule that allows NFS traffic from the VPC private CIDR.
. Open the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/[Amazon EFS page]. To create the EFS, click *Create file system*.
. Click *Customize* and proceed through the wizard.
.. In `Step 2:`, configure the network access:
... Click the VPC of the cluster that you noted previously.
... Ensure that the private subnets are selected.
... Select the Security Group Name that you noted previously for the EC2 worker instances.
... Click *Next*.
.. In `Step 3:`, configure the client access:
... Click *Add access point*.
... Enter a unique Path such as `/access_point_1`.
... Configure the Owner fields with ownership or permissions that allow write access for your worker pods. For example, if your worker pods run with group ID `100`, you can set that ID as your `Owner Group ID` and ensure the permissions include `g+rwx`.
. Continue through the wizard steps, and click *Create File System*.
. After the file system is created:
.. Note the file system ID for later use.
.. Click *Manage client access* and note the access point ID.

You can add more NFS rules, using steps 5-10, to create separate shared data stores. In each case, make note of the corresponding file system ID and access point ID.
