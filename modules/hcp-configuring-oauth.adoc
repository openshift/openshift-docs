= Configuring the internal OAuth server for a hosted cluster

You can configure the internal OAuth server for your hosted cluster by using an OpenID Connect identity provider. Adding any identity provider in the OAuth configuration removes the default `kubeadmin` user provider.

.Prerequisites

* You created your hosted cluster.

.Procedure

. Edit the `HostedCluster` custom resource (CR) on the hosting cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit <hosted_cluster_name> -n <hosted_cluster_namespace>
----

. Add the OAuth configuration in the `HostedCluster` CR by using the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: HostedCluster
metadata:
  name: <hosted_cluster_name> <1>
  namespace: <hosted_cluster_namespace> <2>
spec:
  configuration:
    oauth:
      identityProviders:
      - openID: <3>
          claims:
            email: <4>
              - <email_address>
            name: <5>
              - <display_name>
            preferredUsername:
              - <preferred_username> <6>
          clientID: <client_id> <7>
          clientSecret:
            name: <client_id_secret_name> <8>
          issuer: https://example.com/identity <9>
        mappingMethod: lookup <10>
        name: IAM
        type: OpenID
----
<1> Specifies your hosted cluster name.
<2> Specifies your hosted cluster namespace.

<4> Defines a list of attributes to use as the email address.
<5> Defines a list of attributes to use as a display name.
<6> Defines a list of attributes to use as a preferred user name.
<7> Defines the ID of a client registered with the OpenID provider. You must allow the client to redirect to the `\https://oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster_name>.<cluster_domain>/oauth2callback/<idp_provider_name>` URL.
<8> Defines a secret of a client registered with the OpenID provider.
<9> The link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IssuerIdentifier[Issuer Identifier] described in the OpenID spec. You must use `https` without query or fragment component.
