= Configuring the OAuth server for a hosted cluster by using the CLI

You can configure the internal OAuth server for your hosted cluster by using an OpenID Connect identity provider (`oidc`).

You can configure OAuth for the following supported identity providers:

* `oidc`
* `htpasswd`
* `keystone`
* `ldap`
* `basic-authentication`
* `request-header`
* `github`
* `gitlab`
* `google`

Adding any identity provider in the OAuth configuration removes the default `kubeadmin` user provider.

.Prerequisites

* You created your hosted cluster.

.Procedure

. Edit the `HostedCluster` custom resource (CR) on the hosting cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit <hosted_cluster_name> -n <hosted_cluster_namespace>
----

. Add the OAuth configuration in the `HostedCluster` CR by using the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: HostedCluster
metadata:
  name: <hosted_cluster_name> <1>
  namespace: <hosted_cluster_namespace> <2>

      identityProviders:
      - openID: <3>
          claims:
            email: <4>
              - <email_address>
            name: <5>
              - <display_name>
            preferredUsername: <6>
              - <preferred_username>
          clientID: <client_id> <7>
          clientSecret:
            name: <client_id_secret_name> <8>
          issuer: https://example.com/identity <9>
        mappingMethod: lookup <10>
        name: IAM
        type: OpenID
----
<1> Specifies your hosted cluster name.
<2> Specifies your hosted cluster namespace.
<3> This provider name is prefixed to the value of the identity claim to form an identity name. The provider name is also used to build the redirect URL.
<4> Defines a list of attributes to use as the email address.
<5> Defines a list of attributes to use as a display name.
<6> Defines a list of attributes to use as a preferred user name.
<7> Defines the ID of a client registered with the OpenID provider. You must allow the client to redirect to the `\https://oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster_name>.<cluster_domain>/oauth2callback/<idp_provider_name>` URL.
<8> Defines a secret of a client registered with the OpenID provider.
<9> The link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IssuerIdentifier[Issuer Identifier] described in the OpenID spec. You must use `https` without query or fragment component.
<10> Defines a mapping method that controls how mappings are established between identities of this provider and `User` objects.
