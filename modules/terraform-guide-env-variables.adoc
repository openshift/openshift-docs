+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export <1> = <2>
VARIABLE_NAME="VARIABLE_VALUE"

Your variable name and value can be any string. For example, if you want to consistently refer to your cluster's name, you run the following commad:
+
.Example input
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTER_NAME="rosa-cluster"
----

. Confirm the environment variable by running the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo $<variable_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo $CLUSTER_NAME
$ rosa-cluster
