= Validation lifecycle

Preflight validation attempts to validate every module loaded in the cluster. Preflight will stop running validation on a `Module` resource after the validation is successful. In case module validation has failed, you can change the module definitions and Preflight will try to validate the module again in the next loop.

If you want to run Preflight validation for an additional kernel, then you should create another `PreflightValidationOCP` resource for that kernel. After all the modules have been validated, it is recommended to delete the `PreflightValidationOCP` resource.
