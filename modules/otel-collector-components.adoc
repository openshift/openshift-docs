[id="memorylimiter-processor_{context}"]
=== Memory Limiter processor

The Memory Limiter processor periodically checks the Collector's memory usage and pauses data processing when the soft memory limit is reached. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs. The preceding component, which is typically a receiver, is expected to retry sending the same data and may apply a backpressure to the incoming data. When memory usage exceeds the hard limit, the Memory Limiter processor forces garbage collection to run.

|20% of `limit_mib`

|limit_percentage
|Same as the `limit_mib` but expressed as a percentage of the total available memory. The `limit_mib` setting takes precedence over this setting.
|`0`

|spike_limit_percentage
|Same as the `spike_limit_mib` but expressed as a percentage of the total available memory. Intended to be used with the `limit_percentage` setting.
|`0`

[id="resource-detection-processor_{context}"]
=== Resource Detection processor

The Resource Detection processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

The Resource Detection processor identifies host resource details in alignment with OpenTelemetry's resource semantic standards. Using the detected information, it can add or replace the resource values in telemetry data. This processor supports traces, metrics, and can be used with multiple detectors such as the Docket metadata detector or the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable detector.

[id="attributes-processor_{context}"]
=== Attributes processor

The Attributes processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

The Attributes processor can modify attributes of a span, log, or metric. You can configure this processor to filter and match input data and include or exclude such data for specific actions.

The processor operates on a list of actions, executing them in the order specified in the configuration. The following actions are supported:

Insert:: Inserts a new attribute into the input data when the specified key does not already exist.

Update:: Updates an attribute in the input data if the key already exists.

Upsert:: Combines the insert and update actions: Inserts a new attribute if the key does not exist yet. Updates the attribute if the key already exists.

Delete:: Removes an attribute from the input data.

Hash:: Hashes an existing attribute value as SHA1.

Extract:: Extracts values by using a regular expression rule from the input key to the target keys defined in the rule. If a target key already exists, it will be overridden similarly to the Span processor's `to_attributes` setting with the existing attribute as the source.

Convert:: Converts an existing attribute to a specified type.

[id="resource-processor_{context}"]
=== Resource processor

The Resource processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

----
  config: |
    processor:
      attributes:

Attributes represent the actions that are applied to the resource attributes, such as delete the attribute, insert the attribute, or upsert the attribute.

[id="span-processor_{context}"]
=== Span processor

The Span processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

The Span processor modifies the span name based on its attributes or extracts the span attributes from the span name. It can also change the span status. It can also include or exclude spans. This processor supports traces.

Span renaming requires specifying attributes for the new name by using the `from_attributes` configuration.

.OpenTelemetry Collector using the Span processor for renaming a span
[source,yaml]
----
  config: |
    processor:
      span:

          separator: <value> # <2>
----
<1> Defines the keys to form the new span name.
<2> An optional separator.

You can use the processor to extract attributes from the span name.

              - ^\/api\/v1\/document\/(?P<documentId>.*)\/update$ # <1>
----
<1> This rule defines how the extraction is to be executed. You can define more rules: for example, in this case, if the regular expression matches the name, a `documentID` attibute is created. In this example, if the input span name is `/api/v1/document/12345678/update`, this results in the `/api/v1/document/{documentId}/update` output span name, and a new `"documentId"="12345678"` attribute is added to the span.

You can have the span status modified.

[id="kubernetes-attributes-processor_{context}"]
=== Kubernetes Attributes processor

The Kubernetes Attributes processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

The Kubernetes Attributes processor enables automatic configuration of spans, metrics, and log resource attributes by using the Kubernetes metadata.
This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.
This processor automatically identifies the Kubernetes resources, extracts the metadata from them, and incorporates this extracted metadata as resource attributes into relevant spans, metrics, and logs. It utilizes the Kubernetes API to discover all pods operating within a cluster, maintaining records of their IP addresses, pod UIDs, and other relevant metadata.

[id="filter-processor_{context}"]
=== Filter processor

The Filter processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

The Filter processor leverages the OpenTelemetry Transformation Language to establish criteria for discarding telemetry data. If any of these conditions are satisfied, the telemetry data are discarded. The conditions can be combined by using the logical OR operator. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.

----
<1> Defines the error mode. When set to `ignore`, ignores errors returned by conditions. When set to `propagate`, returns the error up the pipeline. An error causes the payload to be dropped from the Collector.
<2> Filters the spans that have the `container.name == app_container_1` attribute.
<3> Filters the spans that have the `host.name == localhost` resource attribute.

[id="routing-processor_{context}"]
=== Routing processor

The Routing processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

The Routing processor routes logs, metrics, or traces to specific exporters. This processor can read a header from an incoming HTTP request (gRPC or plain HTTP) or can read a resource attribute, and then directs the trace information to relevant exporters according to the read value.

----
<1> The HTTP header name for the lookup value when performing the route.
<2> The default exporter when the attribute value is not present in the table in the next section.
<3> The table that defines which values are to be routed to which exporters.

You can optionally create an `attribute_source` configuratiion, which defines where to look for the attribute in `from_attribute`. The allowed value is `context` to search the context, which includes the HTTP headers, or `resource` to search the resource attributes.
