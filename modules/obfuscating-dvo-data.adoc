= Obfuscating Deployment Validation Operator data

By default, when you install the Deployment Validation Operator (DVO), the name and unique identifier (UID) of a resource are included in the data that is captured and processed by the Insights Operator for {product-title}. 
If you are a cluster administrator, you can configure the Insights Operator to obfuscate data from the Deployment Validation Operator (DVO).
For example, you can obfuscate workload names in the archive file that is then sent to Red{nbsp}Hat.

To obfuscate the name of resources, you must manually set the `obfuscation` attribute in the `insights-config` `ConfigMap` object to include the `workload_names` value, as outlined in the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console with the "cluster-admin" role.
* The *insights-config* `ConfigMap` object exists in the `openshift-insights` namespace.
* The cluster is self managed and the Deployment Validation Operator is installed.

.Procedure

. Go to *Workloads* -> *ConfigMaps* and select *Project: openshift-insights*.
. Click the `insights-config` `ConfigMap` object to open it.
. Click *Actions* and select *Edit ConfigMap*.
. Click the *YAML view* radio button.
. In the file, set the `obfuscation` attribute with the `workload_names` value.
