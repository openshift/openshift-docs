= Obfuscating Deployment Validation Operator data

[role="_abstract"]
By default, when you install the Deployment Validation Operator (DVO), the name and unique identifier (UID) of a resource are included in the data that is captured and processed by the {insights-operator} for {product-title}. 
If you are a cluster administrator, you can configure the {insights-operator} to obfuscate data from the Deployment Validation Operator (DVO).
For example, you can obfuscate workload names in the archive file that is then sent to Red{nbsp}Hat.

To obfuscate the name of resources, you must manually set the `obfuscation` attribute in the `insights-config` `ConfigMap` object to include the `workload_names` value, as outlined in the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console with the "cluster-admin" role.
* The *insights-config* `ConfigMap` object exists in the `openshift-insights` namespace.
* The cluster is self managed and the Deployment Validation Operator is installed.

.Procedure

. Go to *Workloads* -> *ConfigMaps* and select *Project: openshift-insights*.
. Click the `insights-config` `ConfigMap` object to open it.
. Click *Actions* and select *Edit ConfigMap*.
. Click the *YAML view* radio button.
. In the file, set the `obfuscation` attribute with the `workload_names` value.
