= Obfuscating Deployment Validation Operator data

Cluster administrators can configure the Insight Operator to obfuscate data from the Deployment Validation Operator (DVO), if the Operator is installed. When the `workload_names` value is added to the *insights-config* `ConfigMap` object, workload names—rather than UIDs—are displayed in Insights for Openshift, making them more recognizable for cluster administrators. 

.Prerequisites

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console with the "cluster-admin" role.
* The *insights-config* `ConfigMap` object exists in the `openshift-insights` namespace.
* The cluster is self managed and the Deployment Validation Operator is installed.

.Procedure

. Go to *Workloads* -> *ConfigMaps* and select *Project: openshift-insights*.
. Click on the *insights-config* `ConfigMap` object to open it.
. Click *Actions* and select *Edit ConfigMap*.
. Click the *YAML view* radio button.
. In the file, set the `obfuscation` attribute with the `workload_names` value.
