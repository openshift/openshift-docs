= Overview of installing and deploying clusters with GitOps ZTP pipeline

Custom resources (CRs) that are deployed through the GitOps ZTP pipeline support two goals:

. Deploying additional Operators to spoke clusters that are required by typical RAN DU applications running at the network far-edge.
. Customizing the {product-title} installation to provide a high performance platform capable of meeting the strict timing requirements in a minimal CPU budget.

Installing and deploying the clusters is a two stage process, as shown here:

If you require cluster configuration changes that cannot be deployed to clusters with the GitOps ZTP pipeline, there are two options:

Apply the additional configuration after the ZTP pipeline is complete::

When the GitOps ZTP pipeline deployment is complete, the deployed cluster is ready for application workloads. At this point, you can install additional Operators and apply configurations specific to your requirements. Ensure that additional configurations do not negatively affect the performance of the platform or allocated CPU budget.

Add content to the ZTP library::

The base source CRs that you deploy with the GitOps ZTP pipline can be augmented with custom content as required.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Providing additional source CRs or modifying existing source CRs can significantly impact the performance or CPU profile of {product-title}.
