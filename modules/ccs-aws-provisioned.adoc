[id="ccs-aws-provisioned_{context}"]
= Provisioned AWS Infrastructure

[role="_abstract"]
This is an overview of the provisioned Amazon Web Services (AWS) components on a deployed {product-title} cluster. For a more detailed listing of all provisioned AWS components, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/[{OCP} documentation].

[id="aws-policy-ec2_{context}"]
== AWS Elastic Computing (EC2) instances

AWS EC2 instances are required to deploy the control plane and data plane functions of {product-title} in the AWS public cloud. Instance types might vary for control plane and infrastructure nodes depending on worker node count.

* Single availability zone
** 3 m5.2xlarge minimum (control plane nodes)
** 2 r5.xlarge minimum (infrastructure nodes)
** 2 m5.xlarge minimum but highly variable (worker nodes)

* Multiple availability zones
** 3 m5.2xlarge minimum (control plane nodes)
** 3 r5.xlarge minimum (infrastructure nodes)
** 3 m5.xlarge minimum but highly variable (worker nodes)

[id="aws-policy-ebs-storage_{context}"]
== AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) storage

Amazon EBS block storage is used for both local node storage and persistent volume storage.

Volume requirements for each EC2 instance:

- Control plane volumes
* Size: 350 GB
* Type: io1
* Input/output operations per second: 1000

- Infrastructure volumes
* Size: 300 GB
* Type: gp2
* Input/output operations per second: 900

- Worker volumes
* Size: 300 GB
* Type: gp2
* Input/output operations per second: 900

[id="aws-policy-elastic-load-balancers_{context}"]
== Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancers

Up to two Network Load Balancers for API and up to two Classic Load Balancers for application router. For more information, see the link:https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/features/#Details_for_Elastic_Load_Balancing_Products[ELB documentation for AWS].

[id="aws-policy-s3-storage_{context}"]
== S3 storage
The image registry and Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume snapshots are backed by AWS S3 storage. Pruning of resources is performed regularly to optimize S3 usage and cluster performance.

[NOTE]
====
Two buckets are required with a typical size of 2 TB each.
====

[id="aws-policy-vpc_{context}"]
== VPC
Customers should expect to see one VPC per cluster. Additionally, the VPC needs the following configurations:

include::snippets/snip_install-cluster-in-vpc.adoc[]

* *Subnets*: Two subnets for a cluster with a single availability zone, or six subnets for a cluster with multiple availability zones.
+
[NOTE]
====
A *public subnet* connects directly to the internet through an internet gateway. A *private subnet* connects to the internet through a network address translation (NAT) gateway.
====
+
* *Route tables*: One route table per private subnet, and one additional table per cluster.

* *Internet gateways*: One Internet Gateway per cluster.

* *NAT gateways*: One NAT Gateway per public subnet.

[id="aws-policy-security-groups_{context}"]
== Security groups

AWS security groups provide security at the protocol and port-access level; they are associated with EC2 instances and Elastic Load Balancing. Each security group contains a set of rules that filter traffic coming in and out of an EC2 instance. You must ensure the ports required for the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-user-infra.html#installation-aws-user-infra-other-infrastructure_installing-aws-user-infra[{OCP} installation] are open on your network and configured to allow access between hosts.

[id="osd-security-groups-custom_{context}"]
== Additional custom security groups
When you create a cluster by using a non-managed VPC, you can add custom security groups during cluster creation. Custom security groups are subject to the following limitations:

* You must create the custom security groups in AWS before you create the cluster. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html[Amazon EC2 security groups for Linux instances].
* You must associate the custom security groups with the VPC that the cluster will be installed into. Your custom security groups cannot be associated with another VPC.
* You might need to request additional quota for your VPC if you are adding additional custom security groups. For information on requesting an AWS quota increase, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html[Requesting a quota increase].
