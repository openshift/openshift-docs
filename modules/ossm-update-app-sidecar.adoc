= Updating your application pods

If you selected the Automatic Approval Strategy when you were installing your Operators, then the Operators update the control plane automatically but not your applications. Existing applications continue to be part of the mesh and function accordingly. The application administrator must restart applications to upgrade the sidecar.

If your deployment uses automatic sidecar injection, you can update the pod template in the deployment by adding or modifying an annotation. Run the following command to redeploy the pods:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch deployment/<deployment> -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"kubectl.kubernetes.io/restartedAt": "'`date -Iseconds`'"}}}}}'
----

If your deployment does not use automatic sidecar injection, you must manually update the sidecars by modifying the sidecar container image specified in the deployment or pod.
