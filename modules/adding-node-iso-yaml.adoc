[id="adding-node-iso-yaml_{context}"]
= Adding one or more nodes using a configuration file

You can add one or more nodes to your cluster by using the `nodes-config.yaml` file to specify configurations for the new nodes.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)
* You have an active connection to your target cluster
* You have a kubeconfig file available

.Procedure

. Create a new YAML file that contains configurations for the nodes you are adding and is named `nodes-config.yaml`. You must provide a MAC address for each new node.
+
In the following example file, two new workers are described with an initial static network configuration:

. Generate the ISO image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm node-image create nodes-config.yaml
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
In order for the `create` command to fetch a release image that matches the target cluster version, you must specify a valid pull secret.
You can specify the pull secret either by using the `--registry-config` flag or by setting the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable beforehand.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If the directory of the `nodes-config.yaml` file is not specified by using the `--dir` flag, the tool looks for the file in the current directory.
====

. Verify that a new `node.<arch>.iso` file is present in the asset directory.
The asset directory is your current directory, unless you specified a different one when creating the ISO image.

. Boot the selected node with the generated ISO image.

. Track progress of the node creation by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm node-image monitor <ip_addresses>
----
+
where:

`<ip_addresses>`:: Specifies a list of the IP addresses of the nodes that are being added.
+
[NOTE]
====
If reverse DNS entries are not available for your node, the `oc adm node-image monitor` command skips checks for pending certificate signing requests (CSRs).
If these checks are skipped, you must manually check for CSRs by running the `oc get csr` command.
====

. Approve the CSRs by running the following command for each CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
