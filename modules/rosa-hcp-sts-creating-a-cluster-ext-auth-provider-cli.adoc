= Creating an external authentication provider
:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: emacs
:icons: font
 
After you have created a {hcp-title} cluster with external authentication providers, you must create a provider using the ROSA CLI.

[NOTE]
====
Similar to the `rosa create|delete|list idp[s]` command in the ROSA CLI, you cannot edit an existing identity provider that you created using `rosa create external-auth-provider`. Instead, you must delete the external authentication provider and create a new one.
====

The following table shows the possible CLI flags you can use when creating your external authentication provider:

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===

|CLI Flag
|Description

|`--cluster` 
|The name or the ID of your cluster.

|`--name`
|A name that is used to refer to the external authentication provider.

|`--console-client-secret`
|This string is the client secret that is used to associate your account with the application. If you do not include the client secret, this command uses a public OIDC OAuthClient.

|`--issuer-audiences` 
|This is a comma-separated list of token audiences.

|`--issuer-url`
|The URL of the token issuer.

|`--claim-mapping-username-claim` 
|The name of the claim that should be used to construct user names for the cluster identity.

|`--claim-mapping-groups-claim`
|The name of the claim that should be used to construct group names for the cluster identity.

.Procedure

* To use the interactive command interface, run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create external-auth-provider -c <cluster_name>
----
+
.Example output
--
[source,terminal]
----
I: Enabling interactive mode
? Name: <1>
? Issuer audiences: <2>
? The serving url of the token issuer: <3>
? CA file path (optional): <4>
? Claim mapping username: <5>
? Claim mapping groups: <6>
? Claim validation rule (optional): <7>
? Console client id (optional): <8>
----
<1> The name of your external authentication provider. This name should be a lower-case with numbers and dashes.
<2> The audience IDs that this authentication provider issues tokens for.
<3> The issuer's URL that serves the token.
<4> Optional: The certificate file to use when making requests.
<5> The name of the claim that is used to construct the user names for cluster identity, such as using `email`.
<6> The method with which to transform the ID token into a cluster identity, such as using `groups`.
<7> Optional: The rules that help validate token claims which authenticate your users. This field should be formatted as `:<required_value>`.
<8> Optional: The application or client ID that your app registration uses for the console.

* You can include the required IDs to create your external authentication provider with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
rosa create external-auth-provider --cluster=<cluster_id> \
    --name=<provider_name> --issuer-url=<issuing_url> \
    --issuer-audiences=<audience_id> \ 
    --claim-mapping-username-claim=email \ 
    --claim-mapping-groups-claim=groups \
    --console-client-id=<client_id_for_app_registration> \
    --console-client-secret=<client_secret>
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
I: Successfully created an external authentication provider for cluster '<cluster_id>'
----

.Verification 

* View the external authentication configuration on your cluster by running the following commands:
+ 
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list external-auth-provider -c <cluster_name> 
----  
+
.Example output
+
The following example shows a configured Microsoft Entra ID external authentication provider:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME        ISSUER URL
m-entra-id  https://login.microsoftonline.com/<group_id>/v2.0
----

* Display the external authentication configuration on a specified cluster by using the following command:
+ 
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe external-auth-provider \
    -c <cluster_name> --name <name_of_external_authentication>
----  
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
