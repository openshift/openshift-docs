= {microshift-short} networking components and services
This brief overview describes networking components and their operation in {microshift-short}. The `microshift-networking` RPM is a package that automatically pulls in any networking-related dependencies and systemd services to initialize networking, for example, the `microshift-ovs-init` systemd service.

NetworkManager::
NetworkManager is required to set up the initial gateway bridge on the {microshift-short} node. The NetworkManager and `NetworkManager-ovs` RPM packages are installed as dependencies to the `microshift-networking` RPM package, which contains the necessary configuration files. NetworkManager in {microshift-short} uses the `keyfile` plugin and is restarted after installation of the `microshift-networking` RPM package.

microshift-ovs-init::
The `microshift-ovs-init.service` is installed by the `microshift-networking` RPM package as a dependent systemd service to `microshift.service`. It is responsible for setting up the OVS gateway bridge.

OVN containers::
Two OVN-Kubernetes daemon sets are rendered and applied by {microshift-short}.

* *ovnkube-master*
Includes the `northd`, `nbdb`, `sbdb` and `ovnkube-master` containers.

* *ovnkube-node*
The ovnkube-node includes the OVN-Controller container.
+
After {microshift-short} starts, the OVN-Kubernetes daemon sets are deployed in the `openshift-ovn-kubernetes` namespace.

Packaging::
OVN-Kubernetes manifests and startup logic are built into {microshift-short}. The systemd services and configurations included in the `microshift-networking` RPM are:

* `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/microshift-nm.conf` for `NetworkManager.service`
* `/etc/systemd/system/ovs-vswitchd.service.d/microshift-cpuaffinity.conf` for `ovs-vswitchd.service`
* `/etc/systemd/system/ovsdb-server.service.d/microshift-cpuaffinity.conf` for `ovs-server.service`
* `/usr/bin/configure-ovs-microshift.sh` for `microshift-ovs-init.service`
* `/usr/bin/configure-ovs.sh` for `microshift-ovs-init.service`
* `/etc/crio/crio.conf.d/microshift-ovn.conf` for the CRI-O service
