[NOTE]
====
If you have already installed the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator as part of OpenShift
Logging, you do not need to install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator again. The
Jaeger Operator will create the Elasticsearch instance using the installed OpenShift
Elasticsearch Operator.
====

. On the *Install Operator* page, select installation options.
.. For the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator, in the *Update Channel* section, select *stable-5.x*. The Elasticsearch installation requires the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace for the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. The other Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh operators are installed in the `openshift-operators` namespace.
.. For the Jaeger, Kiali, and {ProductName} Operators, accept the defaults.
+
The Jaeger, Kiali and {ProductName} are installed in the `openshift-operators` namespace. The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator is installed in the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace.

. Click *Install*. Wait until the Operator has installed before repeating the steps for the next Operator in the list.

. After all you have installed all four Operators, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* to verify that your Operators installed.
