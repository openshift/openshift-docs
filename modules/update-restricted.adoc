= Updating the disconnected cluster

Update the disconnected cluster to the {product-title} version that you downloaded the release images for.

//TODO: Add xrefs in the following note when functionality is enabled.

[NOTE]
====
If you have a local OpenShift Update Service, you can update by using the connected web console or CLI instructions instead of this procedure.
====

.Prerequisites

* You mirrored the images for the new release to your registry.
* You applied the release image signature ConfigMap for the new release to your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The release image signature config map allows the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) to ensure the integrity of release images by verifying that the actual image signatures match the expected signatures.
====
* You obtained the sha256 digest for your targeted release image.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You paused all `MachineHealthCheck` resources.

.Procedure

* Update the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --allow-explicit-upgrade --to-image ${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}@<digest> <1>
----
<1> The `<digest>` value is the sha256 digest for the targeted release image, for example, `sha256:81154f5c03294534e1eaf0319bef7a601134f891689ccede5d705ef659aa8c92`
+
If you use an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` for the mirror registry, you can use the canonical registry name instead of `LOCAL_REGISTRY`.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can only configure global pull secrets for clusters that have an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object. You cannot add a pull secret to a project.
