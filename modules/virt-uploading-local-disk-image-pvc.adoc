= Uploading a local disk image to a new PersistentVolumeClaim

You can use the `virtctl` CLI utility to upload a virtual machine disk image from
a client machine to your cluster. Uploading the disk image creates a
PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that you can associate with a virtual machine.

.Prerequisites

* You must have one of the following:
** A raw virtual machine image file in either ISO or IMG format.
** A virtual machine image file in QCOW2 format.

* For best results, compress your image file according to the following guidelines before you upload it:
** Compress a raw image file by using `xz` or `gzip`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Using a compressed raw image file results in the most efficient upload.
====
** Compress a QCOW2 image file by using the method that is recommended for your client:
*** If you use a Linux client, _sparsify_ the QCOW2 file by using the
link:https://libguestfs.org/virt-sparsify.1.html[virt-sparsify] tool.
*** If you use a Windows client, compress the QCOW2 file by using `xz` or `gzip`.

* The `kubevirt-virtctl` package must be installed on the client machine.

* The client machine must be configured to trust the {product-title} router's
certificate.

.Procedure

. Identify the following items:
* File location of the VM disk image you want to upload.
* Name and size required for the resulting PVC.

. Run the `virtctl image-upload` command to upload your VM image.
You must specify the PVC name, PVC size, and file location. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl image-upload --pvc-name=<upload-fedora-pvc> --pvc-size=<2Gi> --image-path=</images/fedora.qcow2>
----
+
[WARNING]
====
To allow insecure server connections when using HTTPS, use the `--insecure`
parameter. Be aware that when you use the `--insecure` flag, the authenticity of
the upload endpoint is *not* verified.
====

. To verify that the PVC was created, view all PVC objects:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pvc
----
