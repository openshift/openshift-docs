[id="virt-uploading-local-disk-image-pvc_{context}"]
= Uploading a local disk image to a new PersistentVolumeClaim

You can use the `virtctl` CLI utility to upload a virtual machine disk image from
a client machine to your cluster. Uploading the disk image creates a
PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that you can associate with a virtual machine.

.Prerequisites

* A virtual machine disk image, in RAW, ISO, or QCOW2 format, optionally
compressed by using `xz` or `gz`.
* The `kubevirt-virtctl` package must be installed on the client machine.
* The client machine must be configured to trust the {product-title} router's
certificate.

.Procedure

. Identify the following items:
* File location of the VM disk image you want to upload
* Name and size required for the resulting PVC

. Run the `virtctl image-upload` command to upload your VM image.
You must specify the PVC name, PVC size, and file location. For example:
+
----
$ virtctl image-upload --pvc-name=<upload-fedora-pvc> --pvc-size=<2Gi> --image-path=</images/fedora.qcow2>
----
+
[CAUTION]
====
To allow insecure server connections when using HTTPS, use the `--insecure`
parameter. Be aware that when you use the `--insecure` flag, the authenticity of
the upload endpoint is *not* verified.
====

. To verify that the PVC was created, view all PVC objects:
+
----
$ oc get pvc
----
