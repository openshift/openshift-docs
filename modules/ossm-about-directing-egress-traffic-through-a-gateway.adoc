= About directing egress traffic through a gateway

You can configure a gateway installed through gateway injection as an exit point for traffic leaving the service mesh, and it acts as a forward proxy for requests sent to services external to the mesh.

Egress gateway:: An egress gateway is configured as an exit point for traffic leaving the service mesh, acting as a forward proxy for requests sent to external services. You can configure an egress gateway to fulfill security requirements:

* Traffic Restrictions: In environments with strict traffic restrictions, an egress gateway ensures all outbound traffic flows through a dedicated set of nodes.

* Network Policy Enforcement: When network policies prevent application nodes from directly accessing external services, the egress gateway handles the external access.

+
In these scenarios, gateway proxies are deployed on dedicated egress nodes capable of accessing external services. These nodes can then be subjected to strict network policy enforcement or additional monitoring to enhance security.

Configure egress traffic:: You can configure a gateway installed through gateway injection to direct the egress traffic by combining the following {istio} resources:

* Use the `ServiceEntry` resource to define the properties of an external service. The external service is added to the {istio} service registry for the mesh, which enables you to apply {istio} features, such as monitoring and routing rules, to the traffic exiting the mesh that is destined for an external service.

* Use the `Gateway`, `VirtualService`, and `DestinationRule` resources to set up rules that route traffic from the mesh to the external service using the gateway proxy.

Egress routing in ambient mode:: If your deployment uses ambient mode, you must configure egress routing using the {k8s} Gateway API instead of {istio} `Gateway` and `VirtualService` resources. The {k8s} Gateway API provides a standardized, {k8s}-native method for defining how traffic exits the mesh and reaches external services.
+
You can use `Gateway` and `HTTPRoute` (or `GRPCRoute`) resources to control how mesh traffic is routed to destinations outside the cluster. The Gateway API is fully supported in ambient mode and can also be used with sidecar-based deployments, providing a consistent configuration model for both ingress and egress routing.
