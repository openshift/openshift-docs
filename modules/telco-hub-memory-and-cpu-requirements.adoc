= Hub cluster memory and CPU requirements

The memory and CPU requirements of the hub cluster vary depending on the configuration of the hub cluster, the number of resources on the cluster and the number of managed clusters.

Limits and requirements::
* Ensure that underlying memory and CPU requirements for {product-title} and {rh-rhacm} are met.

Engineering considerations::

--
* Before deploying a Telco hub cluster, ensure that your cluster host meets cluster requirements.

* Specific details about required CPUs and memory for hub clusters that manage a fleet of clusters at scale are described in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.12/html/install/installing#sizing-your-cluster[Sizing your cluster].
Refer to "Hub cluster engineering considerations" for additional details about scaling the number of managed clusters.
