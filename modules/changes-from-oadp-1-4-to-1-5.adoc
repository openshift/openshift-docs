= Changes from OADP 1.4 to 1.5

[role="_abstract"]
The Velero server has been updated from version 1.14 to 1.16.

This changes the following:

Version Support changes::
{oadp-full} implements a streamlined version support policy. Red{nbsp}Hat supports only one version of {oadp-first} on one {OCP-short} version to ensure better stability and maintainability. {oadp-short} 1.5.0 is only supported on {OCP-short} 4.19 version.

OADP Self-Service::
{oadp-short} 1.5.0 introduces a new feature named {oadp-short} Self-Service, enabling namespace admin users to back up and restore applications on the {product-title}.
In the earlier versions of {oadp-short}, you needed the cluster-admin role to perform {oadp-short} operations such as backing up and restoring an application, creating a backup storage location, and so on.
+
From {oadp-short} 1.5.0 onward, you do not need the cluster-admin role to perform the backup and restore operations. You can use {oadp-short} with the namespace admin role. The namespace admin role has administrator access only to the namespace the user is assigned to.
You can use the Self-Service feature only after the cluster administrator installs the {oadp-short} Operator and provides the necessary permissions.

`backupPVC` and `restorePVC` configurations::
A `backupPVC` resource is an intermediate persistent volume claim (PVC) to access data during the data movement backup operation. You create a `readonly` backup PVC by using the `nodeAgent.backupPVC` section of the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) custom resource.
+
A `restorePVC` resource is an intermediate PVC that is used to write data during the Data Mover restore operation.
+
You can configure `restorePVC` in the DPA by using the `ignoreDelayBinding` field.
