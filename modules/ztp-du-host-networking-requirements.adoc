= Distributed unit host networking requirements

The following tables provide a high level overview of the networking information and custom resources required by {rh-rhacm-first} to provision a DU bare-metal host:

.Required `AgentClusterInstall` networking fields
[cols="2,4", width="90%", options="header"]
|====
|Field
|Description

|`clusterNetwork`
| Used to allocate an IPv4 or IPv6 IP address to each node. Ensure there is no overlap with `serviceNetwork`.

|`serviceNetwork`
| Block of IPv4 or IPv6 IP addresses used for cluster services internal communication in {product-title}.  Ensure there is no overlap with `clusterNetwork`.

|`machineNetwork`
| Represents the network range for external communication. Also used to determine the API and Ingress VIP addresses for provisioning the cluster.
|====

[NOTE]
====
Do not specify API and Ingress VIP addresses for DU single node clusters. Instead, when the host is provisioned by the assisted installer service, the `machineNetwork` field in the `AgentClusterInstall` CR is used to determine the API and Ingress VIP addresses.
====

.Required `ClusterDeployment` networking fields
[cols="2,4", width="90%", options="header"]
|====
|Field
|Description

|`baseDomain`
|Base domain for the hub cluster managing the individual DU single node clusters.

|`sshPrivateKeySecretRef`
|SSH private key for secure transactions with the single node cluster DU.

|`pullSecretRef`
|Pull secret for secure installation on the DU host.
|====

.Required `BareMetalHost` networking fields
[cols="2,4", width="90%", options="header"]
|====
|Field
|Description

|`bmc`
|BMC address and BMC username and password credentials.

|`bootMACAddress`
|Boot MAC address for the bare-metal host.

|`bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/hostname`
|Optional: Configures the cluster hostname. If this field is not used, a hostname is allocated by the cluster DHCP server.

|`spec.bmc.address`
|Location of the installation ISO.

|`spec.bmc.credentialsName`
|Name of the `bmcCredentials` secret used to access the ISO image.

|`userData.bootkey`
|Reference to the `Secret` containing the user data to be passed to the host before it boots from the ISO image.

|====

.Required `InfraEnv` networking fields
[cols="2,4", width="90%", options="header"]
|====
|Field
|Description

|`additionalNTPSources`
|IP address for a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. NTP is required to ensure that the certificates are installed correctly on the DU host. The NTP server is only required during provisioning.

|`pullSecretRef`
|Name of the pull secret created for the DU host.

|====

.Required `NMStateConfig` networking fields
[cols="2,4", width="90%", options="header"]
|====
|Field
|Description

|`dns-resolver`
|Target cluster DNS server.

|`interfaces`
|Configures `eno1` for IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity.

|`Routes`
|Configures the default route for the target cluster.

|`mac-address`
|Target bare-metal host MAC address. Must match the MAC address specified in the `BareMetalHost` custom resource (CR).

|`ip-address`
|Target bare-metal host static IP address.

|`public-network-prefix`
|Bare-metal host static IP address subnet.

|`gateway`
|Target bare-metal host gateway.

|`Interfaces`
|Target bare-metal host interface name and MAC address.
|====

[NOTE]
====
`NMStateConfig` is an optional resource. Use `NMStateConfig` to configure network bonding for a pair of NICs, use a concrete VLAN, or to declare a static IP for the DU host. Each `NMState` profile has a one-to-one relationship with a related `InfraEnv` ISO profile used for installing {product-title} on the host. If used, the `NMStateConfig` resource must be created before the `ClusterDeployment` resource. The `NMStateConfig` resource is not required if DHCP is enabled for the cluster network.
