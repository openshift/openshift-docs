= Runtime enforcement 

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure policies that are enforced during runtime to terminate a pod that violates the policy or, in the case of audit log inspection, notify you of events that violate the policy but have already occurred and have been logged.

When enforced, a policy violation results in one or more of the following actions:

* Shutting down an offending pod, which results in creation of another healthy pod in its place
* {product-title-short} intercepting and preventing certain Kubernetes API calls 

[IMPORTANT]
====
When a violation is triggered by an image or workload rule, a violation alert is generated, but the pod is _not_ disrupted.
====
//is the above true? I thought the pod was terminated if enforcement is configured.
