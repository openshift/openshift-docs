= Deleting workflows with the gitops profile

[role="_abstract"]
Before upgrading the Operator, you must delete workflows running with the `gitops` profile. When the upgrade is complete, you must rebuild the corresponding workflow image using the new {ServerlessLogicProductName} 1.37.0 serverless workflow builder image and you must redeploy the workflow using the new image.

.Procedure

. If you are using persistence, back up the workflow database and ensure the backup includes both database objects and table data.

. Ensure you have a backup of all necessary Kubernetes resources, including `SonataFlow` custom resources (CRs), `ConfigMap` resources, or any other related custom configurations.

. Delete the workflow by executing the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f <workflow.yaml> -n <target_namespace>
