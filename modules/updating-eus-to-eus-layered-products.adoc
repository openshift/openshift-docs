= EUS-to-EUS update for layered products and Operators installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager

In addition to the EUS-to-EUS update steps mentioned for the web console and CLI, there are additional steps to consider when performing EUS-to-EUS updates for clusters with the following:

* Layered products
* Operators installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

.What is a layered product?

Layered products refer to products that are made of multiple underlying products that are intended to be used together and cannot be broken into individual subscriptions. For examples of layered {product-title} products, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift/#layered[Layered Offering On OpenShift].

As you perform an EUS-to-EUS update for the clusters of layered products and those of Operators that have been installed through OLM, you must complete the following:

. Ensure that all of your Operators previously installed through OLM are updated to their latest version in their latest channel. Updating the Operators ensures that they have a valid update path when the default OperatorHub catalogs switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster update. For information on how to update your Operators, see "Preparing for an Operator update" in "Additional resources".

. Confirm the cluster version compatibility between the current and intended Operator versions. You can verify which versions your OLM Operators are compatible with by using the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocpouic/?operator=logging&&ocp_versions=4.10,4.11,4.12[Red Hat {product-title} Operator Update Information Checker].

As an example, here are the steps to perform an EUS-to-EUS update from <4.y> to <4.y+2> for OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF). This can be done through the CLI or web console. For information on how to update clusters through your desired interface, see _EUS-to-EUS update using the web console_ and "EUS-to-EUS update using the CLI" in "Additional resources".

.Example workflow
. Pause the worker machine pools.
. Update OpenShift <4.y> -> OpenShift <4.y+1>.
. Update ODF <4.y> -> ODF <4.y+1>.
. Update OpenShift <4.y+1> -> OpenShift <4.y+2>.
. Update to ODF <4.y+2>.
. Unpause the worker machine pools.

[NOTE]
====
The update to ODF <4.y+2> can happen before or after worker machine pools have been unpaused.
