= Applying Multiple Control Plane Updates for layered products and Operators installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager

In addition to the Applying Multiple Control Plane Updates steps mentioned for the web console and CLI, there are additional steps to consider when Applying Multiple Control Plane Updates for clusters with the following:

* Layered products
* Operators installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

.What is a layered product?

Layered products refer to products that are made of multiple underlying products that are intended to be used together and cannot be broken into individual subscriptions. For examples of layered {product-title} products, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift/#layered[Layered Offering On OpenShift].

As you apply Multiple Control Plane Updates on clusters with layered products and those of Operators that have been installed through OLM, you must complete the following:

. You have updated all Operators previously installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to a version that is compatible with your target release. Updating the Operators ensures they have a valid update path when the default OperatorHub catalogs switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster update. See "Updating installed Operators" in the "Additional resources" section for more information on how to check compatibility and, if necessary, update the installed Operators.

. Confirm the cluster version compatibility between the current and intended Operator versions. You can verify which versions your OLM Operators are compatible with by using the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocpouic/?operator=logging&&ocp_versions=4.10,4.11,4.12[Red{nbsp}Hat {product-title} Operator Update Information Checker].

As an example, here are the steps to apply multiple Control Plane updates from <4.y> to <4.y+2> for OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF). This can be done through the CLI or web console. For information on how to update clusters through your desired interface, see _Applying Multiple Control Plane Updates using the web console_ and "Applying Multiple Control Plane Updates using the CLI" in "Additional resources".

.Example workflow
. Pause the worker machine pools.
. Update OpenShift <4.y> -> OpenShift <4.y+1>.
. Update ODF <4.y> -> ODF <4.y+1>.
. Update OpenShift <4.y+1> -> OpenShift <4.y+2>.
. Update to ODF <4.y+2>.
. Unpause the worker machine pools.

[NOTE]
====
The update to ODF <4.y+2> can happen before or after worker machine pools have been unpaused.
