[id="lvms-reusing-vg-from-prev-installation_{context}"]
= Reusing a volume group from the previous LVM Storage installation

You can reuse an existing volume group (VG) from the previous {lvms} installation instead of creating a new VG.

You can only reuse a VG but not the logical volume associated with the VG.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can perform this procedure only while creating an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR).
====

.Prerequisites

* The VG that you want to reuse must not be corrupted.
* The VG that you want to reuse must have the `lvms` tag. For more information on adding tags to LVM objects, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_and_managing_logical_volumes/grouping-lvm-objects-with-tags_configuring-and-managing-logical-volumes#doc-wrapper[Grouping LVM objects with tags].

.Procedure

. Open the `LVMCluster` CR YAML file.

. Configure the `LVMCluster` CR parameters as described in the following example:

.Example `LVMCluster` CR YAML file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lvm.topolvm.io/v1alpha1
kind: LVMCluster
metadata:
  name: my-lvmcluster
spec:
# ...
  storage:
    deviceClasses:
    - name: vg1  <1>
      fstype: ext4 <2>
      default: true
      deviceSelector: <3>
# ...
        forceWipeDevicesAndDestroyAllData: false <4>
      thinPoolConfig: <5>
# ...
      nodeSelector: <6>
# ...
----
<1> Set this field to the name of a VG from the previous {lvms} installation.
<2> Set this field to `ext4` or `xfs`. By default, this field is set to `xfs`.
<3> You can add new devices to the VG that you want to reuse by specifying the new device paths in the `deviceSelector` field. If you do not want to add new devices to the VG, ensure that the `deviceSelector` configuration in the current {lvms} installation is same as that of the previous {lvms} installation.
<4> If this field is set to `true`, {lvms} wipes all the data on the devices that are added to the VG.
<5> To retain the `thinPoolConfig` configuration of the VG that you want to reuse, ensure that the `thinPoolConfig` configuration in the current {lvms} installation is same as that of the previous {lvms} installation. Otherwise, you can configure the `thinPoolConfig` field as required. 
<6> Configure the requirements to choose the nodes on which you want to create the LVM volume group. If this field is empty, all nodes without no-schedule taints are considered.

. Save the `LVMCluster` CR YAML file.

[NOTE]
====
To view the devices that are part a volume group, run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ pvs -S vgname=<vg_name> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<vg_name>` with the name of the volume group.
