Use the following procedure to prepare the MicroShift executable runtime. 

[NOTE]
====
When working with MicroShift based on a pre-release minor version `Y` of {OCP}, the corresponding RPM repository `rhocp-4.$Y-for-rhel-8-$ARCH-rpms` will not be available yet. As a workaround, use the `Y-1` version.
