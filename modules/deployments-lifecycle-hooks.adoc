= Lifecycle hooks

The Rolling and Recreate strategies support _lifecycle hooks_, or deployment
hooks, which allow behavior to be injected into the deployment process at
predefined points within the strategy:

.Example `pre` lifecycle hook
[source,yaml]
----
pre:
  failurePolicy: Abort
  execNewPod: {} <1>
----
<1> `execNewPod` is a pod-based lifecycle hook.

Every hook has a `failurePolicy`, which defines the action the strategy should
take when a hook failure is encountered:

[cols="2,8"]
|===

.^|`Abort`
|The deployment process will be considered a failure if the hook fails.

.^|`Retry`
|The hook execution should be retried until it succeeds.

.^|`Ignore`
|Any hook failure should be ignored and the deployment should proceed.
|===

Hooks have a type-specific field that describes how to execute the hook.
Currently, pod-based hooks are the only supported hook type, specified by the
`execNewPod` field.

==== Pod-based lifecycle hook

Pod-based lifecycle hooks execute hook code in a new pod derived from the
template in a DeploymentConfig.

The following simplified example DeploymentConfig uses the Rolling strategy.
Triggers and some other minor details are omitted for brevity:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: DeploymentConfig
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: helloworld
          image: openshift/origin-ruby-sample
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    name: frontend
  strategy:
    type: Rolling
    rollingParams:
      pre:
        failurePolicy: Abort
        execNewPod:
          containerName: helloworld <1>
          command: [ "/usr/bin/command", "arg1", "arg2" ] <2>
          env: <3>
            - name: CUSTOM_VAR1
              value: custom_value1
          volumes:
            - data <4>
----
<1> The `helloworld` name refers to `spec.template.spec.containers[0].name`.
<2> This `command` overrides any `ENTRYPOINT` defined by the `openshift/origin-ruby-sample` image.
<3> `env` is an optional set of environment variables for the hook container.
<4> `volumes` is an optional set of volume references for the hook container.

In this example, the `pre` hook will be executed in a new pod using the
`openshift/origin-ruby-sample` image from the `helloworld` container. The hook
pod has the following properties:

* The hook command is `/usr/bin/command arg1 arg2`.
* The hook container has the `CUSTOM_VAR1=custom_value1` environment variable.
* The hook failure policy is `Abort`, meaning the deployment process fails if the hook fails.
* The hook pod inherits the `data` volume from the DeploymentConfig pod.

== Setting lifecycle hooks

You can set lifecycle hooks, or deployment hooks, for a DeploymentConfig using
the CLI.

.Procedure

. Use the `oc set deployment-hook` command to set the type of hook you want:
`--pre`, `--mid`, or `--post`. For example, to set a pre-deployment hook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set deployment-hook dc/frontend \
    --pre -c helloworld -e CUSTOM_VAR1=custom_value1 \
    --volumes data --failure-policy=abort -- /usr/bin/command arg1 arg2
----
