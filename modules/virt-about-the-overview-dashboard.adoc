= About the {product-title} dashboards page

The {product-title} dashboard consists of the following cards:

* *Details* provides a brief overview of informational cluster details.
+
Status include *ok*, *error*, *warning*, *in progress*, and *unknown*. Resources can add custom status names.
+
** Cluster ID
** Provider
** Version
* *Cluster Inventory* details number of resources and associated statuses. It is helpful when intervention is required to resolve problems, including information about:
** Number of nodes
** Number of Pods
** Persistent storage volume claims
ifdef::virt-cluster[]
** Virtual machines (available if {VirtProductName} is installed)
endif::virt-cluster[]
** Bare metal hosts in the cluster, listed according to their state (only available in *metal3* environment).
ifdef::virt-cluster[]
* *Cluster Health* summarizes the current health of the cluster as a whole, including relevant alerts and descriptions. If {VirtProductName} is installed, the overall health of {VirtProductName} is diagnosed as well. If more than one subsystem is present, click *See All* to view the status of each subsystem.
endif::virt-cluster[]
* *Cluster Capacity* charts help administrators understand when additional resources are required in the cluster. The charts contain an inner ring that displays current consumption, while an outer ring displays thresholds configured for the resource, including information about:
** CPU time
** Memory allocation
** Storage consumed
** Network resources consumed
* *Cluster Utilization* shows the capacity of various resources over a specified period of time, to help administrators understand the scale and frequency of high resource consumption.
* *Events* lists messages related to recent activity in the cluster, such as Pod creation or virtual machine migration to another host.
* *Top Consumers* helps administrators understand how cluster resources are consumed. Click on a resource to jump to a detailed page listing Pods and nodes that consume the largest amount of the specified cluster resource (CPU, memory, or storage).
