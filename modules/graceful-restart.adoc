= Restarting the cluster

You can restart your cluster after it has been shut down gracefully.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* This procedure assumes that you gracefully shut down the cluster.

.Procedure

. Power on any cluster dependencies, such as external storage or an LDAP server.

. Start all cluster machines.
+
Use the appropriate method for your cloud environment to start the machines, for example, from your cloud provider's web console.
+
Wait approximately 10 minutes before continuing to check the status of control plane nodes.

. Verify that all control plane nodes are ready.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master
----

The control plane nodes are ready if the status is `Ready`, as shown in the following output:

----
NAME                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION

. If the control plane nodes are _not_ ready, then check whether there are any pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) that must be approved.

.. Get the list of current CSRs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csr
----

.. Review the details of a CSR to verify that it is valid:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe csr <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

.. Approve each valid CSR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
----

. After the control plane nodes are ready, verify that all worker nodes are ready.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
----
+
The worker nodes are ready if the status is `Ready`, as shown in the following output:

.. Check that there are no degraded cluster Operators.

----
$ oc get clusteroperators

Check that there are no cluster Operators with the `DEGRADED` condition set to `True`.

If the cluster did not start properly, you might need to restore your cluster using an etcd backup.
