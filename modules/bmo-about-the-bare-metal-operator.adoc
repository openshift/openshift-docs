= About the Bare Metal Operator

Use the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) to provision, manage, and inspect bare-metal hosts in your cluster. 
 
The BMO uses the following resources to complete these tasks: 

* `BareMetalHost`
* `HostFirmwareSettings`
* `FirmwareSchema`
* `HostFirmwareComponents`

The BMO maintains an inventory of the physical hosts in the cluster by mapping each bare-metal host to an instance of the `BareMetalHost` custom resource definition. Each `BareMetalHost` resource features hardware, software, and firmware details. The BMO continually inspects the bare-metal hosts in the cluster to ensure each `BareMetalHost` resource accurately details the components of the corresponding host. 

The BMO also uses the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource, the `FirmwareSchema` resource, and the `HostFirmwareComponents` resource to detail firmware specifications and upgrade or downgrade firmware for the bare-metal host. 

The BMO interfaces with bare-metal hosts in the cluster by using the Ironic API service. The Ironic service uses the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) on the host to interface with the machine. 

Some common tasks you can complete by using the BMO include the following:

* Provision bare-metal hosts to the cluster with a specific image
* Format a host's disk contents before provisioning or after deprovisioning
* Turn on or off a host
* Change firmware settings
* View the host's hardware details
* Upgrade or downgrade a host's firmware to a specific version
