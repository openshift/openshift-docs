= Creating the example alert


To trigger an alert as a starting point to use in the troubleshooting UI panel, you can deploy a container that is deliberately misconfigured.

.Procedure

. Use the following YAML, either from the command line or in the web console, to create a broken deployment in a system namespace:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: bad-deployment
  namespace: default <1>
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bad-deployment
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: bad-deployment
    spec:
      containers: <2>
      - name: bad-deployment
        image: quay.io/openshift-logging/vector:5.8
----
<1> The deployment must be in a system namespace (such as `default`) to cause the desired alerts.
<2> This container deliberately tries to start a `vector` server with no configuration file. The server logs a few messages, and then exits with an error. Alternatively, you can deploy any container you like that is badly configured, causing it to trigger an alert.

. View the alerts:
.. Go to *Observe* -> *Alerting* and click *clear all filters*. View the `Pending` alerts.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Alerts first appear in the `Pending` state. They do not start `Firing` until the container has been crashing for some time. By viewing `Pending` alerts, you do not have to wait as long to see them occur.
====
.. Choose one of the `KubeContainerWaiting`, `KubePodCrashLooping`, or `KubePodNotReady` alerts and open the troubleshooting panel by clicking on the link. Alternatively, if the panel is already open, click the "Focus" button to update the graph.
