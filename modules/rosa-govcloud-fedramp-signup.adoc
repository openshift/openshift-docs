** _Customer managed Identity Provider (IdP), integrated via OpenID Connect (OIDC)_, where you will also need to provide the following:

*** *Email Domain(s):* A list of approved email domains. Only users with an email address from one of these domains will be allowed to log in.
*** *Essential Claim:* A specific key-value pair (e.g., _"rh-approved": "true"_) that must be present in a user's token from the IdP to grant them access.

In this configuration the customer takes on the responsibility for implementing FIPS 140-2 validated MFA.
