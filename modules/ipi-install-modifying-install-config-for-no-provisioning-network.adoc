[id='modifying-install-config-for-no-provisioning-network_{context}']

= Modifying the `install-config.yaml` file for no `provisioning` network (optional)

To deploy an {product-title} cluster without a `provisioning` network, make the following changes to the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
platform:
  baremetal:
    apiVIP: <api_VIP>
    ingressVIP: <ingress_VIP>
    provisioningNetwork: "Disabled" <1>
----

<1> Add the `provisioningNetwork` configuration setting, if needed, and set it to `Disabled`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `provisioning` network is required for PXE booting. If you deploy without a `provisioning` network, you must use a virtual media BMC addressing option such as `redfish-virtualmedia` or `idrac-virtualmedia`. See "Redfish virtual media for HPE iLO" in the "BMC addressing for HPE iLO" section or "Redfish virtual media for Dell iDRAC" in the "BMC addressing for Dell iDRAC" section for additional details.
