= Sharing secrets across namespaces

When you need the same `Secret` object in multiple namespaces, duplicating it manually can cause errors. By using a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR), you can securely share a `Secret` object across different namespaces within a cluster by referencing a single source of data. This also ensures that only authorized namespaces have access to the `Secret` object.
