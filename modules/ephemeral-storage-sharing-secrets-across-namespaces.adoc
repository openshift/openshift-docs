= Sharing secrets across namespaces

[role="_abstract"]
To share a secret across namespaces in a cluster, you create a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) instance for the `Secret` object that you want to share.

.Prerequisites

You must have permission to perform the following actions:

* Create instances of the `sharedsecrets.sharedresource.openshift.io` custom resource definition (CRD) at a cluster-scoped level.
* Create a ClusterRole for the SharedConfigMap.
* Create a Role and RoleBinding for the Shared Resource CSI Driver itself.
* Manage roles and role bindings across the namespaces in the cluster to control which users can get, list, and watch those instances.
* Manage roles and role bindings to control whether the service account specified by a pod can mount a Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume that references the `Secret` or `Configmap` CR instance you want to use.
* Access the namespaces that contain the secrets you want to share.

.Procedure

* Create a `Secret` or `Configmap` CR instance to share across the source namespace.
