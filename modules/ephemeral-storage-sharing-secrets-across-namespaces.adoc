= Sharing secrets across namespaces

[role="_abstract"]
To share a secret across namespaces in a cluster, you create a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) instance for the `Secret` object that you want to share.

.Prerequisites

You must have permission to perform the following actions:

* Create instances of the `sharedsecrets.sharedresource.openshift.io` custom resource definition (CRD) at a cluster-scoped level.
* Manage roles and role bindings across the namespaces in the cluster to control which users can get, list, and watch those instances.
* Manage roles and role bindings to control whether the service account specified by a pod can mount a Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume that references the `SharedSecret` CR instance you want to use.
* Access the namespaces that contain the Secrets you want to share.

.Procedure

* Create a `SharedSecret` CR instance for the `Secret` object you want to share across namespaces in the cluster:
