= Sharing a Secret object across namespaces

[role="_abstract"] 

A `Secret` object is used to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. You can use a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) to securely share a `Secret` object across different namespaces within a cluster without duplicating it manually. Sharing the `Secret` object provides a single source for sensitive data and ensures that authorized namespaces have access to it.
