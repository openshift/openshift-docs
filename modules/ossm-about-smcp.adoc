= About ServiceMeshControlPlane

The control plane includes Istiod, Ingress and Egress Gateways, and other components, such as Kiali and Jaeger. The control plane must be deployed in a separate namespace than the {SMProductShortName} Operators and the data plane applications and services. You can deploy a basic installation of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane`(SMCP) from the {product-title} web console or the command line using the `oc` client tool.

[NOTE]
====
This basic installation is configured based on the default {product-title} settings and is not designed for production use. Use this default installation to verify your installation, and then configure your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` settings for your environment.
====

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) places additional restrictions on where you can create resources, and as a result, the default deployment does not work. See Installing {SMProductShortName} on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS for additional requirements before deploying your SMCP in a ROSA environment.
====

[NOTE]
====
The {SMProductShortName} documentation uses `istio-system` as the example project, but you can deploy the service mesh to any project.
