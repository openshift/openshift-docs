= Site cleanup

To remove a site and the associated installation and policy custom resources (CRs), remove the `SiteConfig` and site-specific `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs from the Git repository. The pipeline hooks remove the generated CRs.

[NOTE]
====
Before removing a `SiteConfig` CR you must detach the cluster from ACM.
