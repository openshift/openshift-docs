= Removing a managed cluster site from the {ztp} pipeline

You can remove a managed site and the associated installation and configuration policy CRs from the {ztp-first} pipeline.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Remove a site and the associated CRs by removing the associated `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` files from the `kustomization.yaml` file.
+
When you run the {ztp} pipeline again, the generated CRs are removed.

. Optional: If you want to permanently remove a site, you should also remove the `SiteConfig` and site-specific `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` files from the Git repository.

. Optional: If you want to remove a site temporarily, for example when redeploying a site, you can leave the `SiteConfig` and site-specific `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` CRs in the Git repository.
