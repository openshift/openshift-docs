= Removing a managed cluster site from the ZTP pipeline

You can remove a managed site and the associated installation and configuration policy CRs from the ZTP pipeline.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Precedure

. Remove a site and the associated CRs by removing the associated `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` files from the `kustomization.yaml` file.
+
When you run the ZTP pipeline again, the generated CRs are removed.

. Optional: If you want to permanently remove a site, you should also remove the `SiteConfig` and site-specific `PolicyGenTemplate` files from the Git repository.

. Optional: If you want to remove a site temporarily, for example when redeploying a site, you can leave the `SiteConfig` and site-specific `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs in the Git repository.

[NOTE]
====
After removing the `SiteConfig` file from the Git repository, if the corresponding clusters get stuck in the detach process, check {rh-rhacm-first} on the hub cluster for information about cleaning up the detached cluster.
