Remove a site and the associated installation and configuration policy CRs by removing the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` file names from the `kustomization.yaml` file. The generated CRs are also removed.

[NOTE]

After removing the `SiteConfig` file, if its corresponding clusters are stuck in the detach process, check the {rh-rhacm-first} for information on cleaning up the detached managed cluster.
