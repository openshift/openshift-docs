= Site cleanup

Remove a site and the associated installation and configuration policy CRs by removing the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` file names from the `kustomization.yaml` file. When you run the ZTP pipeline again, the generated CRs are removed. If you want to permanently remove a site, you should also remove the `SiteConfig` and site-specific `PolicyGenTemplate` files from the Git repository. If you want to remove a site temporarily, for example when redeploying a site, you can leave the `SiteConfig` and site-specific `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs in the Git repository.

[NOTE]
====
After removing the `SiteConfig` file, if the corresponding clusters remain in the detach process, check {rh-rhacm-first} for information about cleaning up the detached managed cluster.
