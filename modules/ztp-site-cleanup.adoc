= Site cleanup

You can remove a site and the associated installation and configuration policy custom resoures (CRs)
by removing the `SiteConfig & PolicyGenTemplate` file name from the `kustomization.yaml` file.
The generated CRs are also removed.

[NOTE]
====
After removing the `SiteConfig` file, if its corresponding clusters are stuck in the detach process, check
{rh-rhacm} page to detach the managed cluster.
