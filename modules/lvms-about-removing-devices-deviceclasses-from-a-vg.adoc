[id="about-removing-devices-deviceclasses-from-a-vg_{context}"]
= About removing devices and device classes from a volume group

[role="_abstract"]
The `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR contains the configuration to specify the paths to the devices that you can remove from the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) volume group.

[id="removing-device-paths-in-deviceselectorpaths-field_{context}"]
== Removing the device paths in the deviceSelector.paths field

You can remove the device paths in the `deviceSelector.paths` field.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the following criteria are met before removing device paths: 

* The device that you want to remove is empty. You can use the `pvdisplay` command to see attributes of physical volumes (PVs) used in LVM. 

* At least one additional device is specified in the `deviceSelector.paths` field.
====

[id="removing-device-classes-from-lvmcluster_{context}"]
== Removing the deviceClass from the LVMCluster

You can also remove the `deviceClass` object from the `LVMCluster` resource. For device class deletion, there is no need to delete `deviceSelector.paths` object.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the following criteria are met before removing a device class: 

* The `deviceClasses.default` field is set to `false`.

* The disks specified in the `deviceSelector.paths` field are empty.

* At least one additional device class is specified in the `storage` field.
