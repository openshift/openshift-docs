= Updating mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift from a local host

This procedure explains how to update the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ from a local host using the `upgrade` command. Updating to the latest version ensures new features, bug fixes, and security vulnerability fixes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When updating, there is intermittent downtime of your mirror registry, as it is restarted during the update process.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ on a local host.

.Procedure

* If you are upgrading the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ from 1.2.z -> 1.3.0, and your installation directory is the default at `/etc/quay-install`, you can enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo ./mirror-registry upgrade -v
----
+
[NOTE]
====
* _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ migrates Podman volumes for Quay storage, Postgres data, and `/etc/quay-install` data to the new `$HOME/quay-install` location. This allows you to use _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ without the `--quayRoot` flag during future upgrades.

* Users who upgrade _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ with the `./mirror-registry upgrade -v` flag must include the same credentials used when creating their mirror registry. For example, if you installed the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ with `--quayHostname <host_example_com>` and `--quayRoot <example_directory_name>`, you must include that string to properly upgrade the mirror registry.
====

* If you are upgrading the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ from 1.2.z -> 1.3.0 and you used a specified directory in your 1.2.z deployment, you must pass in the new `--pgStorage`and `--quayStorage` flags. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo ./mirror-registry upgrade --quayHostname <host_example_com> --quayRoot <example_directory_name> --pgStorage <example_directory_name>/pg-data --quayStorage <example_directory_name>/quay-storage -v
----
