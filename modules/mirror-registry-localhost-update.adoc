= Updating mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift from a local host

This procedure explains how to update the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ from a local host using the `upgrade` command. Updating to the latest version ensures new features, bug fixes, and security vulnerability fixes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When upgrading from version 1 to version 2, be aware of the following constraints:

** The worker count is set to `1` because multiple writes are not allowed in SQLite. 
** You must not use the _mirror registry for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift_ user interface (UP).
** Do not access the `sqlite-storage` Podman volume during the upgrade.
** There is intermittent downtime of your mirror registry because it is restarted during the upgrade process.
** PostgreSQL data is backed up under the `/$HOME/quay-instal/quay-postgres-backup/` directory for recovery.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ on a local host.

.Procedure

* If you are upgrading the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ from 1.3 -> 2.y, and your installation directory is the default at `/etc/quay-install`, you can enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo ./mirror-registry upgrade -v
----
+
[NOTE]
====
* _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ migrates Podman volumes for Quay storage, Postgres data, and `/etc/quay-install` data to the new `$HOME/quay-install` location. This allows you to use _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ without the `--quayRoot` flag during future upgrades.

* Users who upgrade _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ with the `./mirror-registry upgrade -v` flag must include the same credentials used when creating their mirror registry. For example, if you installed the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ with `--quayHostname <host_example_com>` and `--quayRoot <example_directory_name>`, you must include that string to properly upgrade the mirror registry.
====

* If you are upgrading _the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ from 1.3 -> 2.y and you used a custom quay configuration and storage directory in your 1.y deployment, you must pass in the `--quayRoot` and `--quayStorage` flags. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo ./mirror-registry upgrade --quayHostname <host_example_com> --quayRoot <example_directory_name>  --quayStorage <example_directory_name>/quay-storage -v
----

* If you are upgrading the  _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ from 1.3 -> 2.y and want to specify a custom SQLite storage path, you must pass in the `--sqliteStorage` flag, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo ./mirror-registry upgrade --sqliteStorage <example_directory_name>/sqlite-storage -v
----
