= Adding the {cli-manager} custom index to Krew

You can use the terminal to add the CLI manager custom index to Krew. This procedure is required for the {cli-manager} to function correctly and needs to be done only once.

The custom index connects Krew to the {cli-manager} binaries and enables the {cli-manager} to work in disconnected environments.

[NOTE]
====
If you use self-signed certificates, mark the certificate as trusted on your local operating system to use Krew.
