= Planning your environment based on tested cluster maximums

This document describes how to plan your {product-title} environment based on the tested cluster maximums.

Oversubscribing the physical resources on a node affects resource guarantees the Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod placement. Learn what measures you can take to avoid memory swapping.

Some of the tested maximums are stretched only in a single dimension. They will vary when many objects are running on the cluster.

The numbers noted in this documentation are based on Red Hat testing methodology, setup, configuration, and tunings. These numbers can vary based on your own individual setup and environments.

While planning your environment, determine how many pods are expected to fit per node using the following formula:

----
required pods per cluster / pods per node = total number of nodes needed
----

The current maximum number of pods per node is 250. However, the number of pods that fit on a node is dependent on the application itself. Consider the application’s memory, CPU, and storage requirements, as described in _Planning your environment based on application requirements_.

.Example scenario
If you want to scope your cluster for 2200 pods per cluster, you would need at least nine nodes, assuming that there are 250 maximum pods per node:

----
2200 / 250 = 8.8
----

If you increase the number of nodes to 20, then the pod distribution changes to 110 pods per node:

----
2200 / 20 = 110
----

Where:

----
required pods per cluster / total number of nodes = expected pods per node
----
