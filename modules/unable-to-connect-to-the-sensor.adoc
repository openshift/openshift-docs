= Unable to connect to the Sensor

When starting, first check if you can connect to Sensor. Sensor is responsible for downloading kernel drivers and CIDR blocks for processing network events, making it an essential part of the startup process. The following logs indicate you are unable to connect to the Sensor:

This error could mean that Sensor has not started correctly or that Collector configuration is incorrect. To fix this issue, you must verify Collector configuration to ensure that Sensor address is correct and that the Sensor pod is running correctly.


View the Collector logs to specifically check the configured Sensor address. Alternatively, you can run the following command:

[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ kubectl -n stackrox get pod _<collector_pod_name>_ -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].env[?(@.name=="GRPC_SERVER")].value}' <1>
----

<1> For `_<collector_pod_name>_`, specify the name of your Collector pod, for example, `collector-vclg5`.
