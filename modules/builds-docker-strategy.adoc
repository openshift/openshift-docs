= Docker strategy

When using a `Docker` strategy, you can add all defined input secrets into your container image using the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add[`ADD`] and link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy[`COPY` instructions] in your `Dockerfile`.

If you do not specify the `destinationDir` for a secret, then the files will be copied into the same directory in which the `Dockerfile` is located. If you specify a relative path as `destinationDir`, then the secrets will be copied into that directory, relative to your `Dockerfile` location. This makes the secret files available to the Docker build operation as part of the context directory used during the build.

.Example of a Dockerfile referencing secret and ConfigMap data
----
FROM centos/ruby-22-centos7

USER root
COPY ./secret-dir /secrets
COPY ./config /

# Create a shell script that will output secrets and ConfigMaps when the image is run
RUN echo '#!/bin/sh' > /input_report.sh
RUN echo '(test -f /secrets/secret1 && echo -n "secret1=" && cat /secrets/secret1)' >> /input_report.sh
RUN echo '(test -f /config && echo -n "relative-configMap=" && cat /config)' >> /input_report.sh
RUN chmod 755 /input_report.sh

CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/input_report.sh"]

[NOTE]
====
Users should normally remove their input secrets from the final application image so that the secrets are not present in the container running from that image. However, the secrets will still exist in the image itself in the layer where they were added. This removal should be part of the `Dockerfile` itself.
