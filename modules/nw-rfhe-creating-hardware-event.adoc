= Creating the bare-metal event and Secret CRs

To start using bare-metal events, create the `HardwareEvent` custom resource (CR) for the host where the Redfish hardware is present. Hardware events and faults are reported in the `hw-event-proxy` logs.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {product-title} CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have installed the {redfish-operator}.

* You have created a `BMCEventSubscription` CR for the BMC Redfish hardware.

* You have configured dynamic volume provisioning in the cluster or you have manually created `StorageClass`, `LocalVolume`, and `PersistentVolume` CRs to persist the events subscription.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you enable dynamic volume provisioning in the cluster, a `PersistentVolume` resource is automatically created for the `PersistentVolumeClaim` that the {redfish-operator} deploys.

For more information about manually creating persistent storage in the cluster, see "Persistent storage using local volumes".
====

.Procedure

. Create the `HardwareEvent` custom resource (CR):
+
[NOTE]
====
Multiple `HardwareEvent` resources are not permitted.
====

.. Save the following YAML in the `hw-event.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "event.redhat-cne.org/v1alpha1"
kind: "HardwareEvent"
metadata:
  name: "hardware-event"
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/hw-event: "" <1>
  storageType: "example-storage-class" <2>
  logLevel: "debug" <3>
  msgParserTimeout: "10" <4>
----
+
--
<1> Required. Use the `nodeSelector` field to target nodes with the specified label, for example, `node-role.kubernetes.io/hw-event: ""`.
<2> The value of `storageType` is used to populate the `StorageClassName` field for the `PersistentVolumeClaim` (`PVC`) resource that the {redfish-operator} automatically deploys.
The `PVC` resource is used to persist consumer event subscriptions.
+
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} 4.13 or later, you do not need to set the `spec.transportHost` field in the `HardwareEvent` resource when you use HTTP transport for bare-metal events.
Set `transportHost` only when you use AMQP transport for bare-metal events.

The value that you set for `.spec.storageType` in the `HardwareEvent` CR must match the `storageClassName` that is set in the `PersistentVolume` CR.
====
<3> Optional. The default value is `debug`. Sets the log level in `hw-event-proxy` logs. The following log levels are available: `fatal`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`.
<4> Optional. Sets the timeout value in milliseconds for the Message Parser. If a message parsing request is not responded to within the timeout duration, the original hardware event message is passed to the cloud native event framework. The default value is 10.
--

.. Apply the `HardwareEvent` CR in the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hardware-event.yaml
----

. Create a BMC username and password `Secret` CR that enables the hardware events proxy to access the Redfish message registry for the bare-metal host.
+
.. Save the following YAML in the `hw-event-bmc-secret.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: redfish-basic-auth
type: Opaque
stringData: <1>
  username: <bmc_username>
  password: <bmc_password>
  # BMC host DNS or IP address
  hostaddr: <bmc_host_ip_address>
----
<1> Enter plain text values for the various items under `stringData`.
+
.. Create the `Secret` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f hw-event-bmc-secret.yaml
