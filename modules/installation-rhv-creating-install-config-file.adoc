= Creating the install config file

You create an installation configuration file by running the installation program, `openshift-install`, and responding to its prompts with information you specified or gathered earlier.

When you finish responding to the prompts, the installation program creates an initial version of the `install-config.yaml` file in the assets directory you specified earlier, for example, `./wrk/install-config.yaml`

The installation program also creates a file, `$HOME/.ovirt/ovirt-config.yaml`, that contains all the connection parameters that are required to reach the oVirt Engine/{rh-virtualization} Manager and use its REST API.

**NOTE:**
The installation process does not use values you supply for some parameters, such as `Internal API virtual IP` and `Ingress virtual IP`, because you have already configured them in your infrastructure DNS.

It also uses the values you supply for parameters in `inventory.yml`, like the ones for `oVirt cluster`, `oVirt storage`, and `oVirt network`. And uses a script to remove or replace these same values from `install-config.yaml` with the previously mentioned `virtual IPs`.
//For details, see xref:set-platform-to-none[].

.Procedure

. Run the installation program:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create install-config --dir $ASSETS_DIR
----

. Respond to the installation program's prompts with information about your system.

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
? SSH Public Key /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
? Platform <ovirt>
? Engine FQDN[:PORT] [? for help] <engine.fqdn>
? Enter ovirt-engine username <ovirtadmin@internal>
? Enter password <******>
? oVirt cluster <cluster>
? oVirt storage <storage>
? oVirt network <net>
? Internal API virtual IP <172.16.0.252>
? Ingress virtual IP <172.16.0.251>
? Base Domain <example.org>
? Cluster Name <ocp4>
? Pull Secret [? for help] <********>
----

For `Internal API virtual IP` and `Ingress virtual IP`, supply the IP addresses you specified when you configured the DNS service.

Together, the values you enter for the `oVirt cluster` and `Base Domain` prompts form the FQDN portion of URLs for the REST API and any applications you create, such as `\https://api.ocp4.example.org:6443/` and `\https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.example.org`.
