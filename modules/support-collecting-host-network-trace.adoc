= Collecting a host network trace

Sometimes, troubleshooting a network-related issue is simplified by tracing network communication and capturing packets on multiple nodes at the same time.

You can use a combination of the `oc adm must-gather` command and the `registry.redhat.io/openshift4/network-tools-rhel8` container image to gather packet captures from nodes.
Analyzing packet captures can help you troubleshoot network communication issues.

The `oc adm must-gather` command is used to run the `tcpdump` command in pods on specific nodes.
The `tcpdump` command records the packet captures in the pods.
When the `tcpdump` command exits, the `oc adm must-gather` command transfers the files with the packet captures from the pods to your client machine.

[TIP]
====
The sample command in the following procedure demonstrates performing a packet capture with the `tcpdump` command.
However, you can run any command in the container image that is specified in the `--image` argument to gather troubleshooting information from multiple nodes at the same time.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Run a packet capture from the host network on some nodes by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather \
    --dest-dir /tmp/captures \  <.>
    --source-dir '/tmp/tcpdump/' \  <.>
    --image registry.redhat.io/openshift4/network-tools-rhel8:latest \  <.>
    --node-selector 'node-role.kubernetes.io/worker' \  <.>
    --host-network=true \  <.>
    --timeout 30s \  <.>
    -- \
    tcpdump -i any \  <.>
    -w /tmp/tcpdump/%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.pcap -W 1 -G 300
----
<.> The `--dest-dir` argument specifies that `oc adm must-gather` stores the packet captures in directories that are relative to `/tmp/captures` on the client machine. You can specify any writable directory.
<.> When `tcpdump` is run in the debug pod that `oc adm must-gather` starts, the `--source-dir` argument specifies that the packet captures are temporarily stored in the `/tmp/tcpdump` directory on the pod.
<.> The `--image` argument specifies a container image that includes the `tcpdump` command.
<.> The `--node-selector` argument and example value specifies to perform the packet captures on the worker nodes. As an alternative, you can specify the `--node-name` argument instead to run the packet capture on a single node. If you omit both the `--node-selector` and the `--node-name` argument, the packet captures are performed on all nodes.
<.> The `--host-network=true` argument is required so that the packet captures are performed on the network interfaces of the node.
<.> The `--timeout` argument and value specify to run the debug pod for 30 seconds. If you do not specify the `--timeout` argument and a duration, the debug pod runs for 10 minutes.
<.> The `-i any` argument for the `tcpdump` command specifies to capture packets on all network interfaces. As an alternative, you can specify a network interface name.

. Perform the action, such as accessing a web application, that triggers the network communication issue while the network trace captures packets.

. Review the packet capture files that `oc adm must-gather` transferred from the pods to your client machine:

<1> The packet captures are stored in directories that identify the hostname, container, and file name.
If you did not specify the `--node-selector` argument, then the directory level for the hostname is not present.
