=== Logs

Logs are collected for {product-title} builds, deployments, and pods. 
Virtual machine logs can be retrieved from the virtual machine launcher pod.

----
$ oc logs virt-launcher-fedora-vm-zzftf
----

The `-f` option follows the log output in real time, which is useful for
monitoring progress and error checking.

If the launcher pod is failing to start, you may need to use the
`--previous` option to see the logs of the last attempt.

[WARNING]
====
`ErrImagePull` and `ImagePullBackOff` errors could be caused by
an incorrect deployment configuration or problems with the images being
referenced.
