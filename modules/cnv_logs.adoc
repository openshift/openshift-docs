= Logs

Logs are collected for {product-title} builds, deployments, and pods. 
Virtual machine logs can be retrieved from the virtual machine launcher pod.

----
$ oc logs virt-launcher-fedora-vm-zzftf
----

The `-f` option follows the log output in real time, which is useful for
monitoring progress and error checking.

If the launcher pod is failing to start, use the
`--previous` option to see the logs of the last attempt.

[WARNING]
====
`ErrImagePull` and `ImagePullBackOff` errors can be caused by
an incorrect deployment configuration or problems with the images being
referenced.
