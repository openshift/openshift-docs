|ROX_NODE_SCANNING_INTERVAL
|The base value of the interval duration between node scans. The default value is `4h`.

|ROX_NODE_SCANNING_INTERVAL_DEVIATION
|The duration of node scans can differ from the base interval time. However, the maximum value is limited by the `ROX_NODE_SCANNING_INTERVAL`.

|ROX_NODE_SCANNING_MAX_INITIAL_WAIT
|The maximum wait time before the first node scan, which is randomly generated. You can set this value to `0` to disable the initial node scanning wait time. The default value is `5m`.
