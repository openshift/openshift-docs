= Analyzing the default Argo CD instance details

By default, the Operator creates an Argo CD instance in the `openshift-gitops` namespace. After installation, you can use the {OCP} web console to view the **Operator details** page and analyze the default instance configuration. This analysis helps you to customize the behavior of this instance later. The instance is intended for the cluster configuration use case and has elevated privileges. 

[NOTE]
====
You can create additional Argo CD instances in other namespaces to support your application use cases.

.Prerequisite
