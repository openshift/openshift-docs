= Uploading a local disk image to a DataVolume

You can use the `virtctl` CLI utility to upload a local disk image from
a client machine to a DataVolume (DV) in your cluster. You can use a DV that
already exists in your cluster or create a new DV during this procedure.

[NOTE]
====
After you upload a local disk image, you can add it to a virtual machine.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must have one of the following:
** A raw virtual machine image file in either ISO or IMG format.
** A virtual machine image file in QCOW2 format.

* For best results, compress your image file according to the following guidelines before you upload it:
** Compress a raw image file by using `xz` or `gzip`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Using a compressed raw image file results in the most efficient upload.
====
** Compress a QCOW2 image file by using the method that is recommended for your client:
*** If you use a Linux client, _sparsify_ the QCOW2 file by using the
link:https://libguestfs.org/virt-sparsify.1.html[virt-sparsify] tool.
*** If you use a Windows client, compress the QCOW2 file by using `xz` or `gzip`.

* The `kubevirt-virtctl` package must be installed on the client machine.

* The client machine must be configured to trust the {product-title} router's
certificate.

.Procedure

. Identify the following items:
* The name of the upload DataVolume that you want to use. If this DataVolume
does not exist, it is created automatically.
* The size of the DataVolume, if you want it to be created during the upload
procedure. The size must be greater than or equal to the size of the disk image.
* The file location of the virtual machine disk image that you want to upload.

. Upload the disk image by running the `virtctl image-upload` command.
Specify the parameters that you identified in the previous step.
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl image-upload dv <datavolume_name> \ <1>
--size=<datavolume_size> \ <2>
--image-path=</path/to/image> \ <3>
----
<1> The name of the DataVolume.
<2> The size of the DataVolume. For example: `--size=500Mi`, `--size=1G`
<3> The file path of the virtual machine disk image.
+
[NOTE]
====
* If you do not want to create a new DataVolume, omit the `--size` parameter and
include the `--no-create` flag.

* To allow insecure server connections when using HTTPS, use the `--insecure`
parameter. Be aware that when you use the `--insecure` flag, the authenticity of
the upload endpoint is *not* verified.
====

. Optional. To verify that a DataVolume was created, view all DataVolume objects
by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get dvs
