= Transcript collection overview 

Transcripts are sent to {red-hat} every two hours, by default. If you are using the filtering and redaction functionality, the filtered or redacted content is sent to {red-hat}. {red-hat} does not see the original non-redacted content, and the redaction takes place before any content is captured in logs.

{ols-long} temporarily logs and stores complete transcripts of conversations that users have with the virtual assistant. This includes the following information:

* Queries from the user.

* The complete message sent to the configured Large Language Model (LLM) provider, which includes system instructions, referenced documentation, and the user question.

* The complete response from the LLM provider.

Transcripts originate from the cluster and are associated with the cluster. {red-hat} can assign specific clusters to specific customer accounts. Transcripts do not contain any information about users.
