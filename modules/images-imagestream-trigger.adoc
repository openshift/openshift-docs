[id="image-stream-trigger_{context}"]
= Imagestream triggers

An imagestream trigger causes a specific action when an imagestreamtag
changes. For example, importing can cause the value of the tag to change, which
causes a trigger to fire when there are Deployments, Builds, or other resources
listening for those.
