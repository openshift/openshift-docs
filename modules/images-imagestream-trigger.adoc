= Image stream triggers

[role="_abstract"]
Image stream triggers in {product-title} cause specific actions when image stream tags change. You can configure triggers to automatically start builds or deployments when new images are imported.

For example, importing a new image can cause the value of the tag to change, which causes a trigger to fire when there are deployments, builds, or other resources listening for those.
