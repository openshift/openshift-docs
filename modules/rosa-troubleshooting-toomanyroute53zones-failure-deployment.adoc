= Troubleshooting cluster creation with a TooManyRoute53Zones error

If a cluster creation action fails, you might receive the following error messages.

.Example install logs output
[source,terminal]
----
error msg=Error: error creating Route53 Hosted Zone: TooManyHostedZones: Limits Exceeded: MAX_HOSTED_ZONES_BY_OWNER - Cannot create more hosted zones.\\nlevel=error msg=\\tstatus code: 400
----

.Example {cluster-manager} output
[source,terminal]

Provisioning Error Code:    OCM3006
Provisioning Error Message: Zone limit exceeded
----

This error indicates the cluster installation was blocked as the installation program was unable to create a Route 53 hosted zone. A hosted zone is a container for records, and records contain information about how you want to route traffic for a specific domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (acme.example.com, zenith.example.com).

The error suggests that the hosted zone quota is at capacity. By default, each Amazon Route 53 account is limited to a maximum of 500 hosted zones and 10,000 resource record sets per hosted zone.

.Procedure

Request a quota increase from AWS or delete unused VPCs.

* Request a quota increase from AWS.
.. Sign in to the link:https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS Management Console].
.. Click your user name and select **Service Quotas**.
.. Under **Manage quotas**, select a service to view available quotas.
.. If the quota is adjustable, you can choose the button or the name, and then choose **Request increase**.
.. For **Increase quota value**, enter the new value. The new value must be greater than the current value.
.. Choose **Request**.

* Delete unused VPCs. Before you can delete a VPC, you must first terminate or delete any resources that created a requester-managed network interface in the VPC. For example, you must terminate your EC2 instances and delete your load balancers, NAT gateways, transit gateways, and interface VPC endpoints.
.. Sign in to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[AWS EC2 console].
.. Terminate all instances in the VPC. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html[Terminate Amazon EC2 instances].
.. Open the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc[Amazon VPC console].
.. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**.
.. Select the VPC to delete and choose **Actions, Delete VPC**.
.. If you have a Site-to-Site VPN connection, select the option to delete it; otherwise, leave it unselected. Choose **Delete VPC**.
