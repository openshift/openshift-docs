= Mirroring an image set in a partially disconnected environment

.Mirror To Mirror

You can use this workflow for partially disconnected mirroring, that is, when the environment from which you are executing oc-mirror has both:
- Access to the internet
- Access to the mirror registry

.Procedure

. Copy the container images from the source specified in the image set configuration to the destination (container registry).
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror -c isc.yaml --workspace file://oc-mirror/mirror1 docker://localhost:6000 --v2
----

.Verification

. Navigate into the `working-dir` directory that was generated.
. Navigate into the results directory, for example, `cluster-resources`.
. Verify that YAML files are present for the `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, `ImageTagMirrorSet` and `CatalogSource` resources.

.Next steps

* Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror.
