= Mirroring an image set in a partially disconnected environment

You can mirror image sets to a registry using the oc-mirror plugin v2 in environments with restricted internet access.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the internet and the mirror registry in the environment where you are running the oc-mirror plugin v2.

.Procedure

* Mirror the images from the specified image set configuration to a specified registry by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror -c isc.yaml --workspace file://<file_path> docker://<mirror_registry_url> --v2 <1>
----
<1> Specify the URL or address of the mirror registry where the images are stored and from which they need to be deleted.

.Verification

. Navigate to the `cluster-resources` directory within the `working-dir` directory that was generated in the `<file_path>` directory.
. Verify that the YAML files are present for the `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, `ImageTagMirrorSet` and `CatalogSource` resources.


.Next steps

* Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2.
