= Network observability DNS resolution analysis

[role="_abstract"]
Use DNS decoding to differentiate between network transport failures and service discovery issues by enriching eBPF flow records with domain names and status codes.

As a network administrator or site reliability engineer, you need to differentiate between network transport failures and service discovery issues. Domain Name Service (DNS) decoding provides the high-level context required to bridge this gap by translating raw UDP/TCP flows into human-readable domain names and status codes.

== Resolving the service discovery blind spot

Standard flow logs only show that traffic occurred on port 53. DNS decoding allows you to complete the following tasks:

* Identify misconfigured services: Distinguish between a service that is "down" and a service that cannot be "found" by monitoring for `NXDOMAIN` (non-existent domain) responses.
* Measure internal service latency: Track the time it takes for CoreDNS to respond to specific internal lookups (e.g., `my-service.namespace.svc.cluster.local`).
* Audit external dependencies: Audit which external APIs or third-party domains your workloads are communicating with without requiring sidecars or manual packet captures.

[id="dns-flow-enrichment_{context}"]
== DNS flow enrichment

When this feature is active, the eBPF agent enriches the flow record with a `dns_properties` object. This metadata allows you to group and filter traffic by the intent of the connection (the domain) rather than just the destination IP.
