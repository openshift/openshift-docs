= Changing the cluster logging management state

In managed state, the Cluster Logging Operator (CLO) responds to changes in the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR)
and attempts to update the cluster to match the CR.  

In an unmanaged state, the CLO does not respond to changes in the CR. 
The administrator assumes full control of individual component configurations 
and upgrades when in unmanaged state. If you make changes to a CR in managed state,
the Cluster Logging Operator can revert those changes. 

[NOTE]
====
An unmanaged deployment does not receive updates until the cluster logging is placed back into a managed state.
====

.Prerequisite

* The Cluster Logging Operator must be installed.
