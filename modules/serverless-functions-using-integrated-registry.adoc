= Building and deploying functions with OpenShift Container Registry

When building and deploying functions, the resulting container image is stored in an image registry. Usually this will be a public registry, such as Quay. However, you can use the integrated OpenShift Container Registry instead if it has been exposed by a cluster administrator.

.Procedure

* Run the `kn func build` command, or the `kn func deploy` command, with the OpenShift Container Registry and the namespace specified for the `-r` parameter:
+
.Example build command
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn func build -r $(oc get route -n openshift-image-registry)/my-namespace
----
+
.Example deploy command
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn func deploy -r $(oc get route -n openshift-image-registry)/my-namespace
----
+
You can verify that the function deployed successfully by emitting a test event to it.
