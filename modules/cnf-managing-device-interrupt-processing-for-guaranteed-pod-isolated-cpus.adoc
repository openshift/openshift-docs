= Managing device interrupt processing for guaranteed pod isolated CPUs

The Performance Addon Operator manages host CPUs by dividing them into reserved CPUs for cluster and operating system housekeeping duties, and isolated CPUs for workloads. CPUs that are used for low latency workloads are set as isolated.

Device interrupts are load balanced between all isolated and reserved CPUs in order to avoid CPUs being overloaded, with the exception of CPUs where there is a guaranteed pod running. Guaranteed pod CPUs are prevented from processing device interrupts when the relevant annotations are set for the pod.

In the performance profile, `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is used to manage whether device interrupts are processed or not. For certain workloads the reserved CPUs are not always sufficient for dealing with device interrupts, and for this reason, device interrupts are not globally disabled on the isolated CPUs. By default, Performance Addon Operator does not disable device interrupts on isolated CPUs.

To achieve low latency for workloads, some (but not all) pods require the CPUs they are running on to not process device interrupts. A pod annotation, `irq-load-balancing.crio.io`, is used to define whether device interrupts are processed or not. When configured, CRI-O disables device interrupts only as long as the pod is running.

== Disabling global device interrupts handling in Performance Addon Operator

To configure Performance Addon Operator to disable global device interrupts for the isolated CPU set, set the `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` field in the performance profile to `true`. When `true`, conflicting pod annotations are ignored. When `false`, IRQ loads are balanced across all CPUs.

A performance profile snippet illustrates this setting:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
  name: manual
spec:
  globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing: true
...
----

[id="disabling_interrupt_processing_for_individual_pods_{context}"]
== Disabling interrupt processing for individual pods

To disable interrupt processing for individual pods, ensure that `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is set to `false` in the performance profile. Then, in the pod specification, set the `irq-load-balancing.crio.io` and `cpu-quota.crio.io` pod annotations to `disable`. An example pod specification snippet that illustrates this is below:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
      irq-load-balancing.crio.io: "disable"
      cpu-quota.crio.io: "disable"
spec:
    runtimeClassName: performance-<profile_name>
...
