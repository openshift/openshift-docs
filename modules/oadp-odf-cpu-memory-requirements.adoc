== CPU and memory requirement for configurations

Backup and restore operations require large amounts of CephFS `PersistentVolumes` (PVs). To avoid Ceph MDS pods restarting with an `out-of-memory` (OOM) error, the following configuration is suggested:

|===
| Configuration types | Request | Max limit

| CPU
| Request changed to 3
