= Automatic renewal of TLS certificates

* TLS certificates for {VirtProductName} components are created at the time of installation and are renewed and rotated automatically at periodic intervals. These certificates are granted to all components in {VirtProductName} iincluding KubeVirt API, containerized data importer (CDI) controller, and the MAC pool.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When the certificates are being renewed, the following operations are not impacted and continue to function:

* Migrations
* Image uploads
* VNC and console connections
====

Note: You cannot rotate and refresh TLS certificates manually.

During the automatic renewal, the existing certificates are destroyed and successfully replaced with new certificates.
//Verify if the following is true.
The frequency of  certificate rotation for each {VirtProductName} component is different. Certificates for the MAC pool expire after one year and are refreshed at that time. CDI certificates are rotated every 15 days.
//(Question: How often are KubeVirt API certificates refreshed?)

* Note: You cannot rotate and refresh TLS certificates manually.
