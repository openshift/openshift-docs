= Automatic renewal of TLS certificates

TLS certificates for {VirtProductName} are created during installation for these {VirtProductName} components:

 * KubeVirt API
 * containerized data importer controller (CDI)
 * MAC pool

All certificates are renewed and rotated automatically at periodic intervals. You are not required to rotate and refresh TLS certificates manually.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When the certificates are being renewed automatically, the following operations continue to function without being cancelled or disconnected:

* Migrations
* Image uploads
* VNC and console connections
====


During the automatic renewal,  existing certificates are deleted and replaced with new certificates.
//Verify if the following is true.
The frequency of  certificate rotation for each {VirtProductName} component varies:

|===
|Component |Rotation frequency of certificate

|KubeVirt

|Daily.

|MAC pool

|After one year.

|CDI

|Every 15 days.
