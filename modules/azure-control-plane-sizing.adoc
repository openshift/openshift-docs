= Recommended Control Plane Sizing for Azure

For Azure, It is recommended to use Control Plane nodes with at least "Standard_D16s_v3" instance type for improved performance and stability, as using "Standard_D8s_v3" instances led to firing critical alerts such as etcdGRPCRequestsSlow.[Tested on Openshift 4.15 on a cluster with 3 control plane nodes and 3 worker nodes and with 3 iterations of load generated using kube-burner-v2]
