The list of checks includes the following:

* Checks to see that you have logged in (see `login`)
* Checks that your AWS credentials are valid
* Checks that your AWS permissions are valid (see `verify permissions`)
* Checks that your AWS quota levels are high enough (see `verify quota`)
* Runs a cluster simulation to ensure cluster creation will perform as expected
* Checks that the `osdCcsAdmin` user has been created in your AWS account
* Checks that the OpenShift Container Platform command-line tool is available on your system
