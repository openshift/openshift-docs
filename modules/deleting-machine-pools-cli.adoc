= Deleting a machine pool using the ROSA CLI
You can delete a machine pool for your {product-title} cluster by using the ROSA CLI.

[NOTE]
====
For users of ROSA CLI `rosa` version 1.2.25 and earlier versions, the machine pool (ID='Default') that is created along with the cluster cannot be deleted. For users of ROSA CLI `rosa` version 1.2.26 and later, the machine pool (ID='worker') that is created along with the cluster can be deleted if there is one machine pool within the cluster that contains no taints, and at least two replicas for a Single-AZ cluster or three replicas for a Multi-AZ cluster.
