= Scaling manually

In addition to rollbacks, you can exercise fine-grained control over the number
of replicas by manually scaling them.

[NOTE]
====
Pods can also be autoscaled using the `oc autoscale` command.
====

.Procedure

. To manually scale a DeploymentConfig, use the `oc scale` command. For example,
the following command sets the replicas in the `frontend` DeploymentConfig to
`3`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale dc frontend --replicas=3
----
+
The number of replicas eventually propagates to the desired and current
state of the deployment configured by the DeploymentConfig `frontend`.
