= Ensuring that CNF workloads run uninterrupted with pod disruption budgets

You can configure the minimum number of pods in a deployment to allow the CNF workload to run uninterrupted by setting a pod disruption budget in a `PodDisruptionBudget` custom resource (CR) that you apply.
Be careful when setting this value; setting it improperly can cause an update to fail.

For example, if you have 4 pods in a deployment and you set the pod disruption budget to 4, the cluster scheduler keeps 4 pods running at all times - no pods can be scaled down.

Instead, set the pod disruption budget to 2, letting 2 of the 4 pods be scheduled as down.
Then, the worker nodes where those pods are located can be rebooted.

[NOTE]
====
Setting the pod disruption budget to 2 does not mean that your deployment runs on only 2 pods for a period of time, for example, during an update.
The cluster scheduler creates 2 new pods to replace the 2 older pods.
However, there is short period of time between the new pods coming online and the old pods being deleted.
