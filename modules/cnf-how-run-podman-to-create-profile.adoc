= How to run `podman` to create a performance profile

The following example illustrates how to run `podman` to create a performance profile with 20 reserved CPUs that are to be split across the NUMA nodes.

Node hardware configuration:

* 80 CPUs
* Hyperthreading enabled
* Two NUMA nodes
* Even numbered CPUs run on NUMA node 0 and odd numbered CPUs run on NUMA node 1

Run `podman` to create the performance profile:

[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run --entrypoint performance-profile-creator -v /must-gather:/must-gather:z registry.redhat.io/openshift4/performance-addon-rhel8-operator:v4.8 --mcp-name=worker-cnf --reserved-cpu-count=20 --rt-kernel=true --split-reserved-cpus-across-numa=true --must-gather-dir-path /must-gather > my-performance-profile.yaml
----

The created profile is described in the following YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
  kind: PerformanceProfile
  metadata:
    name: performance
  spec:
    cpu:
      isolated: 10-39,50-79
      reserved: 0-9,40-49
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-cnf: ""
    numa:
      topologyPolicy: restricted
    realTimeKernel:
      enabled: true
----

[NOTE]
====
In this case, 10 CPUs are reserved on NUMA node 0 and 10 are reserved on NUMA node 1.
