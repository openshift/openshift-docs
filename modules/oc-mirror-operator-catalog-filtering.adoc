= How filtering works in the operator catalog

oc-mirror plugin v2 selects the list of bundles for mirroring by processing the information in `imageSetConfig`.

When oc-mirror plugin v2 selects bundles for mirroring, it does not infer Group Version Kind (GVK) or bundle dependencies, omitting them from the mirroring set. Instead, it strictly adheres to the user instructions. You must explicitly specify any required dependent packages and their versions.

.Use the following table to see what bundle versions are included in different scenarios
[cols="1,2",options="header"]

|Expected bundle versions


a|Scenario 1

[source,yaml]
----
mirror:
 operators:
   - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.10
----
|For each package in the catalog, one bundle, corresponding to the head version for each channel of that package.

a|Scenario 2

----
mirror:
  operators:

----
|All bundles in all channels, from the `minVersion`, up to the channel head for that package.

a|Scenario 6

[source,yaml]
----
mirror:
  operators:
  - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.15
    packages: 
    - name: compliance-operator
        maxVersion: 6.0.0
----
|All bundles in all channels that are lower than the `maxVersion` for that package.

a|Scenario 7

[source,yaml]
----
mirror:
  operators:
  - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.15
    packages: 
    - name: compliance-operator

----
|All bundles in all channels, between the `minVersion` and `maxVersion` for that package. The head of the channel is not included, even if multiple channels are included in the filtering.

a|Scenario 8

        channels
          - name: stable
----
|The head bundle for the selected channel of that package. You must use the `defaultChannel` field in case the filtered channels are not the default.

a|Scenario 9

----
|Within the selected channel of that package, all versions up to `maxVersion`.
Head of channel is not included, even if multiple channels are included in the filtering.
