= How filtering works in the operator catalog

oc-mirror plugin v2 selects the list of bundles for mirroring by processing the information in `imageSetConfig`.

When oc-mirror plugin v2 selects bundles for mirroring, it does not infer Group Version Kind (GVK) or bundle dependencies, omitting them from the mirroring set. Instead, it strictly adheres to the user instructions. You must explicitly specify any required dependent packages and their versions.

Bundle versions typically use semantic versioning standards (SemVer), and you can sort bundles within a channel by version. You can select buncles that fall within a specific range in the `ImageSetConfig`.

This selection algorithm ensures consistent outcomes compared to oc-mirror plugin v1. However, it does not include upgrade graph details, such as `replaces`, `skip`, and `skipRange`. This approach differs from the OLM algorithm. It might mirror more bundles than necessary for upgrading a cluster because of potentially shorter upgrade paths between the `minVersion` and `maxVersion`.

.Use the following table to see what bundle versions are included in different scenarios:
[cols="1,2",options="header"]
