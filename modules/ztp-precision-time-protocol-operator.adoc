= Precision Time Protocol Operator

The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Operator is a protocol used to synchronize clocks in a network. When used in conjunction with hardware support, PTP is capable of sub-microsecond accuracy. PTP support is divided between the kernel and user space.

The clocks synchronized by PTP are organized in a master-worker hierarchy. The workers are synchronized to their masters, which may be workers to their own masters. The hierarchy is created and updated automatically by the best master clock (BMC) algorithm, which runs on every clock. When a clock has only one port, it can be master or worker, such a clock is called an ordinary clock (OC). A clock with multiple ports can be master on one port and worker on another, such a clock is called a boundary clock (BC). The top-level master is called the grandmaster clock, which can be synchronized by using a Global Positioning System (GPS) time source. By using a GPS-based time source, disparate networks can be synchronized with a high-degree of accuracy.
