= Precision Time Protocol Operator

Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is used to synchronize clocks in a network. The PTP Operator discovers PTP-capable devices in the cluster and creates and manages `linuxptp` services for those devices. The PTP Operator also deploys a PTP fast events infrastructure. vDU applications use PTP fast events notifications to report on clock events that can negatively affect the performance and reliability of the application. PTP fast events are distributed over an Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) event notification bus.
