= Troubleshooting errors with the cnf-tests container

To run latency tests, the cluster must be accessible from within the `cnf-tests` container.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* Verify that the cluster is accessible from inside the `cnf-tests` container by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version} \
oc get nodes
----
+
If this command does not work, an error related to spanning across DNS, MTU size, or firewall access might be occurring.
