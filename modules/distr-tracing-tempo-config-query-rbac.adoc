= Query role based access control (RBAC)

Query RBAC is a feature that allows users to see attributes only for spans that originate from namespaces that they have access to.
Which means users will be able to see traces from all namespaces, however the attributes will be filtered based on the namespaces they have access to,
except for the attributes `service.name` and `k8s.namespace.name` which are always kept.
