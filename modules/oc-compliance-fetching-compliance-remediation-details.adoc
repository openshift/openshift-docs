= Fetching compliance remediation details

The Compliance Operator provides remediation objects that are used to automate the changes required to make the cluster compliant. The `fetch-fixes` subcommand can help you understand exactly which configuration remediations are used. Use the `fetch-fixes` subcommand to extract the remediation objects from a profile, rule, or `ComplianceRemediation` object into a directory to inspect.

.Procedure

. View the remediations for a profile:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc compliance fetch-fixes profile ocp4-cis -o /tmp
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-api-priority-flowschema-catch-all' <1>
No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-api-priority-gate-enabled'
No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-audit-log-maxbackup'
Persisted rule fix to /tmp/ocp4-api-server-audit-log-maxsize.yaml
No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-audit-log-path'
No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-auth-mode-no-aa'
No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-auth-mode-node'
No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-auth-mode-rbac'
No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-basic-auth'
No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-bind-address'
No fixes to persist for rule 'ocp4-api-server-client-ca'
Persisted rule fix to /tmp/ocp4-api-server-encryption-provider-cipher.yaml
Persisted rule fix to /tmp/ocp4-api-server-encryption-provider-config.yaml
----
<1> The `No fixes to persist` warning is expected whenever there are rules in a profile that do not have a corresponding remediation, because either the rule cannot be remediated automatically or a remediation was not provided.

. You can view a sample of the YAML file. The `head` command will show you the first 10 lines:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ head /tmp/ocp4-api-server-audit-log-maxsize.yaml

$ oc get complianceremediations -n openshift-compliance

[WARNING]
====
Use caution before applying remediations directly. Some remediations might not be applicable in bulk, such as the usbguard rules in the moderate profile. In these cases, allow the Compliance Operator to apply the rules because it addresses the dependencies and ensures that the cluster remains in a good state.
