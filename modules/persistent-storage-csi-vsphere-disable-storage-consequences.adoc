.Consequences of disabling/enabling storage on vSphere
|===
|Disabling | Enabling

a| * vSphere CSI Driver Operator un-installs the CSI driver.

* Storage container orchestration (CO) should be healthy.

* vSphere-problem-detector continues running, but does not emit alerts or events, and checks less frequently (once per 24 hours).

* All existing persistent volumes (PVs), persistent volume claims (PVCs), and vSphere storage policies are unchanged:

** vSphere PVs cannot be used in new pods.

** vSphere PVs stay mounted and attached forever to existing nodes for existing pods. These pods remain in terminating state indefinitely after deletion.

* Storage classes are removed

|* vSphere CSI Driver Operator re-installs the CSI driver. 

* If necessary, the vSphere CSI Driver Operator creates the vSphere storage policy.
