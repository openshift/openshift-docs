= Infrastructure requirements for {aws-short}

When you use {hcp} on {aws-first}, the infrastructure requirements fit in the following categories:

* Prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure for the HyperShift Operator in an arbitrary {aws-short} account
* Prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure in a hosted cluster {aws-short} account
* {hcp-capital}-managed infrastructure in a management {aws-short} account
* {hcp-capital}-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster {aws-short} account
* Kubernetes-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster {aws-short} account

Prerequired means that {hcp} requires {aws-short} infrastructure to properly work. Unmanaged means that no Operator or controller creates the infrastructure for you.
