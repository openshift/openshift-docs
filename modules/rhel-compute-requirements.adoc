[id="rhel-compute-requirements_{context}"]
= System requirements for {op-system-base} compute nodes

The {op-system-base-full} compute, or worker, machine hosts in your {product-title} environment must meet the following minimum hardware specifications and system-level requirements:

* You must have an active {product-title} subscription on your Red Hat account. If you do not, contact your sales representative for more information.

* Production environments must provide compute machines to support your expected workloads. As a cluster administrator, you must calculate the expected workload and add about 10% for overhead. For production environments, allocate enough resources so that a node host failure does not affect your maximum capacity.
* Each system must meet the following hardware requirements:
** Physical or virtual system, or an instance running on a public or private IaaS.

** Base OS: CentOS 7.4.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Adding {op-system-base} 7 compute machines to an {product-title} cluster is deprecated. Deprecated functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

In addition, you cannot upgrade your {op-system-base} 7 compute machines to {op-system-base} 8. You must deploy new {op-system-base} 8 hosts, and the old {op-system-base} 7 hosts should be removed. See the "Deleting nodes" section for more information.

For the most recent list of major functionality that has been deprecated or removed within {product-title}, refer to the _Deprecated and removed features_ section of the {product-title} release notes.
====
** If you deployed {product-title} in FIPS mode, you must enable FIPS on the {op-system-base} machine before you boot it. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/security_guide/chap-federal_standards_and_regulations#sec-Enabling-FIPS-Mode[Enabling FIPS Mode] in the {op-system-base} 7 documentation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of FIPS Validated / Modules in Process cryptographic libraries is only supported on {product-title} deployments on the `x86_64` architecture.

** NetworkManager 1.0 or later.
** 1 vCPU.
** Minimum 8 GB RAM.
** Minimum 15 GB hard disk space for the file system containing `/var/`.
** Minimum 1 GB hard disk space for the file system containing `/usr/local/bin/`.
** Minimum 1 GB hard disk space for the file system containing its temporary directory. The temporary system directory is determined according to the rules defined in the tempfile module in the Python standard library.
* Each system must meet any additional requirements for your system provider. For example, if you installed your cluster on VMware vSphere, your disks must be configured according to its link:https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-kubernetes/documentation/index.html[storage guidelines] and the `disk.enableUUID=true` attribute must be set.

* Each system must be able to access the cluster's API endpoints by using DNS-resolvable hostnames. Any network security access control that is in place must allow system access to the cluster's API service endpoints.
