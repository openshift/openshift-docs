= System requirements for RHEL compute nodes

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) compute machine hosts, which are also known as worker machine hosts, in your
{product-title} environment must meet the following minimum hardware
specifications and system-level requirements.

* You must have an active {product-title} subscription on your Red Hat
account. If you do not, contact your sales representative for more information.

* Production environments must provide compute machines to support your expected
workloads. As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you must calculate
the expected workload and add about 10 percent for overhead. For production
environments, allocate enough resources so that a node host failure does not
affect your maximum capacity.
* Each system must meet the following hardware requirements:
** Physical or virtual system, or an instance running on a public or private IaaS.

** Base OS: Fedora 21, CentOS 7.4, or

with "Minimal" installation option.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only RHEL 7.6 is supported in {product-title} {product-version}. You must not
upgrade your compute machines to RHEL 8.

** NetworkManager 1.0 or later.
** 1 vCPU.
** Minimum 8 GB RAM.
** Minimum 15 GB hard disk space for the file system containing `/var/`.
** Minimum 1 GB hard disk space for the file system containing `/usr/local/bin/`.
** Minimum 1 GB hard disk space for the file system containing the system's
temporary directory. The system’s temporary directory is determined according to
the rules defined in the tempfile module in Python’s standard library.
* Each system must meet any additional requirements for your system provider. For
example, if you installed your cluster on VMware vSphere, your disks must
be configured according to its
link:https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-kubernetes/documentation/index.html[storage guidelines]
and the `disk.enableUUID=true` attribute must be set.

== Certificate signing requests management

Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you
use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving
cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The
`kube-controller-manager` only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The
`machine-approver` cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate
that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that
the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a
method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests
and approving them.
