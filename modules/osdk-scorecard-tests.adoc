= Tests performed

By default, the scorecard tool has a set of internal tests it can run available across two internal plug-ins. If multiple CRs are specified for a plug-in, the test environment is fully cleaned up after each CR so that each CR gets a clean testing environment.

Each test has a short name that uniquely identifies the test. This is useful when selecting a specific test or tests to run. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk scorecard -o text --selector=test=checkspectest
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk scorecard -o text --selector='test in (checkspectest,checkstatustest)'
----

== Basic plug-in

The following basic Operator tests are available from the `basic` plug-in:

.`basic` plug-in tests
[cols="25%,55%,20%",options="header"]
|===
|Test |Description |Short name

|Spec Block Exists
|This test checks the custom resources (CRs) created in the cluster to make sure that all CRs have a `spec` block. This test has a maximum score of `1`.
|`checkspectest`

|Status Block Exists
|This test checks the CRs created in the cluster to make sure that all CRs have a `status` block. This test has a maximum score of `1`.
|`checkstatustest`

|Writing Into CRs Has An Effect
|This test reads the scorecard proxy logs to verify that the Operator is making `PUT` or `POST`, or both, requests to the API server, indicating that it is modifying resources. This test has a maximum score of `1`.

[id="osdk-scorecard-tests-olm_{context}"]
== OLM plug-in

The following Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) integration tests are available from the `olm` plug-in:

.`olm` plug-in tests
[cols="25%,55%,20%",options="header"]
|===
|Test |Description |Short name

|OLM Bundle Validation
|This test validates the OLM bundle manifests found in the bundle directory as specified by the bundle flag. If the bundle contents contain errors, then the test result output includes the validator log as well as error messages from the validation library.
|`bundlevalidationtest`

|Provided APIs Have Validation
|This test verifies that the CRDs for the provided CRs contain a validation section and that there is validation for each `spec` and `status` field detected in the CR. This test has a maximum score equal to the number of CRs provided by the `cr-manifest` option.
|`crdshavevalidationtest`

|Owned CRDs Have Resources Listed
|This test makes sure that the CRDs for each CR provided by the `cr-manifest` option have a `resources` subsection in the `owned` CRDs section of the CSV. If the test detects used resources that are not listed in the `resources` section, it lists them in the suggestions at the end of the test. This test has a maximum score equal to the number of CRs provided by the `cr-manifest` option.
|`crdshaveresourcestest`

|Spec Fields With Descriptors
|This test verifies that every field in the `spec` sections of custom resources have a corresponding descriptor listed in the CSV. This test has a maximum score equal to the total number of fields in the `spec` sections of each custom resource passed in by the `cr-manifest` option.
|`specdescriptorstest`

|Status Fields With Descriptors
|This test verifies that every field in the `status` sections of custom resources have a corresponding descriptor listed in the CSV. This test has a maximum score equal to the total number of fields in the `status` sections of each custom resource passed in by the `cr-manifest` option.
