= Tests performed

By default, the scorecard tool has eight internal tests it can run available
across two internal plug-ins. If multiple CRs are specified for a plug-in, the
test environment is fully cleaned up after each CR so that each CR gets a clean
testing environment.

Each test has a short name that uniquely identifies the test. This is useful
when selecting a specific test or tests to run. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk scorecard -o text --selector=test=checkspectest
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk scorecard -o text --selector='test in (checkspectest,checkstatustest)'
----

== Basic plug-in

The following basic Operator tests are available from the `basic` plug-in:

.`basic` plug-in tests
|===
|Test |Description |Short name

|Spec Block Exists
|This test checks the Custom Resource(s) created in the cluster to make sure that
all CRs have a `spec` block. This test has a maximum score of `1`.
|`checkspectest`

|Status Block Exists
|This test checks the Custom Resource(s) created in the cluster to make sure that
all CRs have a `status` block. This test has a maximum score of `1`.
|`checkstatustest`

|Writing Into CRs Has An Effect
|This test reads the scorecard proxy's logs to verify that the Operator is making
`PUT` or `POST`, or both, requests to the API server, indicating that it is
modifying resources. This test has a maximum score of `1`.

[id="osdk-scorecard-tests-olm_{context}"]
== OLM plug-in

The following OLM integration tests are available from the `olm` plug-in:

|===
|Test |Description |Short name

|OLM Bundle Validation
|This test validates the OLM bundle manifests found in the bundle directory as
specified by the bundle flag. If the bundle contents contain errors, then the
test result output includes the validator log as well as error messages from
the validation library.
|`bundlevalidationtest`

|Provided APIs Have Validation
|This test verifies that the CRDs for the provided CRs contain a validation
section and that there is validation for each `spec` and `status` field detected
in the CR. This test has a maximum score equal to the number of CRs provided
by the `cr-manifest` option.
|`crdshavevalidationtest`

|Owned CRDs Have Resources Listed
|This test makes sure that the CRDs for each CR provided by the `cr-manifest`
option have a `resources` subsection in the `owned` CRDs section of the CSV. If
the test detects used resources that are not listed in the `resources` section,
it lists them in the suggestions at the end of the test. This test has a maximum
score equal to the number of CRs provided by the `cr-manifest` option.
|`crdshaveresourcestest`

|Spec Fields With Descriptors
|This test verifies that every field in the Custom Resources' `spec` sections
have a corresponding descriptor listed in the CSV. This test has a maximum score
equal to the total number of fields in the `spec` sections of each custom resource
passed in by the `cr-manifest` option.
|`specdescriptorstest`

|Status Fields With Descriptors
|This test verifies that every field in the Custom Resources' `status` sections
have a corresponding descriptor listed in the CSV. This test has a maximum score
equal to the total number of fields in the `status` sections of each custom
resource passed in by the `cr-manifest` option.
