= Enabling dynamic scaling of shards of the Argo CD Application Controller

[role="_abstract"]
:FeatureName: Dynamic scaling of shards
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

By default, the Argo CD Application Controller assigns clusters to shards indefinitely. If you are using the `round-robin` sharding algorithm, this static assignment can result in uneven distribution of shards, particularly when replicas are added or removed. You can enable dynamic scaling of shards to automatically adjust the number of shards based on the number of clusters managed by the Argo CD Application Controller at a given time. This ensures that shards are well-balanced and optimizes the use of compute resources.

[NOTE]
==== 
After you enable dynamic scaling, you cannot manually modify the shard count. The system automatically adjusts the number of shards based on the number of clusters managed by the Argo CD Application Controller at a given time.
