* You can also register for a new Red{nbsp}Hat account or reset your password on this page.
* Log in to the Red{nbsp}Hat account that you want to associate with the AWS account that has activated the {product-title} product subscription.
* The AWS account used for service billing can only be associated with a single Red{nbsp}Hat account. Typically an AWS payer account is the one that is used to subscribe to {product-title} and used for account linking and billing.
* All team members belonging to the same Red{nbsp}Hat organization can use the linked AWS account for service billing while creating {product-title} clusters.

. Complete the Red{nbsp}Hat account linking after reviewing the terms and conditions:

[NOTE]
====
This step is available only if the AWS account was not linked to any Red{nbsp}Hat account before.

This step is skipped if the AWS account is already linked to the user's logged in Red{nbsp}Hat account.

If the AWS account is linked to a different Red{nbsp}Hat account, an error will be displayed. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7066995[Correcting Billing Account Information for HCP clusters] for troubleshooting.
