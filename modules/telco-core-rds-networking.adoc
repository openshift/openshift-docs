New in this release::
//CNF-10593
* Telco core validation is now extended with bonding, MACVLAN, IPVLAN and SR-IOV networking scenarios.

Description::
* The cluster is configured in dual-stack IP configuration (IPv4 and IPv6).

* The validated physical network configuration consists of two dual-port NICs.
One NIC is shared among the primary CNI (OVN-Kubernetes) and IPVLAN and MACVLAN traffic, the second NIC is dedicated to SR-IOV VF-based Pod traffic.

* A Linux bonding interface (`bond0`) is created in an active-active LACP `IEEE 802.3ad` configuration with the two NIC ports attached.

[NOTE]
====
The top-of-rack networking equipment must support and be configured for multi-chassis link aggregation (mLAG) technology.
====

* VLAN interfaces are created on top of `bond0`, including for the primary CNI.

* Bond and VLAN interfaces are created at install time during network configuration.
Apart from the VLAN (`VLAN0`) used by the primary CNI, the other VLANS can be created on Day 2 using the Kubernetes NMState Operator.

* MACVLAN and IPVLAN interfaces are created with their corresponding CNIs.
They do not share the same base interface.

* SR-IOV VFs are managed by the SR-IOV Network Operator.
The following diagram provides an overview of SR-IOV NIC sharing:
