= ProfileBundle CR example

The bundle object needs two pieces of information: the URL of a container image that contains the `contentImage` and the file that contains the compliance content. The `contentFile` parameter is relative to the root of the file system. The built-in `rhcos4` `ProfileBundle` object can be defined in the example below:

[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: ProfileBundle
  metadata:
    name: rhcos4
  spec:
    contentImage: quay.io/complianceascode/ocp4:latest <1>
    contentFile: ssg-rhcos4-ds.xml <2>
----
<1> Content image location.
<2> Location of the file containing the compliance content.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The base image used for the content images must include `coreutils`.
