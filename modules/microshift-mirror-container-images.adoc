= Mirror container images into an existing registry

Using a custom air-gapped container registry, or mirror, is necessary with certain user environments and workload requirements. Mirroring allows for the transfer of container images and updates to air-gapped environments where they can be installed on a {product-title} instance.

To create an air-gapped mirror registry for {product-title} containers, you must complete the following steps:

* Get the container image list to be mirrored.
* Configure the mirroring prerequisites.
* Download images on a host with the internet access.
* Copy the downloaded image directory to an air-gapped site.
* Upload images to a mirror registry in an air-gapped site.
* Configure your {product-title} hosts to use the mirror registry.
