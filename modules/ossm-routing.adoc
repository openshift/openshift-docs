= Routing and managing traffic

Configure your service mesh by adding your own traffic configuration to {ProductName} with a custom resource definitions in a YAML file.

[id="ossm-routing-traffic-management-vs_{context}"]
== Traffic management with virtual services

You can route requests dynamically to multiple versions of a microservice through {ProductName} with a virtual service. With virtual services, you can:

* Address multiple application services through a single virtual service. If your mesh uses Kubernetes, for example, you can configure a virtual service to handle all services in a specific namespace. A virtual service enables you to turn a monolithic application into a service comprised of distinct microservices with a seamless consumer experience. 
* Configure traffic rules in combination with gateways to control ingress and egress traffic.

[id="ossm-routing-vs_{context}"]
=== Configuring virtual services

Requests are routed to services within a service mesh with virtual services. Each virtual service consists of a set of routing rules that are evaluated in order. {ProductName} matches each given request to the virtual service to a specific real destination within the mesh.

Without virtual services, {ProductName} distributes traffic using round-robin load balancing between all service instances. With a virtual service, you can specify traffic behavior for one or more hostnames. Routing rules in the virtual service tell {ProductName} how to send the traffic for the virtual service to appropriate destinations. Route destinations can be versions of the same service or entirely different services.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file using the following example to route requests to different versions of a the Bookinfo sample application service depending on which user connects to the application.
+
.Example VirtualService.yaml
[source,YAML]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        end-user:
          exact: jason
    route:
    - destination:

        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v3

[id="ossm-routing-config-v-host_{context}"]
== Configuring your virtual host

The following sections describe each field in the YAML file and explain how you can create a virtual host in a virtual service.

[id="ossm-routing-hosts_{context}"]
=== Hosts

The `hosts` field lists the virtual service's destination address to which the routing rules apply. This is the address(es) that are used to send requests to the service.

The virtual service hostname can be an IP address, a DNS name, or a short name that resolves to a fully qualified domain name.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
----

[id="ossm-routing-routing-rules_{context}"]
=== Routing rules

The `http` section contains the virtual service’s routing rules which describe match conditions and actions for routing HTTP/1.1, HTTP2, and gRPC traffic sent to the destination as specified in the hosts field. A routing rule consists of the destination where you want the traffic to go and any specified match conditions.

.Match condition

The first routing rule in the example has a condition that begins with the match field. In this example, this routing applies to all requests from the user `jason`. Add the `headers`, `end-user`, and `exact` fields to select the appropriate requests.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
      end-user:
        exact: jason
----

.Destination

The `destination` field in the route section specifies the actual destination for traffic that matches this condition. Unlike the virtual service’s host, the destination’s host must be a real destination that exists in the {ProductName} service registry. This can be a mesh service with proxies or a non-mesh service added using a service entry. In this example, the host name is a Kubernetes service name:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
      end-user:
        exact: jason
    route:
    - destination:
      host: reviews
      subset: v2
----

[id="ossm-routing-dr_{context}"]
=== Destination rules

Destination rules are applied after virtual service routing rules are evaluated, so they apply to the traffic’s real destination. Virtual services route traffic to a destination. Destination rules configure what happens to traffic at that destination.

[id="ossm-routing-lb_{context}"]
==== Load balancing options

By default, {ProductName} uses a round-robin load balancing policy, where each service instance in the pool gets a request in turn. {ProductName} also supports the following models, which you can specify in destination rules for requests to a particular service or service subset.

* Random: Requests are forwarded at random to instances in the pool.
* Weighted: Requests are forwarded to instances in the pool according to a specific percentage.
* Least requests: Requests are forwarded to instances with the least number of requests.

.Destination rule example

The following example destination rule configures three different subsets for the `my-svc` destination service, with different load balancing policies:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: my-destination-rule
spec:
  host: my-svc
  trafficPolicy:
    loadBalancer:
      simple: RANDOM
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
    trafficPolicy:
      loadBalancer:
        simple: ROUND_ROBIN
  - name: v3
    labels:
      version: v3
----

[id="ossm-routing-gw_{context}"]
=== Gateways

You can use a gateway to manage inbound and outbound traffic for your mesh to specify which traffic you want to enter or leave the mesh. Gateway configurations are applied to standalone Envoy proxies that are running at the edge of the mesh, rather than sidecar Envoy proxies running alongside your service workloads.

Unlike other mechanisms for controlling traffic entering your systems, such as the Kubernetes Ingress APIs, {ProductName} gateways allow you use the full power and flexibility of traffic routing. The {ProductName} gateway resource can layer 4-6 load balancing properties such as ports to expose and configure {ProductName} TLS settings. Instead of adding application-layer traffic routing (L7) to the same API resource, you can bind a regular {ProductName} virtual service to the gateway and manage gateway traffic like any other data plane traffic in a service mesh.

Gateways are primarily used to manage ingress traffic, but you can also configure egress gateways. An egress gateway enables you to configure a dedicated exit node for the traffic leaving the mesh. This enables you to limit which services have access to external networks, which adds security control to your service mesh. You can also use a gateway to configure a purely internal proxy.

.Gateway example

The following example shows a sample gateway configuration for external HTTPS ingress traffic:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ext-host-gwy
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway # use istio default controller
  servers:
  - port:
    number: 443
    name: https
    protocol: HTTPS
    hosts:
    - ext-host.example.com
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE
      serverCertificate: /tmp/tls.crt
      privateKey: /tmp/tls.key
----

This gateway configuration lets HTTPS traffic from `ext-host.example.com` into the mesh on port 443, but doesn’t specify any routing for the traffic.

To specify routing and for the gateway to work as intended, you must also bind the gateway to a virtual service. You do this using the virtual service’s gateways field, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: virtual-svc
spec:
  hosts:
  - ext-host.example.com
  gateways:
    - ext-host-gwy
----

You can then configure the virtual service with routing rules for the external traffic.

[id="ossm-routing-se_{context}"]
=== Service entries

A service entry adds an entry to the service registry that {ProductName} maintains internally. After you add the service entry, the Envoy proxies send traffic to the service as if it is a service in your mesh. Service entries allow you to do the following:

* Manage traffic for services that run outside of the service mesh.
* Redirect and forward traffic for external destinations (such as, APIs consumed from the web) or traffic to services in legacy infrastructure.
* Define retry, timeout, and fault injection policies for external destinations.
* Run a mesh service in a Virtual Machine (VM) by adding VMs to your mesh.

[NOTE]
====
Add services from a different cluster to the mesh to configure a multicluster {ProductName} mesh on Kubernetes.
====

.Service entry examples
The following example mesh-external service entry adds the `ext-resource` external dependency to the {ProductName} service registry:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: svc-entry
spec:
  hosts:
  - ext-svc.example.com
  ports:
  - number: 443
    name: https
    protocol: HTTPS
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  resolution: DNS
----

Specify the external resource using the hosts field. You can qualify it fully or use a wildcard prefixed domain name.

You can configure virtual services and destination rules to control traffic to a service entry in the same way you configure traffic for any other service in the mesh. For example, the following destination rule configures the traffic route to use mutual TLS to secure the connection to the `ext-svc.example.com` external service that is configured using the service entry:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: ext-res-dr
spec:
  host: ext-svc.example.com
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: MUTUAL
      clientCertificate: /etc/certs/myclientcert.pem
      privateKey: /etc/certs/client_private_key.pem
      caCertificates: /etc/certs/rootcacerts.pem
