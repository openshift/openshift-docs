= Manually approving a pending Operator upgrade

If an installed Operator has the approval strategy in its subscription set to *Manual*, when new updates are released in its current update channel, the update must be manually approved before installation can begin.

.Prerequisites

* An Operator previously installed using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Operators -> Installed Operators*.

. Operators that have a pending upgrade display a status with *Upgrade available*. Click the name of the Operator you want to upgrade.

. Click the *Subscription* tab. Any upgrades requiring approval are displayed next to *Upgrade Status*. For example, it might display *1 requires approval*.

. Click *1 requires approval*, then click *Preview Install Plan*.

. Review the resources that are listed as available for upgrade. When satisfied, click *Approve*.

. Navigate back to the *Operators -> Installed Operators* page to monitor the progress of the upgrade. When complete, the status changes to *Succeeded* and *Up to date*.
