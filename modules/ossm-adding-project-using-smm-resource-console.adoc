= Adding a project to the mesh using the ServiceMeshMember resource with the web console

You can add one or more projects to the mesh using the `ServiceMeshMember` resource with the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator.
* You know the name of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource and the name of the project that the resource belongs to.
* You know the name of the project you want to add to the mesh.
* A service mesh administrator must explicitly grant access to the service mesh. Administrators can grant users permissions to access the mesh by assigning them the `mesh-user` `Role` using a `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding`. For more information, see _Creating the {SMProductName} members_.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the *Project* menu and choose the project that you want to add to the mesh from the drop-down list. For example, `istio-system`.

. Click the {SMProductName} Operator.

. Click the *Istio Service Mesh Member* tab.

. Click *Create ServiceMeshMember*

. Accept the default name for the `ServiceMeshMember`.

. Click to expand *ControlPlaneRef*.

. In the *Namespace* field, select the project that the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource belongs to. For example, `istio-system`.

. In the *Name* field, enter the name of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource that this namespace belongs to. For example, `basic`.

. Click *Create*.

.Verification

. Confirm the `ServiceMeshMember` resource was created and that the project was added to the mesh by using the following steps:

.. Click the resource name, for example, `default`. 
.. View the *Conditions* section shown at the end of the screen. 
.. Confirm that the `Status` of the `Reconciled` and `Ready` conditions is `True`. 
+
If the `Status` is `False`, see the `Reason` and `Message` columns for more information.
