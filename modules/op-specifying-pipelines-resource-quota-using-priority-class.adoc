= Specifying pipelines resource quota using priority class

A `PriorityClass` object maps priority class names to the integer values that indicates their relative priorities. Higher values increase the priority of a class. After you create a priority class, you can create pods that specify the priority class name in their specifications. In addition, you can control a pod's consumption of system resources based on the pod's priority.

Specifying resource quota for a pipeline is similar to setting a resource quota for the subset of pods created by a pipeline run. The following steps provide an example of the workaround by specifying resource quota based on priority class.

.Procedure

. Create a priority class for a pipeline.
+
.Example: Priority class for a pipeline
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: pipeline1-pc
value: 1000000
description: "Priority class for pipeline1"
----

. Create a resource quota for a pipeline.
+

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: pipeline1-rq
spec:
  hard:
    cpu: "1000"
    memory: 200Gi
    pods: "10"
  scopeSelector:

.Sample output
----
Name:       pipeline1-rq
Namespace:  default
Resource    Used  Hard
--------    ----  ----
cpu         0     1k
memory      0     200Gi
pods        0     10
----
+
Because pods are not running, the quota is unused.

. Create the pipelines and tasks.

[NOTE]
====
The pipeline run might fail with an error: `failed quota: <quota name> must specify cpu, memory`.

To avoid this error, set a limit range for the namespace, where the defaults from the `LimitRange` object apply to pods created during the build process.

For more information about setting limit ranges, refer to _Restrict resource consumption with limit ranges_ in the _Additional resources_ section.
====

. After the pods are created, verify the resource quota usage for the pipeline run.

.Example: Verify resource quota usage for the pipeline

----
$ oc describe quota

.Sample output
----
Name:       pipeline1-rq

Resource    Used  Hard
--------    ----  ----
cpu         500m  1k
memory      10Gi  200Gi
pods        1     10
----

The output indicates that you can manage the combined resource quota for all concurrent running pods belonging to a priority class, by specifying the resource quota per priority class.
