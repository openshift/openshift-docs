|Clone existing PVC (creates PVC)
|Select an existing PVC available in the cluster and clone it.

|Import via Registry (creates PVC)
|Import content via container registry.

|Container (ephemeral)
|Upload content from a container located in a registry accessible from the cluster. The container disk should be used only for read-only filesystems such as CD-ROMs or temporary virtual machines.

|Name
|
|Name of the disk. The name can contain lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), hyphens (`-`), and periods (`.`), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, or special characters.

|Size
|
|Size of the disk in GiB.

|Type
|
|Type of disk. Example: Disk or CD-ROM

|Interface
|
|Type of disk device. Supported interfaces are *virtIO*, *SATA*, and *SCSI*.

|Storage Class
|
|The storage class that is used to create the disk.

a|Advanced -> Volume Mode
[NOTE]
====
Default values are used from the storage profile.
====
|
|Defines whether the persistent volume uses a formatted file system or raw block state. Default is *Filesystem*.

|Single User (RWO)
|The disk can be mounted as read/write by a single node.

|Shared Access (RWX)
|The disk can be mounted as read/write by many nodes.
ifeval::["{context}" != "virt-importing-rhv-vm"]
