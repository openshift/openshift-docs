|Name | Description

|Source
|Select a blank disk for the virtual machine or choose from the options available: *URL*,  *Container*, *Attach Cloned Disk*, or *Attach Disk*. To select an existing disk and attach it to the virtual machine, choose *Attach Cloned Disk* or *Attach Disk* from a list of available persistent volume claims (PVCs).

|Name
|Name of the disk. The name can contain lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), hyphens (`-`), and periods (`.`), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, or special characters.

|Size (GiB)
|Size, in GiB, of the disk.

|Interface
|Type of disk device. Supported interfaces are *virtIO*, *SATA*, and *SCSI*.

|Storage Class
|The storage class that is used to create the disk.

|Advanced -> Volume Mode
|Defines whether the persistent volume uses a formatted file system or raw block state. Default is *Filesystem*.
ifeval::["{context}" != "virt-importing-rhv-vm"]
|Advanced -> Access Mode
|Access mode of the persistent volume. Supported access modes are *ReadWriteOnce*, *ReadOnlyMany*, and *ReadWriteMany*.

== Advanced storage settings

ifeval::["{context}" != "virt-importing-rhv-vm"]
The following advanced storage settings are available for *Blank*, *Import via URL*, and *Clone existing PVC* disks. These parameters are optional. If you do not specify these parameters, the system uses the default values from the `kubevirt-storage-class-defaults` config map.

.2+|Volume Mode
|Filesystem
|Stores the virtual disk on a file system-based volume.

|Block
|Stores the virtual disk directly on the block volume. Only use `Block` if the underlying storage supports it.

|Single User (RWO)
|The disk can be mounted as read/write by a single node.

|Shared Access (RWX)
|The disk can be mounted as read/write by many nodes.

This is required for some features, such as live migration of virtual machines between nodes.

|Read Only (ROX)
|The disk can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
