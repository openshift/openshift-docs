= Connecting components within an application and across applications

In addition to grouping multiple components within an application, you can also use the *Topology* view to connect components with each other. You can either use a binding connector or a visual one to connect components.

When an application is connected to a service using a binding connector a `ServiceBindingRequest` is created with the necessary binding data. After the request is successful, the application is redeployed. A binding connection between the components can be established only if the target node is an Operator-backed service. This is indicated by the *Create a binding connector* tool-tip which appears when you drag an arrow to such a target node.

A visual connector establishes only a visual connection between the components, depicting an intent to connect. No interaction between the components is established. If the target node is not a binding Operator-backed service the *Create a visual connector* tool-tip is displayed when you drag an arrow to a target node.

== Creating a visual connection between components

You can connect a MongoDB service with a Node.js application visually as follows:

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have created and deployed a Node.js application using the *Developer* perspective.
* Ensure that you have created and deployed a MongoDB service using the *Developer* perspective.

.Procedure

. Hover over the MongoDB service to see a dangling arrow on the node.

. Click and drag the arrow towards the Node.js component to connect the MongoDB service with it.
. Click on the MongoDB service to see the *Overview* Panel. In the *Annotations* section, click the edit icon to see the *Key = `app.openshift.io/connects-to`* and *Value = `nodejs-ex`* annotation added to the service.

Similarly you can create other applications and components and establish connections between them.

== Creating a binding connection between components

[NOTE]
====
Currently, only a few specific Operators like the *etcd* and the *PostgresSQL Database* Operator's service instances are bindable.
====

To connect the Node.js component using a binding connector:

.Prerequisite
* Ensure that you have created and deployed a Node.js application using the *Developer* perspective.
* Ensure that you have installed the *Service Binding Operator* from *OperatorHub*.

.Procedure

. Install the DB Operator using a backing `OperatorSource`. A backing `OperatorSource` exposes the binding information in secrets, ConfigMaps, status, and spec attributes.
.. In the *Add* view, click the *YAML* option to see the *Import YAML* screen.
.. Add the following YAML file to apply the `OperatorSource`:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorSource
metadata:
 name: db-operators
 namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
 type: appregistry
 endpoint: https://quay.io/cnr
 registryNamespace: pmacik
----
.. Click *Create* to create the `OperatorSource` in your cluster.
. Install the *PostgreSQL Database* Operator:
.. In the *Administrator* perspective of the console, navigate to the *Operators -> OperatorHub*.
.. In the *Database* category, select the *PostgreSQL Database* Operator and install it.
. Create a database (DB) instance for the application:
.. Switch to the *Developer* perspective and ensure that you are in the appropriate project.
.. In the *Add* view, click the *YAML* option to see the *Import YAML* screen.
.. Add the service instance YAML in the editor and click *Create* to deploy the service. Following is an example of what the service YAML will look like:
+
[source,YAML]
----
apiVersion: postgresql.baiju.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Database
metadata:
 name: db-demo
 namespace: test-project
spec:
 image: docker.io/postgres
 imageName: postgres
 dbName: db-demo
----
A DB instance is now deployed in the *Topology* view.

. In the *Topology* view, hover over the Node.js component to see a dangling arrow on the node.
. Click and drag the arrow towards the *db-demo-postgresql* service to make a binding connection with the Node.js application. When an application is connected to a service using the binding connector a `ServiceBindingRequest` is created and the *Service Binding Operator* controller injects the DB connection information into the application `Deployment` as environment variables using an intermediate `Secret` called `binding-request`. After the request is successful, the application is redeployed.
