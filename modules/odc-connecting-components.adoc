= Connecting components within an application and across applications

In addition to grouping multiple components within an application, you can also use the *Topology* view to connect components with each other.
You can connect a MongoDB service with a Node.js application as follows:

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have created and deployed a Node.js application on {product-title} using the *Developer* perspective.
* Ensure that you have created and deployed a MongoDB service on {product-title} using the *Developer* perspective.

.Procedure

. Hover over the MongoDB service to see a dangling arrow on the node.

. Click and drag the arrow towards the Node.js component to connect the MongoDB service with it.
. Click on the MongoDB service to see the *Overview* Panel. In the *Annotations* section, click the edit icon to see the *Key = `app.openshift.io/connects-to`* and *Value = `nodejs-ex`* annotation added to the service.

Similarly you can create other applications and components and establish connections between them.
