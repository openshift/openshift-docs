= Associating your AWS account with your Red Hat organization

Before using {cluster-manager-first} to create {product-title} (ROSA) clusters that use the AWS Security Token Service (STS), create an {cluster-manager} IAM role and link it to your Red Hat organization. Then, create a user IAM role and link it to your Red Hat user account in the same Red Hat organization.

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the AWS prerequisites for ROSA with STS.
* You have available AWS service quotas.
* You have enabled the ROSA service in the AWS Console.
* You have installed and configured the latest ROSA CLI (`rosa`) on your installation host.
+
[NOTE]
====
To successfully install ROSA clusters, use the latest version of the ROSA CLI.
====
* You have logged in to your Red Hat account by using the `rosa` CLI.
* You have organization administrator privileges in your Red Hat organization.

.Procedure

. Create an {cluster-manager} role and link it to your Red Hat organization:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create ocm-role --admin
----
+
Select the default values at the prompts to quickly create and link the role.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to enable automatic deployment of the cluster-specific Operator roles and the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider using {cluster-manager}, you must apply the administrative privileges to the role. For more information about the basic and administrative privileges for the {cluster-manager} role, see _Understanding AWS account association_.
====

. Create a user role and link it to your {cluster-manager} user account:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create user-role
----
+
Select the default values at the prompts to quickly create and link the role

[NOTE]

The Red Hat user account must exist in the Red Hat organization that is linked to your {cluster-manager} role.
