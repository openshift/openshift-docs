Before using the {cluster-manager-first} {hybrid-console-second} to create 
ifdef::rosa-hcp[]
{hcp} for 
endif::rosa-hcp[]
{product-title} (ROSA) clusters that use the AWS Security Token Service (STS), create an {cluster-manager} IAM role and link it to your Red Hat organization. Then, create a user IAM role and link it to your Red Hat user account in the same Red Hat organization.

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the AWS prerequisites for  
ifdef::rosa-hcp[]
{hcp} for 
endif::rosa-hcp[]
ROSA with STS.
* You have available AWS service quotas.
* You have enabled the ROSA service in the AWS Console.
* You have installed and configured the latest ROSA CLI (`rosa`) on your installation host.
+
[NOTE]
====
To successfully install  
ifdef::rosa-hcp[]
{hcp} for 
endif::rosa-hcp[]
ROSA clusters, use the latest version of the ROSA CLI.
====
* You have logged in to your Red Hat account by using the `rosa` CLI.
* You have organization administrator privileges in your Red Hat organization.

.Procedure

. Create an {cluster-manager} role and link it to your Red Hat organization:
+
[NOTE]
====
To enable automatic deployment of the cluster-specific Operator roles and the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider using the {cluster-manager} {hybrid-console-second}, you must apply the administrative privileges to the role by choosing the _Admin OCM role_ command in the *Accounts and roles* step of creating a 
ifdef::rosa-hcp[]
{hcp} for 
endif::rosa-hcp[]
ROSA cluster. For more information about the basic and administrative privileges for the {cluster-manager} role, see _Understanding AWS account association_.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If you choose the _Basic OCM role_ command in the *Accounts and roles* step of creating a 
ifdef::rosa-hcp[]
{hcp} for 
endif::rosa-hcp[]
ROSA cluster in the {cluster-manager} {hybrid-console-second}, you must deploy a 
ifdef::rosa-hcp[]
{hcp} for 
endif::rosa-hcp[]
ROSA cluster using manual mode. You will be prompted to configure the cluster-specific Operator roles and the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider in a later step.

[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create ocm-role

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create user-role
----
+
Select the default values at the prompts to quickly create and link the role.
