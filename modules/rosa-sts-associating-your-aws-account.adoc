ifdef::rosa-hcp[]
{hcp-title}
endif::rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::rosa-hcp[]

.Procedure

. Create an {cluster-manager} role and link it to your Red Hat organization:
+
[NOTE]
====
To enable automatic deployment of the cluster-specific Operator roles and the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider using the {cluster-manager} {hybrid-console-second}, you must apply the administrative privileges to the role by choosing the _Admin OCM role_ command in the *Accounts and roles* step of creating a
ifdef::rosa-hcp[]
{hcp-title}
endif::rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::rosa-hcp[]
ROSA
endif::rosa-hcp[]
cluster. For more information about the basic and administrative privileges for the {cluster-manager} role, see _Understanding AWS account association_.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If you choose the _Basic OCM role_ command in the *Accounts and roles* step of creating a
ifdef::rosa-hcp[]
{hcp-title}
endif::rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::rosa-hcp[]
ROSA
endif::rosa-hcp[]
cluster in the {cluster-manager} {hybrid-console-second}, you must deploy a
ifdef::rosa-hcp[]
{hcp-title}
endif::rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::rosa-hcp[]
ROSA
endif::rosa-hcp[]
cluster using manual mode. You will be prompted to configure the cluster-specific Operator roles and the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider in a later step.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create ocm-role
----
+
Select the default values at the prompts to quickly create and link the role.
+
. Create a user role and link it to your {cluster-manager} user account:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create user-role
----
+
Select the default values at the prompts to quickly create and link the role.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Red Hat user account must exist in the Red Hat organization that is linked to your {cluster-manager} role.
