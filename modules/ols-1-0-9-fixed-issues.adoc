{ols-official} 1.0.9 fixes the following issues:

[NOTE]
====
Some linked Jira tickets are accessible only with {red-hat} credentials.

* Previously, you defined replicas in the `DeploymentConfig` and it was not obvious which pod each replica referred to. As a result, when you changed the replica count it was not clear which pod should be scaled. With this release, you configure replica count with each specific component's deployments: `APIContainer`, `ConsoleContainer`, and `DatabaseContainer`. This change allows you to specify the number of replicas for each pod. Note that the value for the number of replicas can only be changed for `APIContainer`. For all other containers, the number of replicas is fixed to `1`.

* Previously, support for custom HTTPS credentials for UI to backend communications was spread between two configurations: `UIDeployment` and `TLSConfig`. As a result, you had to ensure that both places are configured, which was error prone. With this release, support for custom HTTPS credentials for UI to backend communications is consolidated in one place, `TLSConfig`.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not provide `ca.crt` in the current implementation, the {ocp-product-title} Console proxy uses the default system trust store.

* Before this update, {ols-long} failed to handle unreachable MCP servers, resulting in loss of all tool functionality. With this release, {ols-long} isolates the failing MCP server, keeping other tools operational and preserving full assistant capabilities.
