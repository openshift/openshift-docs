= Setting a policy attribute and CPU feature

You can set a policy attribute and CPU feature for each virtual machine (VM) to ensure that it is scheduled on a node according to policy and feature. The CPU feature that you set is verified to ensure that it is supported by the host CPU or emulated by the hypervisor.

.Procedure

* Edit the `domain` spec of your VM configuration file. The following example sets the CPU feature and the `require` policy for a virtual machine instance (VMI):
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: myvmi
spec:
  domain:
    cpu:
      features:
      - name: apic <1>
        policy: require <2>
----
<1> Name of the CPU feature for the VM or VMI.
<2> Policy attribute for the VM or VMI.
