= Setting a policy attribute and CPU feature

[role="_abstract"]
You can set a policy attribute and CPU feature for each virtual machine (VM) to ensure that it is scheduled on a node according to policy and feature. The CPU feature that you set is verified to ensure that it is supported by the host CPU or emulated by the hypervisor.

.Procedure

* Edit the `domain` spec of your VM configuration file. The following example sets the CPU feature and the `require` policy for a virtual machine (VM):
