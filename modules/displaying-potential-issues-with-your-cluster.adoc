[role="_abstract"]
This section describes how to display the {red-hat-lightspeed} report in *{red-hat-lightspeed} Advisor* on {cluster-manager-url}.

Note that {red-hat-lightspeed} repeatedly analyzes your cluster and shows the latest results. These results can change, for example, if you fix an issue or a new issue has been detected.

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster is registered on {cluster-manager-url}.
* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to {cluster-manager-url}.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Advisor* -> *Recommendations* on {cluster-manager-url}.
+
Depending on the result, the {red-hat-lightspeed} advisor service displays one of the following:
+
* *No matching recommendations found*, if {red-hat-lightspeed} did not identify any issues.
+
* A list of issues {red-hat-lightspeed} has detected, grouped by risk (low, moderate, important, and critical).
+
* *No clusters yet*, if {red-hat-lightspeed} has not yet analyzed the cluster. The analysis starts shortly after the cluster has been installed, registered, and connected to the internet.

. If any issues are displayed, click the *>* icon in front of the entry for more details.
+
Depending on the issue, the details can also contain a link to more information from Red Hat about the issue.
