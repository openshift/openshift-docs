= Displaying potential issues with your cluster

This section describes how to display the Insights report in the {cloud-redhat-com}.

Note that Insights repeatedly analyzes your cluster and shows the latest results. These results can change, for example, if you fix an issue or a new issue has been detected.

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster is registered in the {cloud-redhat-com}.
* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[{cloud-redhat-com}].

.Procedure

. Click the *Clusters* menu in the left pane.

. Click the cluster's name to display the details of the cluster.

. Open the *Insights* tab of the cluster.
+
Depending on the result, the tab displays one of the following:
+
* *Your cluster passed all health checks*, if Insights did not identify any issues.

* A list of issues Insights has detected, prioritized by risk (low, moderate, important, and critical).

* *No health checks to display*, if Insights has not yet analyzed the cluster. The analysis starts shortly after the cluster has been installed and connected to the internet.

. If any issues are displayed on the tab, click the *>* icon in front of the entry for further details.
+
Depending on the issue, the details can also contain a link to an Red Hat Knowledge Base article. For details and information on how to solve the problem, click *How to remediate this issue*.
