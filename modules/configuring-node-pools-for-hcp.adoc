= Configuring node pools for hosted control planes

On hosted control planes, you can configure node pools by creating a `MachineConfig` object inside of a config map in the management cluster.

//.Prerequisites

//Are any prerequisites needed for this procedure? i.e., does the customer need to perform an update first?

.Procedure

. To create a `MachineConfig` object inside of a config map in the management cluster, enter the following information:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: <configmap-name>
  namespace: clusters
data:
  config: |
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: MachineConfig
    metadata:
      labels:
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
      name: <machineconfig-name>
    spec:
      config:
        ignition:
          version: 3.2.0
        storage:
          files:
          - contents:
              source: data:...
            mode: 420
            overwrite: true
            path: ${PATH} <1>
----
<1> Sets the path on the node where the `MachineConfig` object is stored.

. After you add the object to the config map, you can apply the config map to the node pool as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  config:
    - name: ${CONFIGMAP_NAME}
----

//.Verification

// Does the user need to do anything to verify that the procedure was successful?
