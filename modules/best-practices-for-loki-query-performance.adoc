= Best practices for Loki query performance

You can take the following steps to improve Loki query performance:

* Ensure that you are running the latest version of the {loki-op}.

* Ensure that you have migrated LokiStack schema to the `v13` version.

* Ensure that you use reliable and fast object storage. Loki places significant demands on object storage.
If you are not using an object store solution from a cloud provider, use solid-state drive (SSD) for your object storage.
By using SSDs you can benefit from the high parallelization capabilities of Loki.
+
To better understand the utilization of object storage by Loki, you can use the following query in the *Metrics* dashboard in the {ocp-product-title} web console:
+

----
sum by(status, container, operation) (label_replace(rate(loki_s3_request_duration_seconds_count{namespace="openshift-logging"}[5m]), "status", "${1}xx", "status_code", "([0-9]).."))
----

* {loki-op} enables automatic stream sharding by default. The default automatic stream sharding mechanism should be adequate in most cases and users should not need to configure `perStream*` attributes.

* If you use the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) data model, you can configure additional stream labels in LokiStack. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_logging/latest/html/configuring/configuring-the-log-store#best-practices-for-loki-labels_loki-query-performance-troubleshooting[Best practices for Loki labels].

* Different types of queries have different performance characteristics. Use simple filter queries instead of regular expressions for better performance.
