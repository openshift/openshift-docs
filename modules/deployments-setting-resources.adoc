= Setting deployment resources

A deployment is completed by a pod that consumes resources (memory, CPU, and ephemeral storage) on a node. By default, pods consume unbounded node resources. However, if a project specifies default container limits, then pods consume resources up to those limits.

[NOTE]
====
The minimum memory limit for a deployment is 12 MB. If a container fails to start due to a `Cannot allocate memory` pod event, the memory limit is too low. Either increase or remove the memory limit. Removing the limit allows pods to consume unbounded node resources.
====

You can also limit resource use by specifying resource limits as part of the deployment strategy. Deployment resources can be used with the recreate, rolling, or custom deployment strategies.

.Procedure

. In the following example, each of `resources`, `cpu`, `memory`, and `ephemeral-storage` is optional:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: hello-openshift
# ...
spec:
# ...
  type: "Recreate"
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: "100m" <1>
      memory: "256Mi" <2>
      ephemeral-storage: "1Gi" <3>
----
<1> `cpu` is in CPU units: `100m` represents 0.1 CPU units (100 * 1e-3).
<2> `memory` is in bytes: `256Mi` represents 268435456 bytes (256 * 2 ^ 20).
<3> `ephemeral-storage` is in bytes: `1Gi` represents 1073741824 bytes (2 ^ 30).
+
However, if a quota has been defined for your project, one of the following two items is required:
+
--
- A `resources` section set with an explicit `requests`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: hello-openshift
# ...
spec:
# ...
  type: "Recreate"
  resources:
    requests: <1>
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "256Mi"
      ephemeral-storage: "1Gi"
----
<1> The `requests` object contains the list of resources that correspond to the list of resources in the quota.

- A limit range defined in your project, where the defaults from the `LimitRange` object apply to pods created during the deployment process.
--
+
To set deployment resources, choose one of the above options. Otherwise, deploy pod creation fails, citing a failure to satisfy quota.
