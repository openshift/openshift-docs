= Enabling mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)

Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) is a protocol where two parties authenticate each other. It is the default mode of authentication in some protocols (IKE, SSH) and optional in others (TLS).

MTLS can be used without changes to the application or service code. The TLS is handled entirely by the service mesh infrastructure and between the two sidecar proxies.

By default, {ProductName} is set to permissive mode, where the sidecars in {ProductShortName} accept both plain-text traffic and connections that are encrypted using mTLS. If a service in your mesh is communicating with a service outside the mesh, strict mTLS could break communication between those services. Use permissive mode while you migrate your workloads to {ProductShortName}.

[id="ossm-security-enabling-strict-mtls_{context}"]
== Enabling strict mTLS across the mesh

You can quickly enable mTLS across your mesh if your workloads do not communicate with outside services, and communication will not be interrupted by accepting only encrypted connections. Set `spec.security.controlPlane.mtls` to `true` in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. The operator creates the required resources.

=== Configuring sidecars for incoming connections for specific services

You can also configure mTLS for individual services or namespaces by creating a policy.

[id="ossm-security-min-max-tls_{context}"]
== Setting the minimum and maximum protocol versions

If your environment has specific requirements for encrypted traffic in your service mesh, you can control the cryptographic functions that are allowed by setting the `spec.security.controlPlane.tls.minProtocolVersion` or `spec.security.controlPlane.tls.maxProtocolVersion` in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. Those values, configured in your control plane resource, define the minimum and maximum TLS version used by mesh components when communicating securely over TLS.
