= Enabling mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)

Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) is a protocol where two parties authenticate each other. It is the default mode of authentication in some protocols (IKE, SSH) and optional in others (TLS). mTLS can be used without changes to the application or service code. The TLS is handled entirely by the service mesh infrastructure and between the two sidecar proxies.

By default, mTLS in {ProductName} is enabled and set to permissive mode, where the sidecars in {ProductShortName} accept both plain-text traffic and connections that are encrypted using mTLS. If a service in your mesh is communicating with a service outside the mesh, strict mTLS could break communication between those services. Use permissive mode while you migrate your workloads to {ProductShortName}. Then, you can enable strict mTLS across your mesh, namespace, or application.

Enabling mTLS across your mesh at the control plane level secures all the traffic in your mesh without rewriting your applications and workflows. You can secure namespaces in your mesh at the data plane level in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource or at the application level with `PeerAuthentication` and `DestinationRule` resources to configure how incoming and outgoing connections encrypt traffic.

== Enabling strict mTLS across the mesh

You can quickly enable mTLS across your mesh if your workloads do not communicate with outside services, and communication will not be interrupted by accepting only encrypted connections. mTLS for all data plane communication is disabled by default. You can enable it by setting `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls` to `true` in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. The Operator creates the required resources.

apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
spec:
  version: v2.0

    dataPlane:
      mtls: true

You can also enable mTLS by using the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Log in to the web console.

. Click the *Project* menu and choose the `istio-system` project from the list.

. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click on *Service Mesh Control Plane* under *Provided APIs*.

. Click the name of your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, for example, `production`.

. On the Details page, click the toggle in the *Security* section for *Data Plane Security*.

=== Configuring sidecars for incoming connections for specific services

You can also configure mTLS for individual services or namespaces by creating a policy.

  name: default
  namespace: <namespace>

[NOTE]
====
If you are not using automatic mTLS and you are setting PeerAuthentication to STRICT, you must create a `DestinationRule` resource for your service.

[id="ossm-security-mtls-sidecars-outgoing_{context}"]
== Configuring sidecars for outgoing connections

Create a destination rule to configure {ProductShortName} to use mTLS when sending requests to other services in the mesh.

[id="ossm-security-min-max-tls_{context}"]
== Setting the minimum and maximum protocol versions

If your environment has specific requirements for encrypted traffic in your service mesh, you can control the cryptographic functions that are allowed by setting the `spec.security.controlPlane.tls.minProtocolVersion` or `spec.security.controlPlane.tls.maxProtocolVersion` in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. Those values, configured in your control plane resource, define the minimum and maximum TLS version used by mesh components when communicating securely over TLS.

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
spec:
  security:
    controlPlane:
      tls:
        minProtocolVersion: TLSv1_2

The default is `TLS_AUTO` and does not specify a version of TLS.

.Valid values

|`TLS_AUTO`
| default

|`TLSv1_0`
|TLS version 1.0

|`TLSv1_1`
|TLS version 1.1

== Enabling strict mTLS for Mixer telemetry or policy components

Secure connections are always used when proxies communicate with the control plane regardless of the `spec.security.controlPlane.mtls` setting. If you use Mixer telemetry or policy, set `spec.security.controlPlane.mtls` to `true` in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to enable strict mTLS.
