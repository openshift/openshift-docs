| `hosts` |  | Details about bare metal hosts to use to build the cluster.
| `defaultMachinePlatform` | | The default configuration used for machine pools without a platform configuration.
| `apiVIP` | `api.<clusterdomain>` | The VIP to use for internal API communication.

This setting must either be provided or pre-configured in DNS so that the
default name resolve correctly.

The `hosts` parameter is a list of separate bare metal assets that should be used to build the cluster.

|===
|Name |Default |Description
| `name` |  | The name of the `BareMetalHost` resource to associate with the details.
| `role` |  | Either `master` or `worker`.
| `bmc` | | Connection details for the baseboard management controller. See below for details.
| `bootMACAddress` |  | The MAC address of the NIC the host will use to boot on the provisioning network.
|===

The `bmc` parameter for each host is a set of values for accessing the baseboard management controller in the host.

|===
|Name |Default |Description

.BMC addressing

Keep the following in mind when providing values for the `bmc` `address` field.

* The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL with details for connecting to the controller,
including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

* IPMI hosts use `ipmi://<host>:<port>`. An unadorned `<host>:<port>` is also accepted.
If the port is omitted, the default of 623 is used.

* Dell iDRAC hosts use `idrac://` (or `idrac+http://` to disable TLS).

* Fujitsu iRMC hosts use `irmc://<host>:<port>`, where `<port>` is optional if using the default.

* For Redfish, use `redfish://` (or `redfish+http://` to disable TLS).
The hostname (or IP address) and the path to the system ID are both required.
For example, `redfish://myhost.example/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1`
or `redfish://myhost.example/redfish/v1/Systems/1`.
