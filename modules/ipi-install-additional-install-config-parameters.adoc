.Required parameters
|===
|Parameters |Default |Description


| `baseDomain`
|
| The domain name for the cluster. For example, `example.com`.

| `bootMode`
| `UEFI`
| The boot mode for a node. Options are `legacy`, `UEFI`, and `UEFISecureBoot`. If `bootMode` is not set, Ironic sets it while inspecting the node.

| `bootstrapExternalStaticDNS`
|
| The static network DNS of the bootstrap node. You must set this value when deploying a cluster with static IP addresses when there is no Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server on the bare-metal network. If you do not set this value, the installation program will use the value from `bootstrapExternalStaticGateway`, which causes problems when the IP address values of the gateway and DNS are different.

| `bootstrapExternalStaticIP`
|
| The static IP address for the bootstrap VM. You must set this value when deploying a cluster with static IP addresses when there is no DHCP server on the bare-metal network.

| `bootstrapExternalStaticGateway`
|
| The static IP address of the gateway for the bootstrap VM. You must set this value when deploying a cluster with static IP addresses when there is no DHCP server on the bare-metal network.

| `sshKey`
|
| The `sshKey` configuration setting contains the key in the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file required to access the control plane nodes and worker nodes. Typically, this key is from the `provisioner` node.

| `pullSecret`
|
| The `pullSecret` configuration setting contains a copy of the pull secret downloaded from the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/metal/user-provisioned[Install OpenShift on Bare Metal] page when preparing the provisioner node.


a|
----
metadata:
    name:
----
|
|The name to be given to the {product-title} cluster. For example, `openshift`.


a|
----
networking:
    machineNetwork:
    - cidr:
----
|
|The public CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) of the external network. For example, `10.0.0.0/24`.

a|
----
compute:
  - name: worker
----
|
|The {product-title} cluster requires a name be provided for worker (or compute) nodes even if there are zero nodes.


a|
----
compute:
    replicas: 2
----
|
|Replicas sets the number of worker (or compute) nodes in the {product-title} cluster.


a|
----
controlPlane:
    name: master
----
|
|The {product-title} cluster requires a name for control plane (master) nodes.


a|
----
controlPlane:
    replicas: 3
----
|
|Replicas sets the number of control plane (master) nodes included as part of the {product-title} cluster.

a| `provisioningNetworkInterface` |  | The name of the network interface on nodes connected to the provisioning network. For {product-title} 4.9 and later releases, use the `bootMACAddress` configuration setting to enable Ironic to identify the IP address of the NIC instead of using the `provisioningNetworkInterface` configuration setting to identify the name of the NIC.


| `defaultMachinePlatform` | | The default configuration used for machine pools without a platform configuration.

| `apiVIPs` | a| (Optional) The virtual IP address for Kubernetes API communication.

This setting must either be provided in the `install-config.yaml` file as a reserved IP from the MachineNetwork or preconfigured in the DNS so that the default name resolves correctly. Use the virtual IP address and not the FQDN when adding a value to the `apiVIPs` configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml` file. The primary IP address must be from the IPv4 network when using dual stack networking. If not set, the installation program uses `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` to derive the IP address from the DNS.

[NOTE]
====
Before {product-title} 4.12, the cluster installation program only accepted an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address for the `apiVIP` configuration setting. From {product-title} 4.12 or later, the `apiVIP` configuration setting is deprecated. Instead, use a list format for the `apiVIPs` configuration setting to specify an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address or both IP address formats.
====


| `disableCertificateVerification` | `False` | `redfish` and `redfish-virtualmedia` need this parameter to manage BMC addresses. The value should be `True` when using a self-signed certificate for BMC addresses.

| `ingressVIPs` | a| (Optional) The virtual IP address for ingress traffic.

This setting must either be provided in the `install-config.yaml` file as a reserved IP from the MachineNetwork or preconfigured in the DNS so that the default name resolves correctly. Use the virtual IP address and not the FQDN when adding a value to the `ingressVIPs` configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml` file. The primary IP address must be from the IPv4 network when using dual stack networking. If not set, the installation program uses `test.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` to derive the IP address from the DNS.

[NOTE]
====
Before {product-title} 4.12, the cluster installation program only accepted an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address for the `ingressVIP` configuration setting. In {product-title} 4.12 and later, the `ingressVIP` configuration setting is deprecated. Instead, use a list format for the `ingressVIPs` configuration setting to specify an IPv4 addresses, an IPv6 addresses or both IP address formats.

.Optional Parameters
|===
|Parameters
|Default
|Description

|`provisioningDHCPRange`
|`172.22.0.10,172.22.0.100`
|Defines the IP range for nodes on the provisioning network.

a|`provisioningNetworkCIDR`
|`172.22.0.0/24`
|The CIDR for the network to use for provisioning. This option is required when not using the default address range on the provisioning network.

|`clusterProvisioningIP`
|The third IP address of the `provisioningNetworkCIDR`.
|The IP address within the cluster where the provisioning services run. Defaults to the third IP address of the provisioning subnet. For example, `172.22.0.3`.

|`bootstrapProvisioningIP`
|The second IP address of the `provisioningNetworkCIDR`.
|The IP address on the bootstrap VM where the provisioning services run while the installer is deploying the control plane (master) nodes. Defaults to the second IP address of the provisioning subnet. For example, `172.22.0.2` or `2620:52:0:1307::2`.

| `externalBridge`
| `baremetal`
| The name of the bare-metal bridge of the hypervisor attached to the bare-metal network.

| `provisioningBridge`
| `provisioning`
| The name of the provisioning bridge on the `provisioner` host attached to the provisioning network.

|`architecture`
|
|Defines the host architecture for your cluster. Valid values are `amd64` or `arm64`.

| `defaultMachinePlatform`
|
| The default configuration used for machine pools without a platform configuration.

| `bootstrapOSImage`
|
| A URL to override the default operating system image for the bootstrap node. The URL must contain a SHA-256 hash of the image. For example:
`https://mirror.openshift.com/rhcos-<version>-qemu.qcow2.gz?sha256=<uncompressed_sha256>`.

| `provisioningNetwork`
|
| The `provisioningNetwork` configuration setting determines whether the cluster uses the provisioning network. If it does, the configuration setting also determines if the cluster manages the network.

`Disabled`: Set this parameter to `Disabled` to disable the requirement for a provisioning network. When set to `Disabled`, you must only use virtual media based provisioning, or bring up the cluster using the assisted installer. If `Disabled` and using power management, BMCs must be accessible from the bare-metal network. If `Disabled`, you must provide two IP addresses on the bare-metal network that are used for the provisioning services.

`Managed`: Set this parameter to `Managed`, which is the default, to fully manage the provisioning network, including DHCP, TFTP, and so on.

`Unmanaged`: Set this parameter to `Unmanaged` to enable the provisioning network but take care of manual configuration of DHCP. Virtual media provisioning is recommended but PXE is still available if required.

| `httpProxy`
|
| Set this parameter to the appropriate HTTP proxy used within your environment.

| `httpsProxy`
|
| Set this parameter to the appropriate HTTPS proxy used within your environment.

| `noProxy`
|
| Set this parameter to the appropriate list of exclusions for proxy usage within your environment.
