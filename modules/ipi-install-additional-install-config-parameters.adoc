See the following tables for the required parameters, the `hosts` parameter,
and the `bmc` parameter for the `install-config.yaml` file.

[options="header"]
.Required parameters
|===
|Parameters |Default |Description


| `baseDomain`
|
| The domain name for the cluster. For example, `example.com`.

| `bootMode`
| `UEFI`
| The boot mode for a node. Options are `legacy`, `UEFI`, and `UEFISecureBoot`. If `bootMode` is not set, Ironic sets it while inspecting the node.

| `sshKey`
|
| The `sshKey` configuration setting contains the key in the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file required to access the control plane nodes and worker nodes. Typically, this key is from the `provisioner` node.

| `pullSecret`
|
| The `pullSecret` configuration setting contains a copy of the pull secret downloaded from the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/metal/user-provisioned[Install OpenShift on Bare Metal] page when preparing the provisioner node.


a|
----
metadata:
    name:
----
|
|The name to be given to the {product-title} cluster. For example, `openshift`.


a|
----
networking:
    machineCIDR:
----
|
|The public CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) of the external network. For example, `10.0.0.0/24`
ifdef::upstream[]
ifeval::[{product-version} >= 4.5]
or `2620:52:0:1302::/64`
endif::[]
endif::[]
.

a|
----
compute:
  - name: worker
----
|
|The {product-title} cluster requires a name be provided for worker (or compute) nodes even if there are zero nodes.


a|
----
compute:
    replicas: 2
----
|
|Replicas sets the number of worker (or compute) nodes in the {product-title} cluster.


a|
----
controlPlane:
    name: master
----
|
|The {product-title} cluster requires a name for control plane (master) nodes.


a|
----
controlPlane:
    replicas: 3
----
|
|Replicas sets the number of control plane (master) nodes included as part of the {product-title} cluster.

a| `provisioningNetworkInterface` |  | The name of the network interface on nodes connected to the `provisioning` network. For {product-title} 4.9 and later releases, use the `bootMACAddress` configuration setting to enable Ironic to identify the IP address of the NIC instead of using the `provisioningNetworkInterface` configuration setting to identify the name of the NIC.


| `defaultMachinePlatform` | | The default configuration used for machine pools without a platform configuration.

| `apiVIP` | | (Optional) The virtual IP address for Kubernetes API communication.

This setting must either be provided in the `install-config.yaml` file as a reserved IP from the MachineNetwork or pre-configured in the DNS so that the default name resolves correctly. Use the virtual IP address and not the FQDN when adding a value to the `apiVIP` configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml` file. The IP address must be from the primary IPv4 network when using dual stack networking. If not set, the installer uses `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` to derive the IP address from the DNS.

| `disableCertificateVerification` | `False` | `redfish` and `redfish-virtualmedia` need this parameter to manage BMC addresses. The value should be `True` when using a self-signed certificate for BMC addresses.

| `ingressVIP` | | (Optional) The virtual IP address for ingress traffic.

This setting must either be provided in the `install-config.yaml` file as a reserved IP from the MachineNetwork or pre-configured in the DNS so that the default name resolves correctly. Use the virtual IP address and not the FQDN when adding a value to the `ingressVIP` configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml` file. The IP address must be from the primary IPv4 network when using dual stack networking. If not set, the installer uses `test.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` to derive the IP address from the DNS.

.Optional Parameters
|===
|Parameters
|Default
|Description

|`provisioningDHCPRange`
|`172.22.0.10,172.22.0.100`
|Defines the IP range for nodes on the `provisioning` network.

a|`provisioningNetworkCIDR`
|`172.22.0.0/24`
|The CIDR for the network to use for provisioning. This option is required when not using the default address range on the `provisioning` network.

|`clusterProvisioningIP`
|The third IP address of the `provisioningNetworkCIDR`.
|The IP address within the cluster where the provisioning services run. Defaults to the third IP address of the `provisioning` subnet. For example, `172.22.0.3`.

|`bootstrapProvisioningIP`
|The second IP address of the `provisioningNetworkCIDR`.
|The IP address on the bootstrap VM where the provisioning services run while the installer is deploying the control plane (master) nodes. Defaults to the second IP address of the `provisioning` subnet. For example, `172.22.0.2` or `2620:52:0:1307::2`.

| `externalBridge`
| `baremetal`
| The name of the `baremetal` bridge of the hypervisor attached to the `baremetal` network.

| `provisioningBridge`
| `provisioning`
| The name of the `provisioning` bridge on the `provisioner` host attached to the `provisioning` network.

| `defaultMachinePlatform`
|
| The default configuration used for machine pools without a platform configuration.

| `bootstrapOSImage`
|
| A URL to override the default operating system image for the bootstrap node. The URL must contain a SHA-256 hash of the image. For example:
`https://mirror.openshift.com/rhcos-<version>-qemu.qcow2.gz?sha256=<uncompressed_sha256>`.

| `clusterOSImage`
|
| A URL to override the default operating system for cluster nodes. The URL must include a SHA-256 hash of the image. For example,  `https://mirror.openshift.com/images/rhcos-<version>-openstack.qcow2.gz?sha256=<compressed_sha256>`.


| `provisioningNetwork`
|
| The `provisioningNetwork` configuration setting determines whether the cluster uses the `provisioning` network. If it does, the configuration setting also determines if the cluster manages the network.

`Disabled`: Set this parameter to `Disabled` to disable the requirement for a `provisioning` network. When set to `Disabled`, you must only use virtual media based provisioning, or bring up the cluster using the assisted installer. If `Disabled` and using power management, BMCs must be accessible from the `baremetal` network. If `Disabled`, you must provide two IP addresses on the `baremetal` network that are used for the provisioning services.

`Managed`: Set this parameter to `Managed`, which is the default, to fully manage the provisioning network, including DHCP, TFTP, and so on.

`Unmanaged`: Set this parameter to `Unmanaged` to enable the provisioning network but take care of manual configuration of DHCP. Virtual media provisioning is recommended but PXE is still available if required.

| `httpProxy`
|
| Set this parameter to the appropriate HTTP proxy used within your environment.

| `httpsProxy`
|
| Set this parameter to the appropriate HTTPS proxy used within your environment.

| `noProxy`
|
| Set this parameter to the appropriate list of exclusions for proxy usage within your environment.

[discrete]
== Hosts

The `hosts` parameter is a list of separate bare metal assets used to build the cluster.

[width="100%", cols="3,2,5",  options="header"]
.Hosts
|===
|Name |Default |Description
| `name`
|
| The name of the `BareMetalHost` resource to associate with the details. For example, `openshift-master-0`.


| `role`
|
| The role of the bare metal node. Either `master` or `worker`.


| `bmc`
|
| Connection details for the baseboard management controller. See the BMC addressing section for additional details.


| `bootMACAddress`
|
| The MAC address of the NIC that the host uses for the `provisioning` network. Ironic retrieves the IP address using the `bootMACAddress` configuration setting. Then, it binds to the host.
