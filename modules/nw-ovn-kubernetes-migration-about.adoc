= Offline migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin overview

The offline migration method is a manual process that includes some downtime, during which your cluster is unreachable. This method is primarily used for self-managed {product-title} deployments.

Although a rollback procedure is provided, the offline migration is intended to be a one-way process.

////
[IMPORTANT]
====
Migrating to or from the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin is not supported for managed OpenShift cloud services such as {product-dedicated}, Azure Red Hat OpenShift(ARO), and Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).

The following sections provide more information about the offline migration method.

== Supported platforms when using the offline migration method

The following table provides information about the supported platforms for the offline migration type.

== Considerations for offline migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin

If you have more than 150 nodes in your {product-title} cluster, then open a support case for consultation on your migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.

The subnets assigned to nodes and the IP addresses assigned to individual pods are not preserved during the migration.

While the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin implements many of the capabilities present in the OpenShift SDN network plugin, the configuration is not the same.

* If your cluster uses any of the following OpenShift SDN network plugin capabilities, you must manually configure the same capability in the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin:
+
--
* Namespace isolation
* Egress router pods
--

* OVN-Kubernetes, the default network provider in {product-title} 4.14 and later versions, uses the following IP address ranges internally: `100.64.0.0/16`, `169.254.169.0/29`, `100.88.0.0/16`, `fd98::/64`, `fd69::/125`, and `fd97::/64`. If your cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes, do not include any of these IP address ranges in any other CIDR definitions in your cluster or infrastructure.

The following sections highlight the differences in configuration between the aforementioned capabilities in OVN-Kubernetes and OpenShift SDN network plugins.

[discrete]
[id="namespace-isolation_{context}"]
=== Namespace isolation

OVN-Kubernetes supports only the network policy isolation mode.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For a cluster using OpenShift SDN that is configured in either the multitenant or subnet isolation mode, you can still migrate to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin. Note that after the migration operation, multitenant isolation mode is dropped, so you must manually configure network policies to achieve the same level of project-level isolation for pods and services.
====

[discrete]
[id="egress-ip-addresses_{context}"]
=== Egress IP addresses

OpenShift SDN supports two different Egress IP modes:

* In the _automatically assigned_ approach, an egress IP address range is assigned to a node.
* In the _manually assigned_ approach, a list of one or more egress IP addresses is assigned to a node.

The migration process supports migrating Egress IP configurations that use the automatically assigned mode.

The differences in configuring an egress IP address between OVN-Kubernetes and OpenShift SDN is described in the following table:

.Differences in egress IP address configuration
[cols="1a,1a",options="header"]
|===
|OVN-Kubernetes|OpenShift SDN

|
* Create an `EgressIPs` object
* Add an annotation on a `Node` object

|
* Patch a `NetNamespace` object
* Patch a `HostSubnet` object
|===

For more information on using egress IP addresses in OVN-Kubernetes, see "Configuring an egress IP address".

[discrete]
[id="egress-network-policies_{context}"]
=== Egress network policies

The difference in configuring an egress network policy, also known as an egress firewall, between OVN-Kubernetes and OpenShift SDN is described in the following table:

.Differences in egress network policy configuration
[cols="1a,1a",options="header"]
|===
|OVN-Kubernetes|OpenShift SDN

|
* Create an `EgressFirewall` object in a namespace

|
* Create an `EgressNetworkPolicy` object in a namespace
|===

[NOTE]
====
Because the name of an `EgressFirewall` object can only be set to `default`, after the migration all migrated `EgressNetworkPolicy` objects are named `default`, regardless of what the name was under OpenShift SDN.

If you subsequently rollback to OpenShift SDN, all `EgressNetworkPolicy` objects are named `default` as the prior name is lost.

For more information on using an egress firewall in OVN-Kubernetes, see "Configuring an egress firewall for a project".

[discrete]
[id="egress-router-pods_{context}"]
=== Egress router pods

OVN-Kubernetes supports egress router pods in redirect mode. OVN-Kubernetes does not support egress router pods in HTTP proxy mode or DNS proxy mode.

When you deploy an egress router with the Cluster Network Operator, you cannot specify a node selector to control which node is used to host the egress router pod.

[discrete]
[id="multicast_{context}"]
=== Multicast

The difference between enabling multicast traffic on OVN-Kubernetes and OpenShift SDN is described in the following table:

.Differences in multicast configuration
[cols="1a,1a",options="header"]
|===
|OVN-Kubernetes|OpenShift SDN

|
* Add an annotation on a `Namespace` object

|
* Add an annotation on a `NetNamespace` object
|===

For more information on using multicast in OVN-Kubernetes, see "Enabling multicast for a project".

[discrete]
[id="network-policies_{context}"]
=== Network policies

OVN-Kubernetes fully supports the Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` API in the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API group. No changes are necessary in your network policies when migrating from OpenShift SDN.
