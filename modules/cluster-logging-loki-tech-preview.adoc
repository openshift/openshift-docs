== Deploying the Lokistack
You can use the {product-title} web console to install the Loki Operator.

.Prerequisites

* {product-title}: 4.13
* {logging-title-uc}: 5.4

To install the Loki Operator using the {product-title} web console:

. Install the Loki Operator:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose  *Loki Operator* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.

.. Under *Installation Mode*, select *All namespaces on the cluster*.

.. Under *Installed Namespace*, select *openshift-operators-redhat*.
+
You must specify the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace. The `openshift-operators`
namespace might contain Community Operators, which are untrusted and could publish
a metric with the same name as an {product-title} metric, which would cause
conflicts.

.. Select *Enable operator recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace*.
+
This option sets the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label in the Namespace object.
You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring
scrapes the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace.

.. Select an *Approval Strategy*.
+
* The *Automatic* strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
+
* The *Manual* strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.

.. Click *Install*.

.. Verify that you installed the Loki Operator. Visit the *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators* page and look for "Loki Operator."

.. Ensure that *Loki Operator* is listed in all the projects whose *Status* is *Succeeded*.
