= Information collected by the {insights-operator}

[role="_abstract"]
The following information is collected by the {insights-operator}:

* General information about your cluster and its components to identify issues that are specific to your {product-title} version and environment.
* Configuration files, such as the image registry configuration, of your cluster to determine incorrect settings and issues that are specific to parameters you set.
* Errors that occur in the cluster components.
* Progress information of running updates, and the status of any component upgrades.
* Details of the platform that {product-title} is deployed on and the region that the cluster is located in

* Cluster workload information transformed into discreet Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) values, which allows Red{nbsp}Hat to assess workloads for security and version vulnerabilities without disclosing sensitive details.
* Workload information about the operating system and runtime environment, including runtime kinds, names, and version. This data gives Red{nbsp}Hat a better understanding of how you use {product-title} containers so that we can proactively help you make investment decisions to drive optimal utilization.

* If an Operator reports an issue, information is collected about core {product-title} pods in the `openshift-&#42;` and `kube-&#42;` projects. This includes state, resource, security context, volume information, and more.
