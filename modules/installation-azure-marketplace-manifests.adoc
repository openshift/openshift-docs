= Updating manifests for Marketplace installation
If you selected a Marketplace image for installation, you must create and modify the manifests to use the Marketplace image. 

.Prerequisites

* You have created the `install-config.yaml` file and completed any modifications to it.

.Procedure

* Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_dir>
----
+
* Edit the `.spec.template.spec.providerSpec.value.image` property of the compute machine set definitions, replacing the `offer`, `publisher`, `sku`, and `version` values with the details gathered in the section titled "Selecting an Azure Marketplace image". These are the three files that must be updated:
** `<installation_dir>/man/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-0.yaml`
** `<installation_dir>/man/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-1.yaml`
** `<installation_dir>/man/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-2.yaml`

* In each file, replace the value of the `.spec.template.spec.providerSpec.value.image.resourceID` property with an empty value (`""`).

* In each file, set the `type` property to `MarketplaceWithPlan`.

* Using the first machine set file as an example, the `.spec.template.spec.providerSpec.value.image` section should look like the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ cat <installation_dir>/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-0.yaml | grep -A5 -B1 offer 

    image:
      offer: rh-ocp-worker
      publisher: redhat
      resourceID: ""
      sku: rh-ocp-worker
      version: 4.8.2021122100
      type: MarketplaceWithPlan
