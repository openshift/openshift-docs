= About the {cgu-operator-full} configuration

The {cgu-operator-first} manages the deployment of {rh-rhacm-first} policies for one or more {product-title} clusters. Using {cgu-operator} in a large network of clusters allows the phased rollout of policies to the clusters in limited batches. This helps to minimize possible service disruptions when updating. With {cgu-operator}, you can control the following actions:

* The timing of the update
* The number of {rh-rhacm}-managed clusters
* The subset of managed clusters to apply the policies to
* The update order of the clusters
* The set of policies remediated to the cluster
* The order of policies remediated to the cluster
* The assignment of a canary cluster

For {sno}, the {cgu-operator-first} offers the following features:

* Create a backup of a deployment before an upgrade
* Pre-caching images for clusters with limited bandwidth

{cgu-operator} supports the orchestration of the {product-title} y-stream and z-stream updates, and day-two operations on y-streams and z-streams.
