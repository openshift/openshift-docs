= Applying a remediation

The boolean attribute `spec.apply` controls whether the remediation should be applied by the Compliance Operator.  You can apply the remediation by setting the attribute to `true`:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-compliance \
patch complianceremediations/<scan-name>-sysctl-net-ipv4-conf-all-accept-redirects \
--patch '{"spec":{"apply":true}}' --type=merge
----

After the Compliance Operator processes the applied remediation, the `status.ApplicationState` attribute would change to *Applied* or to *Error* if incorrect. When a machine config remediation is applied, that remediation along with all other applied remediations are rendered into a `MachineConfig` object named `75-$scan-name-$suite-name`. That `MachineConfig` object is subsequently rendered by the Machine Config Operator and finally applied to all the nodes in a machine config pool by an instance of the machine control daemon running on each node.

Note that when the Machine Config Operator applies a new `MachineConfig` object to nodes in a pool, all the nodes belonging to the pool are rebooted. This might be inconvenient when applying multiple remediations, each of which re-renders the composite `75-$scan-name-$suite-name` `MachineConfig` object. To prevent applying the remediation immediately, you can pause the machine config pool by setting the `.spec.paused` attribute of a `MachineConfigPool` object to `true`.

The Compliance Operator can apply remediations automatically. Set `autoApplyRemediations: true` in the `ScanSetting` top-level object.

[WARNING]
====
Applying remediations automatically should only be done with careful consideration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Compliance Operator does not automatically resolve dependency issues that can occur between remediations. Users should perform a rescan after remediations are applied to ensure accurate results.
