[id="registry-configuring-storage-vsphere_{context}"]
= Configuring registry storage for VMware vSphere

As a cluster administrator, following installation you must configure your registry to use storage.

.Prerequisites

* Cluster administrator permissions.
* A cluster on VMware vSphere.
* Persistent storage provisioned for your cluster, such as {rh-storage-first}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} supports `ReadWriteOnce` access for image registry storage when you have only one replica. `ReadWriteOnce` access also requires that the registry uses the `Recreate` rollout strategy. To deploy an image registry that supports high availability with two or more replicas, `ReadWriteMany` access is required.
====
+
* Must have "100Gi" capacity.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Testing shows issues with using the NFS server on RHEL as storage backend for
core services. This includes the OpenShift Container Registry and Quay,
Prometheus for monitoring storage, and Elasticsearch for logging storage.
Therefore, using RHEL NFS to back PVs used by core services is not recommended.

Other NFS implementations on the marketplace might not have these issues.
Contact the individual NFS implementation vendor for more information on any
testing that was possibly completed against these {product-title} core
components.
====

.Procedure

. To configure your registry to use storage, change the `spec.storage.pvc` in the `configs.imageregistry/cluster` resource.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you use shared storage, review your security settings to prevent outside access.
====

. Verify that you do not have a registry pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -n openshift-image-registry -l docker-registry=default
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
No resourses found in openshift-image-registry namespace
----
+
[NOTE]
=====
If you do have a registry pod in your output, you do not need to continue with this procedure.
=====
. Check the registry configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
storage:
  pvc:
    claim: <1>
----
+
<1> Leave the `claim` field blank to allow the automatic creation of an `image-registry-storage` persistent volume claim (PVC). The PVC is generated based on the default storage class. However, be aware that the default storage class might provide ReadWriteOnce (RWO) volumes, such as a RADOS Block Device (RBD), which can cause issues when you replicate to more than one replica.

. Check the `clusteroperator` status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusteroperator image-registry
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
