= Disabling CPU CFS quota

To eliminate CPU throttling for pinned pods, create a pod with the `cpu-quota.crio.io: "disable"` annotation. This annotation disables the CPU completely fair scheduler (CFS) quota when the pod runs.

[NOTE]
====
Only disable CPU CFS quota when the CPU manager static policy is enabled and for pods with guaranteed QoS that use whole CPUs. For example, pods that contain CPU-pinned containers. Otherwise, disabling CPU CFS quota can affect the performance of other containers in the cluster.
