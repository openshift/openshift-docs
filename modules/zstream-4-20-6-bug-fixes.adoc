The following bugs are fixed for this release:

* Before this update, the `CloudFront` object distribution was not deleted due to a failed tag-based retrieval, and caused persistence of resources, including the origin access identity. With this release, the `CloudFront` origin access identity is deleted after using the distribution command. As a result, the `CloudFront` object distribution and origin access identity are deleted after using the delete command. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-63690[OCPBUGS-63690])

* Before this update, a race condition in the Redfish API power interface caused power operations to fail during simultaneous access. As a consequence, users could not manage power settings. With this release, the race condition in the Redfish API power interface is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-64850[OCPBUGS-64850])

* Before this update, the Ironic API service advertised an inaccessible IP address because there was no accessibility check. As a consequence, the inaccessible Ironic API service caused service unavailability for users. With this release, the advertised IP address for the Ironic API service checks for accessibility. As a result, the advertised IP address for the Ironic API service is reachable. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65519[OCPBUGS-65519])

* Before this update, worker virtual machine (VM) creation failures in the `CentralUSEUAP` hub were due to a hard-coded `platformUpdateDomainCount` parameter in Microsoft Messaging API (MAPI) code. As a consequence, this caused  an incompatible `availability set` configuration and VM creation failures in the {azure-first} `CentralUSEUAP` hub. With this release, the hard-coded `platformUpdateDomainCount` parameter is updated to match the parameter in the `CentralUSEUAP` hub. As a result, worker VMs are created without `availability set` errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65708[OCPBUGS-65708])
