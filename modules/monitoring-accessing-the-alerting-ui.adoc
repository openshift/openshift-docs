= Accessing the Alerting UI in the Administrator and Developer perspectives

The Alerting UI is accessible through the Administrator perspective and the Developer perspective in the {product-title} web console.

* In the *Administrator* perspective, select *Monitoring* -> *Alerting*. The three main pages in the Alerting UI in this perspective are the *Alerts*, *Silences*, and *Alerting Rules* pages.

//Next to the title of each of these pages is a link to the Alertmanager interface.

* In the *Developer* perspective, select *Monitoring* -> *<project_name>* -> *Alerts*. In this perspective alerts, silences and alerting rules are all managed from the *Alerts* page. The results shown in the *Alerts* page are specific to the selected project.

[NOTE]
====
In the Developer perspective, you can select from core {product-title} and user-defined projects that you have access to in the *Project:* list. However, alerts, silences, and alerting rules relating to core {product-title} projects are not displayed if you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges.
