The Alerting UI is accessible through the *{perspective}* perspective of the {product-title} web console.

// tag::ADM[]
* From the *Administrator* perspective, go to *Observe* -> *Alerting*. The three main pages in the Alerting UI in this perspective are the *Alerts*, *Silences*, and *Alerting rules* pages.
// end::ADM[]

// tag::DEV[]
* From the *Developer* perspective, go to *Observe* and go to the *Alerts* tab.
* Select the project that you want to manage alerts for from the *Project:* list. 

In this perspective, alerts, silences, and alerting rules are all managed from the *Alerts* tab. The results shown in the *Alerts* tab are specific to the selected project.

[NOTE]
====
In the *Developer* perspective, you can select from core {product-title} and user-defined projects that you have access to in the *Project: <project_name>* list. However, alerts, silences, and alerting rules relating to core {product-title} projects are not displayed if you are not logged in as a cluster administrator.
