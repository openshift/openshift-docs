= Accessing the Alerting UI in the Administrator and Developer perspectives

The Alerting UI is accessible through the *Administrator* perspective and the *Developer* perspective of the {product-title} web console.

* In the *Administrator* perspective, go to *Observe* -> *Alerting*. The three main pages in the Alerting UI in this perspective are the *Alerts*, *Silences*, and *Alerting rules* pages.

//Next to the title of each of these pages is a link to the Alertmanager interface.

* In the *Developer* perspective, go to *Observe* -> *<project_name>* -> *Alerts*. In this perspective, alerts, silences, and alerting rules are all managed from the *Alerts* page. The results shown in the *Alerts* page are specific to the selected project.

[NOTE]
====
In the *Developer* perspective, you can select from core {product-title} and user-defined projects that you have access to in the *Project: <project_name>* list. However, alerts, silences, and alerting rules relating to core {product-title} projects are not displayed if you are not logged in as a cluster administrator.
