= Configuring RAID for worker node

The following procedure configures RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) for the worker node during the installation process.

[NOTE]
====
. Only servers with BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) type `irmc` are supported. Other types of servers are currently not supported.
. If you want to configure hardware RAID for the server, make sure the server has a RAID controller.
====

.Procedure
. Create manifests.
. Modify the BMH (Bare Metal Host) file corresponding to the worker:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vim clusterconfigs/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_hosts-3.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Because servers with BMC type `irmc` do not support software RAID, the following RAID configuration uses hardware RAID as an example.
====
+
.. If you added specific RAID configuration to the spec, this causes the worker node to delete the original RAID configuration in the `preparing` phase and perform a specified configuration on the RAID. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  raid:
    hardwareRAIDVolumes:
    - level: "0" <1>
      name: "sda"
      numberOfPhysicalDisks: 1
      rotational: true
      sizeGibibytes: 0
----
<1> `level` is a required field, and the others are optional fields.
+
.. If you added an empty RAID configuration to the spec, this empty configuration causes the worker node to delete the original RAID configuration during the `preparing` phase, but does not perform a new configuration. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  raid:
    hardwareRAIDVolumes: []
----
+
.. If you do not add a `raid` field in the spec, the original RAID configuration is not deleted, and no new configuration will be performed.
. Create cluster.
