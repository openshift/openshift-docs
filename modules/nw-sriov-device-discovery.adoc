[id="discover-sr-iov-devices_{context}"]
= Automated discovery of SR-IOV network devices

The SR-IOV Network Operator searches your cluster for SR-IOV capable network devices on worker nodes.
The Operator creates and updates a SriovNetworkNodeState custom resource (CR) for each worker node that provides a compatible SR-IOV network device.

The CR is assigned the same name as the worker node.
The `status.interfaces` list provides information about the network devices on a node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not modify a `SriovNetworkNodeState` object.
The Operator creates and manages these resources automatically.
