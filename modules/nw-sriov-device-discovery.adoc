[id="discover-sr-iov-devices_{context}"]
= Automated discovery of SR-IOV network devices

The SR-IOV Network Operator will search your cluster for SR-IOV capable network devices on worker nodes.
The Operator creates and updates a SriovNetworkNodeState Custom Resource (CR) for each worker node that provides a compatible SR-IOV network device.

One CR is created for each worker node, and shares the same name as the node.
The `.spec.interfaces` list provides information about the network devices on a node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not modify a SriovNetworkNodeState CR.
The Operator creates and manages these resources automatically.

The following is an example of a SriovNetworkNodeState CR created by the SR-IOV Network Operator:

<1> The value for the `name` parameter is the same as the name of the worker node.
<2> The `interfaces` collection includes a list of all of the SR-IOV devices discovered by the Operator on the worker node.
