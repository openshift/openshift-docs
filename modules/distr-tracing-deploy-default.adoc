= Deploying the default {DTShortName} strategy from the web console

The custom resource definition (CRD) defines the configuration used when you deploy an instance of {DTProductName}. The default CR is named `jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory` and it is configured with minimal resources to ensure that you can successfully install it on a default {product-title} installation. You can use this default configuration to create a {JaegerName} instance that uses the `AllInOne` deployment strategy, or you can define your own custom resource file.

[NOTE]
====
In-memory storage is not persistent, which means that if the Jaeger pod shuts down, restarts, or is replaced, that your trace data will be lost.  For persistent storage, you must use the `production` or `streaming` strategies, which use Elasticsearch as the default storage.
====

.Prerequisites

* The {JaegerName} Operator must be installed.
* Review the instructions for how to customize the deployment.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Create a new project, for example `tracing-system`.

.. Navigate to *Home* -> *Projects*.

.. Click *Create Project*.

.. Enter `tracing-system` in the *Name* field.

.. Click *Create*.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. If necessary, select `tracing-system` from the Project menu.  You may have to wait a few moments for the Operators to be copied to the new project.

. Click the {JaegerName} Operator. On the *Details* tab, under *Provided APIs*, the Operator provides a single link.

. Under *Jaeger* click *Create Instance*.

. On the *Create Jaeger* page, to install using the defaults, click *Create* to create the {JaegerShortName} instance.

. On the *Jaegers* page, click the name of the {JaegerShortName} instance, for example, `jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory`.

. On the *Jaeger Details* page, click the *Resources* tab.  Wait until the Pod has a status of "Running" before continuing.

== Deploying the default {DTShortName} strategy from the CLI

Follow this procedure to create an instance of {JaegerShortName} from the command line.

.Prerequisites

* An installed, verified {JaegerName} Operator.
* Access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) that matches your {product-title} version.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login https://{HOSTNAME}:8443
----

. Create a new project named `tracing-system`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project tracing-system
----

. Create a custom resource file named `jaeger.yaml` that contains the following text:
+
.Example jaeger-all-in-one.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory
----

. Run the following command to deploy {JaegerShortName}:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n tracing-system -f jaeger.yaml
----

. Run the following command to watch the progress of the pods during the installation process:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n tracing-system -w
----
+
Once the installation process has completed, you should see output similar to the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
