[id="distr-tracing-deploy-default_{context}"]
= Deploying the {DTShortName} default strategy from the web console

The custom resource definition (CRD) defines the configuration used when you deploy an instance of {DTProductName}. The default CR is named `jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory` and it is configured with minimal resources to ensure that you can successfully install it on a default {product-title} installation. You can use this default configuration to create a {JaegerName} instance that uses the `AllInOne` deployment strategy, or you can define your own custom resource file.

[NOTE]
====
In-memory storage is not persistent.  If the Jaeger pod shuts down, restarts, or is replaced, your trace data will be lost. For persistent storage, you must use the `production` or `streaming` strategies, which use Elasticsearch as the default storage.
====

.Prerequisites

* The {JaegerName} Operator has been installed.
* You have reviewed the instructions for how to customize the deployment.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Create a new project, for example `tracing-system`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing as part of Service Mesh, the {DTShortName} resources must be installed in the same namespace as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, for example `istio-system`.

.. Navigate to *Home* -> *Projects*.

.. Click *Create Project*.

.. Enter `tracing-system` in the *Name* field.

.. Click *Create*.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. If necessary, select `tracing-system` from the *Project* menu. You may have to wait a few moments for the Operators to be copied to the new project.

. Click the {JaegerName} Operator. On the *Details* tab, under *Provided APIs*, the Operator provides a single link.

. Under *Jaeger*, click *Create Instance*.

. On the *Create Jaeger* page, to install using the defaults, click *Create* to create the {JaegerShortName} instance.

. On the *Jaegers* page, click the name of the {JaegerShortName} instance, for example, `jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory`.

. On the *Jaeger Details* page, click the *Resources* tab. Wait until the pod has a status of "Running" before continuing.


[id="distr-tracing-deploy-default-cli_{context}"]
== Deploying the {DTShortName} default strategy from the CLI

Follow this procedure to create an instance of {JaegerShortName} from the command line.

.Prerequisites

* The {JaegerName} Operator has been installed and verified.
* You have reviewed the instructions for how to customize the deployment.
* You have access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) that matches your {product-title} version.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login https://<HOSTNAME>:8443
----

. Create a new project named `tracing-system`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project tracing-system
----

. Create a custom resource file named `jaeger.yaml` that contains the following text:
+
.Example jaeger-all-in-one.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory
----

. Run the following command to deploy {JaegerShortName}:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n tracing-system -f jaeger.yaml
----

. Run the following command to watch the progress of the pods during the installation process:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n tracing-system -w
----
+
After the installation process has completed, you should see output similar to the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
