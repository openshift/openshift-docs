= Parsing JSON logs

Logs including JSON logs are usually represented as a string inside the `message` field. That makes it hard for users to query specific fields inside a JSON document. OpenShift Logging's Log Forwarding API enables you to parse JSON logs into a structured object and forward them to either OpenShift Logging-managed Elasticsearch or any other third-party system supported by the Log Forwarding API.

To illustrate how this works, suppose that you have the following structured JSON log entry.

.Example structured JSON log entry
[source,yaml]
----
{"level":"info","name":"fred","home":"bedrock"}
----

Normally, the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR) forwards that log entry in the `message` field. The `message` field contains the JSON-quoted string equivalent of the JSON log entry, as shown in the following example.

.Example `message` field
[source,yaml]
----
{"message":"{\"level\":\"info\",\"name\":\"fred\",\"home\":\"bedrock\"",
 "more fields..."}
----

To enable parsing JSON log, you add `parse: json` to a pipeline in the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR, as shown in the following example.

.Example snippet showing `parse: json`
[source,yaml]
----
pipelines:
- inputRefs: [ application ]
  outputRefs: myFluentd
  parse: json
----

When you enable parsing JSON logs by using `parse: json`, the CR copies the JSON-structured log entry in a `structured` field, as shown in the following example. This does not modify the original `message` field.

.Example `structured` output containing the structured JSON log entry
[source,yaml]
----
{"structured": { "level": "info", "name": "fred", "home": "bedrock" },
 "more fields..."}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the log entry does not contain valid structured JSON, the `structured` field will be absent.
