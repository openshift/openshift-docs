= About VRRP ID offset

Each IP failover pod managed by the IP failover deployment configuration, `1` pod per node or replica, runs a Keepalived daemon. As more IP failover deployment configurations are configured, more pods are created and more daemons join into the common Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) negotiation. This negotiation is done by all the Keepalived daemons and it determines which nodes service which virtual IPs (VIP).

Internally, Keepalived assigns a unique `vrrp-id` to each VIP. The negotiation uses this set of `vrrp-ids`, when a decision is made, the VIP corresponding to the winning `vrrp-id` is serviced on the winning node.

Therefore, for every VIP defined in the IP failover deployment configuration, the IP failover pod must assign a corresponding `vrrp-id`. This is done by starting at `OPENSHIFT_HA_VRRP_ID_OFFSET` and sequentially assigning the `vrrp-ids` to the list of VIPs. The `vrrp-ids` can have values in the range `1..255`.

When there are multiple IP failover deployment configurations, you must specify `OPENSHIFT_HA_VRRP_ID_OFFSET` so that there is room to increase the number of VIPs in the deployment configuration and none of the `vrrp-id` ranges overlap.
