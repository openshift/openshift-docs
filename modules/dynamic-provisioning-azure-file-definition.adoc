= Azure File object definition

The Azure File StorageClass uses secrets to store the Azure storage account name
and the storage account key that are required to create an Azure Files share. These
permissions are created as part of the following procedure.

.Procedure

. Define a ClusterRole that allows access to create and view secrets:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
#  name: system:azure-cloud-provider
  name: <persistent-volume-binder-role> <1>
rules:
- apiGroups: ['']
  resources: ['secrets']
  verbs:     ['get','create']
----
<1> The name of the ClusterRole to view and create secrets.

. Add the ClusterRole to the ServiceAccount:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user <persistent-volume-binder-role>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
 system:serviceaccount:kube-system:persistent-volume-binder
----

. Create the Azure File StorageClass:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: <azure-file> <1>
provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-file
parameters:
  location: eastus <2>
  skuName: Standard_LRS <3>
  storageAccount: <storage-account> <4>
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
----
<1> Name of the StorageClass. The PersistentVolumeClaim uses this StorageClass for provisioning the associated PersistentVolumes.
<2> Location of the Azure storage account, such as `eastus`. Default is empty, meaning that a new Azure storage account will be created in the {product-title} cluster's location.
<3> SKU tier of the Azure storage account, such as `Standard_LRS`. Default is empty, meaning that a new Azure storage account will be created with the `Standard_LRS` SKU.
<4> Name of the Azure storage account. If a storage account is provided, then
`skuName` and `location` are ignored. If no storage account is provided, then
the StorageClass searches for any storage account that is associated with the
resource group for any accounts that match the defined `skuName` and `location`.
