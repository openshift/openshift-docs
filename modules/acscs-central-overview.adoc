= Central

Red{nbsp}Hat manages Central, the control plane for {product-title-managed-short}.
These services include the following components:

* *Central*: Central is the {product-title-short} application management interface and services.
It handles API interactions and user interface ({product-title-short} Portal) access.
* *Central DB*: Central DB is the database for {product-title-short} and handles all data persistence. It is currently based on PostgreSQL 13.
* *Scanner V4*: Beginning with version 4.4, {product-title-short} contains the Scanner V4 vulnerability scanner for scanning container images. Scanner V4 is built on link:https://github.com/quay/claircore[ClairCore], which also powers the link:https://github.com/quay/clair[Clair] scanner. Scanner V4 includes the Indexer, Matcher, and Scanner V4 DB components, which are used in scanning.
* *StackRox Scanner*: The StackRox Scanner is the default scanner in {product-title-short}. The StackRox Scanner originates from a fork of the Clair v2 open source scanner.
* *Scanner-DB*: This database contains data for the StackRox Scanner.

{product-title-short} scanners analyze each image layer to determine the base operating system and identify programming language packages and packages that were installed by the operating system package manager. They match the findings against known vulnerabilities from various vulnerability sources. In addition, the StackRox Scanner identifies vulnerabilities in the node's operating system and platform. These capabilities are planned for Scanner V4 in a future release.

== Vulnerability sources

{product-title-short} uses the following vulnerability sources:

* link:https://secdb.alpinelinux.org/[Alpine Security Database]
* Data tracked in link:https://alas.aws.amazon.com/index.html[Amazon Linux Security Center]
* link:https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/json[Debian Security Tracker]
* link:https://linux.oracle.com/security/oval[Oracle OVAL]
* link:https://packages.vmware.com/photon/photon_oval_definitions/[Photon OVAL]
* link:https://access.redhat.com/security/data/oval/v2/[Red{nbsp}Hat OVAL]
* link:https://access.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/cvemap.xml[Red{nbsp}Hat CVE Map]: This is used for images which appear in the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/explore[Red{nbsp}Hat Container Catalog].
* link:https://support.novell.com/security/oval/[SUSE OVAL]
* link:https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval/[Ubuntu OVAL]
* link:https://osv.dev/[OSV]: This is used for language-related vulnerabilities, such as Go, Java, Node.js (JavaScript), Python, and Ruby. This source might provide GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) IDs rather than CVE numbers for vulnerabilities.

[NOTE]
====
The {product-title-short} Scanner V4 also uses the OSV database available at link:https://osv.dev/[OSV.dev] under link:https://github.com/google/osv.dev/blob/master/LICENSE[this license].
====
* link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search[NVD]: This is used for various purposes such as filling in information gaps when vendors do not provide information. For example, Alpine does not provide a description, CVSS score, severity, or published date.

[NOTE]
====
This product uses the NVD API but is not endorsed or certified by the NVD.
====
* link:https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/blob/master/scanner/updater/manual/vulns.go[StackRox]: The upstream StackRox project maintains a set of vulnerabilities that might not be discovered due to data formatting from other sources or absence of data.

The Scanner V4 Indexer uses the following files to index Red{nbsp}Hat containers:

* link:https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/repository-to-cpe.json[repository-to-cpe.json]: Maps RPM repositories to their related CPEs, which is required for matching vulnerabilities for RHEL-based images.
* link:https://access.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/container-name-repos-map.json[container-name-repos-map.json]: This matches container names to the repositories to which they are shipped.
