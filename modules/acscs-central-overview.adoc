= Central

Red{nbsp}Hat manages Central, the control plane for {product-title-managed-short}.
These services include the following components:

* *Central*: Central is the {product-title-short} application management interface and services.
It handles API interactions and user interface ({product-title-short} Portal) access.
* *Central DB*: Central DB is the database for {product-title-short} and handles all data persistence. It is currently based on PostgreSQL 13.
* *Scanner V4*: Beginning with version 4.4, {product-title-short} contains the Scanner V4 vulnerability scanner for scanning container images. Scanner V4 is built on link:https://github.com/quay/claircore[ClairCore], which also powers the link:https://github.com/quay/clair[Clair] scanner. Scanner V4 includes the Indexer, Matcher, and Scanner V4 DB components, which are used in scanning.
* *StackRox Scanner*: The StackRox Scanner is the default scanner in {product-title-short}. The StackRox Scanner originates from a fork of the Clair v2 open source scanner.
* *Scanner-DB*: This database contains data for the StackRox Scanner.

{product-title-short} scanners analyze each image layer to determine the base operating system and identify programming language packages and packages that were installed by the operating system package manager. They match the findings against known vulnerabilities from various vulnerability sources. In addition, the StackRox Scanner identifies vulnerabilities in the node's operating system and platform. These capabilities are planned for Scanner V4 in a future release.
