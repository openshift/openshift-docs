By viewing the compliance status for a specific standard, you can ensure that your environment adheres to industry and regulatory compliance requirements.

.Procedure

. Click a standard to view information about all the controls associated with that standard.

[IMPORTANT]
==== 
Many of the controls in CIS Docker refer to the configuration of the Docker engine on each Kubernetes node. Many CIS Docker controls are also best practices for building and using containers, and {product-title-short} has policies to enforce their use. 

For more information, see "Managing security policies".
