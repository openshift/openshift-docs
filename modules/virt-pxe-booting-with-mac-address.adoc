[id="virt-pxe-booting-with-mac-address_{context}"]
= PXE booting with a specified MAC address

As an administrator, you can boot a client over the network by first creating a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object for your PXE network.
Then, reference the network attachment definition in your virtual machine instance configuration file before you start the virtual machine instance.
You can also specify a MAC address in the virtual machine instance configuration file, if required by the PXE server.

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* A Linux bridge must be connected.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* The PXE server must be connected to the same VLAN as the bridge.

.Procedure

. Configure a PXE network on the cluster:

.. Create the network attachment definition file for PXE network `pxe-net-conf`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: pxe-net-conf
spec:
  config: '{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "name": "pxe-net-conf",
    "plugins": [
      {
        "type": "cnv-bridge",
        "bridge": "br1",
        "vlan": 1 <1>
      },
      {
        "type": "cnv-tuning" <2>
      }
    ]
  }'
----
<1> Optional: The VLAN tag.
<2> The `cnv-tuning` plugin provides support for custom MAC addresses.
+
[NOTE]
====
The virtual machine instance will be attached to the bridge `br1` through an access port with the requested VLAN.
====

. Create the network attachment definition by using the file you created in the previous step:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f pxe-net-conf.yaml
----

. Edit the virtual machine instance configuration file to include the details of the interface and network.

.. Specify the network and MAC address, if required by the PXE server.
If the MAC address is not specified, a value is assigned automatically.
+
Ensure that `bootOrder` is set to `1` so that the interface boots first.
In this example, the interface is connected to a network called
`<pxe-net>`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
interfaces:
- masquerade: {}
  name: default
- bridge: {}
  name: pxe-net
  macAddress: de:00:00:00:00:de
  bootOrder: 1
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Boot order is global for interfaces and disks.
====

.. Assign a boot device number to the disk to ensure proper booting after operating system provisioning.
+
Set the disk `bootOrder` value to `2`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
devices:
  disks:
  - disk:
      bus: virtio
    name: containerdisk
    bootOrder: 2
----

.. Specify that the network is connected to the previously created network attachment definition. In this scenario, `<pxe-net>` is connected to the network attachment definition called `<pxe-net-conf>`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
networks:
- name: default
  pod: {}
- name: pxe-net
  multus:
    networkName: pxe-net-conf
----

. Create the virtual machine instance:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f vmi-pxe-boot.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
  virtualmachineinstance.kubevirt.io "vmi-pxe-boot" created
----

. Wait for the virtual machine instance to run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vmi vmi-pxe-boot -o yaml | grep -i phase
  phase: Running
----

. View the virtual machine instance using VNC:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl vnc vmi-pxe-boot
----

. Watch the boot screen to verify that the PXE boot is successful.

. Log in to the virtual machine instance:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl console vmi-pxe-boot
----

.Verification

. Verify the interfaces and MAC address on the virtual machine and that the interface connected to the bridge has the specified MAC address.
In this case, we used `eth1` for the PXE boot, without an IP address. The other interface, `eth0`, got an IP address from {product-title}.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ip addr
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
...
3. eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000
   link/ether de:00:00:00:00:de brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
