[id="virt-pxe-booting-with-mac-address_{context}"]
= PXE booting with a specified MAC address

As an administrator, you can boot a client over the network by first creating a
NetworkAttachmentDefinition object for your PXE network. Then, reference
the NetworkAttachmentDefinition in your virtual machine instance configuration
file before you start the virtual machine instance. You can also specify a MAC
address in the virtual machine instance configuration file, if required by the
PXE server.

.Prerequisites

* A Linux bridge must be connected.
* The PXE server must be connected to the same VLAN as the bridge.

.Procedure

. Configure a PXE network on the cluster:

.. Create the NetworkAttachmentDefinition file for PXE network `pxe-net-conf`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: pxe-net-conf
spec:
  config: '{
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "name": "pxe-net-conf",
      "plugins": [
        {
          "type": "cnv-bridge",
          "bridge": "br1"
        },
        {
          "type": "virt-tuning" <1>
        }
      ]
    }'
----
<1> The `virt-tuning` plug-in provides support for custom MAC addresses.
+
[NOTE]
====
The virtual machine instance will be attached to the bridge `br1` through an
access port with the requested VLAN.
====

. Create the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object by using the file you created
in the previous step:
+
----
$ oc create -f pxe-net-conf.yaml
----

. Edit the virtual machine instance configuration file to include the
details of the interface and network.

.. Specify the network and MAC address, if required by the PXE server.
If the MAC address is not specified, a value is assigned
automatically. However, note that at this time, MAC addresses
assigned automatically are not persistent.
+
Ensure that `bootOrder` is set to `1` so that the interface boots first.
In this example, the interface is connected to a network called
`<pxe-net>`:
+
----
interfaces:
- masquerade: {}
  name: default
- bridge: {}
  name: pxe-net
  macAddress: de:00:00:00:00:de
  bootOrder: 1
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Boot order is global for interfaces and disks.
====

.. Assign a boot device number to the disk to ensure proper booting
after operating system provisioning.
+
Set the disk `bootOrder` value to `2`:
+
----
devices:
  disks:
  - disk:
      bus: virtio
    name: containerdisk
    bootOrder: 2
----

.. Specify that the network is connected to the previously created
NetworkAttachmentDefinition. In this scenario, `<pxe-net>` is connected
to the NetworkAttachmentDefinition called `<pxe-net-conf>`:
+
----
networks:
- name: default
  pod: {}
- name: pxe-net
  multus:
    networkName: pxe-net-conf
----

. Create the virtual machine instance:
+
----
$ oc create -f vmi-pxe-boot.yaml
  virtualmachineinstance.kubevirt.io "vmi-pxe-boot" created
----

. Wait for the virtual machine instance to run:
+
----
$ oc get vmi vmi-pxe-boot -o yaml | grep -i phase
  phase: Running
----

. View the virtual machine instance using VNC:
+
----
$ virtctl vnc vmi-pxe-boot
----

. Watch the boot screen to verify that the PXE boot is successful.

. Log in to the virtual machine instance:
+
----
$ virtctl console vmi-pxe-boot
----

. Verify the interfaces and MAC address on the virtual machine and that the interface
connected to the bridge has the specified MAC address. In this
case, we used `eth1` for the PXE boot, without an IP address. The other
interface, `eth0`, got an IP address from {product-title}.
+
----
$ ip addr
...
3. eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000
   link/ether de:00:00:00:00:de brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
