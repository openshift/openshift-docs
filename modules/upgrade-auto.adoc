= Automatically upgrading your cluster through OCM


You can use the OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) to automatically upgrade your {product-title} cluster on a weekly basis. Based on upstream changes, there might be times when no updates are released. Therefore, no upgrade occurs for that week.

.Procedure

. From link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[OCM], select your cluster from the clusters list.

. Click the *Upgrade settings* tab to access the upgrade operator.

. To schedule automatic upgrades, select *Automatic*.

. Specify the day of the week and the time you want your cluster to upgrade.

. Click *Save*.

. Optional: Set a grace period for *Node draining* by selecting a designated amount of time from the drop down list. A *1 hour* grace period is set by default.

. To edit an existing automatic upgrade policy, edit the preferred day or start time from the *Upgrade Settings* tab. Click *Save*.

. To cancel an automatic upgrade policy, switch the upgrade method to manual from the *Upgrade Settings* tab. Click *Save*.

On the *Upgrade settings* tab, the *Upgrade status* box indicates that an upgrade is scheduled. The date and time of the next scheduled update is listed.

[WARNING]
====
In the event that a CVE or other critical issue to OpenShift Dedicated is found, all clusters are upgraded within 48 hours of the fix being released. You are notified when the fix is available and informed that the cluster will be automatically upgraded at your latest preferred start time before the 48 hour window closes. You can also upgrade manually at any time before the automatic upgrade starts.
