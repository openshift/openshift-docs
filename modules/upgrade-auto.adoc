= Scheduling recurring upgrades for your cluster


You can use {cluster-manager} to schedule recurring, automatic upgrades for z-stream patch versions for your {product-title} cluster. Based on upstream changes, there might be times when no updates are released. Therefore, no upgrade occurs for that week.

.Procedure

. From {cluster-manager-url}, select your cluster from the clusters list.

. Click the *Upgrade settings* tab to access the upgrade operator.

. To schedule recurring upgrades, select *Recurring updates*.

. Provide an administrator’s acknowledgment and click *Approve and continue*. {cluster-manager} does not start scheduled y-stream updates for minor versions without receiving an administrator’s acknowledgment.

. Specify the day of the week and the time you want your cluster to upgrade.

. Click *Save*.

. Optional: Set a grace period for *Node draining* by selecting a designated amount of time from the drop down list. A *1 hour* grace period is set by default.

. To edit an existing recurring upgrade policy, edit the preferred day or start time from the *Upgrade Settings* tab. Click *Save*.

. To cancel a recurring upgrade policy, switch the upgrade method to individual from the *Upgrade Settings* tab. Click *Save*.

On the *Upgrade settings* tab, the *Upgrade status* box indicates that an upgrade is scheduled. The date and time of the next scheduled update is listed.
