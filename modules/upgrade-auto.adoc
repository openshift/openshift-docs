= Automatically upgrading your cluster through OCM


You can use the OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) to automatically upgrade your {product-title} cluster on a weekly basis. Based on upstream changes, there might be times when no updates are released. Therefore, no upgrade occurs for that week.

. Click the *Upgrade settings* tab to access the upgrade operator.

. To schedule automatic upgrades, select *Automatic*.

. Specify the day of the week and the time you want your cluster to upgrade.

. Click *Save*.

. Optional: Set a grace period for *Node draining* by selecting a designated amount of time from the drop down list. A *1 hour* grace period is set by default.

. To edit an existing automatic upgrade policy, edit the preferred day or start time from the *Upgrade Settings* tab. Click *Save*.

. To cancel an automatic upgrade policy, switch the upgrade method to manual from the *Upgrade Settings* tab. Click *Save*.

On the *Upgrade settings* tab, the *Upgrade status* box indicates that an upgrade is scheduled. The date and time of the next scheduled update is listed.
