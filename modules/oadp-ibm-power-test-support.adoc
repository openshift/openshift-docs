= OADP support for target backup locations using IBM Power

IBM Power running with {product-title} 4.11 and OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.1.0 was tested successfully against an AWS S3 backup location target. Although the test involved only an AWS S3 target, Red Hat supports running IBM Power with {product-title} 4.11 and OADP 1.1.0 against all non-AWS S3 backup location targets as well.
