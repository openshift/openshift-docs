* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Kourier 1.0.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative (`kn`) CLI 1.0.

* The `kn func` CLI plugin now uses `func` 0.21.
* The Kafka sink is now available as a Technology Preview.

* The Knative open source project has begun to deprecate camel-cased configuration keys in favor of using kebab-cased keys consistently. As a result, the `defaultExternalScheme` key, previously mentioned in the {ServerlessProductName} 1.18.0 release notes, is now deprecated and replaced by the `default-external-scheme` key. Usage instructions for the key remain the same.

[id="known-issues-1-21-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

* Currently, the domain mapping controller cannot process the URI of a broker, which contains a path that is currently not supported.
+
This means that, if you want to use a `DomainMapping` custom resource (CR) to map a custom domain to a broker, you must configure the `DomainMapping` CR with the broker's ingress service, and append the exact path of the broker to the custom domain:
+
.Example `DomainMapping` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: DomainMapping
metadata:
  name: <domain-name>
  namespace: knative-eventing
spec:
  ref:
    name: broker-ingress
    kind: Service
    apiVersion: v1
----
+
The URI for the broker is then `<domain-name>/<broker-namespace>/<broker-name>`.
