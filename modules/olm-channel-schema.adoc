= olm.channel schema

The `olm.channel` schema defines a channel within a package, the bundle entries that are members of the channel, and the upgrade edges for those bundles.

If a bundle entry represents an edge in multiple `olm.channel` blobs, it can only appear once per channel.

It is valid for an entry's `replaces` value to reference another bundle name that cannot be found in this catalog or another catalog. However, all other channel invariants must hold true, such as a channel not having multiple heads.

[WARNING]
====
When using the `skipRange` field, the skipped Operator versions are pruned from the update graph and are longer installable by users with the `spec.startingCSV` property of `Subscription` objects.

You can update an Operator incrementally while keeping previously installed versions available to users for future installation by using both the `skipRange` and `replaces` field. Ensure that the `replaces` field points to the immediate previous version of the Operator version in question.
