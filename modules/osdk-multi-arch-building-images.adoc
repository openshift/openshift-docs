= Building a manifest list of the platforms your Operator supports

You can use the `make docker-buildx` command to build a manifest list of the platforms supported by your Operator and operands. A manifest list references specific image manifests for one or more architectures. An image manifest specifies the platforms that an image supports.

For more information, see link:https://specs.opencontainers.org/image-spec/image-index[OpenContainers Image Index Spec] or link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/#manifest-list[Image Manifest v2, Schema 2].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your Operator project deploys an application or other workload resources, the following procedure assumes the application's multi-platform images are built during the application release process.
====

.Prerequisites

* An Operator project built using the Operator SDK version {osdk_ver} or later
* Docker installed

.Procedure

. Inspect the image manifests of your Operator and operands to find which platforms your Operator project can support. Run the following command to inspect an image manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker manifest inspect <image_manifest> <1>
----
<1> Specifies an image manifest, such as `redhat/ubi9:latest`.
+
The platforms that your Operator and operands mutually support determine the platform compatibility of your Operator project.
+
.Example output
[source,json]

{
    "manifests": [
        {
            "digest": "sha256:c0669ef34cdc14332c0f1ab0c2c01acb91d96014b172f1a76f3a39e63d1f0bda",
            "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
            "platform": {
                "architecture": "amd64",
                "os": "linux"
            },
            "size": 528
        },
...
        {
            "digest": "sha256:30e6d35703c578ee703230b9dc87ada2ba958c1928615ac8a674fcbbcbb0f281",
            "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
            "platform": {
                "architecture": "arm64",
                "os": "linux",
                "variant": "v8"
            },
            "size": 528
        },
...
----

. If the previous command does not output platform information, then the specified base image might be a single image instead of an image manifest. You can find which architectures an image supports by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker inspect <image>
----

. For Go-based Operator projects, the Operator SDK explicitly references the `amd64` architecture in your project's Dockerfile. Make the following change
to your Dockerfile to set an environment variable to the value specified by the platform flag:
+
.Example Dockerfile
[source,docker]
----
FROM golang:1.19 as builder
ARG TARGETOS
ARG TARGETARCH
...
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=${TARGETOS:-linux} GOARCH=${TARGETARCH} go build -a -o manager main.go <1>
----
<1> Change the `GOARCH` field from `amd64` to `$TARGETARCH`.

. Your Operator project's makefile defines the `PLATFORMS` environment variable. If your Operator's images do not support all of the platforms set by default, edit the variable to specify the supported platforms. The following example defines the supported platforms as `linux/arm64` and `linux/amd64`:
+
.Example makefile
[source,make]
----
# ...
PLATFORMS ?= linux/arm64,linux/amd64 <1>
.PHONY: docker-buildx
# ...
----
+
<1> The following `PLATFORMS` values are set by default: `linux/arm64`, `linux/amd64`, `linux/s390x`, and `linux/ppc64le`.
+
When you run the `make docker buildx` command to generate a manifest list, the Operator SDK creates an image manifest for each of the platforms specified by the `PLATFORMS` variable.

. Run the following command from your Operator project directory to build your manager image. Running the command builds a manager image with multi-platform support and pushes the manifest list to your registry.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make docker-buildx \
  IMG=<image_registry>/<organization_name>/<repository_name>:<version_or_sha>
