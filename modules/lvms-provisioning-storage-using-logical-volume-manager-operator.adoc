= Provisioning storage

After you have created the LVM volume groups using the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR), you can provision the storage by creating persistent volume claims (PVCs).

The following are the minimum storage sizes that you can request for each file system type:

* `block`: 8 MiB
* `xfs`: 300 MiB
* `ext4`: 32 MiB

To create a PVC, you must create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` object.

.Prerequisites

* You have created an `LVMCluster` CR.

.Procedure

. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

. Create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` object:
+
.Example `PersistentVolumeClaim` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: lvm-block-1 <1>
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Block <2>
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi <3>
    limits:
      storage: 20Gi <4>
  storageClassName: lvms-vg1 <5>
----
<1> Specify a name for the PVC.
<2> To create a block PVC, set this field to `Block`. To create a file PVC, set this field to `Filesystem`.
<3> Specify the storage size. If the value is less than the minimum storage size, the requested storage size is rounded to the minimum storage size. The total storage size you can provision is limited by the size of the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) thin pool and the over-provisioning factor.
<4> Optional: Specify the storage limit. Set this field to a value that is greater than or equal to the minimum storage size. Otherwise, PVC creation fails with an error. 
<5> The value of the `storageClassName` field must be in the format `lvms-<device_class_name>` where `<device_class_name>` is the value of the `deviceClasses.name` field in the `LVMCluster` CR.
For example, if the `deviceClasses.name` field is set to `vg1`, you must set the `storageClassName` field to `lvms-vg1`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `volumeBindingMode` field of the storage class is set to `WaitForFirstConsumer`.
====

. Create the PVC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc create -f <file_name> -n <application_namespace>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The created PVCs remain in `Pending` state until you deploy the pods that use them.
====

.Verification

* To verify that the PVC is created, run the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get pvc -n <namespace>
----
