= Provisioning storage using {lvms}

You can provision persistent volume claims (PVCs) using the storage class that is created during the Operator installation. You can provision block and file PVCs, however, the storage is allocated only when a pod that uses the PVC is created.

[NOTE]
====
{lvms} provisions PVCs in units of 1 GiB. The requested storage is rounded up to the nearest GiB.
====

.Procedure

. Identify the `StorageClass` that is created when {lvms} is deployed.
+
The `StorageClass` name is in the format, `lvms-<device-class-name>`.
The `device-class-name` is the name of the device class that you provided in the `LVMCluster` of the `Policy` YAML.
For example, if the `deviceClass` is called `vg1`, then the `storageClass` name is `lvms-vg1`.
+
The `volumeBindingMode` of the storage class is set to `WaitForFirstConsumer`.

. To create a PVC where the application requires storage, save the following YAML to a file with a name such as `pvc.yaml`.

.Example YAML to create a PVC
[source,yaml]
----
# block pvc
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: lvm-block-1
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Block
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: lvms-vg1

# file pvc
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: lvm-file-1
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: lvms-vg1
----

. Create the PVC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc create -f pvc.yaml -ns <application_namespace>
----

+
The created PVCs remain in `pending` state until you deploy the pods that use them.
