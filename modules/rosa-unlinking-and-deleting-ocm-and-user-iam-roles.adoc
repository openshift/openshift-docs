= Unlinking and deleting the {cluster-manager} and user IAM roles

If you installed a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster by using {cluster-manager-first}, you created {cluster-manager} and user Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and linked them to your Red Hat organization. After deleting your cluster, you can unlink and delete the roles by using the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {cluster-manager} and user IAM roles are required if you want to use {cluster-manager} to install and manage other ROSA clusters in the same AWS account. You must only remove the roles if you no longer need to use {cluster-manager} to install ROSA clusters.
====

.Prerequisites

* You created {cluster-manager} and user IAM roles and linked them to your Red Hat organization.
* You have installed and configured the latest ROSA CLI (`rosa`) on your installation host.
* You have organization administrator privileges in your Red Hat organization.

.Procedure

. Unlink the {cluster-manager} IAM role from your Red Hat organization and delete the role:
.. List the {cluster-manager} IAM roles in your AWS account:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list ocm-roles
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Fetching ocm roles
ROLE NAME                           ROLE ARN                                                                      LINKED  ADMIN
ManagedOpenShift-OCM-Role-<red_hat_organization_external_id>  arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/ManagedOpenShift-OCM-Role-<red_hat_organization_external_id>  Yes     Yes
----
+
.. If your {cluster-manager} IAM role is listed as linked in the output of the preceding command, unlink the role from your Red Hat organization:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa unlink ocm-role --role-arn <arn> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<arn>` with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your {cluster-manager} IAM role. The ARN is specified in the output of the preceding command. In the preceding example, the ARN is in the format `arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_external_id>:role/ManagedOpenShift-OCM-Role-<red_hat_organization_external_id>`.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Unlinking OCM role

I: Successfully unlinked role-arn 'arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/ManagedOpenShift-OCM-Role-<red_hat_organization_external_id>' from organization account '<red_hat_organization_id>'
----
+
.. Delete the {cluster-manager} IAM role and policies:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa delete ocm-role --role-arn <arn>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Deleting OCM role
? OCM Role ARN: arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/ManagedOpenShift-OCM-Role-<red_hat_organization_external_id>
? Delete 'arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/ManagedOpenShift-OCM-Role-<red_hat_organization_external_id>' ocm role? Yes
? OCM role deletion mode: auto <1>
I: Successfully deleted the OCM role
----
<1> Specifies the deletion mode. You can use `auto` mode to automatically delete the {cluster-manager} IAM role and policies. In `manual` mode, the `rosa` CLI generates the `aws` commands needed to delete the role and policies. `manual` mode enables you to review the details before running the `aws` commands manually.

. Unlink the user IAM role from your Red Hat organization and delete the role:
.. List the user IAM roles in your AWS account:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list user-roles
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Fetching user roles

.. If your user IAM role is listed as linked in the output of the preceding command, unlink the role from your Red Hat organization:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa unlink user-role --role-arn <arn> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<arn>` with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your user IAM role. The ARN is specified in the output of the preceding command. In the preceding example, the ARN is in the format `arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/ManagedOpenShift-User-<ocm_user_name>-Role`.
