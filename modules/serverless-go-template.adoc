= Go function template structure

When you create a Go function using the Knative (`kn`) CLI, the project directory looks like a typical Go project. The only exception is the additional `func.yaml` configuration file, which is used for specifying the image.

Go functions have few restrictions. The only requirements are that your project must be defined in a `function` module, and must export the function `Handle()`.

Both `http` and `event` trigger functions have the same template structure:

<1> The `func.yaml` configuration file is used to determine the image name and registry.
<2> You can add any required dependencies to the `go.mod` file, which can include additional local Go files. When the project is built for deployment, these dependencies are included in the resulting runtime container image.
