= Granting user permissions using CLI

This procedure shows how to grant users permissions for monitoring their own services using the CLI.

.Prerequisites

* Have a user created.
* Log in using the `oc` command.

.Procedure

* Run this command to assign <role> to <user> in <namespace>:
+
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user <role> <user> -n <namespace>
----
+
Substitute <role> with `monitoring-rules-view`, `monitoring-rules-edit`, or `monitoring-edit`.
+
--
** `monitoring-rules-view` allows reading PrometheusRule custom resources within the namespace.
** `monitoring-rules-edit` allows creating, modifying, and deleting PrometheusRule custom resources matching the permitted namespace.
** `monitoring-edit` gives the same permissions as `monitoring-rules-edit`. Additionally, it allows creating new scraping targets for services or Pods. It also allows creating, modifying, and deleting ServiceMonitors and PodMonitors.
--
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Whichever role you choose, you must bind it against a specific namespace as a cluster administrator.
====
+
As an example, substitute <role> with `monitoring-edit`, <user> with `johnsmith`, and <namespace> with `ns1`. This assigns to user `johnsmith` the permissions for setting up metrics collection and creating alerting rules in the `ns1` namespace.
