= SRE access through PrivateLink VPC endpoint service 

PrivateLink VPC endpoint service is created as part of the ROSA cluster creation. 

When you have a PrivateLink ROSA cluster, its Kubernetes API Server is exposed through a load balancer that can only be accessed from within the VPC by default. Red Hat site reliability engineering (SRE) can connect to this load balancer through a VPC Endpoint Service that has an associated VPC Endpoint in a Red Hat-owned AWS account. This endpoint service contains the name of the cluster, which is also in the ARN.

Under the *Allow principals* tab, a Red Hat-owned AWS account is listed. This specific user ensures that other entities cannot create VPC Endpoint connections to the PrivateLink clusterâ€™s Kubernetes API Server. 

When Red Hat SREs access the API, this fleet management plane can connect to the internal API through the VPC endpoint service.
