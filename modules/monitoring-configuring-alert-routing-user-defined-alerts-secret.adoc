[id="configuring-alert-routing-user-defined-alerts-secret_{context}"]
= Configuring alert routing for user-defined projects with the Alertmanager secret

[role="_abstract"]
If you have enabled a separate instance of Alertmanager that is dedicated to user-defined alert routing, you can customize where and how the instance sends notifications by editing the `alertmanager-user-workload` secret in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
All features of a supported version of upstream Alertmanager are also supported in an {ocp} Alertmanager configuration. To check all the configuration options of a supported version of upstream Alertmanager, see link:https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/{alertmanager-version}/configuration/[Alertmanager configuration] (Prometheus documentation).

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have enabled a separate instance of Alertmanager for user-defined alert routing.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
endif::[]
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Print the currently active Alertmanager configuration into the file `alertmanager.yaml`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get secret alertmanager-user-workload --template='{{ index .data "alertmanager.yaml" }}' | base64 --decode > alertmanager.yaml
----

. Edit the configuration in `alertmanager.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
global:
  http_config:
    proxy_from_environment: true
route:
  receiver: Default
  group_by:
  - name: Default
  routes:
  - matchers:
    - "service = prometheus-example-monitor"
    receiver: <receiver>
receivers:
- name: Default
- name: <receiver>
  <receiver_configuration>
----
+
where:

`proxy_from_environment`::
Specifies whether to enable proxying for all alert receivers. If you configured an HTTP cluster-wide proxy, set this parameter to `true` to enable proxying for all alert receivers.

`matchers`::
Specifies labels to match your alerts. This example targets all alerts that have the `service="prometheus-example-monitor"` label.

`<receiver>`::
Specifies the name of the receiver to use for the alerts group.

`<receiver_configuration>`::
Specifies the receiver configuration.

. Apply the new configuration in the file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring create secret generic alertmanager-user-workload --from-file=alertmanager.yaml --dry-run=client -o=yaml |  oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring replace secret --filename=-
