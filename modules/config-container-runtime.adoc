= Configuring the container runtime

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure the container runtime used with new workloads on your nodes. You can use either crun, which is considered a faster and more lightweight runtime, or runc, which is more widely used and considered more stable than crun. 

For information on crun and runc, see "About the container engine and container runtime".

Starting in {product-title} 4.18, crun is the default container runtime for new containers. You can change between the runtimes by using a `ContainerRuntimeConfig` object, as described in the procedure below. Changing the container runtime affects new workloads only. Existing workloads continue to use the existing container runtime. 

However, if you updated your cluster from {product-title} 4.17, the runc container runtime remains unchanged as the default. Specific machine configs were added to your cluster upon upgrade that override the new default of crun as the runtime. You can change the container runtime to crun, if needed by removing these machine configs at any time. 

.Procedure,

* Configure a cluster that is updated from {product-title} 4.17 to use the crun container runtime:

** Configure crun for worker nodes by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete machineconfig 00-override-worker-generated-crio-default-container-runtime
----

** Configure crun for control plane nodes by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete machineconfig 00-override-master-generated-crio-default-container-runtime
----

* Configure crun or runc as the container runtime for specific nodes by creating a container runtime configuration:

** Create a YAML file for the `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: ContainerRuntimeConfig
metadata:
 name: configure-runc
spec:
 machineConfigPoolSelector:
   matchLabels:
     pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: ''
 containerRuntimeConfig:
   defaultRuntime: "runc"
----
where:
+
--
* `spec.machineConfigPoolSelector.matchLabels`:: Specifies a label for the machine config pool that you want you want to modify.
* `spec.containerRuntimeConfig.defaultRuntime`:: Specifies the container runtime to use with new workloads on the nodes in the specified machine config pool, either `crun` or `runc`.
--

** Create the `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
----

.Verification

. After the nodes return to a ready state, open an `oc debug` session to a node by running a command similar to the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----
+
. Set `/host` as the root directory within the debug shell by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-5.1# chroot /host
----

. Check the container runtime by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-5.1# crio status config | grep default_runtime
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
INFO[2026-01-27 23:09:18.413462914Z] Starting CRI-O, version: 1.30.14-6.rhaos4.17.gitfa27f6f.el9, git: unknown(clean) 
    default_runtime = "runc"
----
+
The `default_runtime` parameter specifies the container runtime that {product-title} uses for new workloads on this node.
