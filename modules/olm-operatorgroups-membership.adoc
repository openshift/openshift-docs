= OperatorGroup membership

An Operator is considered a _member_ of an OperatorGroup if the following
conditions are true:

* The Operator's CSV exists in the same namespace as the OperatorGroup.
* The Operator's CSV's InstallModes support the set of namespaces targeted by
the OperatorGroup.

An InstallMode consists of an `InstallModeType` field and a boolean `Supported`
field. A CSV's spec can contain a set of InstallModes of four distinct
`InstallModeTypes`:

.InstallModes and supported OperatorGroups
[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|InstallModeType |Description

|`OwnNamespace`
|The Operator can be a member of an OperatorGroup that selects its own
 namespace.

|`SingleNamespace`
|The Operator can be a member of an OperatorGroup that selects one namespace.

|`MultiNamespace`
|The Operator can be a member of an OperatorGroup that selects more than one
namespace.

|`AllNamespaces`
|The Operator can be a member of an OperatorGroup that selects all namespaces
(target namespace set is the empty string `""`).

[NOTE]
====
If a CSV's spec omits an entry of `InstallModeType`, then that type is
considered unsupported unless support can be inferred by an existing entry that
implicitly supports it.
