This section describes Helm chart configuration parameters that you can use with the `helm install` and `helm upgrade` commands when installing {product-title-short} using Helm charts on the cluster where Central is installed or on secure clusters.
You can specify these parameters by using the `--set` option or by creating YAML configuration files.

Create the following files for configuring the Helm chart for installing {product-title}:

* Public configuration file `values-public.yaml`: Use this file to save all non-sensitive configuration options.
* Private configuration file `values-private.yaml`: Use this file to save all sensitive configuration options. Make sure that you store this file securely.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While using the `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart, do not modify the `values.yaml` file that is part of the chart.
