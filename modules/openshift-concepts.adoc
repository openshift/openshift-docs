OpenShift is a Kubernetes container platform that provides a trusted environment to run enterprise workloads. It extends the Kubernetes platform with built-in software to enhance app lifecycle development, operations, and security. With OpenShift, you can consistently deploy your workloads across hybrid cloud providers and environments. For more information about the differences between the community Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster offerings, see the link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cs_ov#openshift_kubernetes[comparison table].
