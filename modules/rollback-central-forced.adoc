= Rolling back Central forcefully

[role="_abstract"]
You can use forced rollback to roll back to an earlier version of Central (after the Central service starts).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using forced rollback to switch back to a previous version might result in loss of data and functionality.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must be using {product-title} version 3.0.58.0 or higher.
* Before you can perform a rollback, you must have free disk space available on your persistent storage. {product-title} uses disk space to keep a copy of databases during the upgrade. If the disk space is not enough to store a copy and the upgrade fails, you will not be able to roll back to an earlier version.

.Procedure

* Run the following commands to perform a forced rollback:
** To forcefully rollback to the previously installed version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox rollout undo deploy/central
----
** To forcefully rollback to a specific version:
. Edit Central’s `ConfigMap`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox edit configmap/central-config
----
. Update the value of the `maintenance.forceRollbackVersion` key:
+
[source,yaml]
----
data:
  central-config.yaml: |
    maintenance:
      safeMode: false
      compaction:
         enabled: true
         bucketFillFraction: .5
         freeFractionThreshold: 0.75
      forceRollbackVersion: <x.x.x.x> <1>
  ...
----
<1> Specify the version that you want to roll back to.
. Update the Central image version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox set image deploy/central central=stackrox.io/main:<x.x.x.x> <1>
----
<1> Specify the version that you want to roll back to. It should be the same version that you sepecified for the `maintenance.forceRollbackVersion` key in the `central-config` config map.
