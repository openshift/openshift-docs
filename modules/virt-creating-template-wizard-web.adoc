= Creating a virtual machine template with the wizard in the web console

The web console features the *Create Virtual Machine Template* wizard that guides you through the *General*, *Networking*, *Storage*, *Advanced*, and *Review* steps to simplify the process of creating virtual machine templates. All required fields are marked with a ++*++. The *Create Virtual Machine Template* wizard prevents you from moving to the next step until you provide values in the required fields.

[NOTE]
====
The wizard guides you to create a custom virtual machine template where you specify the operating system, boot source, flavor, and other settings.
====

.Procedure

. In the {VirtProductName} console, click *Workloads* -> *Virtualization* from the side menu.

. Click the *Templates* tab.

. Click *Create* and select *Template with Wizard*.

. Fill in all required fields in the *General* step.

. Click *Next* to progress to the *Networking* step. A NIC that is named `nic0` is attached by default.

.. Optional: Click *Add Network Interface* to create additional NICs.

.. Optional: You can remove any or all NICs by clicking the Options menu {kebab} and selecting *Delete*. Virtual machines created from a template do not need a NIC attached. NICs can be created after a virtual machine has been created.

. Click *Next* to progress to the *Storage* step.

. Click *Add Disk* to add a disk, and complete your selections for the fields in the *Add Disk* screen.

[NOTE]
====
If *Import via URL (creates PVC)*, *Import via Registry (creates PVC)*, or *Container (ephemeral)* is selected as *Source*, a `rootdisk` disk is created and attached to the virtual machine as the *Bootable Disk*.

A *Bootable Disk* is not required for virtual machines provisioned from a *PXE* source if there are no disks attached to the virtual machine. If one or more disks are attached to the virtual machine, you must select one as the *Bootable Disk*.

Blank disks, PVC disks without a valid boot source, and the cloudinitdisk cannot be used as a boot source.
====

. Optional: Click *Advanced* to configure cloud-init and SSH access.

+
[NOTE]
====
Statically inject an SSH key by using the custom script in cloud-init or in the wizard. This allows you to securely and remotely manage virtual machines and manage and transfer information. This step is strongly recommended to secure your VM. 
====

. Click *Review* to review and confirm your settings.

. Click *Create Virtual Machine template*.

. Click *See virtual machine template details* to view details about the virtual machine template.

The template is also listed in the *Templates* tab.
