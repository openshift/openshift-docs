= Sink binding

The `SinkBinding` object supports decoupling event production from delivery addressing. Sink binding is used to connect _event producers_ to an event consumer, or _sink_. An event producer is a Kubernetes resource that embeds a `PodSpec` template and produces events. A sink is an addressable Kubernetes object that can receive events.

The `SinkBinding` object injects environment variables into the `PodTemplateSpec` of the sink, which means that the application code does not need to interact directly with the Kubernetes API to locate the event destination. These environment variables are as follows:

`K_SINK`:: The URL of the resolved sink.
`K_CE_OVERRIDES`:: A JSON object that specifies overrides to the outbound event.

[NOTE]
====
The `SinkBinding` object currently does not support custom revision names for services.
