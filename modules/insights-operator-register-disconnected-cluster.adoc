= Registering your disconnected cluster

Register your disconnected {product-title} cluster on the {hybrid-console} so that your cluster is not impacted by the consequences listed in the section named "Consequences of disabling remote health reporting".

[IMPORTANT]

By registering your disconnected cluster, you can continue to report your subscription usage to Red Hat. In turn, Red Hat can return accurate usage and capacity trends associated with your subscription, so that you can use the returned information to better organize subscription allocations across all of your resources.
