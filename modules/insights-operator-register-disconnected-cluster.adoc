= Registering your disconnected cluster

Register your disconnected {product-title} cluster on the {hybrid-console} so that your cluster does not get impacted by disabling remote health reporting. For more information, see "Consequences of disabling remote health reporting".

[IMPORTANT]
====
By registering your disconnected cluster, you can continue to report your subscription usage to Red{nbsp}Hat. Red{nbsp}Hat can then return accurate usage and capacity trends associated with your subscription, so that you can use the returned information to better organize subscription allocations across all of your resources.
