= Configuring BYOH Windows instance

Creating a BYOH Windows instance requires creating a config map in the WMCO namespace.

.Prerequisites
Any Windows instances that are to be attached to the cluster as a node must fulfill the following requirements:

* The Docker container runtime must be installed on the instance.
* The instance must be on the same network as the Linux worker nodes in the cluster.
* Port 22 must be open and running an SSH server.
* The default shell for the SSH server must be the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_server_configuration#configuring-the-default-shell-for-openssh-in-windows[Windows Command shell], or `cmd.exe`.
* Port 10250 must be open for log collection.
* An administrator user is present with the private key used in the secret set as an authorized SSH key.
* If you are creating a BYOH Windows instance on vSphere, communication with the internal API server must be enabled.
* The hostname of the instance must follow the link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123[RFC 1123] DNS label requirements, which include the following standards:
** Contains only lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-'.
** Starts with an alphanumeric character.
** Ends with an alphanumeric character.

.Procedure
. Create a ConfigMap named `windows-instances` in the WMCO namespace that describes the Windows instances to be added.

[NOTE]
====
Format each entry in the config map's data section by using the address as the key while formatting the value as `username=<username>`.

.Example config map
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: windows-instances
  namespace: openshift-windows-machine-config-operator
data:
  10.1.42.1: |- <1>
    username=Administrator <2>
  instance.example.com: |-
    username=core
----
<1> The address to SSH in to the instance with, either a DNS name or an IPv4 address. A DNS PTR record must exist for this address. It is recommended that you use a DNS name with your BYOH instance if your organization uses DHCP to assign IP addresses. If not, you need to update the `windows-instances` ConfigMap whenever the instance is assigned a new IP address.
<2> The name of the administrator user created in the prerequisites.
