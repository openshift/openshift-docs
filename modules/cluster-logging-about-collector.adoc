= About the logging collector

The {logging-title} collects container and node logs.

By default, the log collector uses the following sources:

* journald for all system logs
* `/var/log/containers/*.log` for all container logs

If you configure the log collector to collect audit logs, it gets them from `/var/log/audit/audit.log`.

The logging collector is a daemon set that deploys pods to each {product-title} node. System and infrastructure logs are generated by journald log messages from the operating system, the container runtime, and {product-title}. Application logs are generated by the CRI-O container engine. Fluentd collects the logs from these sources and forwards them internally or externally as you configure in {product-title}.

The container runtimes provide minimal information to identify the source of log messages: project, pod name, and container ID. This information is not sufficient to uniquely identify the source of the logs. If a pod with a given name and project is deleted before the log collector begins processing its logs, information from the API server, such as labels and annotations, might not be available. There might not be a way to distinguish the log messages from a similarly named pod and project or trace the logs to their source. This limitation means that log collection and normalization are considered *best effort*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The available container runtimes provide minimal information to identify the
source of log messages and do not guarantee unique individual log
messages or that these messages can be traced to their source.
