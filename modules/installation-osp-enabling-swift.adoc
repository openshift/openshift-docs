= Enabling Swift on OpenStack

{product-title} on OpenStack uses https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/object-storage.html[OpenStack Object Storage (Swift)] to store and serve user configuration files.

//[Ignition](https://coreos.com/ignition/docs/latest/what-is-ignition.html)

Swift is operated by a user account with the `swiftoperator` role and `temp-url` support.

.Prerequisites

* An OpenStack administrator account on the target environment
* On Ceph RGW, https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/config-ref/#swift-settings[the `account in url` option must be enabled]

.Procedure

To enable Swift on OpenStack:

. As an administrator in the OpenStack CLI, add the `swiftoperator` role to the account that will access Swift:
+
----
$ openstack role add --user <user> --project <project> swiftoperator
----
. As the account with the `swiftoperator` role, set a temporary URL property for the account:
+
----
$ openstack object store account set --property Temp-URL-Key=superkey
----

Your OpenStack deployment can now use Swift to store and serve files.
