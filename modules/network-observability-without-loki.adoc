= Network Observability without Loki
You can use Network Observability without Loki by not performing the Loki installation steps and skipping directly to "Installing the Network Observability Operator". If you only want to export flows to a Kafka consumer or IPFIX collector, or you only need dashboard metrics, then you do not need to install Loki or provide storage for Loki.  Without Loki, there is no *Network Traffic* panel under *Observe*, which means there is no overview charts, flow table, or topology. The following table compares available features with and without Loki:
