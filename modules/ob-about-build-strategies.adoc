= BuildStrategy and ClusterBuildStrategy resources

[role="_abstract"] 

The `BuildStrategy` and `ClusterBuildStrategy` resources define a series of steps to assemble an application. You can use the `BuildStrategy` resources within a namespace and the `ClusterBuildStrategy` resources within a cluster.

The specification of a `BuildStrategy` or `ClusterBuildStrategy` resource consists of a `steps` object. The following example shows the specification of the `buildah` cluster build strategy:
