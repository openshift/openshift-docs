= Updating with a {op-system} custom layered image

When you configure {op-system-first} image layering, {product-title} no longer automatically updates the node pool that uses the custom layered image. You become responsible to manually update your nodes as appropriate.

To update a node that uses a custom layered image, follow these general steps:

. The cluster automatically upgrades to version x.y.z+1, except for the nodes that use the custom layered image.

. You could then create a new Containerfile that references the updated {product-title} image and the RPM that you had previously applied.

. Create a new machine config that points to the updated custom layered image.

Updating a node with a custom layered image is not required. However, if that node gets too far behind the current {product-title} version, you could experience unexpected results.
