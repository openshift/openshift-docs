The CVEs view organizes information into the following groups:

* *CVE*: Displays a unique identifier for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), each representing a specific vulnerability, to track and analyze it in detail.
* *Images by severity*: Groups images based on the severity level of the associated vulnerabilities.
* *Top CVSS*: Displays the highest CVSS score for each CVE across images to highlight the vulnerabilities with the most severe impact.
* *Top NVD CVSS*: Shows the highest severity scores from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to enable standardized impact assessments.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can see the *Top NVD CVSS* column only if you have enabled Scanner V4.
====
* *EPSS probability*: The likelihood that the vulnerability will be exploited according to the link:https://www.first.org/epss/model[Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)]. This EPSS data provides a percentage estimate of the probability that exploitation of this vulnerability will be observed in the next 30 days. The EPSS collects data of observed exploitation activity from partners, and exploitation activity does not mean that an attempted exploitation was successful. The EPSS score should be used as a single data point _along with other information_, such as the age of the CVE, to help you prioritize the vulnerabilities to address. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7106599[{product-title-short} and EPSS].
* *Affected images*: Displays the number of container images affected by specific CVEs to assess the scope of vulnerabilities.
* *First discovered*: Shows the date each vulnerability was first discovered in the environment to measure the duration of its exposure.
* *Published*: Indicates when the CVE was publicly disclosed.
