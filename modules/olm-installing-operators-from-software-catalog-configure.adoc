= About Operator Catalogs in {product-title}

Out of the box {product-title} provides a catalog source for community operators.
These operators are built and distributed by the community.
There are ongoing efforts to make more operators available through a community operator catalog.

Please note that the Red Hat Operators catalog is not available in {product-title}. According to the subscription agreement, these operators can be used only on OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

// In the future we may add a reference to OKDerators here.
