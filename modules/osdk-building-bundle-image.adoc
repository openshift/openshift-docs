= Building a bundle image

You can build, push, and validate an Operator bundle image using the Operator SDK.

.Prerequisites

* Operator SDK version 0.19.4
* `podman` version 1.9.3+
* An Operator project generated using the Operator SDK
* Access to a registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The internal registry of the {product-title} cluster cannot be used as the target registry because it does not support pushing without a tag, which is required during the mirroring process.
====

.Procedure

. Run the following `make` commands in your Operator project directory to build and push your Operator image. Modify the `IMG` argument in the following steps to reference a repository that you have access to. You can obtain an account for storing containers at repository sites such as Quay.io.

.. Build the image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make docker-build IMG=<registry>/<user>/<operator_image_name>:<tag>
----

.. Push the image to a repository:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make docker-push IMG=<registry>/<user>/<operator_image_name>:<tag>
----

. Update your `Makefile` by setting the `IMG` URL to your Operator image name and tag that you pushed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ # Image URL to use all building/pushing image targets
IMG ?= <registry>/<user>/<operator_image_name>:<tag>
----
+
This value is used for subsequent operations.

. Create your Operator bundle manifest by running the `make bundle` command, which invokes several commands, including the Operator SDK `generate bundle` and `bundle validate` subcommands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make bundle
----
+
Bundle manifests for an Operator describe how to display, create, and manage an application. The `make bundle` command creates the following files and directories in your Operator project:
+
--
* A bundle manifests directory named `bundle/manifests` that contains a `ClusterServiceVersion` object
* A bundle metadata directory named `bundle/metadata`
* All custom resource definitions (CRDs) in a `config/crd` directory
* A Dockerfile `bundle.Dockerfile`
--
+
These files are then automatically validated by using `operator-sdk bundle validate` to ensure the on-disk bundle representation is correct.

. Build and push your bundle image by running the following commands. OLM consumes Operator bundles using an index image, which reference one or more bundle images.

.. Build the bundle image. Set `BUNDLE_IMG` with the details for the registry, user namespace, and image tag where you intend to push the image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make bundle-build BUNDLE_IMG=<registry>/<user>/<bundle_image_name>:<tag>
----

.. Push the bundle image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker push <registry>/<user>/<bundle_image_name>:<tag>
----
