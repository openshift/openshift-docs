storage consumption.

.Prerequisites

* You must have `cluster-admin` permission to view the usage statistics.

* Metrics must be installed to view the usage statistics.

.Procedure

To view the usage statistics:

. Run the following command:
+
----
$ oc adm top pods
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc adm top pods -n openshift-console
NAME                         CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)
