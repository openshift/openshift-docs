= Viewing pod usage statistics

You can display usage statistics about pods, which provide the runtime
environments for containers. These usage statistics include CPU, memory, and
storage consumption.

.Prerequisites

* You must have `cluster-reader` permission to view the usage statistics.
* Metrics must be installed to view the usage statistics.

.Procedure

. View the usage statistics by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm top pods -n <namespace>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

. Optional: Add the `--selector=''` label to view usage statistics for pods with labels. Note that you must choose the label query to filter on, such as `=`, `==`, or `!=`. For example: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm top pod --selector='<pod_name>'
