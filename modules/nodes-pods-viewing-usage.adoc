= Viewing pod usage statistics

You can display usage statistics about pods, which provide the runtime
environments for Containers. These usage statistics include CPU, memory, and
storage consumption.

.Prerequisites

* You must have `cluster-reader` permission to view the usage statistics.

* Metrics must be installed to view the usage statistics.

.Procedure

To view the usage statistics:

. Run the following command:
+
----
$ oc adm top pods
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc adm top pods
NAME                         CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)
hawkular-cassandra-1-pqx6l   219m         1240Mi
hawkular-metrics-rddnv       20m          1765Mi
heapster-n94r4               3m           37Mi
----

. Run the following command to view the usage statistics for pods with labels:
+
----
$ oc adm top pod --selector=''
----
+
You must choose the selector (label query) to filter on. Supports `=`, `==`, and `!=`.
