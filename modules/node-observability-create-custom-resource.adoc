= Creating the Node Observability custom resource

Before you run profiling queries, you must create a `NodeObservability` custom resource (CR).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The worker nodes matching the `nodeSelector` specified in `NodeObservability` CR are rebooted. It might take 10 or more minutes to complete.
====

When you apply the `NodeObservability` CR, the necessary machine config and machine config pool CRs are created to enable the CRI-O profiling on the worker nodes matching the `nodeSelector`.

[NOTE]
====
Kubelet profiling is enabled by default.
====

The CRI-O unix socket of the node is mounted on the agent pod, which allows the agent to communicate with CRIO to run the pprof request. Similiarly, the `kubelet-serving-ca` certificate chain is mounted on the agent pod, which allows secure communication between the agent and node's kubelet endpoint.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the Node Observability Operator.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login -u kubeadmin https://<HOSTNAME>:6443
----

. Switch back to the `node-observability-operator` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project node-observability-operator
----

. Create a CR file named `nodeobservability.yaml` that contains the following text:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    apiVersion: nodeobservability.olm.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    kind: NodeObservability
    metadata:
      name: cluster <1>
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: "" <2>
      type: crio-kubelet
----
<1> You must specify the name as `cluster` because there should be only one `NodeObservability` CR per cluster.
<2> Specify the nodes on which the Node Observability agent must be deployed.

. Run the `NodeObservability` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc apply -f nodeobservability.yaml
----

+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
nodeobservability.olm.openshift.io/cluster created
----

. Review the status of the `NodeObservability` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nob/cluster -o yaml | yq '.status.conditions'
----

+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
conditions:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-07-05T07:33:54Z"
    message: 'DaemonSet node-observability-ds ready: true NodeObservabilityMachineConfig
      ready: true'
    reason: Ready
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
----

+
`NodeObservability` CR run is completed when the reason is `Ready` and the status is `True`.
