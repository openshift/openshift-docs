== Bug fixes
* Before this update, a problem with the Fluentd collector caused it to not capture OAuth login events stored in `/var/log/auth-server/audit.log`. This led to incomplete collection of login events from the OAuth service. With this update, the Fluentd collector now resolves this issue by capturing all login events from the OAuth service, including those stored in `/var/log/auth-server/audit.log`, as expected.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3730[LOG-3730])

* Before this update, when structured parsing was enabled and messages were forwarded to multiple destinations, they were not deep copied. This resulted in some of the received logs including the structured message, while others did not. With this update, the configuration generation has been modified to deep copy messages before JSON parsing. As a result, all received logs now have structured messages included, even when they are forwarded to multiple destinations.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3767[LOG-3767])
