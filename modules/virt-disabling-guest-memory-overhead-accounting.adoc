= Disabling guest memory overhead accounting

[WARNING]
====
This procedure is only useful in certain use-cases and must
only be attempted by advanced users.
====

A small amount of memory is requested by each virtual machine instance in
addition to the amount that you request. This additional memory is used for
the infrastructure that wraps each `VirtualMachineInstance` process.

Though it is not usually advisable, it is possible to increase the virtual machine instance
density on the node by disabling guest memory overhead accounting.


.Procedure

. To disable guest memory overhead accounting, edit the YAML configuration
file and set the `overcommitGuestOverhead` value to `true`. This parameter is
disabled by default.

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  template:
    domain:
    resources:
        overcommitGuestOverhead: true
        requests:
          memory: 1024M

[NOTE]
====
If `overcommitGuestOverhead` is enabled, it adds the guest overhead
to memory limits, if present.
