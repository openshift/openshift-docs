= Disabling guest memory overhead accounting

A small amount of memory is requested by each virtual machine instance in addition to the amount that you request. This additional memory is used for the infrastructure that wraps each `VirtualMachineInstance` process.

Though it is not usually advisable, it is possible to increase the virtual machine instance density on the node by disabling guest memory overhead accounting.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Disabling guest memory overhead accounting increases the potential for virtual machine processes to be killed due to memory pressure (OOM killed).

The potential for a VM to be OOM killed varies based on your specific configuration, node memory, available swap space, virtual machine memory consumption, the use of kernel same-page merging (KSM), and other factors.

.Procedure

. To disable guest memory overhead accounting, edit the YAML configuration file and set the `overcommitGuestOverhead` value to `true`. This parameter is disabled by default.

[NOTE]
====
If `overcommitGuestOverhead` is enabled, it adds the guest overhead to memory limits, if present.
