= Gathering data for a customer support case

If you open a customer support case, you can run the `must-gather` tool with the `openshift-migration-must-gather-rhel8` image to collect information about your cluster and upload it to the link:https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal].

The `openshift-migration-must-gather-rhel8` image collects logs and Custom Resource data that are not collected by the default `must-gather` image.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.

. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command:
+

----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-must-gather-rhel8
----

+
The `must-gather` tool collects the cluster information and stores it in a `must-gather.local.<uid>` directory.

. Remove authentication keys and other sensitive information from the `must-gather` data.

. Create an archive file containing the contents of the `must-gather.local.<uid>` directory:
+

----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather.local.<uid>/
----

+
You can attach the compressed file to your customer support case on the
link:https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal].
