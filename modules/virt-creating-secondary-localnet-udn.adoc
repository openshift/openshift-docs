= Creating a user-defined-network for localnet topology by using the CLI

You can create a secondary cluster-scoped user-defined-network (CUDN) for the localnet network topology by using the CLI.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You installed the Kubernetes NMState Operator.

.Procedure
. Create a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` object to map the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network to an Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge:
+
.Example `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: mapping # <1>
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: '' # <2>
  desiredState:
    ovn:
      bridge-mappings:
      - localnet: tenantblue # <3>
        bridge: br-ex # <4>
        state: present # <5>
----
<1> The name of the configuration object.
<2> Specifies the nodes to which the node network configuration policy is applied. The recommended node selector value is `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ''`.
<3> The name of the additional network from which traffic is forwarded to the OVS bridge. This attribute must match the value of the `spec.network.localnet.physicalNetworkName` field of the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` object that defines the OVN-Kubernetes additional network. This example uses the name `tenantblue`.
<4> The name of the OVS bridge on the node. This value is required if the `state` attribute is `present` or not specified.
<5> The state of the mapping. Must be either `present` to add the mapping or `absent` to remove the mapping. The default value is `present`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{VirtProductName} does not support Linux bridge bonding modes 0, 5, and 6. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/67546[Which bonding modes work when used with a bridge that virtual machine guests or containers connect to?].

. Apply the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----
+
where:

<filename>:: Specifies the name of your `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest YAML file.

. Create a `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` object to create a localnet secondary network:
+
.Example `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` manifest
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: ClusterUserDefinedNetwork
metadata:
  name: cudn-localnet # <1>
spec:
  namespaceSelector: # <2>
    matchExpressions: # <3>
    - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name
      operator: In # <4>
      values: ["red", "blue"]
  network:
    topology: Localnet # <5>
    localnet:
        role: Secondary # <6>
        physicalNetworkName: tenantblue # <7>
        ipam:
          mode: Disabled # <8>
# ...
----
<1> The name of the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource.
<2> The set of namespaces that the cluster UDN applies to. The namespace selector must not point to the following values: `default`; an `openshift-*` namespace; or any global namespaces that are defined by the Cluster Network Operator (CNO).
<3> The type of selector. In this example, the `matchExpressions` selector selects objects that have the label `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` with the value `red` or `blue`.
<4> The type of operator. Possible values are `In`, `NotIn`, and `Exists`.
<5> The topological configuration of the network. A `Localnet` topology connects the logical network to the physical underlay.
<6> Specifies whether the UDN is primary or secondary. The required value is `Secondary` for `topology: Localnet`.
<7> The name of the OVN-Kubernetes bridge mapping that is configured on the node. This value must match the `spec.desiredState.ovn.bridge-mappings.localnet` field in the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest that you previously created. This ensures that you are bridging to the intended segment of your physical network.
<8> Specifies whether IP address management (IPAM) is enabled or disabled. The required value is `Disabled`. {VirtProductName} does not support configuring IPAM for virtual machines.

. Apply the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` manifest by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----
+
where:

<filename>:: Specifies the name of your `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` manifest YAML file.
