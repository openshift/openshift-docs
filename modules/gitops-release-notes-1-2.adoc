[id="new-features-1-2_{context}"]
== New features
In addition to the fixes and stability improvements, the following sections highlight what is new in {gitops-title} 1.2:

* If you do not have read or write access to the openshift-gitops namespace, you can now use the `DISABLE_DEFAULT_ARGOCD_INSTANCE` environment variable in the GitOps Operator and set the value to `TRUE` to prevent the default Argo CD instance from starting in the `openshift-gitops` namespace.
* Resource requests and limits are now configured in Argo CD workloads.  Resource quota is enabled in the `openshift-gitops` namespace. As a result, out-of-band workloads deployed manually in the openshift-gitops namespace must be configured with resource requests and limits and the resource quota may need to be increased.
* Argo CD authentication is now integrated with Red Hat SSO and it is automatically configured with OpenShift 4 Identity Provider on the cluster. This feature is disabled by default.  To enable Red Hat SSO, add SSO configuration in `ArgoCD` CR as shown below. Currently,`keycloak` is the only supported provider.

----
* You can now define hostnames using route labels to support router sharding. Support for setting labels on the `server` (argocd server), `grafana`, and `prometheus` routes is now available. To set labels on a route, add `labels` under the route configuration for a server in the `ArgoCD` CR.

----
* The GitOps Operator now automatically grants permissions to Argo CD instances to manage resources in target namespaces by applying labels. Users can label the target namespace with the label `argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by: <source-namespace>`, where the `source-namespace` is the namespace where the argocd instance is deployed.

[id="fixed-issues-1-2_{context}"]
== Fixed issues
The following issues were resolved in the current release:

* Previously, if a user created additional instances of Argo CD managed by the default cluster instance in the openshift-gitops namespace, the application responsible for the new Argo CD instance would get stuck in an `OutOfSync` status. This issue has now been resolved by adding an owner reference to the cluster secret. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1025[GITOPS-1025]

[id="known-issues-1-2_{context}"]
== Known issues
These are the known issues in {gitops-title} 1.2:

* When an Argo CD instance is deleted from the source namespace, the `argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by` labels in the target namespaces are not removed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1228[GITOPS-1228]

* Resource quota has been enabled in the openshift-gitops namespace in {gitops-title} 1.2. This can affect out-of-band workloads deployed manually and workloads deployed by the default Argo CD instance in the `openshift-gitops` namespace. When you upgrade from {gitops-title} `v1.1.2` to `v1.2` such workloads must be configured with resource requests and limits. If there are any additional workloads, the resource quota in the openshift-gitops namespace must be increased.

You can replace the path in the above commands from `cpu` to `memory` to update the memory.
