= Enabling TPM v2 disk encryption
Use the following procedure to enable TPM v2 mode disk encryption during an {product-title} installation.

.Prerequisites

* You have downloaded the {product-title} installation program on your installation node.

.Procedure

. Check to see if TPM v2 encryption needs to be enabled in the BIOS on each node. This is required on most Dell systems. Check the manual for your computer.

. On your installation node, change to the directory that contains the installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<installation_directory>` with the path to the directory that you want to store the installation files in.

. Create machine config files to encrypt the boot disks for the control plane or compute nodes using the TPM v2 encryption mode.

** To configure encryption on the control plane nodes, save the following machine config sample to a file in the `<installation_directory>/openshift` directory. For example, name the file `99-openshift-master-tpmv2-encryption.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: master-tpm
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.1.0
    storage:
      files:
      - contents:
          source: data:text/plain;base64,e30K
        mode: 420
        overwrite: true
        path: /etc/clevis.json
----

** To configure encryption on the compute nodes, save the following machine config sample to a file in the `<installation_directory>/openshift` directory. For example, name the file `99-openshift-worker-tpmv2-encryption.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: worker-tpm
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.1.0
    storage:
      files:
      - contents:
          source: data:text/plain;base64,e30K
        mode: 420
        overwrite: true
        path: /etc/clevis.json
----

. Create a backup copy of the YAML files. The original YAML files are consumed when you create the Ignition config files.

. Continue with the remainder of the {product-title} installation.
