= Enabling TPM v2 disk encryption
Use this procedure to enable TPM v2 mode disk encryption during {product-title} deployment.

[NOTE]
====
On previous versions of {op-system}, disk encryption was configured by specifying `/etc/clevis.json` in the Ignition config. That file is not supported in clusters created with {product-title} 4.7 or above, and the LUKS device should be configured directly via the Ignition `luks` section.
====

.Procedure

. Check to see if TPM v2 encryption needs to be enabled in the BIOS on each node.
This is required on most Dell systems. Check the manual for your computer.

. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir=<installation_directory>
----

. In the `openshift` directory, create master or worker files to encrypt
disks for those nodes.

[NOTE]
====
If you are also configuring boot disk mirroring on the affected nodes, skip this step. You will configure disk encryption when configuring boot disk mirroring.
====

** To create a worker file, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF > ./99-openshift-worker-tpmv2-encryption.yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: worker-tpm
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    storage:
      luks:
        - name: root
          device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/root
          clevis:
            tpm2: true
      filesystems:
        - device: /dev/mapper/root
          format: xfs
          wipeFilesystem: true
          label: root
EOF
----
** To create a master file, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF > ./99-openshift-master-tpmv2-encryption.yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: master-tpm
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    storage:
      luks:
        - name: root
          device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/root
          clevis:
            tpm2: true
      filesystems:
        - device: /dev/mapper/root
          format: xfs
          wipeFilesystem: true
          label: root
EOF

. Make a backup copy of the YAML file. You should do this because the file will be deleted when you create the cluster.

. Continue with the remainder of the {product-title} deployment.
