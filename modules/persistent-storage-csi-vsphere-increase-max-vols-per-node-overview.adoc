= Increasing maximum volumes per node for vSphere

For VMware vSphere version 7, {product-title} restricts the maximum number of volumes per node to 59. 

However, for vSphere version 8 or later, you can increase the allowable number of volumes per node to a maximum of 255. Otherwise, the default value remains at 59.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must have an homogeneous vSphere 8 environment that only contains ESXi 8 hypervisors. Heterogeneous environments that contain a mix of versions of ESXi other than 8 are not allowed. In such heterogenous environment, if you set a value greater than 59, the cluster degrades.
====

.Limitations

* You must be running VMware vSphere version 8 or later.

* You can potentially exceed the limit of 2048 virtual disks per host if you increase the maximum number of volumes per node on enough nodes. This can occur because there is no Distributed Resource scheduler (DRS) validation for vSphere to ensure you do not exceed this limit.
