= Completing an AWS installation on user-provisioned infrastructure

After you start the {product-title} installation on Amazon Web Service (AWS)
user-provisioned infrastructure, monitor the deployment to completion.

.Prerequisites

* You removed the bootstrap node for an {product-title} cluster on user-provisioned AWS infrastructure.
* You installed the `oc` CLI.

the cluster installation:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install --dir <installation_directory> wait-for install-complete <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
INFO Waiting up to 40m0s for the cluster at https://api.mycluster.example.com:6443 to initialize...
INFO Waiting up to 10m0s for the openshift-console route to be created...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "4vYBz-Fe5en-ymBEc-Wt6NL"
INFO Time elapsed: 1s

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for _Recovering from expired control plane certificates_ for more information.
