= Benefits of a user-defined network

User-defined networks provide the following benefits:

. Enhanced network isolation for security
+
* **Tenant isolation**: Namespaces can have their own isolated primary network, similar to how tenants are isolated in {rh-openstack-first}. This improves security by reducing the risk of cross-tenant traffic.

. Network flexibility
+
* **Layer 2 and layer 3 support**: Cluster administrators can configure primary networks as layer 2 or layer 3 network types. This provides the flexibility of a secondary network to the primary network.

. Simplified network management
+
* **Reduced network configuration complexity**: With user-defined networks, the need for complex network policies are eliminated because isolation can be achieved by grouping workloads in different networks.

. Advanced capabilities
+
* **Consistent and selectable IP addressing**: Users can specify and reuse IP subnets across different namespaces and clusters, providing a consistent networking environment.
+
* **Support for multiple networks**: The user-defined networking feature allows administrators to connect multiple namespaces to a single network, or to create distinct networks for different sets of namespaces.

. Simplification of application migration from {rh-openstack-first}
+
* **Network parity**: With user-defined networking, the migration of applications from OpenStack to {product-title} is simplified by providing similar network isolation and configuration options.

Developers and administrators can create a user-defined network that is namespace scoped using the custom resource. An overview of the process is: create a namespace, create and configure the custom resource, create pods in the namespace.
