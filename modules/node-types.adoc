[id='node-roles-{context}']
= Node roles in {product-title}

{product-title} assigns hosts different roles. These roles define the function
of the node within the cluster. The cluster contains standard definitions for
standard role types, such as bootstrap, master, and worker. 

A node with the bootstrap role
provides the initial configuration to clusters and is used only during initial
configuration.

Nodes with the master role run the cluster
infrastructure and required components. Instead of being grouped into a `MachineSet`,
they are a series of standalone machine API resources. Extra controls apply to
master nodes to prevent you from deleting all master nodes and breaking your
cluster.

Nodes with the worker role drive compute workloads. Each type of worker node is
governed by a specific machine pool that autoscales them.
