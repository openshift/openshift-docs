= Restoring node network configuration after removing an interface

Removing an interface from a node does not automatically restore the node network configuration to a previous state. After you remove an interface, any of the node NICs throughout the cluster that were previously attached or subordinate to the interface are placed in a `down` state. Restore the NICs by applying a new `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest to the cluster.

.Procedure

. Create a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest that specifies the NIC and the desired state of `up`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1alpha1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: eth1
spec:
  desiredState:
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        enabled: true
----

. Apply the manifest to the cluster:
+
----
$ oc apply -f <eth1.yaml> <1>
----
<1> File name of the Policy manifest.
