= Exposing TCP services

{product-title} routes expose applications by proxying traffic through
HTTP/HTTPS(SNI)/TLS(SNI) to pods and services. A
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/#loadbalancer[LoadBalancer]
service creates an AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for your {product-title}
cluster, enabling direct TCP access to applications exposed by your LoadBalancer
service.

[NOTE]
====
LoadBalancer services require an additional purchase. Contact your sales team if
you are interested in using LoadBalancer services for your {product-title}
cluster.
====

== Checking your LoadBalancer Quota

By purchasing LoadBalancer services, you are provided with a quota of
LoadBalancers available for your {product-title} cluster.

== Exposing TCP service

You can expose your applications over an external LoadBalancer service, enabling
access over the public Internet.

----
$ oc expose dc httpd-example --type=LoadBalancer --name=lb-service
service/lb-service exposed
----

== Creating an internal-only TCP service

You can alternatively expose your applications internally only, enabling access
only through AWS VPC Peering or a VPN connection.

----
$ oc expose dc httpd-example --type=LoadBalancer --name=internal-lb --dry-run -o
yaml | awk '1;/metadata:/{ print "  annotations:\n
service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: \"true\"" }' | oc
create -f -service/internal-lb exposed
----

== Using your TCP Service

Once your LoadBalancer service is created, you can access your service by using
the URL provided to you by {product-title}. The `LoadBalancer Ingress` value is
a URL unique to your service that remains static as long as the service is not
deleted. If you prefer to use a custom domain, you can create a CNAME DNS record
for this URL.
