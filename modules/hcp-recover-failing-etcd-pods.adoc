[id="hcp-recover-failing-etcd-pods_{context}"]
= Recovering a failing etcd pod

Each etcd pod of a 3-node cluster has its own persistent volume claim (PVC) to store its data. An etcd pod might fail because of corrupted or missing data. You can recover a failing etcd pod and its PVC.

.Procedure

. To confirm that the etcd pod is failing, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -l app=etcd -n <hosted_control_plane_namespace>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     READY   STATUS             RESTARTS     AGE
etcd-0   2/2     Running            0            64m
etcd-1   2/2     Running            0            45m
etcd-2   1/2     CrashLoopBackOff   1 (5s ago)   64m
----
+
The failing etcd pod might have the `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Error` status.

. Delete the failing pod and its PVC by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pvc/<etcd_pvc_name> pod/<etcd_pod_name> --wait=false
----

.Verification

* Verify that a new etcd pod is up and running by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -l app=etcd -n <hosted_control_plane_namespace>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
etcd-0   2/2     Running   0          67m
etcd-1   2/2     Running   0          48m
etcd-2   2/2     Running   0          2m2s
