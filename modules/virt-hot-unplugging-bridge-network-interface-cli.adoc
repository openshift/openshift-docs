= Hot unplugging a bridge network interface using the CLI

You can remove a bridge network interface from a running virtual machine (VM). 

.Prerequisites

* Your VM must be running.
* The VM must be created on a cluster running {VirtProductName} 4.14 or later.
* The VM must have a bridge network interface attached.

.Procedure

. Hot unplug a bridge network interface by running the following command. The `virtctl removeinterface` command detaches the network interface from the guest, but the interface still exists in the pod.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl removeinterface <vm_name> --name <interface_name>
----

. Remove the interface from the pod by migrating the VM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl migrate <vm_name>
