[id="virt-hot-unplugging-bridge-network-interface_{context}"]
= Hot unplugging a secondary network interface by using the CLI

You can remove a secondary network interface from a running virtual machine (VM).

[NOTE]
====
Hot unplugging is not supported for Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) interfaces.
====

.Prerequisites

* Your VM must be running.
* The VM must be created on a cluster running {VirtProductName} 4.14 or later.
* The VM must have a bridge network interface attached.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Using your preferred text editor, edit the `VirtualMachine` manifest file and set the interface state to `absent`. Setting the interface state to `absent` detaches the network interface from the guest, but the interface still exists in the pod.

----
<1> Set the interface state to `absent` to detach it from the running VM. Removing the interface details from the VM specification does not hot unplug the secondary network interface.

. Save your changes and exit the editor.

. For the new configuration to take effect, apply the changes by running the following command. Applying the changes triggers automatic VM live migration and removes the interface from the pod.
