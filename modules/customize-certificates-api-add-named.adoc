= Add an API server named certificate

The default API server certificate is issued by an internal {product-title}
cluster CA. You can add one or more alternative certificates that the API
server will return based on the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) requested by
the client, for example when a reverse proxy or load balancer is used.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a certificate for the FQDN and its corresponding private key. Each should be in a separate PEM format file.
* The private key must be unencrypted. If your key is encrypted, decrypt it
before importing it into {product-title}.
* The certificate must include the `subjectAltName` extension showing the FQDN.
* The certificate file can contain one or more certificates in a chain. The
certificate for the API server FQDN must be the first certificate in the file.
It can then be followed with any intermediate certificates, and the file should
end with the root CA certificate.

[WARNING]
====
Do not provide a named certificate for the internal load balancer (host
name `api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`). Doing so will leave your
cluster in a degraded state.
====

.Procedure

. Create a secret that contains the certificate chain and private key in the
`openshift-config` namespace.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret tls <secret> \//<1>
     --cert=</path/to/cert.crt> \//<2>
     --key=</path/to/cert.key> \//<3>
     -n openshift-config
----
<1> `<secret>` is the name of the secret that will contain the certificate chain and private key.
<2> `</path/to/cert.crt>` is the path to the certificate chain on your local file system.
<3> `</path/to/cert.key>` is the path to the private key associated with this certificate.

. Update the API server to reference the created secret.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch apiserver cluster \
     --type=merge -p \
     '{"spec":{"servingCerts": {"namedCertificates":
     [{"names": ["<FQDN>"], //<1>
     "servingCertificate": {"name": "<secret>"}}]}}}' <2>
----
<1> Replace `<FQDN>` with the FQDN that the API server should provide the certificate for.
<2> Replace `<secret>` with the name used for the secret in the previous step.

. Examine the `apiserver/cluster` object and confirm the secret is now
referenced.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get apiserver cluster -o yaml
