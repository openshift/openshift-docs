= Add an API server named certificate

The default API server certificate is issued by an internal {product-title}
cluster CA. You can add additional certificates to the API server to send
based on the client's requested URL, such as when a reverse proxy or
load balancer is used.

.Prerequisites

* You must have the certificate and key, in the PEM format, for the
client's URL.
* The certificate must be issued for the URL used by the client to
reach the API server.
* The certificate must have the `subjectAltName` extension for the URL.

If a certificate chain is used, all certificates must be manually concatenated into a single named certificate file. This can be achieved with the following example: `cat first_cert.pem second_cert.pem third_cert.pem >combined_cert.pem`. 

The order of the chain should be:

* {product-title} master host certificate.

* Intermediate CA certificate.

* Root CA certificate.


[WARNING]
====
Do not provide a named certificate for the internal load balancer (host
name `api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`). Doing so will leave your
cluster in a degraded state.
====

.Procedure

. Create a secret that contains the certificate and key in the
`openshift-config` namespace.
+
----
$ oc create secret tls <certificate> \//<1>
     --cert=</path/to/cert.crt> \//<2>
     --key=</path/to/cert.key> \//<3>
     -n openshift-config
----
<1> `<certificate>` is the name of the secret that will contain
the certificate.
<2> `</path/to/cert.crt>` is the path to the certificate on your
local file system.
<3> `</path/to/cert.key>` is the path to the private key associated
with this certificate.

. Update the API server to reference the created secret.
+
----
$ oc patch apiserver cluster \
     --type=merge -p \
     '{"spec":{"servingCerts": {"namedCertificates":
     [{"names": ["<hostname>"], //<1>
     "servingCertificate": {"name": "<certificate>"}}]}}}' <2>
----
<1> Replace `<hostname>` with the hostname that the API server
should provide the certificate for.
<2> Replace `<certificate>` with the name used for the secret in
the previous step.

. Examine the `apiserver/cluster` object and confirm the secret is now
referenced.
+
----
$ oc get apiserver cluster -o yaml
...
spec:
  servingCerts:
    namedCertificates:
    - names:
      - <hostname>
      servingCertificate:
        name: <certificate>
...
