= User Telemetry

Red Hat collects anonymized user data from your browser. This anonymized data includes what pages, features, and resource types that the user of all clusters with enabled telemetry uses.

Other considerations:

* User events are grouped as a SHA-1 hash.
* User's IP address is saved as `0.0.0.0`.
* User names and IP addresses are never saved as separate values.
