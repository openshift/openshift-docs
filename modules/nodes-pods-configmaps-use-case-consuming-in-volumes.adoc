= Injecting content into a volume by using config maps

You can inject content into a volume by using config maps.

.Example `ConfigMap` custom resource (CR)
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: special-config
  namespace: default
data:
  special.how: very
  special.type: charm
----

.Procedure

You have a couple different options for injecting content into a volume by using config maps.

* The most basic way to inject content into a volume by using a config map is to populate the volume with files where the key is the file name and the content of the file is the value of the key:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dapi-test-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: gcr.io/google_containers/busybox
      command: [ "/bin/sh", "cat", "/etc/config/special.how" ]
      volumeMounts:
      - name: config-volume
        mountPath: /etc/config
  volumes:
    - name: config-volume
      configMap:
        name: special-config <1>
  restartPolicy: Never
----
<1> File containing key.
+
When this pod is run, the output of the cat command will be:
+
----
very
----

* You can also control the paths within the volume where config map keys are projected:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dapi-test-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: gcr.io/google_containers/busybox
      command: [ "/bin/sh", "cat", "/etc/config/path/to/special-key" ]
      volumeMounts:
      - name: config-volume
        mountPath: /etc/config
  volumes:
    - name: config-volume
      configMap:
        name: special-config
        items:
        - key: special.how
          path: path/to/special-key <1>
  restartPolicy: Never
----
<1> Path to config map key.

When this pod is run, the output of the cat command will be:

very
