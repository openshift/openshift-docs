= Applying service declarations

You can declaratively configure a Knative service by using the `kn service apply` command. If the service does not exist it is created, otherwise the existing service is updated with the options that have been changed.

The `kn service apply` command is especially useful for shell scripts or in a continuous integration pipeline, where users typically want to fully specify the state of the service in a single command to declare the target state.

When using `kn service apply` you must provide the full configuration for the Knative service. This is different from the `kn service update` command, which only requires you to specify in the command the options that you want to update.

.Example commands

* Create a service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service apply <service_name> --image <image>
----

* Add an environment variable to a service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service apply <service_name> --image <image> --env <key>=<value>
----

* Read the service declaration from a JSON or YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service apply <service_name> -f <filename>
----
