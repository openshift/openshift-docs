= About data copy methods

{mtc-short} supports the file system and snapshot data copy methods for migrating data from the source cluster to the target cluster. You can select a method that is suited for your environment and is supported by your storage provider.

[id='file-system-copy-method_{context}']
== File system copy method

.File system copy method summary
|===
|Benefits |Limitations
a|* Clusters can have different storage classes
* Supported for all S3 storage providers
* Optional data verification with checksum
a|* Slower than the snapshot copy method
* Optional data verification significantly reduces performance
|===

[id='snapshot-copy-method_{context}']
== Snapshot copy method

{mtc-short} copies a snapshot of the source cluster's data to a cloud provider's object storage, configured as a replication repository. The data is restored on the target cluster.

AWS, Google Cloud Provider, and Microsoft Azure support the snapshot copy method.

.Snapshot copy method summary
|===
|Benefits |Limitations
a|* Faster than the file system copy method
a|* Cloud provider must support snapshots.
* Clusters must be on the same cloud provider.
* Clusters must be in the same location or region.
* Clusters must have the same storage class.
* Storage class must be compatible with snapshots.
