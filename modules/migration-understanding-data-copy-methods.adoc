[id='migration-understanding-data-copy-methods_{context}']
= Understanding the data copy methods for migration

The CAM tool supports the file system and snapshot data copy methods for migrating data from the source cluster to the target cluster. You can select a method that is suited for your environment and is supported by your storage provider.

[id='file-system-copy-method_{context}']
== File system copy method

The CAM tool copies data files from the source cluster to the replication repository, and from there to the target cluster.

.File system copy method summary
|===
|Benefits |Limitations
a|* Clusters can have different storage classes
* Supported for all S3 storage providers
a|* Slower than the snapshot copy method
|===

[id='snapshot-copy-method_{context}']
== Snapshot copy method

The CAM tool copies a snapshot of the source cluster's data to a cloud provider's object storage, configured as a replication repository. The data is restored on the target cluster.

AWS, Google Cloud Provider, and Microsoft Azure support the snapshot copy method.

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Snapshot copy method summary
|===
|Benefits |Limitations
a|* Faster than the file system copy method
a|* Cloud provider must support snapshots.
* Clusters must be on the same cloud provider.
* Clusters must be in the same location or region.
* Clusters must have the same storage class.
* Storage class must be compatible with snapshots.
