= Supported bundle formats and dependencies

[role="_abstract"]
To install an Operator as a cluster extension, the Operator must be packaged using the `registry+v1` bundle format. {olmv1} does not support Operators that declare dependencies by using file-based catalog properties.

To install an Operator as a cluster extension, it must meet the following criteria:

* The Operator is packaged using the `registry+v1` bundle format.
* The Operator does not declare dependencies by using the following file-based catalog properties:
** `olm.gvk.required`
** `olm.package.required`
** `olm.constraint`

{olmv1} verifies that an Operator meets these requirements during installation. If an Operator does not meet these criteria, {olmv1} reports the issue in the cluster extension status conditions.
