= Upgrading the {sno} cluster with {lcao} through GitOps ZTP

You can upgrade your managed {sno} cluster with the image-based upgrade through GitOps ZTP.

[IMPORTANT]
====
During the Developer Preview of this feature, when upgrading a cluster, any custom trusted certificates configured on the cluster will be lost. As a temporary workaround, to preserve these certificates, you must use a seed image from a seed cluster that trusts the certificates.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install {rh-rhacm} 2.9.2. or later version.
* Install {cgu-operator}.
* Update GitOps ZTP to the latest version.
* Provision one or more managed clusters with GitOps ZTP.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You generated a seed image from a compatible seed cluster.
* Create an S3-compatible storage solution and a ready-to-use bucket with proper credentials configured. For more information, see _Additional resources_.
* Create a separate partition on the target cluster for the container images that is shared between stateroots. For more information about, see _Additional resources_.

.Procedure

. Create a policy for the OADP `ConfigMap`, named `oadp-cm-common-policies`. For more information about how to create the `ConfigMap`, follow the first step in _Preparing the single-node OpenShift cluster for the image-based upgrade_ in _Additional resources_.

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Depending on the {rh-rhacm} configuration, the `v1/secrets/open-cluster-management-agent/open-cluster-management-image-pull-credentials` object must be backed up.
Check if your `MultiClusterHub` CR has the `spec.imagePullSecret` field defined and the secret exists in the `open-cluster-management-agent` namespace in your hub cluster. If the `spec.imagePullSecret` field does not exist, you can remove the `v1/secrets/open-cluster-management-agent/open-cluster-management-image-pull-credentials` object from the `lca.openshift.io/apply-label` annotation.
====

. (Optional) Create a policy for the `ConfigMap` of your user-specific extra manifests that are not part of the seed image. The {lcao} does not automatically extract these extra manifests from the seed cluster, so you can add a `ConfigMap` resource of your user-specific extra manifests in the `spec.extraManifests` field in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR.

. (Optional) To keep your custom catalog sources after the upgrade, add them to the `spec.extraManifest` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR. For more information, see xref:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.15/html-single/operators/index#olm-catalogsource_olm-understanding-olm[Catalog source].

. Create a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR that contains policies for the `Prep` and `Upgrade` stages.
