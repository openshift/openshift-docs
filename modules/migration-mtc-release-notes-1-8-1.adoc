== Resolved issues

This release has the following major resolved issues:

.CVE-2023-39325: golang: net/http, x/net/http2: rapid stream resets can cause excessive work

A flaw was found in handling multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol, which is used by {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}).Â A client could repeatedly make a request for a new multiplex stream and immediately send an `RST_STREAM` frame to cancel it. This creates additional workload for the server in terms of setting up and dismantling streams, while avoiding any server-side limitations on the maximum number of active streams per connection, resulting in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2245079[(BZ#2245079)]

It is advised to update to {mtc-short} 1.8.1 or later, which resolve this issue.
