= Authorizing log collection RBAC permissions

In logging 5.8 and later, the {clo} provides `collect-audit-logs`, `collect-application-logs`, and `collect-infrastructure-logs` cluster roles, which enable the collector to collect audit logs, application logs, and infrastructure logs respectively.

You can authorize RBAC permissions for log collection by binding the required cluster roles to a service account.

.Prerequisites

* The {clo} is installed in the `openshift-logging` namespace.
* You have administrator permissions.

.Procedure

. Create a service account for the collector. If you want to write logs to storage that requires a token for authentication, you must include a token in the service account.

. Bind the appropriate cluster roles to the service account:

.Example binding command
