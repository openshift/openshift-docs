= Example pod configurations

{product-title} leverages the Kubernetes concept of a _pod_, which is one or more containers deployed together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed.

The following is an example definition of a pod from a Rails application. It demonstrates many features of pods, most of which are discussed in other topics and thus only briefly mentioned here:

<1> Pods can be "tagged" with one or more labels, which can then be used to select and manage groups of pods in a single operation. The labels are stored in key/value format in the `metadata` hash.
<2> The pod restart policy with possible values `Always`, `OnFailure`, and `Never`. The default value is `Always`.
<3> {product-title} defines a security context for containers which specifies whether they are allowed to run as privileged containers, run as a user of their choice, and more. The default context is very restrictive but administrators can modify this as needed.
<4> `containers` specifies an array of one or more container definitions.
<5> The container specifies where external storage volumes are mounted within the container. In this case, there is a volume for storing access to credentials the registry needs for making requests against the {product-title} API.
<6> Specify the volumes to provide for the pod. Volumes mount at the specified path. Do not mount to the container root, `/`, or any path that is the same in the host and the container. This can corrupt your host system if the container is sufficiently privileged, such as the host `/dev/pts` files. It is safe to mount the host by using `/host`.
<7> Each container in the pod is instantiated from its own container image.
<8> Pods making requests against the {product-title} API is a common enough pattern that there is a `serviceAccount` field for specifying which service account user the pod should authenticate as when making the requests. This enables fine-grained access control for custom infrastructure components.
<9> The pod defines storage volumes that are available to its container(s) to use. In this case, it provides an ephemeral volume for a `secret` volume containing the default service account tokens.

[NOTE]
====
This pod definition does not include attributes that are filled by {product-title} automatically after the pod is created and its lifecycle begins. The link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/[Kubernetes pod documentation] has details about the functionality and purpose of pods.
