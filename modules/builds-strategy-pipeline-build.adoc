= Pipeline build

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Pipeline build strategy is deprecated in {product-title} 4. Equivalent and improved functionality is present in the OpenShift Pipelines based on Tekton.

Jenkins images on OpenShift are fully supported and users should follow Jenkins user documentation for defining their Jenkinsfile in a job or store it in a Source Control Management system.
====

The Pipeline build strategy allows developers to define a _Jenkins pipeline_ for
execution by the Jenkins pipeline plug-in. The build can be started, monitored,
and managed by {product-title} in the same way as any other build type.

Pipeline workflows are defined in a Jenkinsfile, either embedded directly in the
build configuration, or supplied in a Git repository and referenced by the build
configuration.

//The first time a project defines a build configuration using a Pipeline
//strategy, {product-title} instantiates a Jenkins server to execute the
//pipeline. Subsequent Pipeline build configurations in the project share this
//Jenkins server.

//.Additional resources

//* Pipeline build configurations require a Jenkins server to manage the
//pipeline execution.
