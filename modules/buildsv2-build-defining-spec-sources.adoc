= Defining Sources

You can download remote artifacts to the directory where the application source-code is located before the actual Build run starts. By default, this directory is `/workspace/source`.

// Additionally, we plan to keep evolving `.spec.sources` by adding more types of remote data declaration. This API field works as an extension point to support external and internal resource locations.

Currently, this capability does not support authentication. You can only download from sources that do not require authentication.

.Prerequisites

* You have a `Build` definition.

.Procedure

* In the `Build` definition use `.spec.sources` specify the artifacts.
