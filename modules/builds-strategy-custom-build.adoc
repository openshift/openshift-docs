= Custom build

The custom build strategy allows developers to define a specific builder image responsible for the entire build process. Using your own builder image allows you to customize your build process.

A custom builder image is a plain container image embedded with build process logic, for example for building RPMs or base images.

Custom builds run with a high level of privilege and are not available to users by default. Only users who can be trusted with cluster administration permissions should be granted access to run custom builds.
