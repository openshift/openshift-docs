= Custom build

The Custom build strategy allows developers to define a specific builder image
responsible for the entire build process. Using your own builder image allows
you to customize your build process.

A Custom builder image is a plain Docker-formatted container image embedded with
build process logic, for example for building RPMs or base images.

Custom builds run with a very high level of privilege and are not available to
users by default. Only users who can be trusted with cluster administration
permissions should be granted access to run custom builds.
