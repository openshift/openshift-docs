= Flags to limit the time period for gathering data
// The flags are still labeled experimental in 4.16. Should this doc update be included in 4.16 docs?
You can gather debugging information about your cluster from within a specific time period by using the `since` and `since-time` flags with the `oc adm must-gather` command. Only one of these flags can be used at a time.

Flags::
* `-since`: Gathers data logs that are newer than the specified time period. The time period can be in seconds, minutes, hours, days, or months. The command defaults to gathering all logs.
** Example: `oc adm must-gather -since 5h` will return data logs from the previous 5 hours.
//Are hours the longest time period you can do this for? Months? Years? Days?
* `since-time`: Gathers data logs that are from after a specified date. The date format must be Day Month Year. The command defaults to gathering all logs.
//How should the date be formatted/does it matter?
** Example: `oc adm must-gather -since-time 1 August 2024` will return data logs from August 1st, 2024 to the present.
