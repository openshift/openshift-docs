= Annotations definition

You can define annotations for a build strategy or a cluster build strategy like for any other Kubernetes object. The build strategy first propagates annotations to the `TaskRun` resource. Then, Tekton propagates them to the pod.

You can use annotations for the following purposes:

* To limit the network bandwidth the pod is allowed to use, the `kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth` and `kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth` annotations are defined in the Kubernetes network traffic shaping feature.
* To define the AppArmor profile of a container, the `container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/<container_name>` annotation is used.

The following example shows the usage of annotations in a build strategy:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
metadata:
  name: <cluster_build_strategy_name>
  annotations:
    container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/step-build-and-push: unconfined
    container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/step-build-and-push: unconfined
spec:
  # ...
----

The following annotations are not propagated:

* `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration`
* `clusterbuildstrategy.shipwright.io/*`
* `buildstrategy.shipwright.io/*`
* `build.shipwright.io/*`
* `buildrun.shipwright.io/*`

A strategy administrator can further restrict the usage of annotations by using policy engines.
