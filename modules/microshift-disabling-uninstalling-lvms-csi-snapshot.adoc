= Disabling and uninstalling LVMS CSI provider and CSI snapshot deployments

You can reduce the use of runtime resources such as RAM, CPU, and storage by removing or disabling the following storage components:

* You can configure {microshift-short} to disable the built-in logical volume manager storage (LVMS) Container Storage Interface (CSI) provider.
* You can configure {microshift-short} to disable the Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshot capabilities.
* You can uninstall the installed CSI implementations using `oc` commands.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Automated uninstallation is not supported as this can cause orphaning of the provisioned volumes. Without the LVMS CSI driver, the cluster does not have knowledge of the underlying storage interface and cannot perform provisioning and deprovisioning or mounting and unmounting operations.
====

[NOTE]
====
You can configure {microshift-short} to disable CSI provider and CSI snapshot only before installing and running {microshift-short}.After {microshift-short} is installed and running, you must update the configuration file and uninstall the components.
