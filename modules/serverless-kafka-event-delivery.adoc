= Apache Kafka event delivery and retries

Using Apache Kafka components in an event-driven architecture provides "at least once" event delivery. This means that operations are retried until a return code value is received. This makes applications more resilient to lost events; however, it might result in duplicate events being sent.

For the Kafka event source, there is a fixed number of retries for event delivery by default. For Kafka channels, retries are only performed if they are configured in the Kafka channel `Delivery` spec.
