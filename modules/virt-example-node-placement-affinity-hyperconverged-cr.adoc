[id="virt-example-node-placement-affinity-hyperconverged-cr_{context}"]
= Example: Node placement with affinity in the HyperConverged Cluster CR

In this example, `affinity` is configured so that infrastructure resources are placed on nodes that are labeled with `example.io/example-infra-key = example-value` and workloads are placed on nodes labeled with `example.io/example-workloads-key = example-workloads-value`. Nodes that have more than eight CPUs are preferred for workloads, but if they are not available, pods are still scheduled.
