= Infrastructure requirements for non-bare metal agent machines

The Agent platform does not create any infrastructure, but it has the following infrastructure requirements:

* Agents: An _Agent_ represents a host that is booted with a discovery image and is ready to be provisioned as an {product-title} node.

* DNS: The API and ingress endpoints must be routable.
