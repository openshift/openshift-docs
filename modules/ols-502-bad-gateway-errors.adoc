= 502 Bad Gateway Errors in the interface

If you try to start using {ols-long} before the internal components have stabilized, 502 Bad Gateway errors can occur. While all the pods might be running, there can be other console and internal {ocp-product-title} system components that are not ready. 

Wait a few minutes and try using {ols-long} again.
