= Adding application RPMs to a blueprint

To add application RPMs to a blueprint, you must create a local repository that Image Builder can use to create the ISO. With this procedure, the required container images for your workload can be pulled over the network.

.Prerequisites

* You have root access to the host.
* Workload or application RPMs exist in the `~/rpmbuild/RPMS` directory.

.Procedure

. Create a local RPM repository by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ createrepo ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/
----

. Give Image Builder access to the RPM repository by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo chmod a+rx ~
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must ensure that Image Builder has all of the necessary permissions to access all of the files needed for image building, or the build cannot proceed.
====
+
. Create the blueprint file, `repo-local-rpmbuild.toml` using the following template:
+
[source,toml]
----
id = "local-rpm-build"
name = "RPMs build locally"
type = "yum-baseurl"
url = "file://<path>/rpmbuild/RPMS" <1>
check_gpg = false
check_ssl = false
system = false
----
<1> Specify part of the path to create a location that you choose. Use this path in the later commands to set up the repository and copy the RPMs.

. Add the repository as a source for Image Builder by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo composer-cli sources add repo-local-rpmbuild.toml
----

. Add the RPM to your blueprint, by adding the following lines:
+
[source,toml]
----
…
[[packages]]
name = "<application_workload_manifests>" <1>
version = "*"
…
----
<1> Add the name of your workload here.

. Push the updated blueprint to Image Builder by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo composer-cli blueprints push repo-local-rpmbuild.toml
----

. At this point, you can either run Image Builder to create the ISO, or embed the container images for offline use.

.. To create the ISO, start Image Builder by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo composer-cli compose start-ostree repo-local-rpmbuild edge-commit
----

In this scenario, the container images are pulled over the network by the edge device during startup.
