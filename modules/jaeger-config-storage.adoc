= Jaeger storage configuration options

The query and collector services are configured with a supported storage type; Elasticsearch.  Multiple instances of each of these components can be provisioned as required for performance and resilience purposes.

When there is no `es.server-urls` option as part of a Jaeger production instance and Elasticsearch is set as the storage type, the Jaeger Operator creates an Elasticsearch cluster via the Elasticsearch Operator by creating a Custom Resource based on the configuration provided in storage section. The Elasticsearch cluster is meant to be dedicated for a single Jaeger instance.

.Restrictions

* There can be only one Jaeger with self-provisioned Elasticsearch instance per namespace.
* There can be only one Elasticsearch per namespace.
* You cannot share or reuse a {ProductName} logging Elasticsearch instance with Jaeger.

|Parameter |Description |Values |Default value


|spec:
 storage:
  options: {}
|Configuration options that define the storage.
|
|

|storage:
  type:
|Type of storage to use for the deployment.
|`memory` or `elasticsearch`
|`memory`

|storage:
  options:
   es:
    server-urls:
|URL of the Elasticsearch instance.
|The fully-qualified domain name of the Elasticsearch server.
|`http://elasticsearch.<namespace>.svc:9200`

|storage:
  elasticsearch:
    nodeCount:
|Number of Elasticsearch nodes. For high availability use at least 3 nodes. Do not use 2 nodes as “split brain” problem can happen.

|storage:
  elasticsearch:
    redundancyPolicy:
|Controls number of Elasticsearch replica shards.
|`ZeroRedundancy`(no replica shards), `SingleRedundancy`(one replica shard), `MultipleRedundancy`(each index is spread over half of the Data nodes), `FullRedundancy` (each index is fully replicated on every Data node in the cluster)
|

|storage:
  elasticsearch:
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu:

      limits:
        cpu:

|storage:
  elasticsearch:
    secretname:
|Name of the secret, for example `jaeger-secret`.
|
|N/A


|storage:
  esIndexCleaner:
    enabled:
|When using Elasticsearch storage, by default a job is created to clean old traces from the index.  This parameter enables or disables the index cleaner job.
|`true`/ `false`
|`true`

|storage:
 esIndexCleaner:
  numberOfDays:
|Number of days to wait before deleting an index.
|Integer value
|`7`

|storage:
 esIndexCleaner:
  schedule:
|Defines the schedule for how often to clean the Elasticsearch index.
|Cron expression
|"55 23 * * *"

|storage:
 esRollover:
  schedule:
|Defines the schedule for how often to rollover to a new Elasticsearch index.
|Cron expression
|'*/30 * * * *'
|
3+|{asterisk} Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting though this is *not* recommended for production deployments. For production use, you should have no less than 16Gi allocated to each Pod by default, but preferably allocate as much as you can, up to 64Gi per Pod.
