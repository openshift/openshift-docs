= Jaeger storage configuration options

You configure storage for the Collector, Ingester, and Query services under `spec:storage`.  Multiple instances of each of these components can be provisioned as required for performance and resilience purposes.

.Restrictions

* There can be only one Jaeger with self-provisioned Elasticsearch instance per namespace.
* There can be only one Elasticsearch per namespace.
* You cannot share or reuse a {ProductName} logging Elasticsearch instance with Jaeger.  The Elasticsearch cluster is meant to be dedicated for a single Jaeger instance.

[NOTE]
====
If you already have installed Elasticsearch as part of OpenShift logging, the Jaeger Operator can use the installed Elasticsearch Operator to provision storage.

.Jaeger general storage parameters
[options="header"]
[cols="l, a, a, a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Values |Default value

|spec:
 storage:
  options: {}
|Configuration options that define the storage.
|
|

|storage:
  type:
|Type of storage to use for the deployment.
|`memory` or `elasticsearch`.
Memory storage is only appropriate for development, testing, demonstrations, and proof of concept environments as the data does not persist if the pod is shut down. For production environments Jaeger supports Elasticsearch for persistent storage.

4+|General Elasticsearch configuration settings
|elasticsearch:
  server-urls:
|URL of the Elasticsearch instance.
|The fully-qualified domain name of the Elasticsearch server.  If you have specified `spec:storage:type`= `elasticsearch` but have not specified a value for `server-urls` parameter, the Jaeger Operator will use the Elasticsearch Operator to create an Elasticsearch cluster using the configuration in the `spec:storage:elasticsearch` section of the custom resource file.
|`http://elasticsearch.<namespace>.svc:9200`

|es:
  max-num-spans:
|The maximum number of spans to fetch at a time, per query, in Elasticsearch.
|
|10000

|es:
  max-span-age:
|The maximum lookback for spans in Elasticsearch.
|
|72h0m0s

|elasticsearch:
  secretname:
|Name of the secret, for example `jaeger-secret`.
|
|N/A

|es:
  sniffer:
|The sniffer configuration for Elasticsearch.  The client uses the sniffing process to find all nodes automatically. Disabled by default.
|`true`/ `false`
|`false`

|es:
  timeout:
|Timeout used for queries. When set to zero there is no  timeout.
|
|0s

|es:
  username:
|The username required by Elasticsearch. The basic authentication also loads CA if it is specified.  See also `es.password`.
|
|

|es:
  password:
|The password required by Elasticsearch.   See also, `es.username`.
|
|

|es:
  version:
|The major Elasticsearch version. If not specified, the value will be auto-detected from Elasticsearch.
|
|0

4+|Elasticsearch resource configuration settings.
|elasticsearch:
  nodeCount:
|Number of Elasticsearch nodes. For high availability use at least 3 nodes. Do not use 2 nodes as “split brain” problem can happen.
|Integer value.  For example, Proof of concept = 1,
Minimum deployment =3
|1

|elasticsearch:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu:
|Number of central processing units for requests, based on your environment’s configuration.
|Specified in cores or millicores (for example, 200m, 0.5, 1).  For example, Proof of concept = 500m,
Minimum deployment =1
|1Gi

|elasticsearch:
  resources:
    requests:
      memory:
|Available memory for requests, based on your environment’s configuration.
|Specified in bytes (for example, 200Ki, 50Mi, 5Gi). For example, Proof of concept = 1Gi,
Minimum deployment = 16Gi*
|500m

|elasticsearch:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu:
|Limit on number of central processing units, based on your environment’s configuration.
|Specified in cores or millicores (for example, 200m, 0.5, 1). For example, Proof of concept = 500m,
Minimum deployment =1
|

|elasticsearch:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory:
|Available memory limit based on your environment’s configuration.
|Specified in bytes (for example, 200Ki, 50Mi, 5Gi). For example, Proof of concept = 1Gi,
Minimum deployment = 16Gi*
|

|
3+|*Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting though this is NOT recommended for production deployments. For production use, you should have no less than 16Gi allocated to each Pod by default, but preferably allocate as much as you can, up to 64Gi per Pod.

4+|Elasticsearch data replication options.
|elasticsearch:
  redundancyPolicy:
|Data replication policy defines how Elasticsearch shards are replicated across data nodes in the cluster. If not specified,the Jaeger Operator automatically determines the most appropriate replication based on number of nodes.
|`ZeroRedundancy`(no replica shards), `SingleRedundancy`(one replica shard), `MultipleRedundancy`(each index is spread over half of the Data nodes), `FullRedundancy` (each index is fully replicated on every Data node in the cluster).

|es:
  num-shards:
|The number of shards per index in Elasticsearch.

<1> Persistent storage configuration. In this case AWS `gp2` with `5Gi` size. When no value is specified, Jaeger uses `emptyDir`. The Elasticsearch Operator provisions `PersistentVolumeClaim` and `PersistentVolume` which are not removed with Jaeger instance. You can mount the same volumes if you create a Jaeger instance with the same name and namespace.
