= Update requirements for clusters with manually maintained credentials

Before you update a cluster that uses manually maintained credentials with the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO), you must update the cloud provider resources for the new release.

If the cloud credential management for your cluster was configured using the CCO utility (`ccoctl`), use the `ccoctl` utility to update the resources. Clusters that were configured to use manual mode without the `ccoctl` utility require manual updates for the resources.

After updating the cloud provider resources, you must update the `upgradeable-to` annotation for the cluster to indicate that it is ready to update.

[NOTE]
====
The process to update the cloud provider resources and the `upgradeable-to` annotation can only be completed by using command line tools.

== Cloud credential configuration options and update requirements by platform type

Some platforms only support using the CCO in one mode. For clusters that are installed on those platforms, the platform type determines the credentials update requirements.

For platforms that support using the CCO in multiple modes, you must determine which mode the cluster is configured to use and take the required actions for that configuration.

{rh-openstack-first} and VMware vSphere::
These platforms do not support using the CCO in manual mode. Clusters on these platforms handle changes in cloud provider resources automatically and do not require an update to the `upgradeable-to` annotation.
+
Administrators of clusters on these platforms should skip the manually maintained credentials section of the update process.

{ibm-cloud-title} and Nutanix::
Clusters installed on these platforms are configured using the `ccoctl` utility.
+
Administrators of clusters on these platforms must take the following actions:
+
. Extract and prepare the `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) for the new release.
. Configure the `ccoctl` utility for the new release and use it to update the cloud provider resources.
. Indicate that the cluster is ready to update with the `upgradeable-to` annotation.

Microsoft Azure Stack Hub::
These clusters use manual mode with long-term credentials and do not use the `ccoctl` utility.
+
Administrators of clusters on these platforms must take the following actions:
+
. Extract and prepare the `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) for the new release.
. Manually update the cloud provider resources for the new release.
. Indicate that the cluster is ready to update with the `upgradeable-to` annotation.

Amazon Web Services (AWS), global Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)::
Clusters installed on these platforms support multiple CCO modes.
+
The required update process depends on the mode that the cluster is configured to use. If you are not sure what mode the CCO is configured to use on your cluster, you can use the web console or the CLI to determine this information.
