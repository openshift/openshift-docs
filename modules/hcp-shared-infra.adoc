= Shared infrastructure between hosted and standalone control planes

As a service provider, you can more effectively use your resources by sharing infrastructure between a standalone {product-title} control plane and {hcp}. A 3-node {product-title} cluster can be a management cluster for a hosted cluster. 

Sharing infrastructure can be beneficial in constrained environments, such as in small-scale deployments where you need resource efficiency.

Before you share infrastructure, ensure that your infrastructure has enough resources to support {hcp}. On the {product-title} management cluster, nothing else can be deployed except {hcp}. Ensure that the management cluster has enough CPU, memory, storage, and network resources to handle the combined load of the hosted clusters. For more information, see "Sizing guidance for {hcp}".

Workload must not be demanding, and it must fall within a low queries-per-second (QPS) profile. To maintain a reasonable risk profile, you can share up to 3 hosted clusters.
