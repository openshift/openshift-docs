= Recommended practices for installing large scale clusters

When installing large clusters or scaling the cluster to larger node counts, set the cluster network `cidr` accordingly in your `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster.

.Example `install-config.yaml` file with a network configuration for a cluster with a large node count

[source,yaml]

networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  machineNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
  networkType: OVNKubernetes

----

The default cluster network `cidr` `10.128.0.0/14` cannot be used if the cluster size is more than 500 nodes. The `cidr` must be set to `10.128.0.0/12` or `10.128.0.0/10` to get to larger node counts beyond 500 nodes.
