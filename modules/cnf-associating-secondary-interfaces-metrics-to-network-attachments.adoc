= Extending secondary network metrics for monitoring

Secondary devices, or interfaces, are used for different purposes. Metrics from secondary network interfaces need to be classified to allow for effective aggregation and monitoring.

Exposed metrics contain the interface but do not specify where the interface originates. This is workable when there are no additional interfaces. However, relying on interface names alone becomes problematic when secondary interfaces are added because it is difficult to identify their purpose and use their metrics effectively..

When adding secondary interfaces, their names depend on the order in which they are added. Secondary interfaces can belong to distinct networks that can each serve a different purposes.

With `pod_network_name_info` it is possible to extend the current metrics with additional information that identifies the interface type. In this way, it is possible to aggregate the metrics and to add specific alarms to specific interface types.

The network type is generated from the name of the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` resource, which distinguishes different secondary network classes. For example, different interfaces belonging to different networks or using different CNIs use different network attachment definition names.
