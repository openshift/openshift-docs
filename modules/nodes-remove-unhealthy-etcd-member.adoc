[id="removing-etcd-member_{context}"]
= Removing the unhealthy etcd member

Begin removing the failed control plane node by first removing the unhealthy etcd member.

.Procedure

. List etcd pods by running the following command and make note of a pod that is not on the affected node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-etcd get pods -l k8s-app=etcd -o wide
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
etcd-openshift-control-plane-0   5/5   Running   11   3h56m   192.168.10.9    openshift-control-plane-0  <none>           <none>
etcd-openshift-control-plane-1   5/5   Running   0    3h54m   192.168.10.10   openshift-control-plane-1   <none>           <none>
etcd-openshift-control-plane-2   5/5   Running   0    3h58m   192.168.10.11   openshift-control-plane-2   <none>           <none>
----

. Connect to a running etcd container by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd <etcd_pod>
----
+
Replace `<etcd_pod>` with the name of an etcd pod associated with one of the healthy nodes.
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-openshift-control-plane-0
----

. View the etcd member list by running the following command. Make note of the ID and the name of the unhealthy etcd member because these values are required later.
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member list -w table
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `etcdctl endpoint health` command will list the removed member until the replacement is complete and the new member is added.
====

. Remove the unhealthy etcd member by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member remove <unhealthy_member_id>
----
+
Replace `<unhealthy_member_id>` with the ID of the etcd member on the unhealthy node.
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member remove 6fc1e7c9db35841d
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Member 6fc1e7c9db35841d removed from cluster b23536c33f2cdd1b
----

. View the member list again by running the following command and verify that the member was removed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member list -w table
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
+------------------+---------+------------------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
|        ID        | STATUS  |             NAME             |        PEER ADDRS         |       CLIENT ADDRS        |

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you remove the member, the cluster might be unreachable for a short time while the remaining etcd instances reboot.
====

. Exit the rsh session into the etcd pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# exit
----

. Turn off the etcd quorum guard by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": {"useUnsupportedUnsafeNonHANonProductionUnstableEtcd": true}}}'
----
+
This command ensures that you can successfully re-create secrets and roll out the static pods.

. List the secrets for the removed, unhealthy etcd member by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secrets -n openshift-etcd | grep <node_name>
----
+
Replace `<node_name>` with the name of the failed node whose etcd member you removed.
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secrets -n openshift-etcd | grep openshift-control-plane-2
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
etcd-peer-openshift-control-plane-2             kubernetes.io/tls   2   134m
etcd-serving-metrics-openshift-control-plane-2  kubernetes.io/tls   2   134m
etcd-serving-openshift-control-plane-2          kubernetes.io/tls   2   134m
----

. Delete the secrets associated with the affected node that was removed:

.. Delete the peer secret by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-peer-<node_name>
----
+
Replace `<node_name>` with the name of the affected node.

.. Delete the serving secret by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-serving-<node_name>
----
+
Replace `<node_name>` with the name of the affected node.

.. Delete the metrics secret by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n openshift-etcd etcd-serving-metrics-<node_name> <1>
----
+
Replace `<node_name>` with the name of the affected node.
