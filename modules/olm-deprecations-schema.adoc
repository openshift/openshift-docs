= olm.deprecations schema

The optional `olm.deprecations` schema defines deprecation information for packages, bundles, and channels in a catalog. Operator authors can use this schema to provide relevant messages about their Operators, such as support status and recommended upgrade paths, to users running those Operators from a catalog.

When this schema is defined, the {product-title} web console displays warning badges for the affected elements of the Operator, including any custom deprecation messages, on both the pre- and post-installation pages of the OperatorHub.

An `olm.deprecations` schema entry contains one or more of the following `reference` types, which indicates the deprecation scope. After the Operator is installed, any specified messages can be viewed as status conditions on the related `Subscription` object.

.Deprecation `reference` types
[cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===
|Type |Scope |Status condition

|`olm.package`
|Represents the entire package
|`PackageDeprecated`

|`olm.channel`
|Represents one channel
|`ChannelDeprecated`

|`olm.bundle`
|Represents one bundle version
|`BundleDeprecated`

|===

Each `reference` type has their own requirements, as detailed in the following example.

[%collapsible]

[source,yaml]
----
schema: olm.deprecations
package: my-operator <1>
entries:
  - reference:
      schema: olm.package <2>
    message: | <3>
    The 'my-operator' package is end of life. Please use the
    'my-operator-new' package for support.
  - reference:
      schema: olm.channel
      name: alpha <4>
    message: |
    The 'alpha' channel is no longer supported. Please switch to the
    'stable' channel.
  - reference:
      schema: olm.bundle
      name: my-operator.v1.68.0 <5>
    message: |
    my-operator.v1.68.0 is deprecated. Uninstall my-operator.v1.68.0 and
    install my-operator.v1.72.0 for support.
----
<1> Each deprecation schema must have a `package` value, and that package reference must be unique across the catalog. There must not be an associated `name` field.
<2> The `olm.package` schema must not include a `name` field, because it is determined by the `package` field defined earlier in the schema.
<3> All `message` fields, for any `reference` type, must be a non-zero length and represented as an opaque text blob.
<4> The `name` field for the `olm.channel` schema is required.
<5> The `name` field for the `olm.bundle` schema is required.

[NOTE]
====
The deprecation feature does not consider overlapping deprecation, for example package versus channel versus bundle.
====

Operator authors can save `olm.deprecations` schema entries as a `deprecations.yaml` file in the same directory as the package's `index.yaml` file:
