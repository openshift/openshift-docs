= Migrating to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin by using the limited live migration method

The following procedure checks for egress router resources and uses the limited live migration method to migrate from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster has been configured with the OpenShift SDN CNI network plugin in the network policy isolation mode.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have created a recent backup of the etcd database.
* The cluster is in a known good state without any errors.
* Before migration to OVN-Kubernetes, a security group rule must be in place to allow UDP packets on port `6081` for all nodes on all cloud platforms.
* Cluster administrators must remove any egress router pods before beginning the limited live migration. For more information about egress router pods, see "Deploying an egress router pod in redirect mode".
* You have reviewed the "Considerations for limited live migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin" section of this document.

.Procedure

. Before initiating the limited live migration, you must check for any egress router pods. If there is an egress router pod on the cluster when performing a limited live migration, the Network Operator blocks the migration and returns the following error: 
+
[source,text]
----
The cluster configuration is invalid (network type live migration is not supported for pods with `pod.network.openshift.io/assign-macvlan` annotation. Please remove all egress router pods). Use `oc edit network.config.openshift.io cluster` to fix.
----
+
** Enter the following command to locate egress router pods on your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods --all-namespaces -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.metadata.annotations."pod.network.openshift.io/assign-macvlan" == "true") | {name: .metadata.name, namespace: .metadata.namespace}'
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
  "name": "egress-multi",
  "namespace": "egress-router-project"
}
----
+
** Alternatively, you can query metrics on the {product-title} web console or by using the `oc` CLI to check for egress router pods. For more information, see "Checking limited live migration metrics".

. Enter the following command to remove an egress router pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pod <egress_pod_name> -n <egress_router_project>
----

ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
. Enter the following command to add the `unsupported-red-hat-internal-testing` annotation to the cluster-level network configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch Network.config.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' --patch '{"metadata":{"annotations":{"unsupported-red-hat-internal-testing": "true"}}}'
----
endif::[]

. Enter the following command to patch the cluster-level networking configuration and initiate the migration from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch Network.config.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' --patch '{"metadata":{"annotations":{"network.openshift.io/network-type-migration":""}},"spec":{"networkType":"OVNKubernetes"}}'
----
+
After running these commands, the migration process begins. During this process, the Machine Config Operator reboots the nodes in your cluster twice. It is expected that the migration takes approximately twice as long as a cluster upgrade.

. Optional: You can enter the following commands to ensure that the migration process has completed, and to check the status of the `network.config`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network.config.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.networkType}'
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network.config cluster -o=jsonpath='{.status.conditions}' | jq .
----
+
You can check limited live migration metrics for troubleshooting issues. For more information, see "Checking limited live migration metrics".

. Complete the following steps only if the migration succeeds and your cluster is in a good state:

.. To remove the migration configuration from the `network.config` custom resource, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' \
  --patch '{ "spec": { "migration": null } }'
----

.. To remove custom configuration for the OpenShift SDN network provider, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' \
  --patch '{ "spec": { "defaultNetwork": { "openshiftSDNConfig": null } } }'
----

.. To remove the OpenShift SDN network provider namespace, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete namespace openshift-sdn
----
