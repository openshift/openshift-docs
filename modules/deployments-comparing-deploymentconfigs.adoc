= Comparing Deployments and DeploymentConfigs

Both Kubernetes Deployments and {product-title}-provided
DeploymentConfigs are supported in {product-title}; however, it is
recommended to use Deployments unless you need a specific feature or behavior
provided by DeploymentConfigs.

The following sections go into more detail on the differences between the two
object types to further help you decide which type to use.

[id="deployments-design_{context}"]
== Design

One important difference between Deployments and DeploymentConfigs is the
properties of the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem[CAP theorem]
that each design has chosen for the rollout process. DeploymentConfigs prefer
consistency, whereas Deployments take availability over consistency.

For DeploymentConfigs, if a node running a deployer Pod goes down, it will
not get replaced. The process waits until the node comes back online or is
manually deleted. Manually deleting the node also deletes the corresponding Pod.
This means that you can not delete the Pod to unstick the rollout, as the
kubelet is responsible for deleting the associated Pod.

However, Deployments rollouts are driven from a controller manager. The
controller manager runs in high availability mode on masters and uses leader
election algorithms to value availability over consistency. During a failure it
is possible for other masters to act on the same Deployment at the same time,
but this issue will be reconciled shortly after the failure occurs.

== DeploymentConfigs-specific features

[discrete]
==== Automatic rollbacks

Currently, Deployments do not support automatically rolling back to the last
successfully deployed ReplicaSet in case of a failure.

[discrete]
==== Triggers

Deployments have an implicit `ConfigChange` trigger in that every
change in the pod template of a deployment automatically triggers a new rollout.
If you do not want new rollouts on pod template changes, pause the deployment:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout pause deployments/<name>
----

[discrete]
==== Lifecycle hooks

Deployments do not yet support any lifecycle hooks.

[discrete]
==== Custom strategies

Deployments do not support user-specified Custom deployment
strategies yet.

[id="delpoyments-specific-features_{context}"]
== Deployments-specific features

[discrete]
==== Rollover

The deployment process for Deployments is driven by a controller
loop, in contrast to DeploymentConfigs which use deployer pods for every
new rollout. This means that a Deployment can have as many active
ReplicaSets as possible, and eventually the deployment controller will scale
down all old ReplicaSets and scale up the newest one.

DeploymentConfigs can have at most one deployer pod running, otherwise
multiple deployers end up conflicting while trying to scale up what they think
should be the newest ReplicationController. Because of this, only two
ReplicationControllers can be active at any point in time. Ultimately, this
translates to faster rapid rollouts for Deployments.

[discrete]
==== Proportional scaling

Because the Deployment controller is the sole source of truth for the sizes of
new and old ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment, it is able to scale ongoing
rollouts. Additional replicas are distributed proportionally based on the size
of each ReplicaSet.

DeploymentConfigs cannot be scaled when a rollout is ongoing because the
DeploymentConfig controller will end up having issues with the deployer
process about the size of the new ReplicationController.

[discrete]
==== Pausing mid-rollout

Deployments can be paused at any point in time, meaning you can also
pause ongoing rollouts. On the other hand, you cannot pause deployer pods
currently, so if you try to pause a DeploymentConfig in the middle of a
rollout, the deployer process will not be affected and will continue until it
finishes.
