= Re-running scans

Although it is possible to run scans as scheduled jobs, you must often re-run a scan on demand, particularly after remediations are applied or when other changes to the cluster are made.

.Procedure

* Rerunning a scan with the Compliance Operator requires use of an annotation on the scan object. However, with the `oc-compliance` plugin you can rerun a scan with a single command. Enter the following command to rerun the scans for the `ScanSettingBinding` object named `my-binding`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc compliance rerun-now scansettingbindings my-binding
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Rerunning scans from 'my-binding': ocp4-cis
Re-running scan 'openshift-compliance/ocp4-cis'
----
