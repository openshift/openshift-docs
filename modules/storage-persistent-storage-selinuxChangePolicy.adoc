= Reducing pod timeouts using seLinuxChangePolicy

SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a security mechanism that assigns security labels (contexts) to all objects (files, processes, network ports, etc.) on a system. These labels determine what a process can access. In {product-title}, SELinux helps prevent containers from escaping and accessing the host system or other containers.

When a pod starts, the container runtime recursively relabels all files on a volume to match the pod's SELinux context. For volumes with many files, this can significantly increase pod startup times.

Mount option specifies avoiding recursive relabeling of all files by attempting to mount the volume with the correct SELinux label directly using the -o context mount option, thus helping to avoid pod timeout problems. 

.RWOP and SELinux mount option

ReadWriteOncePod (RWOP) persistent volumes use the SELinux mount feature by default. 

The mount option feature is driver dependent, and enabled by default in AWS EBS
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp[]
, Azure Disk, GCP PD, {ibm-cloud-title} Block Storage volume, Cinder, vSphere,
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp[]
and {rh-storage-first}. For third-party drivers, contact your storage vendor.

.RWO and RWX and SELinux mount option

ReadWriteOnce (RWO) and ReadWriteMany (RWX) volumes use recursive relabeling by default.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In a future {product-title} version, RWO and RWX volumes will use *mount option by default*.
