= Telco core RDS {product-version} use model overview

The telco core reference design specifications (RDS) describes a platform that supports large-scale telco applications, including control plane functions such as signaling and aggregation.
It also includes some centralized data plane functions, such as user plane functions (UPF).
These functions generally require scalability, complex networking support, resilient software-defined storage, and support performance requirements that are less stringent and constrained than far-edge deployments such as RAN.
