= Synchronizing your application with your Git repository

.Procedure
. In the Argo CD dashboard, notice that the *cluster-configs* Argo CD application has the statuses *Missing* and *OutOfSync*. Because the application was configured with a manual sync policy, Argo CD does not sync it automatically.

. Click *SYNC* on the *cluster-configs* tile, review the changes, and then click *SYNCHRONIZE*. Argo CD will detect any changes in the Git repository automatically. If the configurations are changed, Argo CD will change the status of the *cluster-configs* to *OutOfSync*. You can modify the synchronization policy for Argo CD to automatically apply changes from your Git repository to the cluster.

. Notice that the *cluster-configs* Argo CD application now has the statuses *Healthy* and *Synced*. Click the *cluster-configs* tile to check the details of the synchronized resources and their status on the cluster.

. Navigate to the {product-title} web console and click {rh-app-icon} to verify that a link to the *Red Hat Developer Blog - Kubernetes* is now present there.

. Navigate to the *Project* page and search for the `spring-petclinic` namespace to verify that it has been added to the cluster.

Your cluster configurations have been successfully synchronized to the cluster.
