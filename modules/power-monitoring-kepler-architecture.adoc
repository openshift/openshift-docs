= {PM-shortname-c} architecture

{PM-shortname-c} is made up of the following major components:

The {PM-operator}:: For administrators, the {PM-operator} streamlines the monitoring of power usage for workloads by simplifying the deployment and management of {PM-kepler} in an {product-title} cluster. The setup and configuration for the {PM-operator} are simplified by adding a `PowerMonitor` custom resource definition (CRD). The Operator also manages operations, such as upgrading, removing, configuring, and redeploying {PM-kepler}.

{PM-kepler}:: {PM-kepler} is a key component of {PM-shortname}. It is responsible for monitoring the power usage of containers running in {product-title}. It generates metrics related to the power usage of both nodes and containers.
