= {PM-shortname-c} architecture

The major components of {PM-shortname} are the following:

The {PM-operator}:: For an OpenShift administrator, the {PM-operator} helps in providing a streamlined solution to monitor the power usage of the workloads by simplifying the deployment and management of {PM-kepler} into an {OCP} cluster. The setup and configuration for the {PM-operator} are simplified by adding a tailored {PM-kepler} Custom Resource Definition (CRD). The Operator also facilitates operations, such as upgrading, removing, configuring, and redeploying {PM-kepler}. 

{PM-kepler}:: {PM-kepler} is a key component of {PM-shortname}. It is responsible for monitoring the power usage of containers running in {OCP}. It generates metrics related to the power usage of both nodes and containers.
