= Sample conversation overview

The following examples are intended to serve as samples you can use to start a conversations {ols-long}. In some cases, the conversation includes an initial question and then one or more follow-up questions. Rephrasing questions or asking a more precise follow-up question can help increase the success of the reply.

Some of the examples suggest specific workflows to follow in the user interface. Be sure to ask the follow-up questions without starting a new dialog. {ols-long} uses the entire conversation as context, so follow-up questions should help refine answers.
