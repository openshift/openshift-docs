= Sample conversation overview

[role="_abstract"]

Use these sample prompts and follow-up strategies to initiate effective conversations with {ols-long} and improve response accuracy. 

Some of the examples suggest specific workflows to follow in the user interface. Be sure to ask the follow-up questions without starting a new dialog. {ols-long} uses the entire conversation as context, so follow-up questions should help refine answers. Rephrasing questions or asking a more precise follow-up question can help increase the success of the reply.
