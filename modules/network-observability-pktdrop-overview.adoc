= Packet drop tracking
You can configure graphical representation of network flow records with packet loss in the *Overview* view. By employing eBPF tracepoint hooks, you can gain valuable insights into packet drops for TCP, UDP, SCTP, ICMPv4, and ICMPv6 protocols, which can result in the following actions:

* Identification: Pinpoint the exact locations and network paths where packet drops are occurring. Determine whether specific devices, interfaces, or routes are more prone to drops.

* Root cause analysis: Examine the data collected by the eBPF program to understand the causes of packet drops. For example, are they a result of congestion, buffer issues, or specific network events?

* Performance optimization: With a clearer picture of packet drops, you can take steps to optimize network performance, such as adjust buffer sizes, reconfigure routing paths, or implement Quality of Service (QoS) measures.

When packet drop tracking is enabled, you can see the following panels in the *Overview* by default: 

* *Top X packet dropped state stacked with total*
* *Top X packet dropped cause stacked with total*
* *Top X average dropped packets rates* 
* *Top X dropped packets rates stacked with total*

Other packet drop panels are available to add in *Manage panels*:

* *Top X average dropped bytes rates*
* *Top X dropped bytes rates stacked with total*
