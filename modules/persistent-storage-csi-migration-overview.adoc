= Overview

Volumes managed by in-tree storage plug-ins supported by this feature are migrated to their counterpart Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers. This process does not involve any data migration, {product-title} only translates the persistent volume object in memory. As a result, the translated persistent volume object is not stored on disk, nor is its contents changed.

CSI automatic migration should be seamless. This feature does not change how you use all existing API objects: for example, `PersistentVolumes`, `PersistentVolumeClaims`, and `StorageClasses`.


{product-title} is gradually migrating in-tree storage plugins to their counterpart Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers.  A future release of {product-title} will enable automatic migration of all in-tree plugins to their counterpart CSI drivers.
