= Overview

Volumes that are provisioned by using in-tree storage plug-ins, and that are supported by this feature, are migrated to their counterpart Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers. This process does not perform any data migration; {product-title} only translates the persistent volume object in memory. As a result, the translated persistent volume object is not stored on disk, nor is its contents changed.

The following in-tree to CSI drivers are supported:

|Generally available (GA)
| Yes. For more information, see "_Automatic migration of in-tree volumes to CSI_".

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Block Storage (EBS)

* Google Compute Engine Persistent Disk (in-tree) and Google Cloud Platform Persistent Disk (CSI)
* VMware vSphere
|Techology Preview (TP)
| No. To enable, see "_Manually enabling CSI automatic migration_".
|===

CSI automatic migration should be seamless. This feature does not change how you use all existing API objects: for example, `PersistentVolumes`, `PersistentVolumeClaims`, and `StorageClasses`.

Enabling CSI automatic migration for in-tree persistent volumes (PVs) or persistent volume claims (PVCs) does not enable any new CSI driver features, such as snapshots or expansion, if the original in-tree storage plug-in did not support it.
