= Troubleshooting temporary rekeying errors for Tang servers

To determine if the error condition from rekeying the Tang servers is temporary, perform the following procedure. Temporary error conditions might include:

* Temporary network outages
* Tang server maintenance

Generally, when these types of temporary error conditions occur, you can wait until the daemon set succeeds in resolving the error or you can delete the daemon set and not try again until the temporary error condition has been resolved.

.Procedure

. Restart the pod that performs the rekeying operation using the normal Kubernetes pod restart policy.

. If any of the associated Tang servers are unavailable, try rekeying until all the servers are back online.
