= Configuring the OpenShift root certificate authority for providers

You must configure an {product-title} provider for each cluster that you are including in the migration, and each provider requires a certificate authority (CA) for the cluster. It is important to configure the root CA for the entire cluster to avoid a CA expiration, which causes the provider to fail.

.Procedure

. Run the following command against the cluster for which you are creating the provider:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cm kube-root-ca.crt -o=jsonpath={.data.ca\\.crt}
----

. Paste the output into the provider creation form, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<CA_certificate_content>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
