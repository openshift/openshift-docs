**Cause** (if it has been identified) - Why did this happen?
**Workaround** (If there is one)- What can you do to avoid or negate the effects of this issue in the meantime?  Sometimes if there is no workaround it is worthwhile telling readers to contact support for advice.  Never promise future fixes.
