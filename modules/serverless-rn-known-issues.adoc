The following limitations exist in {ProductName} at this time:

* The Knative Serving Operator should wait for ServiceMeshMemberRoll to include
the `knative-serving` namespace. The installation procedure recommends creating
the `knative-serving` namespace and then installing the operator. Istio does not
consider the `knative-serving` namespace to be in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll when
the Knative Serving Pods are being created. Consequently, the sidecars are not
injected.

* Knative service returns a 503 status code when the cluster is running for a
long time. The Knative Serving Pods do not show any errors. Restarting the
`istio-pilot` Pod temporarily fixes the issue. 

* The gRPC and HTTP2 do not work against routes. This is a known limitation of
OpenShift routes.
