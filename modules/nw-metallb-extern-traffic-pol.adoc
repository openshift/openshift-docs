= MetalLB and external traffic policy

With layer 2 mode, one node in your cluster receives all the traffic for the service IP address.
With BGP mode, a router on the host network opens a connection to one of the nodes in the cluster for a new client connection.
How your cluster handles the traffic after it enters the node is affected by the external traffic policy.

`cluster`::
This is the default value for `spec.externalTrafficPolicy`.
+
With the `cluster` traffic policy, after the node receives the traffic, the service proxy distributes the traffic to all the pods in your service.
This policy provides uniform traffic distribution across the pods, but it obscures the client IP address and it can appear to the application in your pods that the traffic originates from the node rather than the client.

`local`::
With the `local` traffic policy, after the node receives the traffic, the service proxy only sends traffic to the pods on the same node.
For example, if the `speaker` pod on node A announces the external service IP, then all traffic is sent to node A.
After the traffic enters node A, the service proxy only sends traffic to pods for the service that are also on node A.
Pods for the service that are on additional nodes do not receive any traffic from node A.
Pods for the service on additional nodes act as replicas in case failover is needed.
+
This policy does not affect the client IP address.
Application pods can determine the client IP address from the incoming connections.
