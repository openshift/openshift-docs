= Configuring mirroring prerequisites

You must create a container image registry credentials file that allows the mirroring of images from your internet-connected mirror host to your air-gapped mirror. Follow the instructions in the "Configuring credentials that allow images to be mirrored" link provided in the "Additional resources" section. These instructions guide you to create a `~/.pull-secret-mirror.json` file on the mirror registry host that includes the user credentials for accessing the mirror.
