[id="windows-pod-placement_{context}"]
= Windows pod placement

Before deploying your Windows workloads to the cluster, you must configure your Windows node scheduling so pods are assigned correctly. Since you have a machine hosting your Windows node, it is managed the same as a Linux-based node. Likewise, scheduling a Windows pod to the appropriate Windows node is completed similarly, using mechanisms like taints, tolerations, and node selectors.

With multiple operating systems, and the ability to run multiple Windows OS variants in the same cluster, you must map your Windows pods to a base Windows OS variant by using a `RuntimeClass` object. For example, if you have multiple Windows nodes running on different Windows Server container versions, the cluster could schedule your Windows pods to an incompatible Windows OS variant. You must have `RuntimeClass` objects configured for each Windows OS variant on your cluster. Using a `RuntimeClass` object is also recommended if you have only one Windows OS variant available in your cluster.

For more information, see Microsoft's documentation on link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/update-containers#host-and-container-version-compatibility[Host and container version compatibility].

Also, it is recommended that you set the `spec.os.name.windows` parameter in your workload pods. The Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) uses this field to authoritatively identify the pod operating system for validation and is used to enforce Windows-specific pod security context constraints (SCCs). Currently, this parameter has no effect on pod scheduling. For more information about this parameter, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#pod-os[Kubernetes Pods documentation].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The container base image must be the same Windows OS version and build number that is running on the node where the conainer is to be scheduled. 

Also, if you upgrade the Windows nodes from one version to another, for example going from 20H2 to 2022, you must upgrade your container base image to match the new version.
