= Update policies on managed clusters

The {cgu-operator-first} remediates a set of `inform` policies for the clusters specified in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` custom resource (CR). {cgu-operator} remediates `inform` policies by controlling the `remediationAction` specification in a `Policy` CR through the `bindingOverrides.remediationAction` and `subFilter` specifications in the `PlacementBinding` CR. Each policy has its own corresponding {rh-rhacm} placement rule and {rh-rhacm} placement binding.

One by one, {cgu-operator} adds each cluster from the current batch to the placement rule that corresponds with the applicable managed policy. If a cluster is already compliant with a policy, {cgu-operator} skips applying that policy on the compliant cluster. {cgu-operator} then moves on to applying the next policy to the non-compliant cluster. After {cgu-operator} completes the updates in a batch, all clusters are removed from the placement rules associated with the policies. Then, the update of the next batch starts.

If a spoke cluster does not report any compliant state to {rh-rhacm}, the managed policies on the hub cluster can be missing status information that {cgu-operator} needs. {cgu-operator} handles these cases in the following ways:

* If a policy's `status.compliant` field is missing, {cgu-operator} ignores the policy and adds a log entry. Then, {cgu-operator} continues looking at the policy's `status.status` field.
* If a policy's `status.status` is missing, {cgu-operator} produces an error.
* If a cluster's compliance status is missing in the policy's `status.status` field, {cgu-operator} considers that cluster to be non-compliant with that policy.

The `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR's `batchTimeoutAction` determines what happens if an upgrade fails for a cluster. You can specify `continue` to skip the failing cluster and continue to upgrade other clusters, or specify `abort` to stop the policy remediation for all clusters. Once the timeout elapses, {cgu-operator} removes all the resources it created to ensure that no further updates are made to clusters.
