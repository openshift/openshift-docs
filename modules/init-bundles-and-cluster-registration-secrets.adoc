= Init bundles and cluster registration secrets

[role="_abstract"]
To establish a secure communication channel between {product-title-short} Central and your secured clusters, you must generate and apply authentication artifacts. You can create an init bundle by using the {product-title-short} portal or CLI to provision the required TLS certificates for services like Sensor and Collector.

Alternatively, you can use the `roxctl` CLI to generate a cluster registration secret (CRS) if you need a reusable, time-bound token to register multiple clusters.

You can then apply the init bundle or the CRS by using the {ocp} web console or by using the `oc` or `kubectl` CLI. If you install {product-title-short} by using Helm, you provide the init bundle or CRS when you run the `helm install` command.

[NOTE]
====
You must have the `Admin` user role to create an init bundle.
