|Option |Description

|`--certs-only`
|Specify to only back up the certificates. When using an external database, this option is used to generate a backup bundle with certificates. The default value is `false`.

|`--output string`
a|Specify where you want to save the backup. The behavior depends on the specified path:

* If the path is a file path, the backup is written to the file and overwrites it if it already exists. The directory must exist.
* If the path is a directory, the backup is saved in this directory under the file name that the server specifies.
* If this argument is omitted, the backup is saved in the current working directory under the file name that the server specifies.

|`-t`, `--timeout duration`
|Specify the timeout for API requests. It represents the maximum duration of a request. The default value is `1h0m0s`.
