When updating from one y-stream release to the next, you must ensure that the intermediate z-stream releases are also compatible.

[NOTE]
====
You can verify that you are updating to a viable release by running the `oc adm upgrade` command.
The `oc adm upgrade` command lists the compatible update releases.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* **Control plane only update**: Ensure you point to the interim <y+1> release path
* **Y-stream update** - Ensure you use the correct <y.z> release that follows the Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/[version skew policy].
* **Z-stream update** - Verify that there are no problems moving to that specific release
