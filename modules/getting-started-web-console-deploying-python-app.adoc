= Deploying the back-end application

The following procedure deploys `nationalparks`, which is the back-end component for the `national-parks-app` application. The Python application performs 2D geo-spatial queries against a MongoDB database to locate and return map coordinates of all national parks in the world.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed the `parksmap` front-end application.

.Procedure

. From the *Quick create* (image:fa-plus-circle.png[title="Quick create menu"]) menu in the upper right corner, click *Import from Git*.
. In the *Git Repo URL* field, enter [x-]`https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/nationalparks-py.git`.

A builder image is automatically detected, but the import strategy defaults to Dockerfile instead of Python.

. Change the import strategy:

.. Click *Edit Import Strategy*.
.. Select *Builder Image*.
.. Select *Python*.

By default, services running on {product-title} are not accessible externally. You must select this option to create a route so that external clients can access your service.

. Click the *Labels* hyperlink.
+
The application code requires certain labels to be set.

. Add the following labels to the text area and press Enter after each key/value pair:

** `app=national-parks-app`
** `component=nationalparks`
** `role=backend`
** `type=parksmap-backend`

. Click *Create*.

You are redirected to the *Topology* page where you can see the `nationalparks` deployment in the `national-parks-app` application.
