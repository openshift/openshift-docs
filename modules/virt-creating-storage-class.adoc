= Creating a storage class

When you create a storage class, you set parameters that affect the
dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes (PVs) that belong to that storage class.

In order to use the host path provisioner (HPP) you must create an associated storage class for the CSI driver with the `storagePools` stanza.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot update a `StorageClass` object's parameters after you create it.
====

[NOTE]
====
Virtual machines use data volumes that are based on local PVs. Local PVs are bound to specific nodes. While the disk image is prepared for consumption by the virtual machine, it is possible that the virtual machine cannot be scheduled to the node where the local storage PV was previously pinned.

To solve this problem, use the Kubernetes pod scheduler to bind the PVC to a PV on the correct node. By using the `StorageClass` value with `volumeBindingMode` parameter set to `WaitForFirstConsumer`, the binding and provisioning of the PV is delayed until a pod is created using the PVC.

== Creating a storage class for the CSI driver with the storagePools stanza

Use this procedure to create a storage class for use with the HPP CSI driver implementation. You must create this storage class to use HPP in {VirtProductName} 4.10 and later.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for defining the storage class. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ touch <storageclass_csi>.yaml
----

. Edit the file. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: hostpath-csi <1>
provisioner: kubevirt.io.hostpath-provisioner <2>
reclaimPolicy: Delete <3>
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer <4>
parameters:
  storagePool: <any_name> <5>
----
<1> Assign any meaningful name to the storage class. In this example, `csi` is used to specify that the class is using the CSI provisioner instead of the legacy provisioner. Choosing descriptive names for storage classes, based on legacy or CSI driver provisioning, eases implementation of your migration strategy.
<2> The legacy provisioner uses `kubevirt.io/hostpath-provisioner`. The CSI driver uses `kubevirt.io.hostpath-provisioner`.
<3> The two possible `reclaimPolicy` values are `Delete` and `Retain`. If you
do not specify a value, the storage class defaults to `Delete`.
<4> The `volumeBindingMode` parameter determines when dynamic provisioning and volume binding occur. Specify `WaitForFirstConsumer` to delay the binding and provisioning of a PV until after a pod that uses the persistent volume claim (PVC) is created. This ensures that the PV meets the pod's scheduling requirements.
<5> `<any_name>` must match the name of the storage pool, which you define in the HPP custom resource.

. Save the file and exit.

. Create the `StorageClass` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <storageclass_csi>.yaml
----

== Creating a storage class for the legacy hostpath provisioner

Use this procedure to create a storage class for the legacy hostpath provisioner (HPP). You do not need to explicitly add a `storagePool` parameter.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for defining the storage class. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ touch storageclass.yaml

. Edit the file. For example:
+
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1

metadata:
  name: hostpath-provisioner <1>
provisioner: kubevirt.io/hostpath-provisioner
reclaimPolicy: Delete <2>
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer <3>

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f storageclass.yaml
