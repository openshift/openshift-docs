= Querying Operator status after installation

You can check Operator status at the end of an installation. Retrieve diagnostic data for Operators that do not become available. Review logs for any Operator pods that are listed as `Pending` or have an error status. Validate base images used by problematic pods.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Check that cluster Operators are all available at the end of an installation.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusteroperators
----

. If any Operators fail to become available, view Operator events:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe clusteroperator <operator_name>
----

. Review Operator Pod status within the Operator's namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n <operator_namespace>
----

. Obtain a detailed description for pods that do not have `Running` status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe pod/<operator_pod_name> -n <operator_namespace>
----

. Inspect Pod logs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs pod/<operator_pod_name> -n <operator_namespace>
----

. When experiencing Pod base image related issues, review base image status.
.. Obtain details of the base image used by a problematic Pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -o "jsonpath={range .status.containerStatuses[*]}{.name}{'\t'}{.state}{'\t'}{.image}{'\n'}{end}" <operator_pod_name> -n <operator_namespace>
----
+
.. List base image release information:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info <image_path>:<tag> --commits
----
