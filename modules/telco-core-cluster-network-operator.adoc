= Cluster Network Operator

New in this release::

*  No reference design updates in this release

Description::

The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) deploys and manages the cluster network components including the default OVN-Kubernetes network plugin during cluster installation.
The CNO allows configuration of primary interface MTU settings, OVN gateway modes to use node routing tables for pod egress, and additional secondary networks such as MACVLAN.
+
In support of network traffic separation, multiple network interfaces are configured through the CNO.
Traffic steering to these interfaces is configured through static routes applied by using the NMState Operator.
To ensure that pod traffic is properly routed, OVN-K is configured with the `routingViaHost` option enabled.
This setting uses the kernel routing table and the applied static routes rather than OVN for pod egress traffic.
+
The Whereabouts CNI plugin is used to provide dynamic IPv4 and IPv6 addressing for additional pod network interfaces without the use of a DHCP server.

Limits and requirements::
* OVN-Kubernetes is required for IPv6 support.
* Large MTU cluster support requires connected network equipment to be set to the same or larger value.
MTU size up to 8900 is supported.
//https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-10593
* MACVLAN and IPVLAN cannot co-locate on the same main interface due to their reliance on the same underlying kernel mechanism, specifically the `rx_handler`.
This handler allows a third-party module to process incoming packets before the host processes them, and only one such handler can be registered per network interface.
Since both MACVLAN and IPVLAN need to register their own `rx_handler` to function, they conflict and cannot coexist on the same interface.

* Alternative NIC configurations include splitting the shared NIC into multiple NICs or using a single dual-port NIC, though they have not been tested and validated.
* Clusters with single-stack IP configuration are not validated.
* EgressIP
** EgressIP failover time depends on the `reachabilityTotalTimeoutSeconds` parameter in the `Network` CR.
This parameter determines the frequency of probes used to detect when the selected egress node is unreachable.
The recommended value of this parameter is `1` second.
** When EgressIP is configured with multiple egress nodes, the failover time is expected to be on the order of seconds or longer.
** On nodes with additional network interfaces EgressIP traffic will egress through the interface on which the EgressIP address has been assigned.
For more information, see "Configuring an egress IP address".
* Pod-level SR-IOV bonding mode must be set to `active-backup` and a value in `miimon` must be set (`100` is recommended).

Engineering considerations::

* Pod egress traffic is managed by kernel routing table using the `routingViaHost` option.
Appropriate static routes must be configured in the host.
