= Cluster Network Operator

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) deploys and manages the cluster network components including the default OVN-Kubernetes network plugin during {product-title} cluster installation. It allows configuring primary interface MTU settings, OVN gateway modes to use node routing tables for pod egress, and additional secondary networks such as MACVLAN.

Limits and requirements::
* OVN-Kubernetes is required for IPv6 support.

* Large MTU cluster support requires connected network equipment to be set to the same or larger value.

* MACVLAN and IPVLAN cannot co-locate on the same main interface due to their reliance on the same underlying kernel mechanism, specifically the `rx_handler`.
This handler allows a third-party module to process incoming packets before the host processes them, and only one such handler can be registered per network interface.
Since both MACVLAN and IPVLAN need to register their own `rx_handler` to function, they conflict and cannot coexist on the same interface.
See link:https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.10.2/source/drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_main.c#L82[ipvlan/ipvlan_main.c#L82] and link:https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.10.2/source/drivers/net/macvlan.c#L1260[net/macvlan.c#L1260] for details.

* Alternative NIC configurations include splitting the shared NIC into multiple NICs or using a single dual-port NIC.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Splitting the shared NIC into multiple NICs or using a single dual-port NIC has not been validated with the telco core reference design.
====

* Single-stack IP cluster not validated.


Engineering considerations::
* Pod egress traffic is handled by kernel routing table with the `routingViaHost` option. Appropriate static routes must be configured in the host.
