[id="installation-osp-accessing-api-floating_{context}"]

= Enabling access with floating IP addresses

Make {product-title} API endpoints accessible by attaching two floating IP (FIP) addresses to them: one for the API load balancer (`lb FIP`), and one for OpenShift applications (`apps FIP`).

[IMPORTANT]
The load balancer FIP is also used in the `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

. Using the OpenStack CLI, create a new external network:
+
----
$ openstack floating ip create <external network>
----

. Add a record that follows this pattern to your DNS server:
+
[source,dns]
----
api.<cluster name>.<base domain>  IN  A  <lb FIP>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you don't control the DNS server, you can add the record to your `/etc/hosts` file instead. This action makes the API accessible to you only, which is not suitable for production deployment, but does allow installation for development and testing.
