= Understanding how terminated containers are removed though garbage collection

Container garbage collection can be performed using eviction thresholds.

When eviction thresholds are set for garbage collection, the node tries to keep any container for any pod accessible from the API. If the pod has been deleted, the containers will be as well. Containers are preserved as long the pod is not deleted and the eviction threshold is not reached. If the node is under disk pressure, it will remove containers and their logs will no longer be accessible using `oc logs`.

* *eviction-soft* - A soft eviction threshold pairs an eviction threshold with a required administrator-specified grace period.

* *eviction-hard* - A hard eviction threshold has no grace period, and if observed, {product-title} takes immediate action.

The following table lists the eviction thresholds:

.Variables for configuring container garbage collection
|===
| Node condition | Eviction signal | Description

| MemoryPressure 
| `memory.available` 
| The available memory on the node.

| DiskPressure 
a| * `nodefs.available`
  * `nodefs.inodesFree`
  * `imagefs.available`
  * `imagefs.inodesFree`
| The available disk space or inodes on the node root file system, `nodefs`, or image file system, `imagefs`.
|===

If a node is oscillating above and below a soft eviction threshold, but not exceeding its associated grace period, the corresponding node would constantly oscillate between `true` and `false`. As a consequence, the scheduler could make poor scheduling decisions.

To protect against this oscillation, use the `eviction-pressure-transition-period` flag to control how long {product-title} must wait before transitioning out of a pressure condition. {product-title} will not set an eviction threshold as being met for the specified pressure condition for the period specified before toggling the condition back to false.
