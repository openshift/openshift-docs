= Automated Discovery image ISO process for provisioning managed clusters

After you apply the managed site custom resources (CRs) on the hub cluster, the following actions happen automatically:

. A Discovery image ISO file is generated and booted on the target machine.

. When the ISO file successfully boots on the target machine it reports the hardware information of the target machine.

. After all hosts are discovered, {product-title} is installed.

. When {product-title} finishes installing, the hub installs the `klusterlet` service on the target cluster.

. The requested add-on services are installed on the target cluster.

The Discovery image ISO process finishes when the `Agent` custom resource is created on the hub for the managed cluster.
