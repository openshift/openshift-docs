= Build run policy

The build run policy describes the order in which the builds created from the
build configuration should run. This can be done by changing the value of the
`runPolicy` field in the `spec` section of the `Build` specification.

It is also possible to change the `runPolicy` value for existing build
configurations.

  * Changing `Parallel` to `Serial` or `SerialLatestOnly` and triggering a
    new build from this configuration will cause the new build to wait until all
    parallel builds complete as the serial build can only run alone.
  * Changing `Serial` to `SerialLatestOnly` and triggering a new build will
    cause cancellation of all existing builds in queue, except the currently
    running build and the most recently created build. The newest build will
    execute next.
