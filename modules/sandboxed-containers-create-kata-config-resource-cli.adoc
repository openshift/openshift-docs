= Creating the KataConfig custom resource using the CLI

You must create one `KataConfig` custom resource (CR) to install `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` on your nodes. Creating the `KataConfig` CR triggers the {sandboxed-containers-operator} to do the following:

* Install the needed {op-system} extensions, such as QEMU and `kata-containers`, on your {op-system} node.
* Ensure that the link:https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o[CRI-O] runtime is configured with the correct `kata` runtime handlers.
* Create a `RuntimeClass` CR named `kata` with a default configuration. This enables users to configure workloads to use `kata` as the runtime by referencing the CR in the `RuntimeClassName` field. This CR also specifies the resource overhead for the runtime.

[NOTE]
====
Kata is installed on all worker nodes by default. If you want to install `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` only on specific nodes, you can add labels to those nodes, then define the label in the `KataConfig` CR when you create it.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {product-title} {product-version} on your cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {sandboxed-containers-operator}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Creating the `KataConfig` CR automatically reboots the worker nodes. The reboot can take from 10 to more than 60 minutes. Factors that impede reboot time are as follows:

* A larger {product-title} deployment with a greater number of worker nodes.
* Activation of the BIOS and Diagnostics utility.
* Deployment on a hard drive rather than an SSD.
* Deployment on physical nodes such as bare metal, rather than on virtual nodes.
* A slow CPU and network.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file with the following manifest:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: kataconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KataConfig
metadata:
  name: cluster-kataconfig
spec:
  checkNodeEligibility: false <1>
  logLevel: info
----
<1> Set`checkNodeEligibility` to `true` to detect node eligibility to run `kata` as a `RuntimeClass`. For more information, see "Checking whether cluster nodes are eligible to run {sandboxed-containers-first}".

. (Optional) If you want to install `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` only on selected nodes, create a YAML file that includes the label in the manifest:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: kataconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KataConfig
metadata:
  name: cluster-kataconfig
spec:
  checkNodeEligibility: false
  logLevel: info
  kataConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      <label_key>: '<label_value>' <1>
----
<1> Labels in `kataConfigPoolSelector` only support single values; `nodeSelector` syntax is not supported.

. Create the `KataConfig` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file name>.yaml
----

The new `KataConfig` CR is created and begins to install `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` on the worker nodes. Wait for the `kata` installation to complete and the worker nodes to reboot before continuing to the next step.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{sandboxed-containers-first} installs Kata only as a secondary, optional runtime on the cluster and not as the primary runtime.
====

.Verification

* Monitor the installation progress:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ watch "oc describe kataconfig | sed -n /^Status:/,/^Events/p"
----

+
Once the value of *Is In Progress* appears as `false`, the installation is complete.

//TODO: add xref to the Troubleshooting Section
