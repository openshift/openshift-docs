= About Istio deployment

To deploy {istio}, you must create two resources: `Istio` and `IstioCNI`. The `Istio` resource deploys and configures the {istio} Control Plane. The `IstioCNI` resource deploys and configures the {istio} Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin. You should create these resources in separate projects; therefore, you must create two projects as part of the {istio} deployment process.

You can use the {ocp-short-name} web console or the OpenShift CLI (oc) to create a project or a resource in your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
In the {ocp-product-title}, a project is essentially a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, such as the range of user IDs that can be used in the project. Typically, the {ocp-product-title} web console uses the term project, and the CLI uses the term namespace, but the terms are essentially synonymous.
