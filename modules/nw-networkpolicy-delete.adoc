= Deleting a network policy

You can delete a network policy in a namespace.

[NOTE]
====
If you log in with a user with the `cluster-admin` role, then you can delete any network policy in the cluster.
====

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster is using a cluster network provider that supports `NetworkPolicy` objects, such as
ifndef::ovn[]
the OpenShift SDN network provider with `mode: NetworkPolicy` set.
endif::ovn[]
ifdef::ovn[]
the OVN-Kubernetes network provider or the OpenShift SDN network provider with `mode: NetworkPolicy` set.
endif::ovn[]
This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `admin` privileges.
* You are working in the namespace where the network policy exists.

.Procedure

* To delete a `NetworkPolicy` object, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete networkpolicy <policy_name> -n <namespace>
----
+
--
where:

`<policy_name>`:: Specifies the name of the network policy.
`<namespace>`:: Optional: Specifies the namespace if the object is defined in a different namespace than the current namespace.
--
