= Mapping users to specific roles

Argo CD cannot map users to specific roles if they have a direct `ClusterRoleBinding` role. You can manually change the role as `role:admin` on SSO through OpenShift.

.Procedure

. Create a group named `cluster-admins`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm groups new cluster-admins
----
. Add the user to the group.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm groups add-users cluster-admins USER
----
. Apply the `cluster-admin` `ClusterRole` to the group:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group cluster-admin cluster-admins
----
