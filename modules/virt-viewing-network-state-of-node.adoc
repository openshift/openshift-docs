= Viewing the network state of a node by using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
Node network state is the network configuration for all nodes in the cluster. A `NodeNetworkState` object exists on every node in the cluster. This object is periodically updated and captures the state of the network for that node.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. List all the `NodeNetworkState` objects in the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nns
----

. Inspect a `NodeNetworkState` object to view the network on that node. The output in this example has been redacted for clarity:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nns node01 -o yaml
----
+
Example output:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkState
metadata:
  name: node01 <1>
status:
  currentState: <2>
    dns-resolver:
# ...
    interfaces:
# ...
    route-rules:
# ...
    routes:
# ...
  lastSuccessfulUpdateTime: "2020-01-31T12:14:00Z" <3>
----
<1> The name of the `NodeNetworkState` object is taken from the node.
<2> The `currentState` contains the complete network configuration for the node, including DNS, interfaces, and routes.
<3> Timestamp of the last successful update. This is updated periodically as long as the node is reachable and can be used to evalute the freshness of the report.
