[id="ossm-multitenant-install_{context}"]
= {ProductName} control plane

{ProductName} installs a multitenant control plane by default. You specify the projects that can access the {ProductShortName}, and isolate the {ProductShortName} from other control plane instances.

[id="ossm-mt-vs-clusterwide_{context}"]
= Multi-tenancy in {ProductName} versus cluster-wide installations

The main difference between a multitenant installation and a cluster-wide installation is the scope of privileges used by the control plane deployments, for example, Galley and Pilot. The components no longer use cluster-scoped Role Based Access Control (RBAC) resource `ClusterRoleBinding`, but rely on project-scoped `RoleBinding`.

Every project in the `members` list will have a `RoleBinding` for each service account associated with a control plane deployment and each control plane deployment will only watch those member projects. Each member project has a `maistra.io/member-of` label added to it, where the `member-of` value is the project containing the control plane installation.

{ProductName} configures each member project to ensure network access between itself, the control plane, and other member projects. The exact configuration differs depending on how OpenShift software-defined networking (SDN) is configured. See xref:../../networking/openshift-sdn/about-openshift-sdn.adoc#about-openshift-sdn[About OpenShift SDN] for additional details.

If the {product-title} cluster is configured to use the SDN plug-in:

* *`NetworkPolicy`*: {ProductName} creates a `NetworkPolicy` resource in each member project allowing ingress to all pods from the other members and the control plane. If you remove a member from {ProductShortName}, this `NetworkPolicy` resource is deleted from the project.
+
[NOTE]
====
This also restricts ingress to only member projects. If ingress from non-member projects is required, you need to create a `NetworkPolicy` to allow that traffic through.
====

* *Multitenant*: {ProductName} joins the `NetNamespace` for each member project to the `NetNamespace` of the control plane project (the equivalent of running `oc adm pod-network join-projects --to control-plane-project member-project`). If you remove a member from the {ProductShortName}, its `NetNamespace` is isolated from the control plane (the equivalent of running `oc adm pod-network isolate-projects member-project`).

* *Subnet*: No additional configuration is performed.

[id="ossm-automatic-injection_{context}"]
= Automatic injection

The upstream Istio community installation automatically injects the sidecar into pods within the projects you have labeled.

{ProductName} does not automatically inject the sidecar to any pods, but requires you to specify the `sidecar.istio.io/inject` annotation as illustrated in the xref:../service_mesh_day_two/prepare-to-deploy-applications-ossm.adoc#ossm-automatic-sidecar-injection_deploying-applications-ossm[Automatic sidecar injection] section.

[id="ossm-rbac_{context}"]
= Istio Role Based Access Control features

Istio Role Based Access Control (RBAC) provides a mechanism you can use to control access to a service. You can identify subjects by user name or by specifying a set of properties and apply access controls accordingly.

The upstream Istio community installation includes options to perform exact header matches, match wildcards in headers, or check for a header containing a specific prefix or suffix.

{ProductName} extends the ability to match request headers by using a regular expression. Specify a property key of `request.regex.headers` with a regular expression.

[id="ossm-openssl_{context}"]
= OpenSSL

{ProductName} replaces BoringSSL with OpenSSL. OpenSSL is a software library that contains an open source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. The {ProductName} Proxy binary dynamically links the OpenSSL libraries (libssl and libcrypto) from the underlying Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system.


[id="ossm-cni_{context}"]
= The Istio Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in

{ProductName} includes CNI plug-in, which provides you with an alternate way to configure application pod networking. The CNI plug-in replaces the `init-container` network configuration eliminating the need to grant service accounts and projects access to Security Context Constraints (SCCs) with elevated privileges.
