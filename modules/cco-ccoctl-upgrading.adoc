[id="cco-ccoctl-upgrading_{context}"]
= Updating cloud provider resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

The process for upgrading an {product-title} cluster that was configured using the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) is similar to creating the cloud provider resources during installation.

[NOTE]
====
By default, `ccoctl` creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the `--output-dir` flag. This procedure uses `<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>` to refer to this directory.

On AWS clusters, some `ccoctl` commands make AWS API calls to create or modify AWS resources. You can use the `--dry-run` flag to avoid making API calls. Using this flag creates JSON files on the local file system instead. You can review and modify the JSON files and then apply them with the AWS CLI tool using the `--cli-input-json` parameters.
====

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} release image for the version that you are upgrading to.

* Extract and prepare the `ccoctl` binary from the release image.

.Procedure

. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) from the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract --credentials-requests \
  --cloud=<provider_type> \
  --to=<path_to_directory_with_list_of_credentials_requests>/credrequests \
  quay.io/<path_to>/ocp-release:<version>
----
+
where:
+
--
* `<provider_type>` is the value for your cloud provider. Valid values are `alibabacloud`, `aws`, `gcp`, `ibmcloud`, and `nutanix`.
* `credrequests` is the directory where the list of `CredentialsRequest` objects is stored. This command creates the directory if it does not exist.
--

. For each `CredentialsRequest` CR in the release image, ensure that a namespace that matches the text in the `spec.secretRef.namespace` field exists in the cluster. This field is where the generated secrets that hold the credentials configuration are stored.
+
.Sample AWS `CredentialsRequest` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: cloud-credential-operator-iam-ro
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AWSProviderSpec
    statementEntries:
    - effect: Allow
      action:
      - iam:GetUser
      - iam:GetUserPolicy
      - iam:ListAccessKeys
      resource: "*"
  secretRef:
    name: cloud-credential-operator-iam-ro-creds
    namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator <1>
----
<1> This field indicates the namespace which needs to exist to hold the generated secret.
+
The `CredentialsRequest` CRs for other platforms have a similar format with different platform-specific values.

. For any `CredentialsRequest` CR for which the cluster does not already have a namespace with the name specified in `spec.secretRef.namespace`, create the namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create namespace <component_namespace>
----

. Use the `ccoctl` tool to process all `CredentialsRequest` objects in the `credrequests` directory by running the command for your cloud provider. The following commands process `CredentialsRequest` objects:
+
--
* {alibaba}: `ccoctl alibabacloud create-ram-users`
* Amazon Web Services (AWS): `ccoctl aws create-iam-roles`
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP): `ccoctl gcp create-all`
* IBM Cloud: `ccoctl ibmcloud create-service-id`
* Nutanix: `ccoctl nutanix create-shared-secrets`
--
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Refer to the `ccoctl` utility instructions in the installation content for your cloud provider for important platform-specific details about the required arguments and special considerations.
====
+
For each `CredentialsRequest` object, `ccoctl` creates the required provider resources and a permissions policy as defined in each `CredentialsRequest` object from the {product-title} release image.

. Apply the secrets to your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/*-credentials.yaml | xargs -I{} oc apply -f {}
----

.Verification

You can verify that the required provider resources and permissions policies are created by querying the cloud provider. For more information, refer to your cloud provider documentation on listing roles or service accounts.

.Next steps

* Update the `upgradeable-to` annotation to indicate that the cluster is ready to upgrade.
