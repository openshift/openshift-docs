= Updating AWS resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

The process for upgrading an {product-title} cluster configured for manual mode with AWS Secure Token Service (STS) is similar to installing on a cluster for which you create the AWS resources individually.

[NOTE]
====
By default, `ccoctl` creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To specify a directory, use the `--output-dir` flag. This procedure uses `_<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>_` to refer to this location.

Some `ccoctl` commands make AWS API calls to create or modify AWS resources. To place JSON files on the local file system instead, use the `--dry-run` flag. These JSON files can be reviewed or modified and then applied with the AWS CLI tool using the `--cli-input-json` parameters.
====

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} release image for the version that you are upgrading to.

* Extract and prepare the `ccoctl` binary from the release image.

.Procedure

. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) from the {product-title} release image:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc adm release extract --credentials-requests --cloud=aws --to=__<path_to_directory_with_list_of_credentials_requests>__/credrequests quay.io/__<path_to>__/ocp-release:__<version>__
----

. For each `CredentialsRequest` CR in the release image, ensure that a namespace that matches the text in the `spec.secretRef.namespace` field exists in the cluster. This field is where the generated secrets that hold the credentials configuration are stored.
+
.Sample AWS `CredentialsRequest` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: cloud-credential-operator-iam-ro
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
spec:
  secretRef:
    name: cloud-credential-operator-iam-ro-creds
    namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator <1>
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AWSProviderSpec
    statementEntries:
    - effect: Allow
      action:
      - iam:GetUser
      - iam:GetUserPolicy
      - iam:ListAccessKeys
      resource: "*"
----
+
<1> This field indicates the namespace which needs to exist to hold the generated secret.

. For any `CredentialsRequest` CR for which the cluster does not already have a namespace with the name specified in `spec.secretRef.namespace`, create the namespace:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc create namespace __<component_namespace>__
----

. Use the `ccoctl` tool to process all `CredentialsRequest` objects in the `credrequests` directory:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ ccoctl aws create-iam-roles --name __<name>__ --region=__<aws_region>__ --credentials-requests-dir=__<path_to_directory_with_list_of_credentials_requests>__/credrequests --identity-provider-arn arn:aws:iam::__<aws_account_id>__:oidc-provider/__<name>__-oidc.s3.__<aws_region>__.amazonaws.com
----
+
where:
+
** _<name>_ is the name used to tag any cloud resources that are created for tracking. For upgrades, use the same value that was used for the initial installation.
** _<aws_account_id>_ is the AWS account ID.
** _<aws_region>_ is the AWS region in which cloud resources will be created.
+
[NOTE]
====
For AWS environments that use alternative IAM API endpoints, such as GovCloud, you must also specify your region with the `--region` parameter.
====
+
For each `CredentialsRequest` object, `ccoctl` creates an IAM role with a trust policy that is tied to the specified OIDC identity provider, and a permissions policy as defined in each `CredentialsRequest` object from the {product-title} release image.

. Apply the secrets to your cluster:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ ls __<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>__/manifests/*-credentials.yaml | xargs -I{} oc apply -f {}
----

.Verification

You can verify that the IAM roles are created by querying AWS. For more information, refer to AWS documentation on listing IAM roles.
