= Updating AWS resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

The process for upgrading an {product-title} cluster configured for manual mode with AWS Secure Token Service (STS) is similar to installing on a cluster for which you create the AWS resources individually.

[NOTE]
====
By default, `ccoctl` creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the `--output-dir` flag. This procedure uses `<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>` to refer to this directory.

Some `ccoctl` commands make AWS API calls to create or modify AWS resources. You can use the `--dry-run` flag to avoid making API calls. Using this flag creates JSON files on the local file system instead. You can review and modify the JSON files and then apply them with the AWS CLI tool using the `--cli-input-json` parameters.

= Updating GCP resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

The process for upgrading an {product-title} cluster configured for manual mode with GCP Workload Identity is similar to installing on a cluster for which you create the GCP resources individually.

[NOTE]
====
By default, `ccoctl` creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the `--output-dir` flag. This procedure uses `<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>` to refer to this directory.

Some `ccoctl` commands make GCP API calls to create or modify GCP resources. You can use the `--dry-run` flag to avoid making API calls. Using this flag creates bash scripts with Google Cloud CLI commands on the local file system instead. You can review and modify the bash scripts and then run them to create the required GCP resources.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} release image for the version that you are upgrading to.

* Extract and prepare the `ccoctl` binary from the release image.

.Procedure

. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) from the {product-title} release image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract --credentials-requests \
--cloud=aws \
--to=<path_to_directory_with_list_of_credentials_requests>/credrequests \ <1>
--quay.io/<path_to>/ocp-release:<version>
----
+
<1> `credrequests` is the directory where the list of `CredentialsRequest` objects is stored. This command creates the directory if it does not exist.

. For each `CredentialsRequest` CR in the release image, ensure that a namespace that matches the text in the `spec.secretRef.namespace` field exists in the cluster. This field is where the generated secrets that hold the credentials configuration are stored.
+
.Sample AWS `CredentialsRequest` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: cloud-credential-operator-iam-ro
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
spec:
  secretRef:
    name: cloud-credential-operator-iam-ro-creds
    namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator <1>
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AWSProviderSpec
    statementEntries:
    - effect: Allow
      action:
      - iam:GetUser
      - iam:GetUserPolicy
      - iam:ListAccessKeys
      resource: "*"
----
+
<1> This field indicates the namespace which needs to exist to hold the generated secret.

. For any `CredentialsRequest` CR for which the cluster does not already have a namespace with the name specified in `spec.secretRef.namespace`, create the namespace:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc create namespace <component_namespace>
----

. Use the `ccoctl` tool to process all `CredentialsRequest` objects in the `credrequests` directory:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ ccoctl aws create-iam-roles \
--name <name> \
--region=<aws_region> \
--credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_directory_with_list_of_credentials_requests>/credrequests \
--identity-provider-arn arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:oidc-provider/<name>-oidc.s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
----
+
where:
+
--
** `<name>` is the name used to tag any cloud resources that are created for tracking. For upgrades, use the same value that was used for the initial installation.
** `<aws_account_id>` is the AWS account ID.
** `<aws_region>` is the AWS region in which cloud resources will be created.
--
+
[NOTE]
====
For AWS environments that use alternative IAM API endpoints, such as GovCloud, you must also specify your region with the `--region` parameter.

If your cluster uses Technology Preview features that are enabled by the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set, you must include the `--enable-tech-preview` parameter.
====
+
For each `CredentialsRequest` object, `ccoctl` creates an IAM role with a trust policy that is tied to the specified OIDC identity provider, and a permissions policy as defined in each `CredentialsRequest` object from the {product-title} release image.

. Apply the secrets to your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/*-credentials.yaml | xargs -I{} oc apply -f {}
----

.Verification

You can verify that the IAM roles are created by querying AWS. For more information, refer to AWS documentation on listing IAM roles.
