= Creating a custom DNS host name to resolve DNS connectivity issues

In a disconnected environment where the external DNS server cannot be reached, you can resolve Kubernetes NMState Operator health probe issues by specifying a custom DNS host name in the `NMState` custom resource definition (CRD). 

.Procedure

. Add the DNS host name configuration to the `NMState` CRD of your cluster:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NMState
metadata:
  name: nmstate
spec:
  probeConfiguration:
    dns:
      host: redhat.com
# ...
----

. Apply the DNS host name configuration to your cluster network by running the following command. Ensure that you replace `<filename>` with the name of your CRD file.
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----
