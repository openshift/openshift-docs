= Creating a custom DNS host name to resolve DNS connectivity issues

In a disconnected environment where the external DNS server cannot be configured, you can resolve Kubernetes NMState Operator health probe issues by specifying a custom DNS host name in the `NMState` custom resource definition (CRD). 

.Procedure

. Replace the DNS host name with your own resolvable hostname in the `NMState` CRD of your cluster:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NMState
metadata:
  name: nmstate
spec:
  probeConfiguration:
    dns:
      host: redhat.com <1>
# ...
----
<1> The hostname that can be successfully resolved in your own DNS server

. To change the hostname, edit the DNS host name configuration to your cluster network by running the following command. 
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ oc edit nmstate nmstate
----
