= Configuring the Cluster Version Operator (CVO)

After the OpenShift Update Service Operator has been installed and the OpenShift Update Service application has been created, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) can be updated to pull graph data from the locally installed OpenShift Update Service.

.Prerequisites

* The OpenShift Update Service Operator has been installed.
* The OpenShift Update Service graph data container image has been created and pushed to a repository that is accessible to the OpenShift Update Service.
* The current release and update target releases have been mirrored to a locally accessible registry.
* The OpenShift Update Service application has been created.

.Procedure

. Set the OpenShift Update Service target namespace, for example, `openshift-update-service`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ NAMESPACE=openshift-update-service
----

. Set the name of the OpenShift Update Service application, for example, `service`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ NAME=service
----

.  Obtain the policy engine route:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ POLICY_ENGINE_GRAPH_URI="$(oc -n "${NAMESPACE}" get -o jsonpath='{.status.policyEngineURI}/api/upgrades_info/v1/graph{"\n"}' updateservice "${NAME}")"
----

. Set the patch for the pull graph data:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ PATCH="{\"spec\":{\"upstream\":\"${POLICY_ENGINE_GRAPH_URI}\"}}"
----
+
. Patch the CVO to use the local OpenShift Update Service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch clusterversion version -p $PATCH --type merge
----
