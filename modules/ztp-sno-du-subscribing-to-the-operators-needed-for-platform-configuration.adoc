= Operator subscriptions

{sno-caps} clusters that run DU workloads require the following `Subscription` CRs. The subscription provides the location to download the following Operators:

* Local Storage Operator
* Logging Operator
* PTP Operator
* SR-IOV Network Operator

For each Operator subscription, specify the channel to get the Operator from. The recommended channel is `stable`.

You can specify `Manual` or `Automatic` updates.
In `Automatic` mode, the Operator automatically updates to the latest versions in the channel as they become available in the registry.
In `Manual` mode, new Operator versions are installed only when they are explicitly approved.

[NOTE]
====
Use Manual mode for subscriptions. This allows you to control the timing of Operator updates to fit within planned/scheduled maintenance windows.
