.Procedure
* Add the following line under the `providerSpec` field:
+
ifdef::aws[]
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  value:
    spotMarketOptions: {}
----
+
You can optionally set the `spotMarketOptions.maxPrice` field to limit the cost of the Spot Instance. For example you can set `maxPrice: '2.50'`.
+
If the `maxPrice` is set, this value is used as the hourly maximum spot price. If it is not set, the maximum price defaults to charge up to the On-Demand Instance price.
+
[NOTE]
====
It is strongly recommended to use the default On-Demand price as the `maxPrice` value and to not set the maximum price for Spot Instances.
====
endif::aws[]
ifdef::azure[]
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  value:
    spotVMOptions: {}
----
+
You can optionally set the `spotVMOptions.maxPrice` field to limit the cost of the Spot VM. For example you can set `maxPrice: '0.98765'`. If the `maxPrice` is set, this value is used as the hourly maximum spot price. If it is not set, the maximum price defaults to `-1` and charges up to the standard VM price.
+
Azure caps Spot VM prices at the standard price. Azure will not evict an instance due to pricing if the instance is set with the default `maxPrice`. However, an instance can still be evicted due to capacity restrictions.

[NOTE]
====
It is strongly recommended to use the default standard VM price as the `maxPrice` value and to not set the maximum price for Spot VMs.
====
endif::azure[]
ifdef::gcp[]
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  value:
    preemptible: true
----
+
If `preemptible` is set to `true`, the machine is labelled as an `interruptable-instance` after the instance is launched.
