= Creating Spot Instances

You can launch a Spot Instance on AWS by adding SpotMarketOptions to your MachineSet YAML file.

.Procedure
* Add the following line under the `providerSpec` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  value:
    spotMarketOptions: {} <1>
----
<1> You can optionally set the `maxPrice` for the `spotMarketOptions` field to limit the cost of
the Spot Instance, for example `maxPrice: '2.50'`. If the `maxPrice` is set, this value is used as
the hourly maximum spot price. If not set, the maximum price defaults to charge up to the On-Demand Instance price.

[NOTE]
====
It is strongly recommended to use the default On-Demand price as the `maxPrice` value and to not set
the maximum price for Spot Instances.
