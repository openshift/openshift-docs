= Cluster history tab

[role="_abstract"]
The **Cluster history** tab shows every change to the cluster from creation onward for each version. You can specify date ranges for your cluster history and use filters to search based on the description of the notification, the severity of the notification, the type of notification, and which role logged it. You may download your cluster history as a JSON or CSV file.
