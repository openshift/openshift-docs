= Getting started with Gateway API for the Ingress Operator

When you create a GatewayClass as shown in the first step, it configures Gateway API for use on your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {product-title} Gateway API implementation relies on the Cluster Ingress Operator (CIO) to install and manage a specific version of OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM v3.x) in the `openshift-ingress` namespace.

A conflict occurs if your cluster already has an active OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM v2.x) subscription in any namespace. OSSM v2.x and OSSM v3.x cannot coexist on the same cluster.

If a conflicting OSSM v2.x subscription is present when you create a `GatewayClass` resource:
* The Cluster Ingress Operator's attempt to install the required OSSM v3.x components will fail.
* As a result, Gateway API resources such as `Gateway` or `HTTPRoute` will have no effect, and no proxy will be configured to route traffic.
* In OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, this failure is silent.
*In OpenShift Container Platform 4.20 and later, this conflict causes the `ingress` `ClusterOperator` to report a `Degraded` status.

Before enabling Gateway API by creating a `GatewayClass`, verify that you do not have an active OSSM v2.x subscription on the cluster.

.Procedure

. Create a `GatewayClass` object:

.. Create a YAML file, `openshift-default.yaml`, that contains the following information:
+
.Example `GatewayClass` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
  name: openshift-default
spec:
  controllerName: openshift.io/gateway-controller/v1 <1>
----
<1> The controller name.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The controller name must be exactly as shown for the Ingress Operator to manage it. If you set this field to anything else, the Ingress Operator ignores the `GatewayClass` object and all associated `Gateway`, `GRPCRoute`, and `HTTPRoute` objects. The controller name is tied to the implementation of Gateway API in {product-title}, and `openshift.io/gateway-controller/v1` is the only controller name allowed.
====

.. Run the following command to create the `GatewayClass` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f openshift-default.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
gatewayclass.gateway.networking.k8s.io/openshift-default created
----
+
During the creation of the `GatewayClass` resource, the Ingress Operator installs a lightweight version of {SMProductName}, an Istio custom resource, and a new deployment in the `openshift-ingress` namespace.

.. Optional: Verify that the new deployment, `istiod-openshift-gateway` is ready and available:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment -n openshift-ingress
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
istiod-openshift-gateway   1/1     1            1           55s
router-default             2/2     2            2           6h4m
----

. Create a secret by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ingress create secret tls gwapi-wildcard --cert=wildcard.crt --key=wildcard.key
----

. Get the domain of the Ingress Operator by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ DOMAIN=$(oc get ingresses.config/cluster -o jsonpath={.spec.domain})
----

. Create a `Gateway` object:

.. Create a YAML file, `example-gateway.yaml`, that contains the following information:
+
.Example `Gateway` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: example-gateway
  namespace: openshift-ingress <1>
spec:
  gatewayClassName: openshift-default <2>
  listeners:
  - name: https <3>
    hostname: "*.gwapi.${DOMAIN}" <4>
    port: 443
    protocol: HTTPS
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:
      - name: gwapi-wildcard <5>
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: All
----
<1> The `Gateway` object must be created in the `openshift-ingress` namespace.
<2> The `Gateway` object must reference the name of the previously created `GatewayClass` object.
<3> The HTTPS listener listens for HTTPS requests that match a subdomain of the cluster domain. You use this listener to configure ingress to your applications by using Gateway API `HTTPRoute` resources.
<4> The hostname must be a subdomain of the Ingress Operator domain. If you use a domain, the listener tries to serve all traffic in that domain.
<5> The name of the previously created secret.

.. Apply the resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-gateway.yaml
----

.. Optional: When you create a `Gateway` object, {SMProductName} automatically provisions a deployment and service with the same name. Verify this by running the following commands:
*** To verify the deployment, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment -n openshift-ingress example-gateway-openshift-default
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
example-gateway-openshift-default    1/1     1            1           25s
----
*** To verify the service, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get service -n openshift-ingress example-gateway-openshift-default
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP         PORT(S)      AGE
example-gateway-openshift-default   LoadBalancer   10.1.2.3     <external_ipname>   <port_info>  47s
----

.. Optional: The Ingress Operator automatically creates a `DNSRecord` CR using the hostname from the listeners, and adds the label `gateway.networking.k8s.io/gateway-name=example-gateway`. Verify the status of the DNS record by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ingress get dnsrecord -l gateway.networking.k8s.io/gateway-name=example-gateway -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
kind: DNSRecord
  ...
status:
  ...
  zones:
  - conditions:
    - message: The DNS provider succeeded in ensuring the record
      reason: ProviderSuccess
      status: "True"
      type: Published
    dnsZone:
      tags:
        ...
  - conditions:
    - message: The DNS provider succeeded in ensuring the record
      reason: ProviderSuccess
      status: "True"
      type: Published
    dnsZone:
      id: ...
----

. Create an `HTTPRoute` resource that directs requests to your already-created namespace and application called `example-app/example-app`:

.. Create a YAML file, `example-route.yaml`, that contains the following information:
+
.Example `HTTPRoute` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: example-route
  namespace: example-app-ns <1>
spec:
  parentRefs: <2>
  - name: example-gateway
    namespace: openshift-ingress
  hostnames: ["example.gwapi.${DOMAIN}"] <3>
  rules:
  - backendRefs: <4>
    - name: example-app <5>
      port: 8443
----
<1> The namespace you are deploying your application.
<2> This field must point to the `Gateway` object you previously configured.
<3> The hostname must match the one specified in the `Gateway` object. In this case, the listeners use a wildcard hostname.
<4> This field specifies the backend references that point to your service.
<5> The name of the `Service` for your application.

.. Apply the resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-route.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/example-route created
----

.Verification

. Verify that the `Gateway` object is deployed and has the condition `Programmed` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait -n openshift-ingress --for=condition=Programmed gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io example-gateway
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
gateway.gateway.networking.k8s.io/example-gateway condition met
----

. Send a request to the configured `HTTPRoute` object hostname:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -I --cacert <local cert file> https://example.gwapi.${DOMAIN}:443
----
