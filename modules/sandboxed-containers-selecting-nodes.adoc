[id="sandboxed-containers-selecting-nodes-CLI_{context}"]
= Installing {sandboxed-containers-first} on selected nodes using the CLI

You can use labels to install the `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` on specific worker nodes.

By default, when you create the `KataConfig` custom resource (CR), the {sandboxed-containers-operator} installs `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` on all worker nodes. Add labels to specific worker nodes and define the label in the `KataConfig` CR when you create it to install Kata only on the labeled nodes.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {product-title} {product-version} on your cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {sandboxed-containers-operator}.

.Procedure

. Apply a label to a node using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <worker_node_name> <label_key=<label_value>
----
+
.Example
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node worker_node_abc custom-kata-machine-pool=true
----

. Repeat this step for each node you want to label.

. Create a YAML file with the following manifest:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    apiVersion: kataconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: KataConfig
    metadata:
      name: cluster-kataconfig
    spec:
      kataConfigPoolSelector:
        matchLabels:
           <label_key>: '<label_value>'
----

. Create the `KataConfig` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file name>.yaml
----

The new `KataConfig` CR is created and begins to install `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` on the worker nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{sandboxed-containers-first} installs Kata only as a secondary, optional runtime on the cluster and not as the primary runtime.
====

.Verification

* Monitor the installation progress:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ watch oc describe kataconfig
----

+
Once the value of *Completed nodes* equals the number of labeled nodes, the installation is complete.

// TROUBLESHOOTING??
//* You can check to see if the nodes in the `machine-config-pool` object are going through a config update.
//** If you are using the default nodes, you can monitor the `machine-config-pool` resource by running:
//+
//[source,terminal]
//----
//$ watch oc get mcp worker
//----
//** If you are using selected nodes, you can monitor the `machine-config-pool` resource by running:
//+
//[source,terminal]
//----
//$ watch oc get mcp kata-oc
//----
//
//* You can run `watch oc describe kataconfig cluster-kataconfig` to display information about `sandboxed-containers` extension failure on a node. The information is gathered from the status of the `machine-config-pool` object. You can view the information by running:
//+
//[source,terminal]
//----
//$ oc describe mcp <machine-config-pool>
//----
