= Additional support limitations for the Shared Resource CSI Driver

[role="_abstract"]
The Shared Resource CSI Driver has the following noteworthy limitations:

* The driver is subject to the limitations of Container Storage Interface (CSI) inline ephemeral volumes.
* The value of the `readOnly` field must be `true`. Otherwise, on volume provisioning during pod startup, the driver returns an error to the kubelet. This limitation is in keeping with proposed best practices for the upstream Kubernetes CSI Driver to apply SELinux labels to associated volumes.
* The driver ignores the `FSType` field because it only supports `tmpfs` volumes.
* The driver ignores the `NodePublishSecretRef` field. Instead, it uses `SubjectAccessReviews` with the `use` verb to evaluate whether a pod can obtain a volume that contains `SharedSecret` or `SharedConfigMap` custom resource (CR) instances.
