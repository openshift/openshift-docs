= Additional support limitations for the Shared Resource CSI Driver

[role="_abstract"]
The Shared Resource CSI Driver has the following noteworthy limitations:

* The driver is subject to the limitations of Container Storage Interface (CSI) inline ephemeral volumes.
* The value of the `readOnly` field must be `true`. On `Pod` creation, a validating admission webhook rejects the pod creation if `readOnly` is `false`. If for some reason the validating admission webhook cannot be contacted, on volume provisioning during pod startup, the driver returns an error to the kubelet. Requiring `readOnly` is `true` is in keeping with proposed best practices for the upstream Kubernetes CSI Driver to apply SELinux labels to associated volumes.
* The driver ignores the `FSType` field because it only supports `tmpfs` volumes.
* The driver ignores the `NodePublishSecretRef` field. Instead, it uses `SubjectAccessReviews` with the `use` verb to evaluate whether a pod can obtain a volume that contains `SharedSecret` or `SharedConfigMap` custom resource (CR) instances.
* You cannot create `SharedSecret` or `SharedConfigMap` custom resource (CR) instances whose names start with `openshift`.
