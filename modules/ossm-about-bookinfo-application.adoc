= About the Bookinfo application

Installing the `bookinfo` example application consists of two main tasks: deploying the application and creating a gateway so the application is accessible outside the cluster.

You can use the `bookinfo` application to explore service mesh features. Using the `bookinfo` application, you can easily confirm that requests from a web browser pass through the mesh and reach the application.

The `bookinfo` application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. The application displays a page that describes the book, lists book details (ISBN, number of pages, and other information), and book reviews.

The `bookinfo` application is exposed through the mesh, and the mesh configuration determines how the microservices comprising the application are used to serve requests. The review information comes from one of three services: `reviews-v1`, `reviews-v2` or `reviews-v3`. If you deploy the `bookinfo` application without defining the `reviews` virtual service, then the mesh uses a round robin rule to route requests to a service.

By deploying the `reviews` virtual service, you can specify a different behavior. For example, you can specify that if a user logs into the `bookinfo` application, then the mesh routes requests to the `reviews-v2` service, and the application displays reviews with black stars. If a user does not log into the `bookinfo` application, then the mesh routes requests to the `reviews-v3` service, and the application displays reviews with red stars.
