= Requirements for the {rh-virtualization} environment

To install and run an {product-title} cluster, the {rh-virtualization} environment must meet the following requirements. Not meeting these requirements can cause failures.

The following requirements for CPUs, memory, and storage are based on the _default_ values you specify in the virtual machine template multiplied by the number of virtual machines the installation program creates.

By default, the installation program creates seven machines during the installation process, which includes one bootstrap machine. When the installation program finishes, it deletes the bootstrap machine and frees up its resources. If you perform a custom installation, you can increase the number of virtual machines the installation program creates.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you increase the resources when you create the virtual machine template, or increase the number of virtual machines in the `install_config.yaml` file, you must also increase these requirements.

.Requirements

* The {rh-virtualization} version is 4.3.9.4 or later.
* The {rh-virtualization} environment has one data center whose state is *Up*.
* The {rh-virtualization} data center contains an {rh-virtualization} cluster.
* The {rh-virtualization} cluster has the following resources exclusively for the {product-title} cluster:
** Minimum 28 vCPUs, which is 4 vCPUs for each of the seven virtual machines created during installation.
** 112 GiB RAM or more, including:
*** 16 GiB or more for the bootstrap machine, which provides the temporary control plane.
*** 16 GiB or more for each of the three control plane machines which provide the control plane.
*** 16 GiB or more for each of the three compute machines, which run the application workloads.
* The {rh-virtualization} storage domain must meet link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4770281[these etcd backend performance requirements].
* In production environments, each virtual machine must have 120 GiB or more, so the storage domain must have 840 GiB or more for the {product-title} cluster. In resource-constrained or non-production environments, each virtual machine must have 32 GiB or more, so the storage domain must have 230 GiB or more for the {product-title} cluster.
* The {rh-virtualization} cluster must have access to an Internet connection to download images from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog during installation and updates, and for the Telemetry service to simplify the subscription and entitlement process.
* The {rh-virtualization} cluster has a virtual network with access to the REST API on the {rh-virtualization} Manager.

[NOTE]
====
* All together, the hosts must have the required memory and CPU resources **in addition to and aside from** what they use to operate or provide to non-{product-title} operations.
* The release cycles of {product-title} and
{rh-virtualization} are different and versions tested might vary in the future
depending on the release dates of both products.
* The bootstrap machine provides a temporary control plane while the installation program creates the {product-title} cluster. After it creates the cluster, the installation program removes the bootstrap machine and releases its resources.
