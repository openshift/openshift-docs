= Requirements for the {rh-virtualization} environment

To install and run an {product-title} cluster, the {rh-virtualization} environment must meet the following requirements. Not meeting these requirements can cause failures.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These requirements are based on the resource allocations in the virtual machine template the installation program uses to create control plane and compute machines. These resources include vCPUs, memory, and storage. If you change the virtual machine template or increase the number of {product-title} machines, adjust these requirements.
====

.Requirements

* The {rh-virtualization} version is 4.3.9 or later.
* The {rh-virtualization} environment has one data center whose state is *Active*.
* The {rh-virtualization} data center contains an {rh-virtualization} cluster.
* The {rh-virtualization} cluster has the following resources exclusively for the {product-title} cluster:
** Minimum 28 vCPUs, which is 4 vCPUs for each of the seven virtual machines created during installation.
** 112 GiB RAM or more, including:
*** 16 GiB or more for the bootstrap machine, which provides the temporary control plane.
*** 16 GiB or more for each of the three control plane machines which provide the control plane.
*** 16 GiB or more for each of the three compute machines, which run the application workloads.
* The {rh-virtualization} storage domain for the {product-title} cluster must have 230 GiB or more and must meet link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4770281[these etcd backend performance requirements].
* The {rh-virtualization} cluster must have access to an Internet connection to download images from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog during installation and updates, and for the Telemetry service to simplify the subscription and entitlement process.
* The {rh-virtualization} cluster has a virtual network with access to the REST API on the {rh-virtualization} Manager.

[NOTE]
====
* All together, the hosts must have the required memory and CPU resources **in addition to and aside from** what they use to operate or provide to non-{product-title} operations.
* The release cycles of {product-title} and
{rh-virtualization} are different and versions tested might vary in the future
depending on the release dates of both products.
* The bootstrap machine provides a temporary control plane while the installation program creates the {rh-virtualization} cluster. After it creates the cluster, the installation program removes the bootstrap machine and releases its resources.
