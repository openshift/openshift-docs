= Requirements for the {rh-virtualization} environment

To install and run an {product-title} cluster, the {rh-virtualization} environment must meet the following requirements.

Not meeting these requirements can cause the installation or process to fail. Additionally, not meeting these requirements can cause the {product-title} cluster to fail days or weeks after installation.

The following requirements for CPU, memory, and storage resources are based on *default* values multiplied by the default number of virtual machines the installation program creates. These resources must be available *in addition to* what the {rh-virtualization} environment uses for non-{product-title} operations.

By default, the installation program creates seven virtual machines during the installation process. First, it creates a bootstrap virtual machine to provide temporary services and a control plane while it creates the rest of the {product-title} cluster. When the installation program finishes creating the cluster, deleting the bootstrap machine frees up its resources.

If you increase the number of virtual machines in the {rh-virtualization} environment, you must increase the resources accordingly.

.Requirements

* The {rh-virtualization} environment has one data center whose state is *Up*.
* The {rh-virtualization} data center contains an {rh-virtualization} cluster.
* The {rh-virtualization} cluster has the following resources exclusively for the {product-title} cluster:
** Minimum 28 vCPUs: four for each of the seven virtual machines created during installation.
** 112 GiB RAM or more, including:
*** 16 GiB or more for the bootstrap machine, which provides the temporary control plane.
*** 16 GiB or more for each of the three control plane machines which provide the control plane.
*** 16 GiB or more for each of the three compute machines, which run the application workloads.
* The {rh-virtualization} storage domain must meet link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4770281[these etcd backend performance requirements].
* In production environments, each virtual machine must have 120 GiB or more. Therefore, the storage domain must provide 840 GiB or more for the default {product-title} cluster. In resource-constrained or non-production environments, each virtual machine must have 32 GiB or more, so the storage domain must have 230 GiB or more for the default {product-title} cluster.
* To download images from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog during installation and update procedures, the {rh-virtualization} cluster must have access to an internet connection. The Telemetry service also needs an internet connection to simplify the subscription and entitlement process.
// TBD - What about the disconnected installation alternative?
* The {rh-virtualization} cluster must have a virtual network with access to the REST API on the {rh-virtualization} Manager.
* A user account and group with the following least privileges for installing and managing an {product-title} cluster on the target {rh-virtualization} cluster:
** `DiskOperator`
** `DiskCreator`
** `UserTemplateBasedVm`
** `TemplateOwner`
** `TemplateCreator`
** `ClusterAdmin` on the target cluster


[WARNING]
====
Apply the principle of least privilege: Avoid using an administrator account with `SuperUser` privileges on {rh-virtualization} during the installation process. The installation program saves the credentials you provide to a temporary `ovirt-config.yaml` file that might be compromised.
