= Requirements for the {rh-virtualization} environment

To install and run an {product-title} version {product-version} cluster, the {rh-virtualization} environment must meet the following requirements.

Not meeting these requirements can cause the installation or process to fail. Additionally, not meeting these requirements can cause the {product-title} cluster to fail days or weeks after installation.

The following requirements for CPU, memory, and storage resources are based on *default* values multiplied by the default number of virtual machines the installation program creates. These resources must be available *in addition to* what the {rh-virtualization} environment uses for non-{product-title} operations.

By default, the installation program creates seven virtual machines during the installation process. First, it creates a bootstrap virtual machine to provide temporary services and a control plane while it creates the rest of the {product-title} cluster. When the installation program finishes creating the cluster, deleting the bootstrap machine frees up its resources.

If you increase the number of virtual machines in the {rh-virtualization} environment, you must increase the resources accordingly.

.Requirements

* The {rh-virtualization} version is 4.4.
* The {rh-virtualization} environment has one data center whose state is *Up*.
* The {rh-virtualization} data center contains an {rh-virtualization} cluster.
* The {rh-virtualization} cluster has the following resources exclusively for the {product-title} cluster:
** Minimum 28 vCPUs: four for each of the seven virtual machines created during installation.
** 112 GiB RAM or more, including:
*** 16 GiB or more for the bootstrap machine, which provides the temporary control plane.
*** 16 GiB or more for each of the three control plane machines which provide the control plane.
*** 16 GiB or more for each of the three compute machines, which run the application workloads.
* The {rh-virtualization} storage domain must meet link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4770281[these etcd backend performance requirements].

* For affinity group support:
Three or more hosts in the {rh-virtualization} cluster. If necessary, you can disable affinity groups. For details, see _Example: Removing all affinity groups for a non-production lab setup_ in _Installing a cluster on {rh-virtualization} with customizations_
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "installing-rhv-customizations"]
* For affinity group support:
+
One physical machine per worker or control plane. Workers and control planes can be on the same physical machine. For example, if you have three workers and three control planes, you need three physical machines. If you have four workers and three control planes, you need four physical machines.

** For hard anti-affinity (default): A minimum of three physical machines. For more than three worker nodes, one physical machine per worker or control plane. Workers and control planes can be on the same physical machine.
** For custom affinity groups: Ensure that the resources are appropriate for the affinity group rules that you define.
////
** Production setup: For hard anti-affinity, you need a minimum of three physical machines. For more than three worker nodes, one physical machine per worker or control plane. Workers and control planes can be on the same physical machine. For example, if you have three workers and three control planes, you need three physical machines. If you have four workers and three control planes, you need four physical machines.
** Non-production setup, such as a lab: Remove all affinity groups to enable putting multiple workers or control planes on as few physical machines as possible. This setup does not guarantee redundancy so it is not appropriate for production.
////
endif::[]
* In production environments, each virtual machine must have 120 GiB or more. Therefore, the storage domain must provide 840 GiB or more for the default {product-title} cluster. In resource-constrained or non-production environments, each virtual machine must have 32 GiB or more, so the storage domain must have 230 GiB or more for the default {product-title} cluster.
* To download images from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog during installation and update procedures, the {rh-virtualization} cluster must have access to an internet connection. The Telemetry service also needs an internet connection to simplify the subscription and entitlement process.
// TBD - What about the disconnected installation alternative?
* The {rh-virtualization} cluster must have a virtual network with access to the REST API on the {rh-virtualization} Manager. Ensure that DHCP is enabled on this network, because the VMs that the installer creates obtain their IP address by using DHCP.
* A user account and group with the following least privileges for installing and managing an {product-title} cluster on the target {rh-virtualization} cluster:
** `DiskOperator`
** `DiskCreator`
** `UserTemplateBasedVm`
** `TemplateOwner`
** `TemplateCreator`
** `ClusterAdmin` on the target cluster


[WARNING]
====
Apply the principle of least privilege: Avoid using an administrator account with `SuperUser` privileges on {rh-virtualization} during the installation process. The installation program saves the credentials you provide to a temporary `ovirt-config.yaml` file that might be compromised.
