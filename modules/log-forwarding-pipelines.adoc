= Understanding pipelines

Pipelines are used to configure routing from a log type to one or more outputs.

Log types can be any of the following:

Application:: Container logs generated by user applications running in the cluster, except infrastructure container applications.
Infrastructure:: Container logs from pods that run in the `openshift*`, `kube*`, or `default` projects and journal logs sourced from node file system.
Audit:: Audit logs generated by the node audit system, `auditd`, Kubernetes API server, OpenShift API server, and OVN network.

If you do not define a pipeline for a log type, the logs of the undefined types are dropped. For example, if you specify a pipeline for application and audit logs, but not for infrastructure logs, infrastructure logs are dropped.

You can add labels to outbound log messages by using `key:value` pairs in the pipeline. For example, you might add a label to messages that are forwarded to other data centers or label the logs by type. Labels that are added to objects are also forwarded with the log message.

In the pipeline, you define which log types to forward using an `inputRef` parameter and where to forward the logs to using an `outputRef` parameter.
