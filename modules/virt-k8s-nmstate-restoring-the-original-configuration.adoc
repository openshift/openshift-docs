= Restoring the original configuration

Removing an interface configuration **does not** restore the network interfaces to the state they were in before a policy was applied. Instead, the NICs targeted in the policy are down and reflect `state: down` when getting the `NodeNetworkState`. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
[kni@node ~]$ oc get nns node01 -o yaml
----

[source,yaml]
----
status:
    interfaces:
    - ipv4:
        enabled: false
      ipv6:
        enabled: false
      mac-address: 52:55:00:D1:56:00
      mtu: 1500
      name: eth1
      state: down <1>
      type: ethernet
    - ipv4:
        enabled: false
      ipv6:
        enabled: false
      mac-address: 52:55:00:D1:56:01
      mtu: 1500
      name: eth2
      state: down <1>
      type: ethernet
----

<1> Note that the `state` attribute is `down`.

To restore NICs to their original configuration, simply apply a new policy using the **Creating interfaces** procedure.
