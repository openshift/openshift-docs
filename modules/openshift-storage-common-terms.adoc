= Common terms

This glossary defines common terms that are used in the architecture content. These terms help you understand {product-title} architecture effectively.

Volume access modes:: Volume access modes describe volume capabilities. You can use access modes to match persistent volume claim (PVC) and persistent volume (PV). The following are the examples of access modes:

* ReadWriteOnce (RWO)
* ReadOnlyMany (ROX)
* ReadWriteMany (RWX)
* ReadWriteOncePod (RWOP)

Cinder::
Cinder is the Block Storage service for {rh-openstack-first}. You use Cinder to manage the administration, security, and scheduling of all volumes.

Config map::
Use a config map to inject configuration data into pods. You can reference the data stored in a config map in a volume of type `ConfigMap`. Applications running in a pod can use this data.

Container Storage Interface (CSI)::
CSI is an API specification for managing container storage across different container orchestration (CO) systems.

Dynamic Provisioning::
Use the Dynamic Provisioning framework to create storage volumes on-demand. Cluster administrators do ot need to pre-provision persistent storage.

Ephemeral storage::
Ephemeral storage is temporary or transient local storage that pods and containers might require for their operation. The lifetime of this ephemeral storage does not extend beyond the life of the individual pod, and this ephemeral storage cannot be shared across pods.

Fiber channel::
Fiber channel is a networking technology for transferring data among data centers, computer servers, switches and storage.

FlexVolume::
FlexVolume is an out-of-tree plug-in interface that uses an exec-based model to interface with storage drivers. You must install the FlexVolume driver binaries in a pre-defined volume plug-in path on each node and in some cases the control plane nodes.

fsGroup::
Use the fsGroup to define a file system group ID for a pod.

iSCSI::
Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) is an Internet Protocol-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities.
An iSCSI volume allows an existing iSCSI (SCSI over IP) volume to be mounted into your pod.

hostPath volume::
A hostPath volume in an {product-title} cluster mounts a file or directory from the host node’s filesystem into your pod.

KMS key::
Use the Key Management Service (KMS) to achieve the required encryption level of your data across different services. You can use the KMS key to encrypt, decrypt, and re-encrypt data.

Local volume::
A local volume is a mounted local storage device such as a disk, partition or directory.

NFS::
A Network File System (NFS) allows remote hosts to mount file systems over a network and interact with those file systems as though they are mounted locally. System administrators can then consolidate resources onto centralized servers on the network.

OpenShift Data Foundation::
OpenShift Data Foundation provides agnostic persistent storage for OpenShift Container Platform. It supports file, block, and object storage, either in-house or in hybrid clouds

Persistent storage::
Pods and containers require permanent storage for their operation. {product-title} uses the Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) framework, so that cluster administrators can provision persistent storage for a cluster. Developers can use PVC to request PV resources without having specific knowledge of the underlying storage infrastructure.

Persistent volumes (PV)::
{product-title} uses the Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) framework to allow cluster administrators to provision persistent storage for a cluster. Developers can use PVC to request PV resources without having specific knowledge of the underlying storage infrastructure.

Persistent volume claims (PVCs)::
You can use a PVC to mount a PersistentVolume into a Pod. You can access the storage without knowing the details of the cloud environment.

Pod::
Pods are One or more containers with shared resources, such as volume and IP addresses, that run in your {product-title} cluster. A pod is the smallest compute unit defined, deployed, and managed.

Reclaim policy::
A policy that tells the cluster what to do with the volume after it is released. A volume’s reclaim policy can be `Retain`, `Recycle`, or `Delete`.

Role-based access control (RBAC)::
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources that is based on the roles of individual users within your organization.

Stateless applications::
A stateless application is an application program that does not save client data generated in one session for use in the next session with that client.

Stateful applications::
A stateful application saves data to persistent disk storage. A server, client, and applications can use a persistent disk storage. You can use the `Statefulset` object in {product-title} to manage the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods. The Statefulset object guarantees the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.

Static provisioning::
In static provisioning a cluster administrator creates a number of PVs. PVs contain the details of storage, exist in the Kubernetes API and are available for consumption.

Storage class::
A storage class provides a way for administrators to describe different types of storage that they offer. Different classes can map to the quality of service levels, backup policies, or arbitrary policies determined by the cluster administrators.

VMware vSphere’s Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) volumes::
Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) is a file format that is used for containers for virtual hard disk drives in virtual machines.
