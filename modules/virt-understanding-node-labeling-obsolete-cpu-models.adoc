= Understanding node labeling for obsolete CPU models

To ensure that a node supports only valid CPU models for scheduled VMs, create a ConfigMap with a list of obsolete CPU models. When the `node-labeller` obtains the list of obsolete CPU models, it eliminates those CPU models and creates labels for valid CPU models.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not configure a ConfigMap with a list of obsolete CPU models, all CPU models are evaluated for labels, including obsolete CPU models that are not present in your environment.
====

Through the process of iteration, the list of base CPU features in the minimum CPU model are eliminated from the list of labels generated for the node. For example, an environment might have two supported CPU models: `Penryn` and `Haswell`.

If `Penryn` is specified as the CPU model for `minCPU`, the `node-labeller` evaluates each base CPU feature for `Penryn` and compares it with each CPU feature supported by `Haswell`. If the CPU feature is supported by both `Penryn` and `Haswell`, the `node-labeller` eliminates that feature from the list of CPU features for creating labels. If a CPU feature is supported only by `Haswell` and not by `Penryn`, that CPU feature is included in the list of generated labels. The `node-labeller` follows this iterative process to eliminate base CPU features that are present in the minimum CPU model and create labels.

The following example shows the complete list of CPU features for `Penryn` which is specified as the CPU model for `minCPU`:
