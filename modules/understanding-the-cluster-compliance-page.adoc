= Understanding the cluster compliance page

The cluster compliance page organizes information in the following groups:

* *Cluster*: Gives the details of your cluster and provides a snapshot of its current state and configurations.
* *Operator status*: Assesses the health and operational status of the operators within your cluster and ensures that the operators are running optimally and functioning seamlessly.
* *Build date*: Provides important information about the build date and provides a timestamp for the last configuration update or change to your cluster.
* *Compliance*: Shows the percentage of checks that have been passed for the scanned profiles.
