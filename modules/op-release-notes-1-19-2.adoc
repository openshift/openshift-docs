== Fixed issues

* Before this update, when you installed the {pipelines-shortname} Operator 1.19.0 by using the web console, the `Tekton Pruner` API was incorrectly visible in the _Details_ section. With this update, the `Tekton Pruner`` API is no longer visible in the web console, as intended by the pruner design.

* Before this update, there were only limited tasks fetched from ArtifactHUB in the pipeline builder page, and on search for a task, if the task was not available in the first fetched list, then that task was not displayed. With this update, UI makes an API call to ArtifactHub to search for a task in Pipeline builder quick search and lists them to install.

* Before this update, the Pipeline Builder page only fetched a limited number of tasks from Artifact Hub. If a searched task was not included in that initial list, it would not appear in the results. With this update, the UI now makes a direct API call to Artifact Hub during quick search, allowing users to find and list additional tasks for installation.

* Before this update, the _Events_ tab for a `PipelineRun` did not display any events. With this update, the tab now correctly shows events, allowing you to view relevant activity for each `PipelineRun`.

* Before this update, `onError` variable substitution did not work with the `v1beta1` API. With this update, the issue has been fixed. 

* Before this update, the Git resolver did not use the provided `gitToken` and `gitTokenKey` for remote authentication, which caused HTTP token-based authentication to fail. With this update, all Git resolver operations now use the provided `gitToken` for remote authentication.
