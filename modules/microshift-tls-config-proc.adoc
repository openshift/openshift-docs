= Configuring TLS for {microshift-short}

You can choose to use either the TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 security profiles with {microshift-short} for system hardening.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a root user.
* {microshift-short} has either not started for the first time, or is stopped.
* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.
* The certificate authority has issued the custom certificates (CAs).

.Procedure

. Make a copy of the provided `config.yaml.default` file in the `/etc/microshift/` directory, renaming it `config.yaml`.

. Keep the new {microshift-short} `config.yaml` in the `/etc/microshift/` directory. Your `config.yaml` file is read every time the {microshift-short} service starts.
+
[NOTE]
====
After you create it, the `config.yaml` file takes precedence over built-in settings.
====

. Optional: Use a configuration snippet if you are using an existing {microshift-short} YAML. See "Using configuration snippets" in the Additional resources section for more information.

. Replace the default values in the `tls` section of the {microshift-short} YAML with your valid values.

.Example TLS 1.2 configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiServer:
# ...
  tls:
    cipherSuites: # <1>
    - <cipher_suite_1> # <2>
    - ...
    minVersion: VersionTLS12 # <3>
# ...
----
<1> Defaults to the suites of the configured `minVersion`. If `minVersion` is not configured, the default value is TLS 1.2.
<2> Specify the cipher suites you want to use from the list of supported cipher suites. If you do not configure this list, all of the supported cipher suites are used. All clients connecting to the API server must support the configured cipher suites or the connections fail during the TLS handshake phase. Be sure to add the CA certificate bundle to the list of CA certificates that the TLS client or server trusts.
<3> Specify `VersionTLS12` or `VersionTLS13`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When you choose TLS 1.3 as the minimum TLS version, only the default {microshift-short} cipher suites can be used. Additional cipher suites are not configurable. If other cipher suites to use with TLS 1.3 are configured, those suites are ignored and overwritten by the {microshift-short} defaults.
====

. Complete any other additional configurations that you require, then restart {microshift-short} by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart microshift
