= Group-by-Attributes Processor

[role="_abstract"]
The Group-by-Attributes Processor groups all spans, log records, and metric datapoints that share the same attributes by reassigning them to a Resource that matches those attributes.

:FeatureName: The Group-by-Attributes Processor
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

At minimum, configuring this processor involves specifying an array of attribute keys to be used to group spans, log records, or metric datapoints together, as in the following example:

.Example of the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource when using the Group-by-Attributes Processor
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
  config:
    processors:
      groupbyattrs:
        keys: # <1>
          - <key1> # <2>
          - <key2>
# ...
----
<1> Specifies attribute keys to group by.
<2> If a processed span, log record, or metric datapoint contains at least one of the specified attribute keys, it is reassigned to a Resource that shares the same attribute values; and if no such Resource exists, a new one is created. If none of the specified attribute keys is present in the processed span, log record, or metric datapoint, then it remains associated with its current Resource. Multiple instances of the same Resource are consolidated.
