= Creating a service account, role, and binding for event sources

.Prerequisites

* You must have the {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Serving, and Knative Eventing installed in your {product-title} cluster. This can be installed by a cluster administrator.

.Procedure

. Create a service account, role, and role binding for the event source by creating a file named `authentication.yaml` and copying the following sample code into it:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: events-sa
  namespace: default <1>

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: event-watcher
  namespace: default <1>
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
    resources:
      - events
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: k8s-ra-event-watcher
  namespace: default <1>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: event-watcher
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: events-sa
    namespace: default <1>
----
<1> Change this namespace to the namespace that you have selected for installing the event source.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to re-use an existing service account with the appropriate permissions, you must modify the `authentication.yaml` for that service account.
====
. Apply the `authentication.yaml` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply --filename authentication.yaml
----
