= About `opm`

The `opm` CLI tool is provided by the Operator Framework for use with the Operator Bundle Format. This tool allows you to create and maintain catalogs of Operators from a list of bundles, called an _index_, that are similar to software repositories. The result is a container image, called an _index image_, which can be stored in a container registry and then installed on a cluster.

An index contains a database of pointers to Operator manifest content that can be queried through an included API that is served when the container image is run. On {product-title}, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can use the index image as a catalog by referencing it in a CatalogSource, which polls the image at regular intervals to enable frequent updates to installed Operators on the cluster.
