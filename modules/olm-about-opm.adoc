= About the opm CLI

The `opm` CLI tool is provided by the Operator Framework for use with the Operator bundle format. This tool allows you to create and maintain catalogs of Operators from a list of Operator bundles that are similar to software repositories. The result is a container image which can be stored in a container registry and then installed on a cluster.

A catalog contains a database of pointers to Operator manifest content that can be queried through an included API that is served when the container image is run. On {product-title}, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can reference the image in a catalog source, defined by a `CatalogSource` object, which polls the image at regular intervals to enable frequent updates to installed Operators on the cluster.
