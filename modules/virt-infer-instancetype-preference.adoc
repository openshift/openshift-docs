= Inferring an instance type or preference

Inferring instance types, preferences, or both is enabled by default, and the `inferFromVolumeFailure` policy of the `inferFromVolume` attribute is set to `Ignore`. When inferring from the boot volume, errors are ignored, and the VM is created with the instance type and preference left unset.

However, when flags are applied, the `inferFromVolumeFailure` policy defaults to `Reject`. When inferring from the boot volume, errors result in the rejection of the creation of that VM.

You can use the `--infer-instancetype` and `--infer-preference` flags to infer which instance type, preference, or both to use to define the workload sizing and runtime characteristics of a VM.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the `virtctl` tool.

.Procedure

* To explicitly infer instance types from the volume used to boot the virtual machine, use the `--infer-instancetype` flag. To explicitly infer preferences, use the `--infer-preference` flag. The following command includes both flags:

$ virtctl create vm --volume-import type:pvc,src:my-ns/my-pvc --infer-instancetype --infer-preference
