= Creating a service function chain on the DPU

Network service chaining, also known as service function chaining (SFC) is a capability that uses software-defined networking (SDN) capabilities to create a chain of connected network services, such as L4-7 services like firewalls, network address translation (NAT), and intrusion protection.

Follow this procedure on the DPU to create the network function `my-network-function` in the service function chain.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {oc-first}.
* An account with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Install the DPU Operator.

.Procedure

. Save the following YAML file example as `sfc.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: ServiceFunctionChain
metadata:
  name: sfc
  namespace: openshift-dpu-operator
spec:
  networkFunctions:
  - name: my-network-function <1>
    image: quay.io/example-org/my-network-function:latest <2>
----
+
<1> The name of the network function. This name is used to identify the network function in the service function chain.
<2> The URL to the container image that contains the network function. The image must be accessible from the DPU.

. Create the chain by running the following command on the DPU nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f sfc.yaml
