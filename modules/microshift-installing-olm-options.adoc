= Determining your OLM installation type

[role="_abstract"]
You can install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) for use with {microshift-short} 4.16 or newer versions. There are different ways to install OLM for a {microshift-short} node, depending on your use case.

* You can install the `microshift-olm` RPM at the same time you install the {microshift-short} RPM on {op-system-base-full}.
* You can install the `microshift-olm` on an existing {microshift-short} {product-version}. Restart the {microshift-short} service after installing OLM for the changes to apply.
* See the following links for specifics on each installation type:
