= Deployments

Kubernetes provides a first-class, native API object type in {product-title}
called _Deployments_. Deployments serve as a descendant of the
{product-title}-specific DeploymentConfig.

Like DeploymentConfigs, Deployments describe the desired state of a particular
component of an application as a Pod template. Deployments create ReplicaSets,
which orchestrate Pod lifecycles.

For example, the following Deployment definition creates a ReplicaSet to bring
up one `hello-openshift` Pod:

.Deployment definition
