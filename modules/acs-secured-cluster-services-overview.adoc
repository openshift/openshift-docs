= Secured cluster services

You install the secured cluster services on every cluster you want to secure by using the {product-title}, including the cluster where you have installed Central.
Secured cluster services include the following components:

* *Sensor*: Sensor is the service responsible for analyzing and monitoring the cluster.
Sensor listens to the {ocp} or Kubernetes API and Collector events to report the current state of the cluster.
Sensor also triggers deploy-time and runtime violations based on {product-title-short} policies. Additionally, Sensor is responsible for all cluster interactions, such as applying network policies, initiating reprocessing of {product-title-short} policies, and interacting with the Admission controller.
* *Admission controller*: The Admission controller prevents users from creating workloads that violate security policies in {product-title-short}.
* *Collector*: Collector analyzes and monitors container activity on cluster nodes.
It collects container runtime and network activity information and sends the collected data to Sensor.
* *Scanner*: On Kubernetes, the Secured cluster services do not include Scanner.
However, on the {ocp}, {product-title-short} installs a lightweight Scanner version on each secured cluster to scan images in the integrated {ocp} registry.
