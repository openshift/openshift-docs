You install the secured cluster services on each cluster that you want to secure by using the {title}.
Secured cluster services include the following components:

* *Sensor*: Sensor is the service responsible for analyzing and monitoring the cluster.
Sensor listens to the {ocp} or Kubernetes API and Collector events to report the current state of the cluster.
Sensor also triggers deploy-time and runtime violations based on {short-title} policies.
In addition, Sensor is responsible for all cluster interactions, such as applying network policies, initiating reprocessing of {short-title} policies, and interacting with the Admission controller.
* *Admission controller*: The Admission controller prevents users from creating workloads that violate security policies in {short-title}.
* *Collector*: Collector analyzes and monitors container activity on cluster nodes.
It collects container runtime and network activity information and sends the collected data to Sensor.
* *StackRox Scanner*: In Kubernetes, the secured cluster services include Scanner-slim as an optional component. However, on {ocp}, {short-title} installs a Scanner-slim version on each secured cluster to scan images in the {ocp} integrated registry and optionally other registries.
* *Scanner-DB*: This database contains data for the StackRox Scanner.
* *Scanner V4*: Scanner V4 components are installed on the secured cluster if enabled.
** *Scanner V4 Indexer*: The Scanner V4 Indexer performs image indexing, previously known as image analysis. Given an image and registry credentials, the Indexer pulls the image from the registry. It finds the base operating system, if it exists, and looks for packages. It stores and outputs an index report, which contains the findings for the given image.
** *Scanner V4 DB*: This component is installed if Scanner V4 is enabled. This database stores information for Scanner V4, including index reports. For best performance, configure a persistent volume claim (PVC) for Scanner V4 DB.

[NOTE]
====
When secured cluster services are installed on the same cluster as Central services and installed in the same namespace, secured cluster services do not deploy Scanner V4 components. Instead, it is assumed that Central services already include a deployment of Scanner V4.
