= Jaeger Collector configuration options

The Jaeger Collector is the component responsible for receiving the spans that were captured by the tracer and writing them to a persistent storage (Elasticsearch) when using the `production` strategy, or to AMQ Streams when using the `streaming` strategy.

The collectors are stateless and thus many instances of Jaeger Collector can be run in parallel. Collectors require almost no configuration, except for the location of the Elasticsearch cluster.

.Parameters used by the Operator to define the Jaeger Collector
[options="header"]
[cols="l, a, a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Values
|collector:
  replicas:
|Specifies the number of Collector replicas to create.
|Integer, for example, `5`

.Jaeger parameters passed to the Collector
[options="header"]
[cols="l, a, a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Values
|spec:
 collector:
  options: {}
|Configuration options that define the Jaeger Collector.
|

|options:
  collector:
    num-workers:
|The number of workers pulling from the queue.
|Integer, for example, `50`

|options:
  collector:
    queue-size:
|The size of the Collector queue.
|Integer, for example, `2000`

|options:
  kafka:
    producer:
      topic: jaeger-spans
|The `topic` parameter identifies the Kafka configuration used by the collector to produce the messages, and the ingester to consume the messages.
|Label for the producer

|kafka:
  producer:
    brokers: my-cluster-kafka-brokers.kafka:9092
|Identifies the Kafka configuration used by the Collector to produce the messages.  If brokers are not specified, and you have AMQ Streams 1.4.0+ installed, Jaeger will self-provision Kafka.
|

|log-level:
|Logging level for the collector.
|`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `fatal`, `panic`

|maxReplicas:
|Specifies the maximum number of replicas to create when autoscaling the Collector.
|Integer, for example, `100`

|num-workers:
|The number of workers pulling from the queue.
|Integer, for example, `50`

|queue-size:
|The size of the Collector queue.
|Integer, for example, `2000`

|replicas:
|Specifies the number of Collector replicas to create.
|Integer, for example, `5`

== Configuring the Collector for autoscaling

[NOTE]
====
Autoscaling is only supported for Jaeger 1.20 or later.
====

You can configure the Collector to autoscale; the Collector will scale up or down based on the CPU and/or memory consumption.  Configuring the Collector to autoscale can help you ensure your Jaeger environment scales up during times of increased load, and scales down when less resources are needed, saving on costs.  You configure autoscaling by setting the `autoscale` parameter to `true` and specifying a value for `.spec.collector.maxReplicas` along with a reasonable value for the resources that you expect the Collector's pod to consume. If you do not set a value for `.spec.collector.maxReplicas` the Operator will set it to `100`.

By default, when there is no value provided for `.spec.collector.replicas`, the Jaeger Operator creates  a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) configuration for the Collector.  For more information about HPA, refer to the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[Kubernetes documentation].

The following is an example autoscaling configuration, setting the Collector's limits as well as the maximum number of replicas:
