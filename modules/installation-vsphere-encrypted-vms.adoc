= Requirements for encrypting virtual machines

You can encrypt your virtual machines prior to installing {product-title} {product-version} by meeting the following requirements.

* You have configured a Standard key provider in vSphere. For more information, see link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vsan.doc/GUID-AC06B3C3-901F-402E-B25F-1EE7809D1264.html[Adding a KMS to vCenter Server].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Native key provider in vCenter is not supported. For more information, see link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-54B9FBA2-FDB1-400B-A6AE-81BF3AC9DF97.html[vSphere Native Key Provider Overview].
====

* You have enabled host encryption mode on all of the ESXi hosts that are hosting the cluster. For more information, see link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-A9E1F016-51B3-472F-B8DE-803F6BDB70BC.html[Enabling host encryption mode].
* You have a vSphere account which has all cryptographic privileges enabled. For more information, see link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-660CCB35-847F-46B3-81CA-10DDDB9D7AA9.html[Cryptographic Operations Privileges].

When you deploy the OVF template in the section titled "Installing RHCOS and starting the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process", select the option to "Encrypt this virtual machine" when you are selecting storage for the OVF template. After completing cluster installation, create a storage class that uses the encryption storage policy you used to encrypt the virtual machines.
