[id="nw-networkpolicy-deny-all-multi-network-policy_{context}"]
= Creating a default deny all {name} policy

[role="_abstract"]
The default deny all {name} policy blocks all cross-pod networking other than network traffic allowed by the configuration of other deployed network policies and traffic between host-networked pods. This procedure enforces a strong deny policy by applying a `deny-by-default` policy in the `my-project` namespace.

[WARNING]
====
Without configuring a `NetworkPolicy` custom resource (CR) that allows traffic communication, the following policy might cause communication problems across your cluster.
====

.Prerequisites
ifndef::microshift[]
* Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports `NetworkPolicy` objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, with `mode: NetworkPolicy` set.
endif::microshift[]
* You installed the {oc-first}.
ifndef::microshift[]
* You logged in to the cluster with a user with `{role}` privileges.
endif::microshift[]
* You are working in the namespace that the {name} policy applies to.

.Procedure

. Create the following YAML that defines a `deny-by-default` policy to deny ingress from all pods in all namespaces. Save the YAML in the `deny-by-default.yaml` file:
+
ifdef::multi[]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-by-default
  namespace: my-project
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/policy-for:<namespace_name>/<network_name>
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress: []
----
+
where:
+
`namespace`:: Specifies the namespace in which to deploy the policy. For example, the `my-project` namespace.
`annotations`:: Specifies the name of namespace project followed by the network attachment definition name.
`podSelector`:: If this field is empty, the configuration matches all the pods. Therefore, the policy applies to all pods in the `my-project` namespace.
`policyTypes`:: Specifies a list of rule types that the `NetworkPolicy` relates to.
`- Ingress`:: Specifies `Ingress` only `policyTypes`.
`ingress`:: Specifies ingress rules. If not specified, all incoming traffic is dropped to all pods.
endif::multi[]
ifndef::multi[]
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-by-default
  namespace: my-project
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress: []
----
+
where:
+
`namespace`:: Specifies the namespace in which to deploy the policy. For example, the `my-project` namespace.
`podSelector`:: If this field is empty, the configuration matches all the pods. Therefore, the policy applies to all pods in the `my-project` namespace.
`ingress`:: Where `[]` indicates that no `ingress` rules are specified. This causes incoming traffic to be dropped to all pods.
endif::multi[]

. Apply the policy by entering the following command. Successful output lists the name of the policy object and the `created` status.
