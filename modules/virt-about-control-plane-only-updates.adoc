= About Control Plane Only updates

Every even-numbered minor version of {product-title}, including 4.10 and 4.12, is an Extended Update Support (EUS) version. However, because Kubernetes design mandates serial minor version updates, you cannot directly update from one EUS version to the next.

After you update from the source EUS version to the next odd-numbered minor version, you must sequentially update {VirtProductName} to all z-stream releases of that minor version that are on your update path. When you have upgraded to the latest applicable z-stream version, you can then update {product-title} to the target EUS minor version.

When the {product-title} update succeeds, the corresponding update for {VirtProductName} becomes available. You can now update {VirtProductName} to the target EUS version.

== Preparing to update

Before beginning a Control Plane Only update, you must:

* Pause worker nodes' machine config pools before you start a Control Plane Only update so that the workers are not rebooted twice.

* Disable automatic workload updates before you begin the update process. This is to prevent {VirtProductName} from migrating or evicting your virtual machines (VMs) until you update to your target EUS version.

[NOTE]
====
By default, {VirtProductName} automatically updates workloads, such as the `virt-launcher` pod, when you update the {VirtProductName} Operator. You can configure this behavior in the `spec.workloadUpdateStrategy` stanza of the `HyperConverged` custom resource.
