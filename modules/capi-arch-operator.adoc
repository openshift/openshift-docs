= The Cluster CAPI Operator

The Cluster CAPI Operator is an {product-title} Operator that maintains the lifecycle of Cluster API resources.
This Operator is responsible for all administrative tasks related to deploying the Cluster API project within an {product-title} cluster.

If a cluster is configured correctly to allow the use of the Cluster API, the Cluster CAPI Operator installs the Cluster API components on the cluster.

For more information, see the "Cluster CAPI Operator" entry in the _Cluster Operators reference_ content.
