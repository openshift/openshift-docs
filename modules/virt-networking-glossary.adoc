{VirtProductName} provides advanced networking functionality by using custom
resources and plug-ins.

The following terms are used throughout {VirtProductName} documentation:

Container Network Interface (CNI):: a link:https://www.cncf.io/[Cloud Native Computing Foundation]
project, focused on container network connectivity. {VirtProductName} uses CNI
plug-ins to build upon the basic Kubernetes networking functionality.

Multus:: a "meta" CNI plug-in that allows multiple CNIs to exist so that a Pod or
virtual machine can use the interfaces it needs.

Custom Resource Definition (CRD):: a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Kubernetes]
API resource that allows you to define custom resources, or an object defined by
using the CRD API resource.

NetworkAttachmentDefinition:: a CRD introduced by the Multus project that
allows you to attach Pods, virtual machines, and virtual machine instances to one or more networks.

Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE):: an interface that enables an administrator
to boot a client machine from a server over the network. Network booting allows
you to remotely load operating systems and other software onto the client.
