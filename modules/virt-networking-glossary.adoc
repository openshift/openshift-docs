{VirtProductName} provides advanced networking functionality by using custom resources and plugins.

The following terms are used throughout {VirtProductName} documentation:

Container Network Interface (CNI):: a link:https://www.cncf.io/[Cloud Native Computing Foundation]
project, focused on container network connectivity.
{VirtProductName} uses CNI plugins to build upon the basic Kubernetes networking functionality.

Multus:: a "meta" CNI plugin that allows multiple CNIs to exist so that a pod or virtual machine can use the interfaces it needs.

Custom resource definition (CRD):: a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Kubernetes]
API resource that allows you to define custom resources, or an object defined by using the CRD API resource.

Network attachment definition:: a CRD introduced by the Multus project that allows you to attach pods, virtual machines, and virtual machine instances to one or more networks.

Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE):: an interface that enables an administrator to boot a client machine from a server over the network.
Network booting allows you to remotely load operating systems and other software onto the client.
