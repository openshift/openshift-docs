= Creating a NetworkPolicy object

To define granular rules describing Ingress network traffic allowed for projects
in your cluster, you can create NetworkPolicy objects.

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster is using a default CNI network provider that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OpenShift SDN network provider with `mode: NetworkPolicy` set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a policy rule:
.. Create a `<policy-name>.yaml` file where `<policy-name>` describes the policy
rule.
.. In the file you just created define a policy object, such as in the following
example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: <policy-name> <1>
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress: []
----
<1> Specify a name for the policy object.

. Run the following command to create the policy object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <policy-name>.yaml -n <project>
----
+
In the following example, a new NetworkPolicy object is created in a project
named `project1`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f default-deny.yaml -n project1
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
networkpolicy "default-deny" created
----
