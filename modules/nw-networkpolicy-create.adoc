= Creating a network policy

To define granular rules describing ingress or egress network traffic allowed for namespaces in your cluster, you can create a network policy.

[NOTE]
====
If you log in with a user with the `cluster-admin` role, then you can create a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
====

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster is using a cluster network provider that supports `NetworkPolicy` objects, such as
ifndef::ovn[]
the OpenShift SDN network provider with `mode: NetworkPolicy` set.
endif::ovn[]
ifdef::ovn[]
the OVN-Kubernetes network provider or the OpenShift SDN network provider with `mode: NetworkPolicy` set.
endif::ovn[]
This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `admin` privileges.
* You are working in the namespace that the network policy applies to.

.Procedure

. Create a policy rule:
.. Create a `<policy_name>.yaml` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ touch <policy_name>.yaml
----
+
--
where:

`<policy_name>`:: Specifies the network policy file name.
--

.. Define a network policy in the file that you just created, such as in the following examples:
+
.Deny ingress from all pods in all namespaces
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-by-default
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress: []
----
+
.Allow ingress from all pods in the same namespace
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-same-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
----


. To create the network policy object, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <policy_name>.yaml -n <namespace>
----
+
--
where:

`<policy_name>`:: Specifies the network policy file name.
`<namespace>`:: Optional: Specifies the namespace if the object is defined in a different namespace than the current namespace.
--
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
networkpolicy "default-deny" created
----

endif::ovn[]
