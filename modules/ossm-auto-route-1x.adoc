[id="ossm-auto-route_{context}"]
= Automatic route creation

OpenShift routes for Istio Gateways are automatically managed in {ProductName}. Every time an Istio Gateway is created, updated or deleted inside the service mesh, an OpenShift route is created, updated or deleted.

[id="ossm-auto-route-enable_{context}"]
== Enabling Automatic Route Creation
A {ProductName} control plane component called Istio OpenShift Routing (IOR) synchronizes the gateway route. Enable IOR as part of the control plane deployment.

If the Gateway contains a TLS section, the OpenShift Route will be configured to support TLS.

. In the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, add the `ior_enabled` parameter and set it to `true`. For example, see the following resource snippet:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  istio:
    gateways:
     istio-egressgateway:
       autoscaleEnabled: false
       autoscaleMin: 1
       autoscaleMax: 5
     istio-ingressgateway:
       autoscaleEnabled: false
       autoscaleMin: 1
       autoscaleMax: 5
       ior_enabled: true
----


[id="ossm-auto-route-subdomains_{context}"]
== Subdomains

{ProductName} creates the route with the subdomain, but {product-title} must be configured to enable it. Subdomains, for example `*.domain.com`, are supported but not by default.

If the following gateway is created:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway1
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - www.bookinfo.com
    - bookinfo.example.com
----

Then, the following OpenShift Routes are created automatically. You can check that the routes are created with the following command.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <control_plane_namespace> get routes
----

.Expected output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME           HOST/PORT             PATH  SERVICES               PORT  TERMINATION   WILDCARD
gateway1-lvlfn bookinfo.example.com        istio-ingressgateway   <all>               None
gateway1-scqhv www.bookinfo.com            istio-ingressgateway   <all>               None
----

If the gateway is deleted, {ProductName} deletes the routes. However, routes created manually are never modified by {ProductName}.
