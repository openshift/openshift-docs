= Libguestfs and virtctl guestfs commands

`Libguestfs` tools help you access and modify virtual machine (VM) disk images. You can use `libguestfs` tools to view and edit files in a guest, clone and build virtual machines, and format and resize disks.

You can also use the `virtctl guestfs` command and its sub-commands to modify, inspect, and debug VM disks on a PVC. To see a complete list of possible sub-commands, enter `virt-` on the command line and press the Tab key. For example:

[width="100%",cols="42%,58%",options="header",]
|===
|Command |Description

|`virt-edit -a /dev/vda /etc/motd`
|Edit a file interactively in your terminal.

|`virt-customize -a /dev/vda --ssh-inject root:string:<public key example>`
|Inject an ssh key into the guest and create a login.

|`virt-df -a /dev/vda -h`
|See how much disk space is used by a VM.

|`virt-customize -a /dev/vda --run-command 'rpm -qa > /rpm-list'`
|See the full list of all RPMs installed on a guest by creating an output file containing the full list.

|`virt-cat -a /dev/vda /rpm-list`
|Display the output file list of all RPMs created using the `virt-customize -a /dev/vda --run-command 'rpm -qa > /rpm-list'` command in your terminal.

|`virt-sysprep -a /dev/vda`
|Seal a virtual machine disk image to be used as a template.
|===

By default, `virtctl guestfs` creates a session with everything needed to manage a VM disk. However, the command also supports several flag options if you want to customize the behavior:

[width="100%",cols="42%,58%",options="header",]
|===
|Flag Option |Description

|`--h` or `--help`
|Provides help for `guestfs`.

|`-n <namespace>` option with a `<pvc_name>` argument
|To use a PVC from a specific namespace.

If you do not use the `-n <namespace>` option, your current project is used. To change projects, use `oc project <namespace>`.

If you do not include a `<pvc_name>` argument, an error message appears.

|`--image string`
|Lists the `libguestfs-tools` container image.

You can configure the container to use a custom image by using the `--image` option.

|`--kvm`
|Indicates that `kvm` is used by the `libguestfs-tools` container.

By default, `virtctl guestfs` sets up `kvm` for the interactive container, which greatly speeds up the `libguest-tools` execution because it uses QEMU.

If a cluster does not have any `kvm` supporting nodes, you must disable `kvm` by setting the option `--kvm=false`.

If not set, the `libguestfs-tools` pod remains pending because it cannot be scheduled on any node.

|`--pull-policy string`
|Shows the pull policy for the `libguestfs` image.

You can also overwrite the image's pull policy by setting the `pull-policy` option.
|===

The command also checks if a PVC is in use by another pod, in which case an error message appears. However, once the `libguestfs-tools` process starts, the setup cannot avoid a new pod using the same PVC. You must verify that there are no active `virtctl guestfs` pods before starting the VM that accesses the same PVC.

[NOTE]
=====
The `virtctl guestfs` command accepts only a single PVC attached to the interactive pod.
