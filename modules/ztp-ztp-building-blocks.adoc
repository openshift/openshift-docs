= Zero touch provisioning building blocks

ACM deploys single node OpenShift (SNO), which is {product-title} installed on single nodes, leveraging zero touch provisioning (ZTP).
The initial site plan is broken down into smaller components and initial configuration data is stored in a Git repository. Zero touch provisioning uses a declarative GitOps approach to deploy these nodes.
The deployment of the nodes includes:

* Installing the host operating system (RHCOS) on a blank server.

* Deploying {product-title} on single nodes.

* Creating cluster policies and site subscriptions.

* Leveraging a GitOps deployment topology for a develop once, deploy anywhere model.

* Making the necessary network configurations to the server operating system.

* Deploying profile Operators and performing any needed software-related configuration, such as performance profile, PTP, and SR-IOV.

* Downloading images needed to run workloads (CNFs).
