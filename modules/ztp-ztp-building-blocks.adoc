= Zero touch provisioning building blocks

{rh-rhacm-first} leverages zero touch provisioning (ZTP) to deploy single-node {product-title} clusters, three-node clusters, and standard clusters. The initial site plan is divided into smaller components and initial configuration data is stored in a Git repository. ZTP uses a declarative GitOps approach to deploy these clusters.

The deployment of the clusters includes:

* Installing the host operating system (RHCOS) on a blank server.

* Deploying {product-title}.

* Creating cluster policies and site subscriptions.

* Leveraging a GitOps deployment topology for a develop once, deploy anywhere model.

* Making the necessary network configurations to the server operating system.

* Deploying profile Operators and performing any needed software-related configuration, such as performance profile, PTP, and SR-IOV.

* Downloading images needed to run workloads (CNFs).
