= Accessing third-party monitoring UIs

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} does not provide or support direct access to third-party web user interfaces (UIs) for the following components in the monitoring stack: Alertmanager, Prometheus, Thanos Ruler, and Thanos Querier. 
As an alternative to these third-party UIs, navigate to the *Observe* section of the {product-title} web console to access alerting, metrics, dashboards, targets, and other UIs for platform components.

[NOTE]
====
Although you can access the third-party Grafana web UI from the web console or the CLI, this access is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future {product-title} release.
