= Configuring the OAuth server for a hosted cluster by using the web console

You can configure the internal OAuth server for your hosted cluster by using the {product-title} web console.

You can configure OAuth for the following supported identity providers:

* `oidc`
* `htpasswd`
* `keystone`
* `ldap`
* `basic-authentication`
* `request-header`
* `github`
* `gitlab`
* `google`

Adding any identity provider in the OAuth configuration removes the default `kubeadmin` user provider.

.Prerequisites

* You logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You created your hosted cluster.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Home* -> *API Explorer*.

. Use the *Filter by kind* box to search for your `HostedCluster` resource.

. Click the `HostedCluster` resource that you want to edit.

. Click the *Instances* tab.

. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to your hosted cluster name entry and click *Edit HostedCluster*.

. Add the OAuth configuration in the YAML file:
