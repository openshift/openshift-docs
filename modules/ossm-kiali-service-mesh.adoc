[id="ossm-kiali-service-mesh_{context}"]
= Kiali and service mesh

Installing Kiali  via the Service Mesh on {product-title} differs from community Kiali installations in multiple ways. These modifications are sometimes necessary to resolve issues, provide additional features, or to handle differences when deploying on {product-title}.

* Kiali has been enabled by default.
* Ingress has been enabled by default.
* Updates have been made to the Kiali ConfigMap.
* Updates have been made to the ClusterRole settings for Kiali.
* Do not edit the ConfigMap or the Kiali custom resource files as those changes might be overwritten by the {ProductShortName} or Kiali Operators. All configuration for Kiali running on {ProductName} is done in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` custom resource file and there are limited configuration options. Updating the Operator files should be restricted to those users with `cluster-admin` privileges. If you use {product-dedicated}, updating the operator files should be restricted to those users with `dedicated-admin` privileges.
