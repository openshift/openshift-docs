= Example policy configurations for different interfaces

Before you read the different example `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) manifest configurations, consider the following factors when you apply a policy so that your cluster runs at its best performance conditions:

* When you need to apply a policy to more than one node, create a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest for each target node. The Kubernetes NMState Operator applies the policy to each node with an NNCP in an unspecified order. Scoping a policy with this approach reduces the length of time for policy application but risks a cluster-wide outage if an error is in the cluster's configuration. To avoid this type of error, initially apply NNCP to some nodes, and after you confirm they are configured correctly, proceed with applying the policy to the remaining nodes.

* When you need to apply a policy to many nodes but you only want to create a single NNCP for all target nodes, the Kubernetes NMState Operator applies the policy to each node in sequence. You can set the speed and coverage of policy application for target nodes with the `maxUnavailable` parameter in the cluster configuration. By setting a lower percentage value for the parameter, you can reduce the risk of a cluster-wide outage if the outage impacts the small percentage of nodes that are receiving the policy application.

* Consider specifying all related network configurations in a single policy.

* When a node restarts, the Kubernetes NMState Operator cannot control the order that it applies policies to nodes. The Kubernetes NMState Operator might apply interdependent policies in a sequence that results in a degraded network object.
