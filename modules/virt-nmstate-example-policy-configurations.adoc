= Example policy configurations for different interfaces

Before you read the different example `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) manifest configurations, consider the following factors when you apply a policy to nodes so that your cluster runs under its best performance conditions:

* When you need to apply a policy to more than one node, create a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest for each target node. The Kubernetes NMState Operator applies the policy to each node with a defined NNCP in an unspecified order. Scoping a policy with this approach reduces the length of time for policy application but risks a cluster-wide outage if an error exists in the cluster's configuration. To avoid this type of error, initially apply an NNCP to some nodes, confirm the NNCP is configured correctly for these nodes, and then proceed with applying the policy to the remaining nodes.

* When you need to apply a policy to many nodes but you only want to create a single NNCP for all the nodes, the Kubernetes NMState Operator applies the policy to each node in sequence. You can set the speed and coverage of policy application for target nodes with the `maxUnavailable` parameter in the cluster's configuration file. By setting a lower percentage value for the parameter, you can reduce the risk of a cluster-wide outage if the outage impacts the small percentage of nodes that are receiving the policy application.

* Consider specifying all related network configurations in a single policy.

* When a node restarts, the Kubernetes NMState Operator cannot control the order to which it applies policies to nodes. The Kubernetes NMState Operator might apply interdependent policies in a sequence that results in a degraded network object.
