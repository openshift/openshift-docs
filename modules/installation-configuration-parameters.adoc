[id="installation-configuration-parameters_{context}"]
= Installation configuration parameters

Before you deploy an {product-title} cluster, you provide parameter values to
describe your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and optionally customize your
cluster's platform. When you create the `install-config.yaml` installation
configuration file, you provide values for the required parameters through the
command line. If you customize your cluster, you can modify the
`install-config.yaml` file to provide more details about the platform.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot modify these parameters after installation.

|====
|Parameter|Description|Values

|`baseDomain`
|The base domain of your cloud provider. This value is used to create routes
to your {product-title} cluster components. The full DNS name for your cluster
is a combination of the `baseDomain` and `metadata.name` parameter values that
uses the `<metadata.name>.<baseDomain>` format.
|A fully-qualified domain or subdomain name, such as `example.com`.

|`controlPlane.platform`
|The cloud provider to host the control plane machines. This parameter value
must match the `compute.platform` parameter value.
|`aws`

|`compute.platform`
|The cloud provider to host the worker machines. This parameter value
must match the `controlPlane.platform` parameter value.
|`aws`

|`metadata.name`
|The name of your cluster.
|A string that contains uppercase or lowercase letters, such as `dev`.

|`platform.aws.region`
|The region to deploy your cluster in.
|A valid AWS region, such as `us-east-1`.

|`pullSecret`
|The pull secret that you obtained from the
link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull Secret] page on the {cloud-redhat-com} site.
You use this pull secret to authenticate with the services that are
provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the
container images for {product-title} components.

.Optional AWS platform parameters
[cols=".^2,.^3a,.^3a",options="header"]
|====
|Parameter|Description|Values

|`sshKey`
|The SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation
debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide an SSH key that your `ssh-agent`
process uses to the installation program.
====
|A valid, local public SSH key that you added to the `ssh-agent` process.

|`compute.hyperthreading`
|Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or `hyperthreading`
on compute machines. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled
to increase the performance of your machines' cores.
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning
accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.
====
|`Enabled` or `Disabled`

|`compute.platform.aws.rootVolume.iops`
|The Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) that is reserved for the root volume.
|Integer, for example `4000`.

|`compute.platform.aws.rootVolume.size`
|The size in GiB of the root volume.
|Integer, for example `500`.

|`compute.platform.aws.rootVolume.type`
|The instance type of the root volume.
|Valid link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html[AWS EBS instance type],
such as `io1`.

|`compute.platform.aws.type`
|The EC2 instance type for the compute machines.
|Valid link:https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/[AWS instance type],
such as `c5.9xlarge`.

|`compute.platform.aws.zones`
|The availability zones where the installation program creates machines for the
compute MachinePool.
|A list of valid AWS availability zones, such as `us-east-1c`, in a
link:https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#sequence//[YAML sequence].

|`compute.aws.region`
|The AWS region that the installation program creates compute resources in.
|Valid link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html[AWS region],
such as `us-east-1`.

|`compute.replicas`
|The number of compute machines, which are also known as worker machines, to provision.
|A positive integer greater than or equal to `2`. The default value is `3`.

|`controlPlane.hyperthreading`
|Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or `hyperthreading`
on control plane machines. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled
to increase the performance of your machines' cores.
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning
accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.

|`Enabled` or `Disabled`

|`controlPlane.platform.aws.type`

such as `c5.9xlarge`.

|`controlPlane.platform.aws.zones`
|The availability zones where the installation program creates machines for the

|`controlPlane.replicas`
|The number of control plane machines to provision.
|A positive integer greater than or equal to `3`. The default value is `3`.

|`platform.aws.userTags`
|A map of keys and values that the installation program adds as tags to all
resources that it creates.
|Any valid YAML map, such as key value pairs in the `<key>: <value>` format.
For more information about AWS tags,
