[id='installation-configuration-parameters-{context}']
= Installation configuration parameters

Before you deploy a {product-title} cluster, you provide parameter values to
describe your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and optionally customize your
cluster's platform. When you create the `install-config.yaml` installation
configuration file, you provide values for the required parameters through the
command line. If you customize your cluster, you can modify the
`install-config.yaml` file to provide more details about the platform.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot modify these parameters after installation.
