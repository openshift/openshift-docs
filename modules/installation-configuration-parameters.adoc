[id="installation-configuration-parameters_{context}"]
= Installation configuration parameters

Before you deploy an {product-title} cluster, you provide parameter values to describe your account on the cloud platform that hosts your cluster and optionally customize your cluster's platform. When you create the `install-config.yaml` installation configuration file, you provide values for the required parameters through the command line. If you customize your cluster, you can modify the `install-config.yaml` file to provide more details about the platform.

[NOTE]
====
After installation, you cannot modify these parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file.
