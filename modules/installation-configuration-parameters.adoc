[id="installation-configuration-parameters_{context}"]
= Installation configuration parameters

Before you deploy an {product-title} cluster, you provide parameter values to
describe your account on the cloud platform that hosts your cluster
and optionally customize your
cluster's platform. When you create the `install-config.yaml` installation
configuration file, you provide values for the required parameters through the
command line. If you customize your cluster, you can modify the
`install-config.yaml` file to provide more details about the platform.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot modify these parameters after installation.

.Required parameters
[cols=".^2,.^3,.^5a",options="header"]
|====
|Parameter|Description|Values

|`baseDomain`
|The base domain of your cloud provider. This value is used to create routes
to your {product-title} cluster components. The full DNS name for your cluster
is a combination of the `baseDomain` and `metadata.name` parameter values that
uses the `<metadata.name>.<baseDomain>` format.
|A fully-qualified domain or subdomain name, such as `example.com`.

|`controlPlane.platform`
|The cloud provider to host the control plane machines. This parameter value
must match the `compute.platform` parameter value.
|`aws`, `azure`, or `gcp`

|`compute.platform`
|The cloud provider to host the worker machines. This parameter value
must match the `controlPlane.platform` parameter value.
|`aws`, `azure`, or `gcp`

|`metadata.name`
|The name of your cluster.
|A string that contains uppercase or lowercase letters, such as `dev`.

|`platform.<platform>.region`
|The region to deploy your cluster in.
|A valid region for your cloud, such as `us-east-1` for AWS or `centralus`
for Azure.

|`pullSecret`
|The pull secret that you obtained from the
link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install[OpenShift Infrastructure Providers] page.
You use this pull secret to authenticate with the services that are
provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the
container images for {product-title} components.

.Optional parameters
[cols=".^2,.^3a,.^3a",options="header"]
|====
|Parameter|Description|Values

|`sshKey`
|The SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation
debugging or disaster recovery on, you must provide an SSH key that your `ssh-agent`
process uses to the installation program.
====
|A valid, local public SSH key that you added to the `ssh-agent` process.

|`compute.hyperthreading`
|Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or `hyperthreading`,
on compute machines. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled
to increase the performance of your machines' cores.
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning
accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.
====
|`Enabled` or `Disabled`

|`compute.replicas`
|The number of compute, or worker, machines to provision.
|A positive integer greater than or equal to `2`. The default value is `3`.

|`controlPlane.hyperthreading`
|Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or `hyperthreading`,
on control plane machines. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled
to increase the performance of your machines' cores.
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning
accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.
====
|`Enabled` or `Disabled`

|`controlPlane.replicas`
|The number of control plane machines to provision.
|A positive integer greater than or equal to `3`. The default value is `3`.
