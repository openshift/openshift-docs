You can customize your installation configuration based on the requirements of your existing network infrastructure. For example, you can expand the IP address block for the cluster network or provide different IP address blocks than the defaults.

// OSDOCS-1640 - IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack bare metal only
// But only for installer-provisioned
// https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2020416
// Once BM UPI supports dual-stack, uncomment all the following conditionals and blocks

* If you use the {openshift-networking} OpenShift SDN network plugin, only the IPv4 address family is supported.

ifdef::ibm-cloud[]
[NOTE]
====

endif::ibm-cloud[]

ifdef::vsphere[]
[NOTE]

endif::vsphere[]

If you configure your cluster to use both IP address families, review the following requirements:

* Both IP families must use the same network interface for the default gateway.

* Both IP families must have the default gateway.

* You must specify IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same order for all network configuration parameters. For example, in the following configuration IPv4 addresses are listed before IPv6 addresses.
