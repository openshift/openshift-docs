= Checking journal logs after updates

In some cases, {microshift-short} might fail to update. In these events, it is helpful to understand failure types and how to troubleshoot them. The journal logs can assist in diagnosing update failures.

[NOTE]
====
The default configuration of the `systemd` journal service stores data in a volatile directory. To persist system logs across system starts and restarts, enable log persistence and set limits on the maximum journal data size.

.Procedure

* Get comprehensive {microshift-short} journal logs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl -u microshift
----

* Check the Greenboot journal logs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl -u greenboot-healthcheck
----

* Examining the comprehensive logs of a specific boot uses three steps. First list the boots, then select the one you want from the list you obtained:

** List the boots present in the journal logs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl --list-boots

[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl --boot <-my_boot_ID> <1>
----
<1> Replace _<-my-boot-ID>_ with the number assigned to the specific boot that you want to check.

** Check the journal logs for the boot of a specific service by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl --boot <-my_boot_ID> -u <service_name> <1> <2>
----
<1> Replace _<-my-boot-ID>_ with the number assigned to the specific boot that you want to check.
