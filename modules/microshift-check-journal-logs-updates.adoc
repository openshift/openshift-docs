[id="microshift-check-journal-logs-updates_{context}"]
= Checking journal logs after updates

In some cases, {microshift-short} might fail to update. In these events, it is helpful to understand failure types and how to troubleshoot them. The journal logs can assist in diagnosing update failures.

[NOTE]
====
The default configuration of the `systemd` journal service stores data in a volatile directory. To persist system logs across system starts and restarts, enable log persistence and set limits on the maximum journal data size.

.Procedure

* Check the {microshift-short} journal logs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl -u microshift
----

* Check the Greenboot journal logs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl -u greenboot-healthcheck
----

* Check the journal logs for a boot of a specific service by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl --boot <boot> -u <service-name>
----

* Examining the comprehensive logs of a specific boot uses two steps. First list the boots, then select the one you want from the list you obtained:

** List the boots present in the journal logs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl --list-boots
----

** Check the journal logs for the boot you want by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl --boot <-my-boot-number>
----
