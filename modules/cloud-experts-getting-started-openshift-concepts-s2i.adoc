= Source-to-Image (S2I)

[role="_abstract"]
Source-to-Image (S2I) is a toolkit and workflow for building reproducible container images from source code. S2I produces ready-to-run images by inserting source code into a container image and letting the container prepare the source code. By creating self-assembling builder images, you can version and control your build environments exactly like you use container images to version your runtime environments.

== How it works

For a dynamic language such as Ruby, the build time and run time environments are typically the same. Assuming that Ruby, Bundler, Rake, Apache, GCC, and all other packages needed to set up and run a Ruby application are already installed, a builder image performs the following steps:

. The builder image starts a container with the application source injected into a known directory.

. The container process transforms that source code into the appropriate runnable setup. For example, it installs dependencies with Bundler and moves the source code into a directory where Apache has been preconfigured to look for the Ruby configuration file.

. It then commits the new container and sets the image entrypoint to be a script that will start Apache to host the Ruby application.

For compiled languages such as C, C++, Go, or Java, the necessary dependencies for compilation might outweigh the size of the runtime artifacts. To keep runtime images small, S2I enables a multiple-step build process, where a binary artifact such as an executable file is created in the first builder image, extracted, and injected into a second runtime image that simply places the executable program in the correct location.

For example, to create a reproducible build pipeline for Tomcat and Maven:

. Create a builder image containing OpenJDK and Tomcat that expects to have a WAR file injected.

. Create a second image that layers on top of the first image Maven and any other standard dependencies, and expects to have a Maven project injected.

. Start S2I using the Java application source and the Maven image to create the desired application WAR.

. Start S2I a second time using the WAR file from the earlier step and the initial Tomcat image to create the runtime image.

By placing build logic inside of images and combining the images into multiple steps, the runtime environment is close to the build environment without requiring the deployment of build tools to production.

== S2I benefits

Reproducibility::
Allow build environments to be tightly versioned by encapsulating them within a container image and defining a simple interface of injected source code for callers. Reproducible builds are a key requirement for enabling security updates and continuous integration in containerized infrastructure, and builder images help ensure repeatability and the ability to swap run times.

Flexibility::
Any existing build system that can run on Linux can run inside of a container, and each individual builder can also be part of a larger pipeline. The scripts that process the application source code can be injected into the builder image, allowing authors to adapt existing images to enable source handling.

Speed::
Instead of building multiple layers in a single Dockerfile, S2I encourages authors to represent an application in a single image layer. This saves time during creation and deployment and allows for better control over the output of the final image.

Security::
Dockerfiles are run without many of the normal operational controls of containers. They usually run as root and have access to the container network. S2I can control what permissions and privileges are available to the builder image since the build is launched in a single container. In concert with platforms like OpenShift, S2I allows administrators to control what privileges developers have at build time.
