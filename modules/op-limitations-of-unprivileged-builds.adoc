= Limitations of unprivileged builds

The process for unprivileged builds works with most `Dockerfile` objects. However, there are some known limitations might cause a build to fail:

* Using the `--mount=type=cache` option might fail due to lack of necessay permissions issues. For more information, see this link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6969529[article].
* Using the `--mount=type=secret` option fails because mounting resources requires additionnal capabilities that are not provided by the custom SCC.
