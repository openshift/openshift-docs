= Limitations of unprivileged builds

[role="_abstract"]
The process for unprivileged builds works with most `Dockerfile` objects. However, there are some known limitations might cause a build to fail: 

* Using the `--mount=type=cache` option might fail due to lack of necessary permissions issues. For more information, see this link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6969529[article].
* Using the `--mount=type=secret` option fails because mounting resources requires additional capabilities that are not provided by the custom SCC.
