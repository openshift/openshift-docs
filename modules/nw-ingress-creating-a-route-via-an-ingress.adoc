= Creating a route through an Ingress object

Some ecosystem components have an integration with Ingress resources but not with
route resources. To cover this case, {product-title} automatically creates
managed route objects when an Ingress object is created. These route objects are deleted
when the corresponding Ingress objects are deleted.

.Procedure

. Define an Ingress object in the {product-title} console or by entering the oc `create` command:

<1> The `route.openshift.io/termination` annotation can be used to configure the `spec.tls.termination` field of the `Route`
as `Ingress` has no field for this. The accepted values are `edge`, `passthrough` and `reencrypt`. All
other values are silently ignored. When unset, `edge` is used.

The result includes an autogenerated route whose name starts with `frontend-`:
