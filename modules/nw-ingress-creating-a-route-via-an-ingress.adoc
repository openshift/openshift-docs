= Creating a route through an Ingress object

Some ecosystem components have an integration with Ingress resources but not with route resources. To cover this case, {product-title} automatically creates managed route objects when an Ingress object is created. These route objects are deleted when the corresponding Ingress objects are deleted.

.Procedure

. Define an Ingress object in the {product-title} console or by entering the `oc create` command:

<1> The `route.openshift.io/termination` annotation can be used to configure the `spec.tls.termination` field of the `Route` as `Ingress` has  no field for this. The accepted values are `edge`, `passthrough` and `reencrypt`. All other values are silently ignored. When  the annotation value is unset, `edge` is the default route. The TLS certificate details must be defined in the template file to implement the default edge route.
<2> When working with an `Ingress` object, you must specify an explicit hostname, unlike when working with routes. You can use the `<host_name>.<cluster_ingress_domain>` syntax, for example `apps.openshiftdemos.com`, to take advantage of the `*.<cluster_ingress_domain>` wildcard DNS record and serving certificate for the cluster. Otherwise, you must ensure that there is a DNS record for the chosen hostname.

.. If you specify the `passthrough` value in the `route.openshift.io/termination` annotation, set `path` to `''` and `pathType` to `ImplementationSpecific` in the spec:

                number: 443

$ oc apply -f ingress.yaml

<3> The `route.openshift.io/destination-ca-certificate-secret` can be used on an Ingress object to define a route with a custom destination certificate (CA). The annotation references a kubernetes secret, `secret-ca-cert` that will be inserted into the generated route.

.. To specify a route object with a destination CA from an ingress object, you must create a `kubernetes.io/tls` or `Opaque` type secret with a certificate in PEM-encoded format in the `data.tls.crt` specifier of the secret.

. List your routes:
