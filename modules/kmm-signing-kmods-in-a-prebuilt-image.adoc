[id="kmm-signing-kmods-in-a-prebuilt-image_{context}"]
= Signing kmods in a pre-built image

Use this procedure if you have a pre-built image, such as an image either distributed by a hardware vendor or built elsewhere.

The following YAML file adds the public/private key-pair as secrets with the required key names - `key` for the private key, `cert` for the public key. The cluster then pulls down the `unsignedImage` image, opens it, signs the kernel modules listed in `filesToSign`, adds them back, and pushes the resulting image as `containerImage`.

KMM then loads the signed kmods onto all the nodes with that match the selector. The kmods are successfully loaded on any nodes that have the public key in their MOK database, and any nodes that are not secure-boot enabled, which will ignore the signature.

.Prerequisites

* The `keySecret` and `certSecret` secrets have been created in the same namespace as the rest of the resources.

.Procedure

* Apply the YAML file:
