[id="starting-a-task-run-with-custom-config-map-or-a-pipeline-run_{context}"]
= Starting a task run with custom config map, or a pipeline run

After defining the custom Buildah cluster task, you can create a `TaskRun` object that builds an image as a `build` user with user id `1000`. In addition, you can integrate the `TaskRun` object as part of a `PipelineRun` object.

.Procedure

. Create a `TaskRun` object with a custom `ConfigMap` and `Dockerfile` objects.

.Example: A task run that runs Buildah as user id `1000`

<1> Use a config map because the focus is on the task run, without any prior task that fetches some sources with a Dockerfile.
<2> The name of the service account that you created.
<3> Mount a config map as the source workspace for the `buildah-as-user` task.

. (Optional) Create a pipeline and a corresponding pipeline run.

<1> Use the `git-clone` cluster task to fetch the source containing a Dockerfile and build it using the modified Buildah task.
<2> Refer to the modified Buildah task.
<3> Use the service account that you created for the Buildah task.
<4> Share data between the `git-clone` task and the modified Buildah task using a persistent volume claim (PVC) created automatically by the controller.

. Start the task run or the pipeline run.
