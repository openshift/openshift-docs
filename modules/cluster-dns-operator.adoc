= DNS Operator

[discrete]
== Purpose

The DNS Operator deploys and manages CoreDNS to provide a name resolution
service to Pods that enables DNS-based Kubernetes Service discovery in
{product-title}.

The Operator creates a working default deployment based on the cluster's configuration.

* The default cluster domain is `cluster.local`.
* Configuration of the CoreDNS Corefile or Kubernetes plug-in is not yet supported.

The DNS Operator manages CoreDNS as a Kubernetes DaemonSet exposed as a service
with a static IP. CoreDNS runs on all nodes in the cluster.
