= Setting a scrape sample limit for user-defined projects

You can limit the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects.

[WARNING]
====
If you set a sample limit, no further sample data is ingested for that target scrape after the limit is reached.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

. Add the `enforcedSampleLimit` configuration to `data.config.yaml` to limit the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      enforcedSampleLimit: 50000 <1>
----
<1> A value is required if this parameter is specified. This `enforcedSampleLimit` example limits the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects to 50,000.

. Save the file to apply the changes. The limit is applied automatically.
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object, the pods and other resources in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
