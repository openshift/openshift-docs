= Running the scorecard

.Prerequisites

The following prerequisites for the Operator project are checked by the
scorecard tool:

* Access to a cluster running Kubernetes 1.11.3 or later.
* If you want to use the scorecard to check the integration of your Operator
project with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), then a ClusterServiceVersion
(CSV) file is also required. This is a requirement when the `olm-deployed`
option is used.
* For Operators that were not generated using the Operator SDK (non-SDK
Operators):
** Resource manifests for installing and configuring the Operator and CRs.

See the
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v0.15.0/doc/test-framework/writing-e2e-tests.md[Writing E2E Tests]
guide for more information on the global and namespaced manifests.

** Configuration getter that supports reading from the `KUBECONFIG` environment
variable, such as the `clientcmd` or `controller-runtime` configuration getters.
This is required for the scorecard proxy to work correctly.

.Procedure

. Define a `.osdk-scorecard.yaml` configuration file in your Operator project.
. Create the namespace defined in the RBAC files (`role_binding`).
. Run the scorecard from the root directory of your Operator project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk scorecard
----
+
The scorecard return code is `1` if any of the executed texts did not pass and
`0` if all selected tests passed.
