= Viewing Operator Subscription status using the CLI

You can view Operator Subscription status using the CLI.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. List Operator Subscriptions:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get subs -n <operator_namespace>
----

. Use the `oc describe` command to inspect a Subscription resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe sub <subscription_name> -n <operator_namespace>
----

. In the command output, find the `Conditions` section for the status of Operator subscription condition types. In the following example, the `CatalogSourcesUnhealthy` condition type has a status of `false` because all available catalog sources are healthy:
+
.Example output

are managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and they have a Subscription
object.
