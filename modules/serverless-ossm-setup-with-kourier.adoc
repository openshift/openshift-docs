= Integrating {SMProductShortName} with {ServerlessProductName} when Kourier is enabled

You can use {SMProductShortName} with {ServerlessProductName} even if Kourier is already enabled. This procedure might be useful if you have already installed Knative Serving with Kourier enabled, but decide to add a {SMProductShortName} integration later.

.Prerequisites

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster administrator access.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster or dedicated administrator access.
endif::[]

* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Install the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving on your cluster.
* Install {SMProductName}. {ServerlessProductName} with {SMProductShortName} and Kourier is supported for use with both {SMProductName} versions 1.x and 2.x.

.Procedure

. Add the namespaces that you would like to integrate with {SMProductShortName} to the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` object as members:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  members:
    - <namespace> <1>
...
----
<1> A list of namespaces to be integrated with {SMProductShortName}.
. Apply the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

. Create a network policy that permits traffic flow from Knative system pods to Knative services:
.. For each namespace that you want to integrate with {SMProductShortName}, create a `NetworkPolicy` resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-serving-system-namespace
  namespace: <namespace> <1>
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          knative.openshift.io/part-of: "openshift-serverless"
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
...
----
<1> Add the namespace that you want to integrate with {SMProductShortName}.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `knative.openshift.io/part-of: "openshift-serverless"` label was added in {ServerlessProductName} 1.22.0. If you are using {ServerlessProductName} 1.21.1 or earlier, add the `knative.openshift.io/part-of` label to the `knative-serving` and `knative-serving-ingress` namespaces.

Add the label to the `knative-serving` namespace:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label namespace knative-serving knative.openshift.io/part-of=openshift-serverless
----

Add the label to the `knative-serving-ingress` namespace:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label namespace knative-serving-ingress knative.openshift.io/part-of=openshift-serverless
----
====
.. Apply the `NetworkPolicy` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----
