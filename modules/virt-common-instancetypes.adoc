= Pre-defined instance types

{VirtProductName} includes a set of pre-defined instance types called `common-instancetypes`. Some are specialized for specific workloads and others are workload-agnostic.

These instance type resources are named according to their series, version, and size. The size value follows the `.` delimiter and ranges from `nano` to `8xlarge`.
