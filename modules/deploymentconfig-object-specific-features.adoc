[id="deploymentconfig-object-specific-features-automatic-rollbacks_{context}"]
== Automatic rollbacks

Currently, deployments do not support automatically rolling back to the last successfully deployed replica set in case of a failure.

[id="deploymentconfig-object-specific-features-triggers_{context}"]
== Triggers

Deployments have an implicit config change trigger in that every change in the pod template of a deployment automatically triggers a new rollout.
If you do not want new rollouts on pod template changes, pause the deployment:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout pause deployments/<name>
----
