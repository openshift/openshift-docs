[id="hcp-get-upgrade-versions_{context}"]
= Updating the {product-title} version in a hosted cluster

{hcp-capital} enables the decoupling of updates between the control plane and the data plane.

As a cluster service provider or cluster administrator, you can manage the control plane and the data separately.

You can update a control plane by modifying the `HostedCluster` custom resource (CR) and a node by modifying its `NodePool` CR. Both the `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` CRs specify an {product-title} release image in a `.release` field.

To keep your hosted cluster fully operational during an update process, the control plane and the node updates must follow the link:https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/[Kubernetes version skew policy].

[id="hcp-mce-hub-cluster_{context}"]
== The {mce-short} hub management cluster

The {mce} requires a specific {product-title} version for the management cluster to remain in a supported state. You can install the {mce-short} from OperatorHub in the {product-title} web console.

See the following support matrices for the {mce-short} versions:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7086906[{mce-short} 2.7]
* link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7073030[{mce-short} 2.6]
* link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7056007[{mce-short} 2.5]
* link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7027079[{mce-short} 2.4]

The {mce-short} supports the following {product-title} versions:

* The latest unreleased version
* The latest released version
* Two versions before the latest released version

You can also get the {mce-short} version as a part of {rh-rhacm-first}.

[id="hcp-supported-ocp-versions_{context}"]
== Supported {product-title} versions in a hosted cluster

When deploying a hosted cluster, the {product-title} version of the management cluster does not affect the {product-title} version of a hosted cluster.

The HyperShift Operator creates the `supported-versions` ConfigMap in the `hypershift` namespace. The `supported-versions` ConfigMap describes the range of supported {product-title} versions that you can deploy.

See the following example of the `supported-versions` ConfigMap:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
    server-version: 2f6cfe21a0861dea3130f3bed0d3ae5553b8c28b
    supported-versions: '{"versions":["4.17","4.16","4.15","4.14"]}'
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
    creationTimestamp: "2024-06-20T07:12:31Z"
    labels:
        hypershift.openshift.io/supported-versions: "true"
    name: supported-versions
    namespace: hypershift
    resourceVersion: "927029"
    uid: f6336f91-33d3-472d-b747-94abae725f70

[IMPORTANT]
====
To create a hosted cluster, you must use the {product-title} version from the support version range. However, the {mce-short} can manage only between `n+1` and `n-2` {product-title} versions, where `n` defines the current minor version. You can check the {mce-short} support matrix to ensure the hosted clusters managed by the {mce-short} are within the supported {product-title} range.
====

To deploy a higher version of a hosted cluster on {product-title}, you must update the {mce-short} to a new minor version release to deploy a new version of the Hypershift Operator. Upgrading the {mce-short} to a new patch, or z-stream, release does not update the HyperShift Operator to the next version.

See the following example output of the `hcp version` command that shows the supported {product-title} versions for {product-title} 4.16 in the management cluster:

[source,terminal]
----
Client Version: openshift/hypershift: fe67b47fb60e483fe60e4755a02b3be393256343. Latest supported OCP: 4.17.0
Server Version: 05864f61f24a8517731664f8091cedcfc5f9b60d
