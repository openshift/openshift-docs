= Remote access kubeconfig files

When a {microshift-short} cluster connects to the API server from an external source, a certificate with all of the alternative names in the SAN field is used for validation. {microshift-short} generates a default `kubeconfig` for external access using the `hostname` value. The defaults are set in the `<node.hostnameOverride>`, `<node.nodeIP>` and `api.<dns.baseDomain>` parameter values of the default `kubeconfig` file.

The `/var/lib/microshift/resources/kubeadmin/<hostname>/kubeconfig` file uses the `hostname` of the machine, or `node.hostnameOverride` if that option is set, to reach the API server. The CA of the `kubeconfig` file is able to validate certificates when accessed externally.

== Remote access customization
Multiple remote access `kubeconfig` file values can be generated for accessing the cluster with different IP addresses or host names. An additional `kubeconfig` file generates for each entry in the `apiServer.subjectAltNames` parameter. You can copy remote access `kubeconfig` files from the host during times of IP connectivity and then use them to access the API server from other workstations.
