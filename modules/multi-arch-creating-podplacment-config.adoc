= Creating the ClusterPodPlacementConfig object

After installing the Multiarch Tuning Operator, you must create the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object.

[NOTE]
====
You can create only a single instance of the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object.
====

The `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object is used to enable or disable the pod placement operand of the Multiarch Tuning Operator. 

.Example `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: multiarch.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterPodPlacementConfig
metadata:
  name: cluster <1>
spec:
  logVerbosityLevel: Normal <2>
  namespaceSelector: <3>
    matchExpressions:
      - key: multiarch.openshift.io/exclude-pod-placement 
        operator: DoesNotExist 
----
<1> You must set this field value to `cluster`. 
<2> Optional: You can set the field value to `Normal`, `Debug`, `Trace`, or `TraceAll`. The value is set to `Normal` by default. 
<3> Optional: You can configure the `namespaceSelector` to select the namespaces in which the Multiarch Tuning Operator's pod placement operand must process the `nodeAffinity` of the pods. All namespaces are considered by default.

In this example, the `operator` field value is set to `DoesNotExist`. Therefore, if the `key` field value (`multiarch.openshift.io/exclude-pod-placement`) is set as a label in a namespace, the operand does not process the `nodeAffinity` of the pods in that namespace. Instead, the operand processes the `nodeAffinity` of the pods in namespaces that do not contain the label.

If you want the operand to process the `nodeAffinity` of the pods only in specific namespaces, you can configure the `namespaceSelector` as follows:
[source,yaml]
----
namespaceSelector:
  matchExpressions:
    - key: multiarch.openshift.io/include-pod-placement
      operator: Exists  
----

In this example, the `operator` field value is set to `Exists`. Therefore, the operand processes the `nodeAffinity` of the pods only in namespaces that contain the `multiarch.openshift.io/include-pod-placement` label. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
The namespaces starting with `openshift-`, `kube-`, and `hypershift-` are excluded.
