= Running a simple OCP installation

From the user perspective, the process of starting up an OpenShift 4 cluster can be as simple as:

* Setting up a platform to run OpenShift. For example, an AWS account with DNS configured.
* Downloading the openshift-install CLI tool to your laptop or other personal computer.
* Starting the installer, providing a few key pieces of information.
* Waiting for a short period of time (possible only about 30 minutes, depending on the available resources) for the install to complete.

When the installation is complete, the results of a default installation are:

* A six-node cluster is up and running on your selected platform, consisting of three master (control plane) nodes and three worker (compute) nodes
* A set of credentials, presented by the openshift-install process, that provides you with:
* Console access: Log into the OpenShift web console from your browser to use and administer your new OpenShift cluster.
* Command-line access: Run the oc login command to access your new OpenShift cluster from the command line, to do everything from managing your cluster to building and deploying applications. Binaries of the oc CLI are https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/&sa=D&ust=1557950770623000[available for download].
