= Mirroring from disk-to-mirror

You can use the oc-mirror plugin v1 to mirror the contents of a generated image set to the target mirror registry.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) in the disconnected environment.
* You have installed the `oc-mirror` CLI plugin v1 in the disconnected environment.
* You have generated the image set file by using the `oc mirror` command.
* You have access to the target mirror registry.
* You have transferred the image set file to the disconnected environment.
* You have set the umask parameter to `0022` on the operating system that uses oc-mirror plugin v1.
// TODO: Confirm prereq about not needing a cluster, but need pull secret misc

.Procedure

* Run the `oc mirror` command to process the image set file on disk and mirror the contents to a target mirror registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror --from=./mirror_seq1_000000.tar \// <1>
  docker://registry.example:5000             <2>
----
<1> Pass in the image set `.tar` file to mirror, named `mirror_seq1_000000.tar` in this example. If an `archiveSize` value was specified in the image set configuration file, the image set might be broken up into multiple `.tar` files. In this situation, you can pass in a directory that contains the image set `.tar` files.
<2> Specify the registry to mirror the image set file to. The registry must start with `docker://`. If you specify a top-level namespace for the mirror registry, you must also use this same namespace on subsequent executions.
+
[NOTE]
====
The generated image sets follow a sequential order and must be pushed to the target mirror registry accordingly. You can determine the sequence number from the file name of the generated image set archive file.
====
+
This command updates the mirror registry with the image set and generates the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` and `CatalogSource` resources.

.Verification

. Navigate into the `oc-mirror-workspace/` directory that was generated.
. Navigate into the results directory, for example, `results-1639608409/`.
. Verify that YAML files are present for the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` and `CatalogSource` resources.
+
// TODO: Test and get some better wording/example output.

.Next steps

* Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror.
