= Adding a real-time kernel to nodes (during installation)

Some {product-title} workloads require a high degree of determinism.
While Linux is not a real-time operating system, the Linux real-time
kernel includes a preemptive scheduler that provides the operating
system with real-time characteristics.

If your {product-title} workloads require these real-time characteristics,
you can set up your compute (worker) and/or control plane machines to use the
Linux real-time kernel when you first install the cluster. To do this,
create a `MachineConfig` object and inject that object into the set of manifest
files used by Ignition during cluster setup, as described in the following
procedure.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure is fully supported with bare metal installations using
systems that are certified for Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Real Time 8.
Real time support in {product-title} is also limited to specific subscriptions.
This procedure is also supported for use with Google Cloud Platform.
====

.Prerequisites
* For a bare metal installation of {product-title}, prepare masters and workers.
* Use {product-title} version 4.4 or later.

.Procedure

. Create the `intall-config.yaml` file using the installer or prepare it manually.
To create it using installer, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory>
----

. Generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
----

. Decide if you want to add the real-time kernel to worker or control plane nodes.

. In the `openshift` directory, create a file (for example,
`99-worker-realtime.yaml`) to define a `MachineConfig` object that applies a
real-time kernel to the selected nodes (worker nodes in this case):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF > 99-worker-realtime.yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "worker"
  name: 99-worker-realtime
spec:
  kernelType: realtime
EOF
----
+
You can change `worker` to `master` to add kernel arguments to control plane nodes instead.
Create a separate YAML file to add to both master and worker nodes.

. Create the cluster.  You can now continue on to create the {product-title} cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory>
----

. Check the real-time kernel: Once the cluster comes up, log in to the cluster
and run the following commands to make sure that the real-time kernel has
replaced the regular kernel for the set of worker or control plane nodes you
configured:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
