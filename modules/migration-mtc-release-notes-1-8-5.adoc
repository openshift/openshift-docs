[id="known-issues-1-8-5_{context}"]
== Known issues

{mtc-short} 1.8.5 has the following known issues:

.The associated SCC for service account cannot be migrated in {OCP} 4.12

The associated Security Context Constraints (SCCs) for service accounts in {OCP} 4.12 cannot be migrated. This issue is planned to be resolved in a future release of {mtc-short}. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIG-1454[(MIG-1454)]

.{mtc-short} does not patch `statefulset.spec.volumeClaimTemplates[].spec.storageClassName` on storage class conversion

While running a Storage Class conversion for a StatefulSet application, {mtc-short} updates the persistent volume claims (PVC) references in `.spec.volumeClaimTemplates[].metadata.name` to use the migrated PVC names. {mtc-short} does not update `spec.volumeClaimTemplates[].spec.storageClassName`, which causes the application to scale up. Additionally, new replicas consume PVCs created under the old Storage Class instead of the migrated Storage Class. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIG-1660[(MIG-1660)]

.Performing a StorageClass conversion triggers the scale-down of all applications in the namespace

When running a `StorageClass` conversion on more than one application, {mtc-short} scales down all the applications in the cutover phase, including those not involved in the migration. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIG-1661[(MIG-1661)]

.`MigPlan` cannot be edited to have the same target namespace as the source cluster after it is changed

After changing the target namespace to something different from the source namespace while creating a `MigPlan` in the {mtc-short} UI, you cannot edit the `MigPlan` again to make the target namespace the same as the source namespace. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIG-1600[(MIG-1600)]


.Migrated builder pod fails to push to the image registry

When migrating an application that includes `BuildConfig` from the source to the target cluster, the builder pod encounters an error, failing to push the image to the image registry.
link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2234781[(BZ#2234781)]

.Conflict condition clears briefly after it is displayed

When creating a new state migration plan that results in a conflict error, the error is cleared shortly after it is displayed. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2144299[(BZ#2144299)]

.`PvCapacityAdjustmentRequired` warning not displayed after setting `pv_resizing_threshold`

The `PvCapacityAdjustmentRequired` warning does not appear in the migration plan after the `pv_resizing_threshold` is adjusted. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2270160[(BZ#2270160)]
