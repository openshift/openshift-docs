= Required changes to the Git repository

When upgrading from an earlier release to {product-title} 4.10, additional requirements are placed on the contents of the Git repository. Existing content in the repository must be updated to reflect these changes.

* Changes to `PolicyGenTemplate` files:
+
All `PolicyGenTemplate` files must be created in a `Namespace` prefixed with `ztp`. This ensures that the GitOps zero touch provisioning (ZTP) application is able to manage the policy CRs generated by GitOps ZTP without conflicting with the way {rh-rhacm-first} manages the policies internally.

* Remove the `pre-sync.yaml` and `post-sync.yaml` files:
+
This step is optional but recommended. When the `kustomization.yaml` files are added, the `pre-sync.yaml` and `post-sync.yaml` files are no longer used. They must be removed to avoid confusion and can potentially cause errors if kustomization files are inadvertantly removed. Note that there is a set of `pre-sync.yaml` and `post-sync.yaml` files under both the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` trees.

* Add the `kustomization.yaml` file to the repository:
+
All `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs must be included in a `kustomization.yaml` file under their respective directory trees. For example:
+
[source,terminal]

[NOTE]
====
The files listed in the `generator` sections must contain either `SiteConfig` or `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs only. If your existing YAML files contain other CRs, for example, `Namespace`, these other CRs must be pulled out into separate files and listed in the `resources` section.
====
+
The `PolicyGenTemplate` kustomization file must contain all `PolicyGenTemplate` YAML files in the `generator` section and `Namespace` CRs in the `resources` section. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

generators:
- common-ranGen.yaml
- group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml
- site1.yaml
- site2.yaml

resources:
- common-ns.yaml
- group-du-sno-ranGen-ns.yaml
- site1-ns.yaml
- site2-ns.yaml
----
+
The `SiteConfig` kustomization file must contain all `SiteConfig` YAML files in the `generator` section and any other CRs in the resources:
+
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

generators:
- site1.yaml
- site2.yaml

* Review and incorporate recommended changes
+
Each release may include additional recommended changes to the configuration applied to deployed clusters. Typically these changes result in lower CPU use by the OpenShift platform, additional features, or improved tuning of the platform.
+
Review the reference `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs applicable to the types of cluster in your network. These examples can be found in the `argocd/example` directory extracted from the GitOps ZTP container.
