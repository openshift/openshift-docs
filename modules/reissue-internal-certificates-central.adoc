= Reissuing internal certificates for Central

Central uses a built-in server certificate for authentication when communicating with other {product-title} services.
This certificate is unique to your Central installation.
The {product-title-short} portal shows an information banner when the Central certificate is about to expire.

[NOTE]
====
The information banner only appears 15 days before the certificate expiration date.
====

For Operator-based installations, beginning with {product-title-short} version 4.3.4, the Operator will automatically rotate all Central components' service transport layer security (TLS) certificates 6 months before they expire. The following conditions apply:

* The rotation of certificates in the secrets does not trigger the components to automatically reload them. However, reloads typically occur when the pod is replaced as part of an {product-title-short} upgrade or as a result of node reboots. If neither of those events happens at least every 6 months, you must restart the pods before the old (in-memory) service certificates expire. For example, you can delete the pods with an `app` label that contains one of the values of `central`, `central-db`, `scanner`, or `scanner-db`.

* CA certificates are not updated. They are valid for 5 years.

* The service certificates in the init bundles used by secured cluster components are not updated. You must rotate the init bundles at regular intervals.

For non-Operator based installations, you must manually rotate TLS certificates. Instructions for manually rotating certificates are included in the following section.

.Prerequisites

* To reissue, or rotate, certificates, you must have `write` permission for the `Administration` resource.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, click on the link in the banner that announces the certificate expiration to download a YAML configuration file, which contains a new secret. The secret includes the certificate and key values.
. Apply the new YAML configuration file to the cluster where you have installed Central by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <secret_file.yaml>
----
. Restart Central to apply the changes.
