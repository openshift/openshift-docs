= Querying metrics for all projects as a cluster administrator

As a cluster administrator or as a user with view permissions for all projects, you can access metrics for all default {product-title} and user-defined projects in the Metrics UI.

[NOTE]
====
Only cluster administrators have access to the third-party UIs provided with {product-title} Monitoring.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role or with view permissions for all projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective within the {product-title} web console, select *Monitoring* -> *Metrics*.

. Select *Insert Metric at Cursor* to view a list of predefined queries.

. To create a custom query, add your Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) query to the *Expression* field.

. To add multiple queries, select *Add Query*.

. To delete a query, select {kebab} next to the query, then choose *Delete query*.

. To disable a query from being run, select {kebab} next to the query and choose *Disable query*.

. Select *Run Queries* to run the queries that you have created. The metrics from the queries are visualized on the plot. If a query is invalid, the UI shows an error message.
+
[NOTE]
====
Queries that operate on large amounts of data might time out or overload the browser when drawing time series graphs. To avoid this, select *Hide graph* and calibrate your query using only the metrics table. Then, after finding a feasible query, enable the plot to draw the graphs.

. Optional: The page URL now contains the queries you ran. To use this set of queries again in the future, save this URL.

.Additional resources

* See the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/[Prometheus query documentation] for more information about creating PromQL queries.
