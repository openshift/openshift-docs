= Long-running requests

To ensure that requests exceeding the default 600 second timeout set by Knative are not prematurely terminated, you need to adjust the timeouts in the following components:

* {ocp-product-title} route
* {ServerlessProductName} Serving
* Load balancer, depending on the cloud provider

You can configure the timeouts globally or per revision. You can configure the timeouts globally if you have requests across all Knative services that need extended durations, or per revision for specific workloads that require different timeout values, such as AI deployments.
