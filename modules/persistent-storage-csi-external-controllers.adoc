= External CSI controllers

External CSI Controllers is a deployment that deploys one or more pods 
with three containers:

* An external CSI attacher container translates `attach` and `detach` 
calls from {product-title} to respective `ControllerPublish` and 
`ControllerUnpublish` calls to the CSI driver.
* An external CSI provisioner container that translates `provision` and 
`delete` calls from {product-title} to respective `CreateVolume` and 
`DeleteVolume` calls to the CSI driver.
* A CSI driver container

The CSI attacher and CSI provisioner containers communicate with the CSI 
driver container using UNIX Domain Sockets, ensuring that no CSI 
communication leaves the pod. The CSI driver is not accessible from 
outside of the pod.

[NOTE]
====
`attach`, `detach`, `provision`, and `delete` operations typically require 
the CSI driver to use credentials to the storage backend. Run the CSI 
controller pods on infrastructure nodes so the credentials are never leaked
to user processes, even in the event of a catastrophic security breach 
on a compute node.

[NOTE]
====
The external attacher must also run for CSI drivers that do not support 
third-party `attach` or `detach` operations. The external attacher will 
not issue any `ControllerPublish` or `ControllerUnpublish` operations to 
the CSI driver. However, it still must run to implement the necessary 
{product-title} attachment API.
