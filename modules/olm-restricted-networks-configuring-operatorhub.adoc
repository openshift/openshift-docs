= Mirroring an Operator catalog image

Cluster administrators can mirror their catalog's content into a registry and
use a CatalogSource to load the content onto an {product-title} cluster. For this
example, the procedure uses a custom `redhat-operators` catalog image previously
built and pushed to a supported registry.

= Configuring OperatorHub for restricted networks

Cluster administrators can configure OLM and OperatorHub to use local content in a restricted network environment using a custom Operator catalog image. For this example, the procedure uses a custom `redhat-operators` catalog image previously built and pushed to a supported registry.
endif::[]

.Prerequisites

* Workstation with unrestricted network access
* A custom Operator catalog image pushed to a supported registry
* `oc` version 4.3.5+
* `podman` version 1.4.4+
* Access to mirror registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]
* If you are working with private registries, set the `REG_CREDS` environment variable to the file path of your registry credentials for use in later steps. For example, for the `podman` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REG_CREDS=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json
----

.Procedure

ifeval::["{context}" == "olm-restricted-networks"]
. Disable the default `OperatorSource` objects by adding `disableAllDefaultSources: true` to the spec:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
    -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
----
+
This disables the default sources that are configured by default during an {product-title} installation.
endif::[]

. The `oc adm catalog mirror` command extracts the contents of your custom Operator catalog image to generate the manifests required for mirroring. You can choose to either:
+
--
* Allow the default behavior of the command to automatically mirror all of the image content to your mirror registry after generating manifests, or
* Add the `--manifests-only` flag to only generate the manifests required for mirroring, but do not actually mirror the image content to a registry yet. This can be useful for reviewing what will be mirrored, and it allows you to make any changes to the mapping list if you only require a subset of the content. You can then use that file with the `oc image mirror` command to mirror the modified list of images in a later step.
--
+
On your workstation with unrestricted network access, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror \
    <registry_host_name>:<port>/olm/redhat-operators:v1 \//<1>
    <registry_host_name>:<port> \
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \//<2>
    [--insecure] \//<3>
    [--filter-by-os="<os>/<arch>"] \//<4>
    [--manifests-only] <5>
----
<1> Specify your Operator catalog image.
<2> Optional: If required, specify the location of your registry credentials file.
<3> Optional: If you do not want to configure trust for the target registry, add the `--insecure` flag.
<4> Optional: Because the catalog might reference images that support multiple architectures and operating systems, you can filter by architecture and operating system to mirror only the images that match. Valid values are `linux/amd64`, `linux/ppc64le`, and `linux/s390x`.
<5> Optional: Only generate the manifests required for mirroring and do not actually mirror the image content to a registry.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
using database path mapping: /:/tmp/190214037
wrote database to /tmp/190214037
using database at: /tmp/190214037/bundles.db <1>
...
----
<1> Temporary database generated by the command.
+
After running the command, a `<image_name>-manifests/` directory is created in the current directory and generates the following files:
+
--
* The `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file defines an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object that can configure nodes to translate between the image references stored in Operator manifests and the mirrored registry.
* The `mapping.txt` file contains all of the source images and where to map them in the target registry. This file is compatible with the `oc image mirror` command and can be used to further customize the mirroring configuration.
--

. If you used the `--manifests-only` flag in the previous step and want to mirror only a subset of the content:

.. Modify the list of images in your `mapping.txt` file to your specifications. If you are unsure of the exact names and versions of the subset of images you want to mirror, use the following steps to find them:

... Run the `sqlite3` tool against the temporary database that was generated by the `oc adm catalog mirror` command to retrieve a list of images matching a general search query. The output helps inform how you will later edit your `mapping.txt` file.
+
For example, to retrieve a list of images that are similar to the string `clusterlogging.4.3`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo "select * from related_image \
    where operatorbundle_name like 'clusterlogging.4.3%';" \
    | sqlite3 -line /tmp/190214037/bundles.db <1>
----
<1> Refer to the previous output of the `oc adm catalog mirror` command to find the path of the database file.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
image = registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-logging-kibana5@sha256:aa4a8b2a00836d0e28aa6497ad90a3c116f135f382d8211e3c55f34fb36dfe61
operatorbundle_name = clusterlogging.4.3.33-202008111029.p0

image = registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-oauth-proxy@sha256:6b4db07f6e6c962fc96473d86c44532c93b146bbefe311d0c348117bf759c506
operatorbundle_name = clusterlogging.4.3.33-202008111029.p0
...
----

... Use the results from the previous step to edit the `mapping.txt` file to only include the subset of images you want to mirror.
+
For example, you can use the `image` values from the previous example output to find that the following matching lines exist in your `mapping.txt` file:
+
.Matching image mappings in `mapping.txt`
[source,txt]
----
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-logging-kibana5@sha256:aa4a8b2a00836d0e28aa6497ad90a3c116f135f382d8211e3c55f34fb36dfe61=<registry_host_name>:<port>/openshift4-ose-logging-kibana5:a767c8f0
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-oauth-proxy@sha256:6b4db07f6e6c962fc96473d86c44532c93b146bbefe311d0c348117bf759c506=<registry_host_name>:<port>/openshift4-ose-oauth-proxy:3754ea2b
----
+
In this example, if you only want to mirror these images, you would then remove all other entries in the `mapping.txt` file and leave only the above two lines.

.. Still on your workstation with unrestricted network access, use your modified `mapping.txt` file to mirror the images to your registry using the `oc image mirror` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror \
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \
    -f ./redhat-operators-manifests/mapping.txt
----

. Apply the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ./redhat-operators-manifests/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----

. Create a `CatalogSource` object that references your catalog image.

.. Modify the following to your specifications and save it as a `catalogsource.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: my-operator-catalog
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: <registry_host_name>:<port>/olm/redhat-operators:v1 <1>
  displayName: My Operator Catalog
  publisher: grpc
----
<1> Specify your custom Operator catalog image.

.. Use the file to create the `CatalogSource` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f catalogsource.yaml
----

. Verify the following resources are created successfully.

.. Check the pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-marketplace
----
+
.Example output

$ oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace

You can now install the Operators from the *OperatorHub* page on your restricted network {product-title} cluster web console.
