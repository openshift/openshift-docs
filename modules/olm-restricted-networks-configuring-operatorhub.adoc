= Configuring OperatorHub for restricted networks

Cluster administrators can configure OLM and OperatorHub to use local content in
restricted network environments.

.Prerequisites

* Cluster administrator access to an {product-title} cluster and its internal registry.
* Separate workstation without network restrictions.
* If pushing images to the {product-title} cluster's internal registry, the registry must be exposed with a route.
* `podman` version 1.5.1+

.Procedure

. **Disable the default OperatorSources.**
+
Add `disableAllDefaultSources: true` to the spec:
+
----
$ oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
    -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
----
+
This disables the default OperatorSources that are configured by default during
an {product-title} installation.

. **Retrieve package lists.**
+
To get the list of packages that are available for the default OperatorSources,
run the following `curl` commands from your workstation without network
restrictions:
+
----
$ curl https://quay.io/cnr/api/v1/packages?namespace=redhat-operators > packages.txt
$ curl https://quay.io/cnr/api/v1/packages?namespace=community-operators >> packages.txt
$ curl https://quay.io/cnr/api/v1/packages?namespace=certified-operators >> packages.txt
----
+
Each package in the new `packages.txt` is an Operator that you could add to your
restricted network catalog. From this list, you could either pull every Operator
or a subset that you would like to expose to users.

. **Pull Operator content.**
+
For a given Operator in the package list, you must pull its content:
+
----
$ curl https://quay.io/cnr/api/v1/packages/<namespace>/<operator_name>/<release>
----
+
This example uses the etcd Operator:

.. Retrieve the digest:
+
----
$ curl https://quay.io/cnr/api/v1/packages/community-operators/etcd/0.0.12
----

.. From that JSON, take the digest and use it to pull the gzipped archive:
+
----
$ curl -XGET https://quay.io/cnr/api/v1/packages/community-operators/etcd/blobs/sha256/8108475ee5e83a0187d6d0a729451ef1ce6d34c44a868a200151c36f3232822b \
    -o etcd.tar.gz
----

.. To pull the information out, you must untar the archive into a
`manifests/<operator_name>/` directory with all the other Operators that you
want. For example, to untar to an existing directory called `manifests/etcd/`:
+
----
$ mkdir -p manifests/etcd/ <1>
$ tar -xf etcd.tar.gz -C manifests/etcd/
----
<1> Create different subdirectories for each extracted archive so that files are not
overwritten by subsequent extractions for other Operators.

. *Break apart `bundle.yaml` content, if necessary.*
+
In your new `manifests/<operator_name>` directory, the goal is to get your bundle in the following directory structure:
+
----
manifests/
└── etcd
    ├── 0.0.12
    │   ├── clusterserviceversion.yaml
    │   └── customresourcedefinition.yaml
    └── package.yaml
----
+
If you see files already in this structure, you can skip this step. However, if
you instead see only a single file called `bundle.yaml`, you must first break
this file up to conform to the required structure.
+
You must separate the CSV content under `data.clusterServiceVersion` (each file
in the list), the CRD content under `data.customResourceDefinition` (each file
in the list), and the package content under `data.Package` into their own files.

.. For the CSV file creation, find the following lines in the `bundle.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
data:
  clusterServiceVersions: |
----
+
Omit those lines, but save a new file consisting of the full CSV resource
content beginning with the following lines, removing the prepended `-`
character:
+
[source,yaml]
.Example `clusterserviceversion.yaml` file snippet
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterServiceVersion
[...]
----

.. For the CRD file creation, find the following line in the `bundle.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  customResourceDefinitions: |
----
+
Omit this line, but save new files consisting of each, full CRD resource content
beginning with the following lines, removing the prepended `-` character:
+
[source,yaml]
.Example `customresourcedefinition.yaml` file snippet
----
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
[...]
----
+
.. For the package file creation, find the following line in the `bundle.yaml`
file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  packages: |
----
+
Omit this line, but save a new file consisting of the package content beginning
with the following lines, removing the prepended `-` character, and ending with
a `packageName` entry:
+
[source,yaml]
.Example `package.yaml` file
----
channels:
- currentCSV: etcdoperator.v0.9.4
  name: singlenamespace-alpha
- currentCSV: etcdoperator.v0.9.4-clusterwide
  name: clusterwide-alpha
defaultChannel: singlenamespace-alpha
packageName: etcd
----

. **Identify images required by the Operators you want to use.**
+
Inspect the CSV files of each Operator for `image:` fields to identify the pull
specs for any images required by the Operator, and note them for use in a later
step.
+
For example, in the following `deployments` spec of an etcd Operator CSV:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  spec:
   serviceAccountName: etcd-operator
   containers:
   - name: etcd-operator
     command:
     - etcd-operator
     - --create-crd=false
     image: quay.io/coreos/etcd-operator@sha256:bd944a211eaf8f31da5e6d69e8541e7cada8f16a9f7a5a570b22478997819943 <1>
     env:
     - name: MY_POD_NAMESPACE
       valueFrom:
         fieldRef:
           fieldPath: metadata.namespace
     - name: MY_POD_NAME
       valueFrom:
         fieldRef:
           fieldPath: metadata.name
----
<1> Image required by Operator.

. **Create an Operator catalog image.**

.. Save the following to a Dockerfile, for example named
`custom-registry.Dockerfile`:
+
[source,go]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-operator-registry:v4.2.8 AS builder

COPY manifests manifests

RUN /bin/initializer -o ./bundles.db

FROM quay.io/openshift/origin-base:4.2

COPY --from=builder /registry/bundles.db /bundles.db
COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/registry-server /registry-server
COPY --from=builder /bin/grpc_health_probe /bin/grpc_health_probe

EXPOSE 50051

ENTRYPOINT ["/registry-server"]

CMD ["--database", "bundles.db"]
----

.. Use the `podman` command to create and tag the container image from the
Dockerfile:
+
----
$ podman build -f custom-registry.Dockerfile \
    -t <local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>/<namespace>/custom-registry <1>
----
<1> Tag the image for the internal registry of the restricted network
{product-title} cluster and any namespace.

. **Push the Operator catalog image to a registry.**
+
Your new Operator catalog image must be pushed to a registry that the restricted
network {product-title} cluster can access. This can be the internal registry of
the cluster itself or another registry that the cluster has network access to,
such as an on-premise Quay Enterprise registry.
+
For this example, login and push the image to the internal registry
{product-title} cluster:
+
----
$ podman push <local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>/<namespace>/custom-registry
----

. **Create a CatalogSource pointing to the new Operator catalog image.**

.. Save the following to a file, for example `my-operator-catalog.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: my-operator-catalog
  namespace: default
spec:
  displayName: My Operator Catalog
  sourceType: grpc
  image: <local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>/<namespace>/custom-registry:latest
----

.. Create the CatalogSource resource:
+
----
$ oc create -f my-operator-catalog.yaml
----

.. Verify the CatalogSource and package manifest are created successfully:
+
----
# oc get pods -n openshift-marketplace
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
my-operator-catalog-6njx6 1/1 Running 0 28s
marketplace-operator-d9f549946-96sgr 1/1 Running 0 26h

# oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace
NAME DISPLAY TYPE PUBLISHER AGE
my-operator-catalog My Operator Catalog grpc 5s

# oc get packagemanifest -n openshift-marketplace
NAME CATALOG AGE
etcd My Operator Catalog 34s
----
+
You should also be able to view them from the *OperatorHub* page in the web
console.

. **Mirror the images required by the Operators you want to use.**

.. Determine the images defined by the Operator(s) that you are expecting. This
example uses the etcd Operator, requiring the `quay.io/coreos/etcd-operator`
image.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure only shows mirroring Operator images themselves and not Operand
images, which are the components that an Operator manages. Operand images must
be mirrored as well; see each Operator's documentation to identify the required
Operand images.
====

.. To use mirrored images, you must first create an ImageContentSourcePolicy for
each image to change the source location of the Operator catalog image. For
example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageContentSourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: etcd-operator
spec:
  repositoryDigestMirrors:
  - mirrors:
    - <local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>/coreos/etcd-operator
    source: quay.io/coreos/etcd-operator
----

.. Use the `oc image mirror` command from your workstation without network
restrictions to pull the image from the source registry and push to the internal
registry without being stored locally:
+
----
$ oc image mirror quay.io/coreos/etcd-operator \
    <local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>/coreos/etcd-operator
----

You can now install the Operator from the OperatorHub on your restricted network
{product-title} cluster.
