= Configuring OperatorHub for restricted networks

Cluster administrators can configure OLM and OperatorHub to use local content in
a restricted network environment using a custom Operator catalog image. For this
example, the procedure uses a custom `redhat-operators` catalog image previously
built and pushed to a supported registry.

.Prerequisites

* A Linux workstation with unrestricted network access
ifeval::["{context}" == "olm-restricted-networks"]
footnoteref:[BZ1771329]
endif::[]
* A custom Operator catalog image pushed to a supported registry
* `oc` version 4.3.5+
* `podman` version 1.5.1+
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]

.Procedure

. Disable the default OperatorSources by adding `disableAllDefaultSources: true`
to the spec:
+
----
$ oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
    -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
----
+
This disables the default OperatorSources that are configured by default during
an {product-title} installation.

. Mirror the contents of your catalog to your target registry. The following `oc adm catalog mirror`
command extracts the contents of your custom Operator catalog image to generate
the manifests required for mirroring and mirrors the images to your registry:
+
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror \
    <registry_host_name>:<port>/olm/redhat-operators:v1 \//<1>
    <registry_host_name>:<port> \
    [-a <path_to_registry_credentials>] \//<2>
    [--insecure] <3>

mirroring ...
----
<1> Specify your Operator catalog image.
<2> Optional: If required, specify the location of your registry credentials file for `podman` or `docker`.
<3> Optional: If you do not want to configure trust for the target registry, add the `--insecure` flag.
+
This command also creates a `<image_name>-manifests/` directory in the current
directory and generates the following files:
+
--
* The `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file defines an ImageContentSourcePolicy
object that can configure nodes to translate between the image references stored
in Operator manifests and the mirrored registry.
* The `mapping.txt` file contains all of the source images and where to map them
in the target registry. This file is compatible with the `oc image mirror`
command and can be used to further customize the mirroring configuration.
--

. Apply the manifests:
+
----
$ oc apply -f ./redhat-operators-manifests
----

. Create a CatalogSource object that references your catalog image.

.. Modify the following to your specifications and save it as a
`catalogsource.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: my-operator-catalog
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: <registry_host_name>:<port>/olm/redhat-operators:v1 <1>
  displayName: My Operator Catalog
  publisher: grpc
----
<1> Specify your custom Operator catalog image.

.. Use the file to create the CatalogSource object:
+
----
$ oc create -f catalogsource.yaml
----

. Verify the CatalogSource and package manifest are created successfully:
+
----
# oc get pods -n openshift-marketplace
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
my-operator-catalog-6njx6 1/1 Running 0 28s
marketplace-operator-d9f549946-96sgr 1/1 Running 0 26h

# oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace
NAME DISPLAY TYPE PUBLISHER AGE
my-operator-catalog My Operator Catalog grpc 5s

# oc get packagemanifest -n openshift-marketplace
NAME CATALOG AGE
etcd My Operator Catalog 34s
----
+
You can also view them from the *OperatorHub* page in the web console.

You can now install the Operators from the *OperatorHub* page on your restricted
network {product-title} cluster.
