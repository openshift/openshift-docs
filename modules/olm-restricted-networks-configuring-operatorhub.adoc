= Configuring OperatorHub for restricted networks

Cluster administrators can configure OLM and OperatorHub to use local content in
a restricted network environment using a custom Operator catalog image. For this
example, the procedure uses a custom `redhat-operators` catalog image previously
built and pushed to a supported registry.

.Prerequisites

* A Linux workstation with unrestricted network access
ifeval::["{context}" == "olm-restricted-networks"]
footnoteref:[BZ1771329]
endif::[]
* A custom Operator catalog image pushed to a supported registry
* `oc` version 4.3.5+
* `podman` version 1.4.4+
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]
* If you are working with private registries, set the `REG_CREDS` environment
variable to the file path of your registry credentials for use in later steps.
For example, for the `podman` CLI:
+
----
$ REG_CREDS=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json
----

.Procedure

. Disable the default OperatorSources by adding `disableAllDefaultSources: true`
to the spec:
+
----
$ oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
    -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
----
+
This disables the default OperatorSources that are configured by default during
an {product-title} installation.

. Mirror the contents of your catalog to your target registry. The following `oc adm catalog mirror`
command extracts the contents of your custom Operator catalog image to generate
the manifests required for mirroring and mirrors the images to your registry:
+
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror \
    <registry_host_name>:<port>/olm/redhat-operators:v1 \//<1>
    <registry_host_name>:<port> \
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \//<2>
    [--insecure] \//<3>
    [--filter-by-os="<os>/<arch>"] <4>

mirroring ...
----
<1> Specify your Operator catalog image.
<2> Optional: If required, specify the location of your registry credentials
file.
<3> Optional: If you do not want to configure trust for the target registry, add
the `--insecure` flag.
<4> Optional: Because the catalog might reference images that support multiple
architectures and operating systems, you can filter by architecture and
operating system to mirror only the images that match. Valid values are
`linux/amd64`, `linux/ppc64le`, and `linux/s390x`.
+
This command also creates a `<image_name>-manifests/` directory in the current
directory and generates the following files:
+
--
* The `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file defines an ImageContentSourcePolicy
object that can configure nodes to translate between the image references stored
in Operator manifests and the mirrored registry.
* The `mapping.txt` file contains all of the source images and where to map them
in the target registry. This file is compatible with the `oc image mirror`
command and can be used to further customize the mirroring configuration.
--

. Apply the manifests:
+
----
$ oc apply -f ./redhat-operators-manifests
----

. Create a CatalogSource object that references your catalog image.

.. Modify the following to your specifications and save it as a
`catalogsource.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: my-operator-catalog
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: <registry_host_name>:<port>/olm/redhat-operators:v1 <1>
  displayName: My Operator Catalog
  publisher: grpc
----
<1> Specify your custom Operator catalog image.

.. Use the file to create the CatalogSource object:
+
----
$ oc create -f catalogsource.yaml
----

. Verify the CatalogSource and package manifest are created successfully:
+
----
# oc get pods -n openshift-marketplace
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
my-operator-catalog-6njx6 1/1 Running 0 28s
marketplace-operator-d9f549946-96sgr 1/1 Running 0 26h

# oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace
NAME DISPLAY TYPE PUBLISHER AGE
my-operator-catalog My Operator Catalog grpc 5s

# oc get packagemanifest -n openshift-marketplace
NAME CATALOG AGE
etcd My Operator Catalog 34s
----
+
You can also view them from the *OperatorHub* page in the web console.

You can now install the Operators from the *OperatorHub* page on your restricted
network {product-title} cluster.
