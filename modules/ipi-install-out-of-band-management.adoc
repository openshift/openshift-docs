= Out-of-band management

Nodes will typically have an additional NIC used by the Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs). These BMCs must be accessible from the provisioning node.

Each node must be accessible via out-of-band management. The provisioning node requires access to the out-of-band management network for a successful {product-title} 4 installation.

The out-of-band management setup is out of scope for this document. We recommend setting up a separate management network for out-of-band management. However, using the `provisioning` network or the `baremetal` network are valid options.
