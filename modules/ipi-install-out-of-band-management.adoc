= Out-of-band management

Nodes will typically have an additional NIC used by the Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs). These BMCs must be accessible from the `provisioner` node.

Each node must be accessible via out-of-band management. When using an out-of-band management network, the `provisioner` node requires access to the out-of-band management network for a successful {product-title} 4 installation.

The out-of-band management setup is out of scope for this document. We recommend setting up a separate management network for out-of-band management. However, using the `provisioning` network or the `baremetal` network are valid options.
