= Out-of-band management

Nodes will typically have an additional NIC used by the Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs). These BMCs must be accessible from the provisioner node.

Each node must be accessible via out-of-band management. When using an out-of-band management network, the provisioner node requires access to the out-of-band management network for a successful {product-title} 4 installation.

The out-of-band management setup is out of scope for this document. We recommend setting up a separate management network for out-of-band management. However, using the provisioning network or the baremetal network are valid options.
