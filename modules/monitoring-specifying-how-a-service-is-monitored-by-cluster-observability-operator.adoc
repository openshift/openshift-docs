= Specifying how a service is monitored by Cluster Observability Operator

To use the metrics exposed by the sample service you created in the "Deploying a sample service for Cluster Observability Operator" section, you must configure monitoring components to scrape metrics from the `/metrics` endpoint. 

You can create this configuration by using a `ServiceMonitor` object that specifies how the service is to be monitored, or a `PodMonitor` object that specifies how a pod is to be monitored. 
The `ServiceMonitor` object requires a `Service` object. The `PodMonitor` object does not, which enables the `MonitoringStack` object to scrape metrics directly from the metrics endpoint exposed by a pod.

This procedure shows how to create a `ServiceMonitor` object for a sample service named `prometheus-coo-example-app` in the `ns1-coo` namespace.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role or as a user with administrative permissions for the namespace.
* You have installed the Cluster Observability Operator.
* You have deployed the `prometheus-coo-example-app` sample service in the `ns1-coo` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
The `prometheus-coo-example-app` sample service does not support TLS authentication.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file named `example-coo-app-service-monitor.yaml` that contains the following `ServiceMonitor` object configuration details:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    k8s-app: prometheus-coo-example-monitor
  name: prometheus-coo-example-monitor
  namespace: ns1-coo
spec:
  endpoints:
  - interval: 30s
    port: web
    scheme: http
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus-coo-example-app
----
+
This configuration defines a `ServiceMonitor` object that the `MonitoringStack` object will reference to scrape the metrics data exposed by the `prometheus-coo-example-app` sample service.

. Apply the configuration to the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-app-service-monitor.yaml
----

. Verify that the `ServiceMonitor` resource is created by running the following command and observing the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n ns1-coo get servicemonitor
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                         AGE
prometheus-coo-example-monitor   81m
