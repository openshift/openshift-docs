= Downloading manifest files and deployment resources

You must download the archive file that includes files for creating cluster resources and custom manifests. After you extract the contents of the archive file, you must upload the extracted files to an {oci-first} stack. The archive file contains a script that when run creates {oci} resources, such as DNS records, an instance, and so on.

A stack is an {oci} feature where you can automate the provisioning of all necessary {oci} infrastructure resources, such as the custom image, that are required for installing an {product-title} cluster on {oci}.

The script uses the {oci-first} Compute Service to create a virtual machine (VM) instance on {oci}. This instance can then automatically attach to a virtual network interface controller (vNIC) in the virtual cloud network (VNC) subnet. On specifying the IP address of your {product-title} cluster in the custom manifest template files, the {oci} instance can communicate with your cluster over the VNC.

.Prerequisites

* You uploaded a generated discovery ISO image to {oci}. For more information, see "Using the Assisted Installer to generate an OCI-compatible discovery ISO image".
* You have permissions to access the `oracle-quickstart / oci-openshift` GitHub repository.
* You logged in to your {oci-first} account with administrator privileges.

.Procedure

. From the link:https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-openshift[`oracle-quickstart / oci-openshift`] GitHub web page, click the *Code* button and then click *Download ZIP*.  The following list details these resources:
+
** link:https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-openshift/tree/main/custom_manifests[CCM and CSI custom manifests].
** link:https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-openshift/blob/main/README.md[Download the {oci} Resource Manager configuration to provision resources for deploying Openshift on {oci}].
+
[NOTE]
====
Consider using the example configurations in link:https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-openshift/tree/main/custom_manifests/manifests[manifests] GitHub page as a guide for configuring a cloud infrastructure to meet your organization's needs.
====

. Create a stack by completing the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack-compartment.htm[Creating a Stack from an Existing Compartment] procedure in the Oracle documentation. Ensure that you also complete the following subtasks:
+
.. Upload the archive file, `.zip`, that you downloaded previously from the `oracle-quickstart / oci-openshift` repository. This file contains a script and after you upload the script to {oci}, the script creates {oci} resources within your child compartment.
.. From the *Stack information* section, specify a name for your stack.
.. From the *Configure variables* section, complete the following fields. Ensure you replace the examples with your actual values.

|===
|Field |Value

| *cluster_name:*
|Specify the name of your cluster, such as `ocicluster`.

|*compartment_ocid:*
|Specify the {ocid} from the parent compartment. For example, `ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaa6r2iu3qndqgz5ogqkgnh2u2ajy5iou5ugkjr2ksmkrtdqrvxsvyq`.

|*home_region:*
|Specify a region, such as `us-sanjose-1`.

|*zone_dns:*
|Specify the DNS name server that stores DNS records for a zone, such as `openshift-demo.devcluster.openshift.com`.

|*enable_private_dns:*
|Set the DNS zone to public or private. Specifying a value of `true`, creates a private DNS zone; specifying a value of `false` creates a public DNS zone. For a private DNS zone, you must configure your local `/etc/hosts` file to reach the cluster.

|*openshift_image_source_url:*
|Specify the URL that you copied from a previous step of the quick-start procedure.
|===

. Click the *Apply* button to start an apply job. Check the *Logs* section to confirm that your stack is successfully created.

. Copy the `oci_ccm_config` cloud configuration from the *Outputs* section of the log.

. Extract the archive file that you downloaded in a previous step from the link:https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-openshift[`oracle-quickstart / oci-openshift`] repository. A new directory displays on your file explorer. Open the directory in your preferred code editor.

. Open the custom manifest template, `oci-ccm.yml`, and replace the cloud configuration section of the template file with the configuration that you previously copied from the *Logs* section on {oci}. Perform the same steps to update the configuration of the CSI driver in the `oci-csi.yml` file.
+
The following example replaces the `region:` to `rateLimitBucketWrite` parameters of the `oci-csi.yml` file with the configuration from the `oci_ccm_config` cloud configuration on {oci}:
