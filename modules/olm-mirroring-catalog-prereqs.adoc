Mirroring Operator catalogs for use with disconnected clusters has the following prerequisites:

* Workstation with unrestricted network access.
* `podman` version 1.9.3 or later.

* If you want to mirror a Red Hat-provided catalog, run the following command on your workstation with unrestricted network access to authenticate with `registry.redhat.io`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----
endif::[]
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2].
* Decide which namespace on your mirror registry you will use to store the mirrored Operator content. For example, you might create an `olm-mirror` namespace.
* If your mirror registry does not have internet access, connect removable media to your workstation with unrestricted network access.
* If you are working with private registries, including `registry.redhat.io`, set the `REG_CREDS` environment variable to the file path of your registry credentials for use in later steps. For example, for the `podman` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REG_CREDS=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json
