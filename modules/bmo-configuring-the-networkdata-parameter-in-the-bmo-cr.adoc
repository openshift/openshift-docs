= Configuring the networkData parameter in the BareMetalHost resource

The `networkData` field in the `BareMetalHost` custom resource (CR) allows you to control the network configuration of the bare-metal host at creation time. For most operating systems, this is achieved using a configuration file encapsulated in a Kubernetes secret. Then, the `cloud-init` service uses it to customize services.

.Procedure

. Create a file named `network-data.yaml` with the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
links:
  - id: <interface_id>
    type: phy
    ethernet_mac_address: <mac_address>
networks:
  - id: <interface_id>
    link: <interface_id>
    type: ipv4_dhcp
services:
  - type: dns
    address: <dns_server>
----
+
`<interface_id>`:: 
The ID of the network interface, such as `enp2s0`.
`<mac_address>`::
The MAC address of the network interface.
`<dns_server>`:: 
The IP address of the DNS server.

. Create a secret from the `networkData` file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic <hostname>-network-data \
  --from-file=networkData=network-data.yaml -n bmaas
----
+
`<hostname>`::
The hostname of the bare-metal host.

. Configure the `BareMetalHost` to use the `networkData` file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch baremetalhost <hostname> -n bmaas \
  --type merge -p '{"spec":{"networkData":{"name":"<hostname>-network-data"}}}'
----
