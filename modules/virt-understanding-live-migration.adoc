= Understanding live migration

Live migration is the process of moving a running virtual machine instance to
another node in the cluster without interrupting the virtual workload or access.
This can be a manual process, if you select virtual machine instance
to migrate to another node, or an automatic process, if the virtual machine
instance has a `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy and the node on
which it is running is placed into maintenance.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Virtual machines must have a persistent volume claim (PVC)
with a shared ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode to be live migrated.
