= Understanding live migration

Live migration is the process of moving a running virtual machine instance (VMI) to
another node in the cluster without interrupting the virtual workload or access.
If a VMI uses the `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy, it automatically migrates
when the node that the VMI runs on is placed into maintenance mode. You can also
manually start live migration by selecting a VMI to migrate.

Virtual machines must have a persistent volume claim (PVC) with a shared
ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode to be live migrated.

[NOTE]
====
Live migration is supported for virtual machines that are attached to an SR-IOV network interface only if the `sriovLiveMigration` feature gate is enabled in the HyperConverged Cluster custom resource (CR). When the `spec.featureGates.sriovLiveMigration` field is set to `true`, the `virt-launcher` pod runs with the `SYS_RESOURCE` capability. This might degrade its security.
