= Understanding live migration

Live migration is the process of moving a running virtual machine instance (VMI) to
another node in the cluster without interrupting the virtual workload or access.
If a VMI uses the `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy, it automatically migrates
when the node that the VMI runs on is placed into maintenance mode. You can also
manually start live migration by selecting a VMI to migrate.

Virtual machines must have a persistent volume claim (PVC) with a shared
ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode to be live migrated.

[NOTE]
==== 
Live migration is not supported for virtual machines that are
attached to an SR-IOV network interface.
