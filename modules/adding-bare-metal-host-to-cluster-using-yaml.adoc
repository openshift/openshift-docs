= Adding a bare metal host to the cluster using YAML in the web console

You can add bare metal hosts to the cluster in the web console using a YAML file that describes the bare metal host.

.Prerequisites

* Install a {op-system} compute machine on bare metal infrastructure for use in the cluster.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Create a `Secret` CR for the bare metal host.

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to *Compute* -> *Bare Metal Hosts*.
. Select *Add Host* -> *New from YAML*.
. Copy and paste the below YAML, modifying the relevant fields with the details of your host:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BareMetalHost
metadata:
  name: <bare_metal_host_name>
spec:
  online: true
  bmc:
    address: <bmc_address>
    credentialsName: <secret_credentials_name>  <1>
    disableCertificateVerification: True
  bootMACAddress: <host_boot_mac_address>
  hardwareProfile: unknown
----
+
<1> `credentialsName` must reference a valid `Secret` CR. The `baremetal-operator` cannot manage the bare metal host without a valid `Secret` referenced in the `credentialsName`. For more information about secrets and how to create them, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-secrets.adoc#nodes-pods-secrets-about_nodes-pods-secrets[Understanding secrets].

. Select *Create* to save the YAML and create the new bare metal host.
. Scale up the number of replicas to match the number of available bare metal hosts. Navigate to *Compute* -> *MachineSets*, and increase the number of machines in the cluster by selecting *Edit Machine count* from the *Actions* drop-down menu.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also manage the number of bare metal nodes using the `oc scale` command and the appropriate bare metal machine set.
