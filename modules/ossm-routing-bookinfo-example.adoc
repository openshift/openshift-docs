= Routing example using the bookinfo application

The {ProductShortName} Bookinfo sample application consists of four separate microservices, each with multiple versions. Three different versions, one of the microservices called `reviews`, have been deployed and are running concurrently.

.Prerequisites:

* Deploy the Bookinfo sample application to work with the following examples.

.About this task

To illustrate the problem this causes, access the bookinfo app `/product page` in a browser and refresh several times.

Sometimes the book review output contains star ratings and other times it does not. Without an explicit default service version to route to, {ProductShortName} routes requests to all available versions one after the other.

This tutorial helps you apply rules that route all traffic to `v1` (version 1) of the microservices. Later, you can apply a rule to route traffic based on the value of an HTTP request header.

[id="ossm-routing-bookinfo-applying_{context}"]
== Applying a virtual service

To route to one version only, apply virtual services that set the default version for the micro-services. In the following example, the virtual service routes all traffic to `v1` of each micro-service

1.  Run the following command to apply the virtual services:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-1.1/samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml
----
+
2. To test the command was successful, display the defined routes with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get virtualservices -o yaml
----
+
That command returns the following YAML file. 
+
[source,yaml]
----

You have configured {ProductShortName} to route to the `v1` version of the Bookinfo microservices, most importantly the `reviews` service version 1.

[id="ossm-routing-bookinfo-test_{context}"]
== Test the new routing configuration

You can easily test the new configuration by once again refreshing the `/productpage` of the Bookinfo app.

1.  Open the Bookinfo site in your browser. The URL is `http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage`, where `$GATEWAY_URL` is the External IP address of the ingress.
+
The reviews part of the page displays with no rating stars, no matter how many times you refresh. This is because you configured {ProductShortName} to route all traffic for the reviews service to the version `reviews:v1` and this version of the service does not access the star ratings service.
+
Your service mesh now routes traffic to one version of a service.

[id="ossm-routing-bookinfo-route_{context}"]
== Route based on user identity

Next, change the route configuration so that all traffic from a specific user is routed to a specific service version. In this case, all traffic from a user named `jason` will be routed to the service `reviews:v2`.

Note that {ProductShortName} doesn't have any special, built-in understanding of user identity. This example is enabled by the fact that the `productpage` service adds a custom `end-user` header to all outbound HTTP requests to the reviews service.

1. Run the following command to enable user-based routing:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-1.1/samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-test-v2.yaml
----
+
2. Confirm the rule is created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get virtualservice reviews -o yaml
----
+
That command returns the following YAML file. 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
  ...
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
      end-user:
        exact: jason
    route:
    - destination:
      host: reviews
      subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
      host: reviews
      subset: v1
----
+
3.  On the `/productpage` of the Bookinfo app, log in as user `jason`. Refresh the browser. What do you see? The star ratings appear next to each review.
+
4. Log in as another user (pick any name you wish). Refresh the browser. Now the stars are gone. This is because traffic is routed to `reviews:v1` for all users except Jason.

You have successfully configured {ProductShortName} to route traffic based on user identity.
