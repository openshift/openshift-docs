= Understanding the cluster logging component images

There are several components in cluster logging, each one implemented with one
or more images.  Each image is specified by an environment variable
defined in the *cluster-logging-operator* deployment in the *openshift-logging* project and should not be changed.

You can view the images by running the following command:

----
$ oc -n openshift-logging set env deployment/cluster-logging-operator --list | grep _IMAGE
----
