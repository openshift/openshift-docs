= Understanding {logging} component images

There are several components in {logging}, each one implemented with one or more images. Each image is specified by an environment variable
defined in the *cluster-logging-operator* deployment in the *openshift-logging* project and should not be changed.

You can view the images by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-logging set env deployment/cluster-logging-operator --list | grep _IMAGE
----
// logging test command and update the example output
