= Expanding {sno} clusters with GitOps ZTP

You can expand {sno} clusters with GitOps ZTP. When you add worker nodes to {sno} clusters, the original {sno} cluster retains the control plane node role.

[NOTE]
====
Although there is no specified limit on the number of worker nodes that you can add to a {sno} cluster, you must revaluate the reserved CPU allocation on the control plane node for the additional worker nodes.
====

If you require workload partitioning on the worker node, you must deploy and remediate the managed cluster policies on the hub cluster before installing the node. This way, the workload partitioning `MachineConfig` objects are rendered and associated with the `worker` `MachineConfig` pool before the GitOps ZTP workflow applies the `MachineConfig` ignition file to the worker node.

The recommended procedure order is remediating policies, then installing the worker node.
If you create the workload partitioning manifests after node installation, you must manually drain the node and delete all the pods managed by daemonsets. When the managing daemonsets create the new pods, the new pods undergo the workload partitioning process.
