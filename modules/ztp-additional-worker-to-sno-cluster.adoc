= {sno-caps} cluster expansion with worker nodes
include::../_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

When you add worker nodes to increase available CPU resources, the original {sno} cluster retains the control plane node role.

[NOTE]
====
Although there is no specified limit on the number of worker nodes that you can add, you must revaluate the reserved CPU allocation on the control plane node for the additional worker nodes.
====

If workload partitioning is required on the worker node, the policies configuring the worker node must be deployed and remediated before installing the node. This way, the workload partitioning `MachineConfig` objects are rendered and associated with the `worker` `MachineConfig` pool before the `MachineConfig` ignition is downloaded by the installing worker node.

The recommended procedure order is remediating policies, then installing the worker node.
If you create the workload partitioning manifests after node installation, you must manually drain the node and delete all the pods managed by daemonsets. When the managing daemonsets create the new pods, the new pods undergo the workload partitioning process.
