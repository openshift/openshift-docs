= Optional dependencies of the Network Observability Operator

You can optionally integrate the Network Observability Operator with other components to enhance its functionality and scalability. Supported optional dependencies include the {loki-op} for flow storage, and AMQ Streams for large-scale data handling with Kafka.

{loki-op}:: You can use Loki as the backend to store all collected flows with a maximal level of details. It is recommended to use the Red Hat supported {loki-op} to install Loki. You can also choose to use network observability without Loki, but you need to consider some factors. For more information, see "Network observability without Loki".

AMQ Streams Operator:: Kafka provides scalability, resiliency and high availability in the {product-title} cluster for large scale deployments. If you choose to use Kafka, it is recommended to use Red Hat supported AMQ Streams Operator.
