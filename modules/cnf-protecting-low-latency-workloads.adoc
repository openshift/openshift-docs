= Protecting low-latency workloads

[role="_abstract"]
To maintain strict timing requirements in high-performance environments, use `ExecCPUAffinity` to isolate secondary container processes from primary workloads. This system-enabled pinning prevents latency spikes by ensuring that debugging tools do not interrupt exclusive CPUs dedicated to your 5G or Telco applications.

In high-performance environments like Telco RAN DU or 5G Core, applications are pinned to isolated CPUs to ensure deterministic performance; however, before the {product-title} {product-version}, processes initiated through `exec` operations—such as debugging tools or shell access—could be scheduled on any available CPU within the container. This unpredictability led to resource contention and context switching, causing micro-interruptions and latency spikes that violated the strict timing requirements of the primary workload.

The `ExecCPUAffinity` capability allows you to execute these operations safely by isolating secondary processes. By default, this feature pins the initial affinity of any new command to the first CPU in the container's set. The system prioritizes the first CPU from the container shared set if one exists; otherwise, it utilizes the first exclusive CPU. This ensures that the exclusive cores dedicated to your time-sensitive application remain undisturbed.

The `ExecCPUAffinity` feature is enabled by default whenever a PerformanceProfile is applied to a node. For the pinning to take effect, the pod must belong to the Guaranteed QoS class and request whole integer CPUs. The system automatically selects the first available CPU—prioritizing a shared CPU if one exists—to host the executed process. If you require the legacy behavior where executed processes can run on any allocated core, you can disable the feature by adding the `performance.openshift.io/disable-exec-cpu-affinity: "true"` annotation to your PerformanceProfile.
