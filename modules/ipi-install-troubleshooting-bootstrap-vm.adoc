= Bootstrap VM issues

The {product-title} installation program spawns a bootstrap node virtual machine, which handles provisioning the {product-title} cluster nodes.

.Procedure

. About 10 to 15 minutes after triggering the installation program, check to ensure the bootstrap VM is operational using the `virsh` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo virsh list
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
 Id    Name                           State
 --------------------------------------------
 12    openshift-xf6fq-bootstrap      running
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The name of the bootstrap VM is always the cluster name followed by a random set of characters and ending in the word "bootstrap."
====
+
If the bootstrap VM is not running after 10-15 minutes, troubleshoot why it is not running. Possible issues include:

. Verify `libvirtd` is running on the system:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ systemctl status libvirtd
----
+
[source,terminal]

If the bootstrap VM is operational, log in to it.

. Use the `virsh console` command to find the IP address of the bootstrap VM:

$ sudo virsh console example.com

[IMPORTANT]
====
When deploying an {product-title} cluster without the `provisioning` network, you must use a public IP address and not a private IP address like `172.22.0.2`.
====


. After you obtain the IP address, log in to the bootstrap VM using the `ssh` command:
+
[NOTE]
====
In the console output of the previous step, you can use the IPv6 IP address provided by `ens3` or the IPv4 IP provided by `ens4`.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh core@172.22.0.2
----

If you are not successful logging in to the bootstrap VM, you have likely encountered one of the following scenarios:

* You cannot reach the `172.22.0.0/24` network. Verify the network connectivity between the provisioner and the `provisioning` network bridge. This issue might occur if you are using a `provisioning` network.
`
* You cannot reach the bootstrap VM through the public network. When attempting
to SSH via `baremetal` network, verify connectivity on the
`provisioner` host specifically around the `baremetal` network bridge.

* You encountered `Permission denied (publickey,password,keyboard-interactive)`. When
attempting to access the bootstrap VM, a `Permission denied` error
might occur. Verify that the SSH key for the user attempting to log
in to the VM is set within the `install-config.yaml` file.
