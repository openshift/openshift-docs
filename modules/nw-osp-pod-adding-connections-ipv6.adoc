= Adding IPv6 connectivity to pods on {rh-openstack}

After you enable IPv6 connectivity in pods, add connectivity to them by using a Container Network Interface (CNI) configuration.

.Procedure

. To edit the Cluster Network Operator (CNO), enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. Specify your CNI configuration under the `spec` field. For example, the following configuration uses a SLAAC address mode with MACVLAN:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  additionalNetworks:
  - name: ipv6
    namespace: ipv6 <1>
    rawCNIConfig: '{ "cniVersion": "0.3.1", "name": "ipv6", "type": "macvlan", "master": "ens4"}' <2>
    type: Raw
----
<1> Be sure to create pods in the same namespace.
<2> The interface in the network attachment `"master"` field can differ from `"ens4"` when more networks are configured or when a different kernel driver is used.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using stateful address mode, include the IP Address Management (IPAM) in the CNI configuration.

DHCPv6 is not supported by Multus.

. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.

.Verification

* On a command line, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions -A
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE       NAME            AGE
ipv6            ipv6            21h
----

You can now create pods that have secondary IPv6 connections.
