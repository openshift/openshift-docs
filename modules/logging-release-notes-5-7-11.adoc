== Bug fixes
* Before this update, when configured to read a custom S3 Certificate Authority, the Loki Operator would not automatically update the configuration when the name of the `ConfigMap` object or the contents changed. With this update, the Loki Operator now watches for changes to the `ConfigMap` object and automatically updates the generated configuration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4968[LOG-4968])
