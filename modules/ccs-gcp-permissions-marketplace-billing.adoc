= Roles required for {GCP} Marketplace billing

[role="_abstract"]
To deploy an {product-title} cluster using {GCP} Marketplace-based billing, your {GCP} account must first be prepared. This involves accepting the {GCP} Marketplace terms and agreements for the OpenShift Dedicated product listing. Contact your {GCP} administrator who has the `Consumer Procurement Entitlement Manager` role to enable {product-title} cluster deployments in your {GCP} project.

To automate the checking and acceptance of these terms and agreements during OpenShift Dedicated cluster creation, you must grant the `Consumer Procurement Entitlement Viewer` role to the {GCP} identity (user or service account) that is creating the cluster. The `Consumer Procurement Entitlement Viewer` role includes the necessary permissions to check for existing consent to the {GCP} terms and agreements and grants consent if that has not yet been given.

The following table lists the permissions that are included in the `Consumer Procurement Entitlement Viewer` role.
