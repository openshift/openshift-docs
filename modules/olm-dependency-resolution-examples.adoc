= Example dependency resolution scenarios

In the following examples, a _provider_ is an Operator which "owns" a CRD or
APIService.

=== Example: Deprecating dependent APIs

A and B are APIs (e.g., CRDs):

* A's provider depends on B.
* B’s provider has a Subscription.
* B’s provider updates to provide C but deprecates B.

This results in:

* B no longer has a provider.
* A no longer works.

This is a case OLM prevents with its upgrade strategy.

=== Example: Version deadlock

A and B are APIs:

* A's provider requires B.
* B's provider requires A.
* A's provider updates to (provide A2, require B2) and deprecate A.
* B's provider updates to (provide B2, require A2) and deprecate B.

If OLM attempts to update A without simultaneously updating B, or vice-versa, it
is unable to progress to new versions of the Operators, even though a new
compatible set can be found.

This is another case OLM prevents with its upgrade strategy.
