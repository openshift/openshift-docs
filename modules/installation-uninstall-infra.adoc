= Removing a cluster on {rh-openstack} that uses your own infrastructure

You can remove an {product-title} cluster on {rh-openstack-first} that uses your own infrastructure. To complete the removal process quickly, create and run several Ansible playbooks.

.Prerequisites

* Python 3 is installed on your machine
* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies"

.Procedure

[NOTE]
You may have the `common.yaml` and `inventory.yaml` playbooks left over from when you installed {product-title}. If you do, you can skip the first two steps of the procedure.

. Insert the following content into a local file called `common.yaml`:
+
.`common.yaml` Ansible playbook
