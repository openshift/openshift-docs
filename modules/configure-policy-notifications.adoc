= Configuring policy notifications

Enable alert notifications for system policies.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Policies*.
. Select one or more policies for which you want to send alerts.
. Under **Bulk actions**, select *Enable notification*.
. In the **Enable notification** window, select the {toolname} notifier.

[NOTE]
====
If you have not configured any other integrations, the system displays a message that no notifiers are configured.
====
. Click *Enable*.

[NOTE]
====
* {product-title} sends notifications on an opt-in basis.
To receive notifications, you must first assign a notifier to the policy.
* Notifications are only sent once for a given alert.
If you have assigned a notifier to a policy, you will not receive a notification unless a violation generates a new alert.

* {product-title} creates a new alert for the following scenarios:
** A policy violation occurs for the first time in a deployment.
** A runtime-phase policy violation occurs in a deployment after you resolved the previous runtime alert for a policy in that deployment.
