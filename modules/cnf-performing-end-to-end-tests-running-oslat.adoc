= Running oslat

The `oslat` test simulates a CPU-intensive DPDK application and measures all the interruptions and disruptions to test how the cluster handles CPU heavy data processing.

[NOTE]
====
When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. Depending on your local operating system and SELinux configuration, you might also experience issues running these commands from your home directory. To make the `podman` commands work, run the commands from a folder that is not your home/<username> directory, and append `:Z` to the volumes creation. For example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have reviewed the prerequisites for running latency tests.

.Procedure

* To perform the `oslat` test, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_CPUS=10 -e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=600 -e MAXIMUM_LATENCY=20 \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v{product-version} \
/usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.focus="oslat" --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
----
+
`LATENCY_TEST_CPUS` specifies the number of CPUs to test with the `oslat` command.
+
The command runs the `oslat` tool for 10 minutes (600 seconds). The test runs successfully when the maximum observed latency is lower than `MAXIMUM_LATENCY` (20 μs).
+
If the results exceed the latency threshold, the test fails.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
During testing shorter time periods, as shown, can be used to run the tests. However, for final verification and valid results, the test should run for at least 12 hours (43200 seconds).
