[id="cnf-performing-end-to-end-tests-running-oslat_{context}"]
= Running oslat

The `oslat` test simulates a CPU-intensive DPDK application and measures all the interruptions and disruptions to test how the cluster handles CPU heavy data processing.

[NOTE]
====
When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. To make the `podman` command work, append `:Z` to the volumes creation; for example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to `registry.redhat.io` with your Customer Portal credentials.
* You have applied a cluster performance profile by using the Node Tuning Operator.

.Procedure

* To perform the `oslat` test, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_CPUS=10 -e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=600 -e MAXIMUM_LATENCY=20 \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version} \
/usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.focus="oslat" --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
----
+
`LATENCY_TEST_CPUS` specifies the number of CPUs to test with the `oslat` command.
+
The command runs the `oslat` tool for 10 minutes (600 seconds). The test runs successfully when the maximum observed latency is lower than `MAXIMUM_LATENCY` (20 μs).
+
If the results exceed the latency threshold, the test fails.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For valid results, the test should run for at least 12 hours.
