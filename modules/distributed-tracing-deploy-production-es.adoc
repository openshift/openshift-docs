= Deploying the Jaeger production strategy from the web console

The `production` deployment strategy is intended for production environments, where long term storage of trace data is important, as well as a more scalable and highly available architecture is required.

.Prerequisites

* The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator must be installed.
* The Jaeger Operator must be installed.
* Review the instructions for how to customize the Jaeger installation.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Create a new project, for example `jaeger-system`.

.. Navigate to *Home* -> *Projects*.

.. Click *Create Project*.

.. Enter `jaeger-system` in the *Name* field.

.. Click *Create*.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. If necessary, select `jaeger-system` from the Project menu.  You may have to wait a few moments for the Operators to be copied to the new project.

. Click the Jaeger Operator. On the *Overview* tab, under *Provided APIs*, the Operator provides a single link.

. Under *Jaeger* click *Create Instance*.

. On the *Create Jaeger* page, replace the default `all-in-one` yaml text with your production YAML configuration, for example:

. Click *Create* to create the Jaeger instance.

. On the *Jaegers* page, click the name of the Jaeger instance, for example, `jaeger-prod-elasticsearch`.

. On the *Jaeger Details* page, click the *Resources* tab.  Wait until all the pods have a status of "Running" before continuing.

== Deploying Jaeger production from the CLI

Follow this procedure to create an instance of Jaeger from the command line.

.Prerequisites

* An installed, verified {ProductName} Operator.
* Access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login https://{HOSTNAME}:8443
----

. Create a new project named `jaeger-system`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project jaeger-system
----

. Create a custom resource file named `jaeger-production.yaml` that contains the text of the example file in the previous procedure.

. Run the following command to deploy Jaeger:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n jaeger-system -f jaeger-production.yaml
----
+
. Run the following command to watch the progress of the pods during the installation process:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n jaeger-system -w
----
+
Once the installation process has completed, you should see output similar to the following:
