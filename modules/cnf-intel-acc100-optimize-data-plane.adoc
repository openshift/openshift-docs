= Understanding the vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100

Hardware accelerator cards from Intel accelerate 4G/LTE and 5G Virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRAN) workloads. This in turn increases the overall compute capacity of a commercial, off-the-shelf platform.

The vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100, based on Intel eASIC technology is designed to offload and accelerate the computing-intensive process of forward error correction (FEC) for 4G/LTE and 5G technology, freeing up processing power.
Intel eASIC devices are structured ASICs, an intermediate technology between FPGAs and standard application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).

Intel vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100 support on {product-title} uses one Operator:

* OpenNESS Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators
