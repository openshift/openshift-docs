= Mounting the ISO and booting the rendezvous node

[role="_abstract"]
To initiate the cluster installation, attach the downloaded ISO to the machine that will serve as your rendezvous host and boot the machine from the ISO.

The rendezvous node runs as the bootstrap host during the installation, which hosts the configuration web console and runs an Assisted Service that facilitates the cluster deployment.

.Prerequisites

* You have downloaded the installation ISO.

.Procedure

. On the machine that you have designated to be the rendezvous node, attach the ISO image to the machine and boot the machine from this image.
You can also boot from a USB drive containing the ISO image.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you mount the ISO via a virtual drive, the cluster installation might take several hours to complete.
Mount the ISO with physical media such as a USB drive to reduce the overall installation time.
====

. Wait for the machine to boot from the image and display the *Rendezvous node setup* menu.

. Select *This is the rendezvous node* in the *Rendezvous node setup* menu.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must select only one machine to act as the rendezvous node.
Selecting two or more machines as a rendezvous node is not supported.
====

. In the *Rendezvous node IP selection* menu, select an IP address from the list to use as the rendezvous node IP address and select *Continue*.
Make note of this address for later use.

. Wait for the rendezvous node to provide a URL for finishing the installation and save the URL for later use, as shown in the following image.
