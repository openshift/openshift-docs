= Mounting the ISO and booting the rendezvous node

To initiate the cluster installation, attach the downloaded ISO to the machine that will serve as your rendezvous host and boot the machine from the ISO.
The rendezvous node runs as the bootstrap host during the installation, which hosts the configuration web console and runs an Assisted Service that facilitates the cluster deployment.

.Prerequisites

* You have downloaded the installation ISO.

.Procedure

. On the machine that you have designated to be the rendezvous node, attach the ISO image to the machine and boot the machine from this image.
You can also boot from a USB drive containing the ISO image.

. Wait for the machine to boot from the image and display the *Rendezvous node setup* menu.

. Select *This is the rendezvous node* in the *Rendezvous node setup* menu.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must select only one machine to act as the rendezvous node.
Selecting two or more machines as a rendezvous node is not supported.
====

. In the *Rendezvous node IP selection* menu, select an IP address from the list to use as the rendezvous node IP address and select *Continue*.
Make note of this address for later use.
