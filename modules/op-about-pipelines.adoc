You can use a `Pipeline` resource to arrange a collection of tasks in a specific order of execution. By defining a pipeline, you construct complex workflows that automate the build, deployment, and delivery of your applications.

A `Pipeline` is a collection of `Task` resources arranged in a specific order of execution. You run them to construct complex workflows that automate the build, deployment and delivery of applications by using one or more tasks to define a CI/CD workflow for your application.

A `Pipeline` resource definition consists of several fields or attributes, which together enable the pipeline to run a specific goal. Each `Pipeline` resource definition must contain at least one `Task` resource, which obtains specific inputs and produces specific outputs. The pipeline definition can also optionally include several _Conditions_, _Workspaces_, _Parameters_, or _Resources_ depending on the application requirements.

The following example shows the `build-and-deploy` pipeline, which builds an application image from a Git repository by using the `buildah` task provided in the `openshift-pipelines` namespace:

`apiVersion`:: Pipeline API version `v1`.

`kind`:: Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, `Pipeline`.

`metadata.name`:: Unique name of this pipeline.

`spec`:: Specifies the definition and structure of the pipeline.

`spec.workspaces`:: Workspaces used across all the tasks in the pipeline.

`spec.params`:: Parameters used across all the tasks in the pipeline.

`tasks[0].name`:: Specifies the list of tasks used in the pipeline.

`tasks[1].name`:: Task `build-image`, which uses the `buildah` task provided in the `openshift-pipelines` namespace to build application images from a given Git repository.

`tasks[2].name`:: Task `apply-manifests`, which uses a user-defined task with the same name.

`tasks[2].name.runAfter`:: Specifies the sequence in which tasks run in a pipeline. In this example, the `apply-manifests` task runs only after the `build-image` task finishes.

[NOTE]
====
The {pipelines-title} Operator installs the Buildah task in the `openshift-pipelines` namespace and creates the `pipeline` service account with enough permissions to build and push an image. The Buildah task can fail when associated with a different service account with insufficient permissions.
