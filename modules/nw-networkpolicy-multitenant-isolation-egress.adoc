= Multitenant egress network policies 

By default, if no egress network policy is applied to a pod, the pod is not isolated for egress traffic. When a pod is not isolated for egress, it can send traffic freely to any destination.

With an egress multitenant isolation network policy, cluster administrators can control outbound traffic from pods. When an egress network policy is applied to a pod, that pod becomes _isolated_ for egress, meaning that egress traffic is allowed only if it is permitted by at least one matching egress rule.

Egress network policies help ensure that only authorized outbound traffic, such as communication with external services or specific namespaces, is allowed, depending on the configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Before configuring an egress network policy, cluster administrators should first configure ingress network policies. Attempting to configure both at the same time can make it difficult to determine which network policy is blocking traffic.

* Egress network policies are harder to effectively implement than ingress network policies. Restricting outbound traffic might lead to unexpected issues.
