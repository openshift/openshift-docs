[id="mint-mode-with-removal-or-rotation-of-admin-credential_{context}"]
= Mint Mode with removal or rotation of the admin credential

Currently, this mode is only supported on AWS.

In this mode, a user installs {product-title} with an `admin` credential just
like the normal mint mode. However, this mode removes the `admin` credential
secret from the cluster post-installation.

The administrator can have the Cloud Credential Operator make its own request
for a read-only credential that allows it to verify if all `CredentialsRequests`
have their required permissions, thus the `admin` credential is not required
unless something needs to be changed. After the associated credential is
removed, it can be destroyed on the underlying cloud, if desired.

Prior to upgrade, the `admin` credential should be restored. In the future,
upgrade might be blocked if the credential is not present.

The `admin` credential is not stored in the cluster permanently.

This mode still requires the `admin` credential in the cluster for brief periods
of time. It also requires manually re-instating the secret with `admin`
credentials for each upgrade.
