= Verifying the VPN connection

After you have set up your side of the VPN tunnel, you can verify that the
tunnel is up in the AWS console and that connectivity across the tunnel is
working.

.Prerequisites

* Created a VPN connection.

.Procedure

. *Verify the tunnel is up in AWS.*

.. From the VPC Dashboard, click on *VPN Connections*.
.. Select the VPN connection you created previously and click the *Tunnel Details* tab.
.. You should be able to see that at least one of the VPN tunnels is *Up*.

. *Verify the connection.*

To test network connectivity to an endpoint device, `nc` (or `netcat`) is a
helpful troubleshooting tool. It is included in the default image and provides
quick and clear output if a connection can be established:

.. Create a temporary Pod using the `busybox` image, which cleans up after itself:
+
----
$ oc run netcat-test \
    --image=busybox -i -t \
    --restart=Never --rm \
    -- /bin/sh
----

.. Check the connection using `nc`.

* Example successful connection results:
+
----
/ nc -zvv 192.168.1.1 8080
10.181.3.180 (10.181.3.180:8080) open
sent 0, rcvd 0
----

* Example failed connection results:
+
----
/ nc -zvv 192.168.1.2 8080
nc: 10.181.3.180 (10.181.3.180:8081): Connection refused
sent 0, rcvd 0
----
--

.. Exit the container, which automatically deletes the Pod:
+
----
/ exit
