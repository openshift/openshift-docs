= Configuring concurrent requests for Knative Serving autoscaling

You can specify the number of concurrent requests that should be handled by each instance of a revision container, or application, by adding the `target` annotation or the `containerConcurrency` field in the revision template.

.Example revision template YAML using target annotation

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        autoscaling.knative.dev/target: 50
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: myimage
----

.Example revision template YAML using containerConcurrency annotation

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
    spec:
      containerConcurrency: 100
      containers:
      - image: myimage
----

Adding a value for both `target` and `containerConcurrency` will target the `target` number of concurrent requests, but impose a hard limit of the `containerConcurrency` number of requests.

For example, if the `target` value is 50 and the `containerConcurrency` value is 100, the targeted number of requests will be 50, but the hard limit will be 100.

If the `containerConcurrency` value is less than the `target` value, the `target` value will be tuned down, since there is no need to target more requests than the number that can actually be handled.

[NOTE]
====
`containerConcurrency` should only be used if there is a clear need to limit how many requests reach the application at a given time. Using `containerConcurrency` is only advised if the application needs to have an enforced constraint of concurrency.
====

== Configuring concurrent requests using the target annotation

The default target for the number of concurrent requests is `100`, but you can override this value by adding or modifying the `autoscaling.knative.dev/target` annotation value in the revision template.

Here is an example of how this annotation is used in the revision template to set the target to `50`:

[source,yaml]
----
autoscaling.knative.dev/target: 50
----

== Configuring concurrent requests using the containerConcurrency field

`containerConcurrency` sets a hard limit on the number of concurrent requests handled.

[source,yaml]
----
containerConcurrency: 0 | 1 | 2-N
----

0:: allows unlimited concurrent requests.
1:: guarantees that only one request is handled at a time by a given instance of the revision container.
2 or more:: will limit request concurrency to that value.

[NOTE]
====
If there is no `target` annotation, autoscaling is configured as if `target` is equal to the value of `containerConcurrency`.
