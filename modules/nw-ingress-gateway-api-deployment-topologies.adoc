= Gateway API deployment topologies

Gateway API is designed to accomodate two topologies: shared gateways or dedicated gateways. Each topology has its own advantages and different security implications.

Dedicated gateway:: Routes and any load balancers or proxies are served from the same namespace. The `Gateway`
object restricts routes to a particular application namespace. This is the default topology when deploying a Gateway API resource in {product-title}.

Shared gateway:: Routes are served from multiple namespaces or with multiple hostnames. The `Gateway` object filters allow routes from application namespaces by using the `spec.listeners.allowedRoutes.namespaces` field.

== Dedicated gateway example

The following example shows a dedicated `Gateway` resource, `fin-gateway`:

.Example dedicated `Gateway` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: fin-gateway
  namespace: openshift-ingress
spec:
  listeners: <1>
  - name: http
    protocol: HTTP
    port: 8080
    hostname: "example.com"
----
<1> Creating a `Gateway` resource without setting `spec.listeners[].allowedRoutes` results in implicitly setting the `namespaces.from` field to have the value `Same`.

The following example shows the associated `HTTPRoute` resource, `sales-db`, which attaches to the dedicated `Gateway` object:

.Example `HTTPRoute` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: sales-db
  namespace: openshift-ingress
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: fin-gateway
  hostnames:
  - sales-db.example.com
  rules:
    - backendRefs:
        - name: sales-db
        ¦ port: 8080
----

The `HTTPRoute` resource must have the name of the `Gateway` object as the value for its `parentRefs` field in order to attach to the gateway. Implicitly, the route is assumed to be in the same namespace as the `Gateway` object.

[id="shared-gateway-example_{context}"]
== Shared gateway example

The following example shows a `Gateway` resource, `devops-gateway`, that has a `spec.listeners.allowedRoutes.namespaces` label selector set to match any namespaces containing `shared-gateway-access: "true"`:

.Example shared `Gateway` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: devops-gateway
  namespace: openshift-ingress
listeners:
  - name: https
    protocol: HTTPS
    hostname: "example.com"
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: Selector
        selector:
        ¦ matchLabels:
        ¦   shared-gateway-access: "true"
----

The following examples show the allowed namespaces for the `devops-gateway` resource:

.Example `Namespace` resources
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dev
  labels:
    shared-gateway-access: "true"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ops
  labels:
    shared-gateway-access: "true"
----

In this example, two `HTTPRoute` resources, `dev-portal` and `ops-home`, are in different namespaces but are attached to the shared gateway:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: dev-portal
  namespace: dev
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: devops-gateway
    namespace: openshift-ingress
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: dev-portal
      port: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: ops-home
  namespace: ops
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: devops-gateway
    namespace: openshift-ingress
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: ops-home
      port: 8080
----

With a shared gateway topology, the routes must specify the namespace of the `Gateway` object it wants to attach to. Multiple `Gateway` objects can be deployed and shared across namespaces. When there are multiple shared gateways, this topology becomes conceptually similar to Ingress Controller sharding.
