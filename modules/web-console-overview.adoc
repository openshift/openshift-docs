= Understanding and accessing the web console

The web console runs as a pod on the master. The static assets required to run
the web console are served by the pod. Once {product-title} is successfully
installed, find the URL for the web console and login credentials for your
installed cluster in the CLI output of the installation program. For example:

[source,terminal]
