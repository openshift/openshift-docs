== New features

.Backing up different volumes in the same namespace by using the VolumePolicy feature is now possible

With this release, Velero provides resource policies to back up different volumes in the same namespace by using the `VolumePolicy` feature. The supported `VolumePolicy` feature to back up different volumes includes `skip`, `snapshot`, and `fs-backup` actions.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1071[OADP-1071]

.File system backup and data mover can now use short-term credentials

File system backup and data mover can now use short-term credentials such as {aws-short} {sts-first} and {gcp-short} WIF. With this support, backup is successfully completed without any `PartiallyFailed` status.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-5095[OADP-5095]

[id="resolved-issues-1-4-2_{context}"]
== Resolved issues

.DPA now reports errors if VSL contains an incorrect provider value 

Previously, if the provider of a Volume Snapshot Location (VSL) spec was incorrect, the Data Protection Application (DPA) reconciled successfully. With this update, DPA reports errors and requests for a valid provider value.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-5044[OADP-5044]

.Data Mover restore is successful irrespective of using different OADP namespaces for backup and restore

Previously, when backup operation was executed by using {oadp-short} installed in one namespace but was restored by using {oadp-short} installed in a different namespace, the Data Mover restore failed. With this update, Data Mover restore is now successful.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-5460[OADP-5460]

.SSE-C backup works with the calculated MD5 of the secret key

Previously, backup failed with the following error:
[source,terminal]
----
Requests specifying Server Side Encryption with Customer provided keys must provide the client calculated MD5 of the secret key.
----
With this update, missing Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C) base64 and MD5 hash are now fixed. As a result, SSE-C backup works with the calculated MD5 of the secret key. In addition, incorrect `errorhandling` for the `customerKey` size is also fixed.

[id="known-issues-1-4-2_{context}"]
== Known issues

.The nodeSelector spec is not supported for the Data Mover restore action

When a Data Protection Application (DPA) is created with the `nodeSelector` field set in the `nodeAgent` parameter, Data Mover restore partially fails instead of completing the restore operation. 
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-5260[OADP-5260]

.The S3 storage does not use proxy environment when TLS skip verify is specified

In the image registry backup, the S3 storage does not use the proxy environment when the `insecureSkipTLSVerify` parameter is set to `true`.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-3143[OADP-3143]

.Kopia does not delete artifacts after backup expiration

Even after you delete a backup, Kopia does not delete the volume artifacts from the `${bucket_name}/kopia/${namespace}` on the S3 location after backup expired. For more information, see "About Kopia repository maintenance".
