= Troubleshooting the control plane

Once Ironic is available, the installer will provision three control plane
nodes. For early failures, use IPMI to access the Baseboard Management
Controller (BMC) of each control plane node to see if it received any error
reports. You can also use a proprietary solution such as iDRAC or ILO.

If commands like `oc get clusteroperators` show degraded Operators when the
cluster comes up and after the installer destroys the bootstrap VM, it can be
useful to examine the logs of the Pods within the `openshift-kni-infra`
namespace.
