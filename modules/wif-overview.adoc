= Workload Identity Federation Overview

Workload Identity Federation (WIF) allows {product-title} on {GCP} customers to use federated identities instead of service account keys when creating the necessary credentials needed to access GCP resources. Credentials created using WIF are considered short-term and more secure, while credentials created using service account keys are considered long-term and less secure. WIF minimizes the rights granted to third parties such as Red Hat, and ensures all Google Cloud native IAM and best practices for securing Google Cloud services and infrastructure are followed.

The following bulleted items provides a basic overview of the Workload Identity Federation process:

* The owner of the {GCP} project binds the service accounts to principals that can be impersonated as specified by a workload identity pool.
* This workload identity pool is configured to authenticate requests using an Identity Provider (IP) that the user defines.
* For applications to get access to cloud resources, they first pass credentials to Google's Security Token Service (STS). STS uses the specified identity provider to verify the credentials.
* Once the credentials are verified, STS will return a temporary access token to the caller, giving the application the ability to impersonate the service account bound to that identity.

Operators also need access to cloud resources. By using Workload Identity Federation instead of service account keys to grant this access, cluster security is further strengthened, as service account keys would no longer be stored in the cluster. Instead, operators are given temporary access tokens that impersonate the service accounts. These tokens are short-lived and regularly rotated.

// * External applications authenticate to the identity provider.
// * The external application calls Google Security Token Service to exchange the account credentials for a short-lived Google Cloud access token.
// * The token can then be used to impersonate a service account and access Google Cloud resources.

[NOTE]
====
Migrating an existing non-WIF cluster to a WIF cluster is not supported. This feature can only be enabled during new cluster creation.
