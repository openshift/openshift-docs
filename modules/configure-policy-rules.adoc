= Configuring policy rules

[role="_abstract"]

You can use policy fields, or criteria, to create rules for your policies.

.Procedure

To create a policy rule:

. In the *Rules* section, configure the conditions that you want to trigger the policy. You can edit the rule titles and click *Add a new rule* to add an additional rule.
. For each rule, click and drag policy fields into the *Policy Section* to add policy fields or criteria.
+
[NOTE]
====
The policy fields that are available depend on the lifecycle stage you chose for the policy. For example, criteria under *Kubernetes access policies* or *Networking* are available when creating a policy for the runtime lifecycle, but not when creating a policy for the build lifecycle. See "Policy criteria" in the "Additional resources" section for more information about policy criteria, including information about criteria and the lifecycle phase in which they are available.
====
. For each field, you can select from options that are specific to the field. These differ depending on the type of field. For example:
* The default behavior for a value that is a string is to match on a policy field, and you click *Not* to indicate when you do not want the field to match.
* Some fields contain a value that is either `true` or `false`.
* Some fields require you to select a value from a drop-down list.
* If you select an attribute with Boolean values `Read-Only Root Filesystem`, the `READ-ONLY` and `WRITABLE` options are available.
* If you select an attribute with compound values `Environment variable`, you can enter values for the `Key`, `Value`, and `Value From` fields, and click the icon to add more values for the available options.
