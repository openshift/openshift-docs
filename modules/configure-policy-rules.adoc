= Configuring policy rules

[role="_abstract"]

You can use policy fields, or criteria, to create rules for your policies.

.Procedure

. In the *Rules* section, configure the conditions that you want to trigger the policy. You can edit the rule titles; for example, you can change `Rule 1` to something more descriptive. 
. For each rule, click and drag policy fields into the *Policy Section* to add policy fields or criteria.
+
[NOTE]
====
The policy fields that are available depend on the lifecycle stage you chose for the policy. For example, criteria under *Networking* or *Workload activity* are available when creating a policy for the runtime lifecycle, but not when creating a policy for the build lifecycle. For more information about policy criteria, including information about criteria and the lifecycle phase in which they are available, see "Policy criteria".
====
. For each field, you can select from options that are specific to the field. These differ depending on the type of field. For example:
* The default behavior for a value that is a string is to match on a policy field, and you click *Not* to indicate when you do not want the field to match.
* Some fields contain a value that is either `true` or `false`.
* Some fields require you to select a value from a drop-down list.
* If you select an attribute with Boolean values, such as `Read-Only Root Filesystem`, the `READ-ONLY` and `WRITABLE` options are available.
* If you select an attribute with compound values, such as `Environment variable`, you can enter values for the `Key`, `Value`, and `Value From` fields, and then click the icon to add more values for the available options.
