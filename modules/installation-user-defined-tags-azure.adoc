= Configuring user-defined tags for {azure-short}

In {product-title}, you can use tags for grouping resources and for managing resource access and cost. Tags are applied only to the resources created by the {product-title} installation program and its core Operators such as Machine API Operator, Cluster Ingress Operator, Cluster Image Registry Operator. The {product-title} consists of the following types of tags:

{product-title} tags:: By default, {product-title} installation program attaches the {product-title} tags to the {azure-short} resources. These {product-title} tags are not accessible to the users. The format of the {product-title} tags is `kubernetes.io_cluster.<cluster_id>:owned`, where `<cluster_id>` is the value of `.status.infrastructureName` in the infrastructure resource for the cluster.

User-defined tags:: User-defined tags are manually created in `install-config.yaml` file during installation. When creating the user-defined tags, you must consider the following points:

** User-defined tags on {azure-short} resources can only be defined during {product-title} cluster creation, and cannot be modified after the cluster is created.

** Support for user-defined tags is available only for the resources created in the {azure-short} Public Cloud.

** User-defined tags are not supported for the {product-title} clusters upgraded to {product-title} {product-version}.
