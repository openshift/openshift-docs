== Bug fixes

* Previously, the {KialiProduct} used the `k8s_cluster_info` Ansible module from the `kubernetes.core` collection, which could fail in some environments with a result code of `-9`. This failure occurred during the `Get api version information from the cluster` Ansible task and prevented the Operator from reconciling Kiali custom resources (CRs). Now, the fix removes the use of the `k8s_cluster_info` Ansible module to prevent this error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-9659[OSSM-9659])
