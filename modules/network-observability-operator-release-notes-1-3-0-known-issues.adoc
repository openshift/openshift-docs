= Network Observability Operator 1.3.0 known issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the following issues and their workarounds, if available, to troubleshoot issues with the Network Observability Operator 1.3.0 release.

* When `processor.metrics.tls` is set to `PROVIDED` in the `FlowCollector`, the `flowlogs-pipeline` `servicemonitor` is not adapted to the TLS scheme. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1087[*NETOBSERV-1087*])

* Since the 1.2.0 release of the Network Observability Operator, using {loki-op} 5.6, a Loki certificate change periodically affects the `flowlogs-pipeline` pods and results in dropped flows rather than flows written to Loki. The problem self-corrects after some time, but it still causes temporary flow data loss during the Loki certificate change. This issue has only been observed in large-scale environments of 120 nodes or greater.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-980[*NETOBSERV-980*])

* When you install the Operator, a warning kernel taint can appear. The reason for this error is that the network observability eBPF agent has memory constraints that prevent preallocating the entire hashmap table. The Operator eBPF agent sets the `BPF_F_NO_PREALLOC` flag so that pre-allocation is disabled when the hashmap is too memory expansive.
