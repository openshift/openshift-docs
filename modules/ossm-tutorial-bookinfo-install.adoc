= Installing the Bookinfo application

This tutorial walks you through how to create a sample application by creating a project, deploying the Bookinfo application to that project, and viewing the running application in {SMProductShortName}.

.Prerequisites:

* {product-title} 4.1 or higher installed.
* {SMProductName} {SMProductVersion} installed.
* Access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to {product-title} as`cluster-admin`.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to {product-title} as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]

ifndef::openshift-rosa[]
[NOTE]
====
The Bookinfo sample application cannot be installed on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-power-name}.
====

endif::openshift-rosa[]
[NOTE]
====
The commands in this section assume the {SMProductShortName} control plane project is `istio-system`.  If you installed the control plane in another namespace, edit each command before you run it.
====

.Procedure

. Click *Home* -> *Projects*.

. Click *Create Project*.

. Enter `bookinfo` as the *Project Name*, enter a *Display Name*, and enter a *Description*, then click *Create*.
+
** Alternatively, you can run this command from the CLI to create the `bookinfo` project.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project bookinfo
----
+
. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the *Project* menu and use the {SMProductShortName} control plane namespace. In this example, use `istio-system`.

. Click the *{SMProductName}* Operator.

. Click the *Istio Service Mesh Member Roll* tab.

.. If you have already created a Istio Service Mesh Member Roll, click the name, then click the YAML tab to open the YAML editor.

.. If you have not created a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`, click *Create ServiceMeshMemberRoll*.
+
. Click *Members*, then enter the name of your project in the *Value* field.
+
. Click *Create* to save the updated Service Mesh Member Roll.
+
.. Or, save the following example to a YAML file.
+
.Bookinfo ServiceMeshMemberRoll example servicemeshmemberroll-default.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  members:
  - bookinfo
----
+
.. Run the following command to upload that file and create the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource in the `istio-system` namespace.   In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the {SMProductShortName} control plane project.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n istio-system -f servicemeshmemberroll-default.yaml
----
+
. Run the following command to verify the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` was created successfully.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get smmr -n istio-system -o wide
----
+
The installation has finished successfully when the `STATUS` column is `Configured`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      READY   STATUS       AGE   MEMBERS
default   1/1     Configured   70s   ["bookinfo"]
----
. From the CLI, deploy the Bookinfo application in the _`bookinfo`_ project by applying the `bookinfo.yaml` file:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-{MaistraVersion}/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
----
+
You should see output similar to the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
service/details created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-details created
deployment.apps/details-v1 created
service/ratings created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-ratings created
deployment.apps/ratings-v1 created
service/reviews created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-reviews created
deployment.apps/reviews-v1 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v2 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v3 created
service/productpage created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-productpage created
deployment.apps/productpage-v1 created
----
+
. Create the ingress gateway by applying the `bookinfo-gateway.yaml` file:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-{MaistraVersion}/samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
----
+
You should see output similar to the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
gateway.networking.istio.io/bookinfo-gateway created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/bookinfo created
----
+
. Set the value for the `GATEWAY_URL` parameter:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----
