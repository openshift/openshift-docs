= Installing the Bookinfo application

This tutorial walks you through creating a Bookinfo project, deploying the Bookinfo application, and running Bookinfo  on {product-title} with {ProductShortName} {ProductVersion}.

[WARNING]
====
The Bookinfo example application allows you to test your {ProductName} {ProductVersion} installation on {product-title}.

Red Hat does not provide support for the Bookinfo application.
====

.Prerequisites:

* {product-title} 4.1 or higher installed.
* {ProductName} {ProductVersion} installed.
* Access to the {product-title} Command-line Interface (CLI) also known as `oc`.

[NOTE]
====
{ProductName} implements auto-injection differently than the upstream Istio project, therefore this procedure uses a version of the `bookinfo.yaml` file annotated to enable automatic injection of the Istio sidecar for {ProductName}.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with cluster-admin rights.

. Click to *Home* -> *Projects*.

. Click *Create Project*.

. Enter `bookinfo` as the *Project Name*, enter a *Display Name*, and enter a *Description*, then click *Create*.
+
** Alternatively, you can run this command from the CLI to create the `bookinfo` project.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project bookinfo
----
+
. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the *Project* menu and use the control plane namespace. In this example, use `istio-system`.

. Click the *{ProductName}* Operator.

. Click the *Istio Service Mesh Member Roll* link.

.. If you have already created a Istio Service Mesh Member Roll, click the name, then click the YAML tab to open the YAML editor.

.. If you have not created a Istio Service Mesh Member Roll, click *Create Service Mesh Member Roll*.
+
[NOTE]
====
You need cluster-admin rights to edit the Istio Service Mesh Member Roll.
====
+
. Edit the default Service Mesh Member Roll YAML and add `bookinfo` to the *members* list.
+
.Bookinfo ServiceMeshMemberRoll example

[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
  kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
  metadata:
    name: default
  spec:
    members:
    - bookinfo
----
+
** Alternatively, you can run this command from the CLI to add the `bookinfo` project to the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`. Replace `<control_plane_project>` with the name of your control plane project.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <control_plane_project> patch --type='json' smmr default -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/members", "value":["'"bookinfo"'"]}]'
----
+
. Click *Create* to save the updated Service Mesh Member Roll.

. From the CLI, deploy the Bookinfo application in the _`bookinfo`_ project by applying the `bookinfo.yaml` file:
+

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-{MaistraVersion}/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
----
+
. Create the ingress gateway by applying the `bookinfo-gateway.yaml` file:
+

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-{MaistraVersion}/samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
----
+
. Set the value for the `GATEWAY_URL` parameter:
+
[NOTE]
====
Replace `<control_plane_project>` with the name of your control plane project. In this example, the control plane project is `istio-system`.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n <control_plane_project> get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
