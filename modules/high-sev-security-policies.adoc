|Deploy |Environment Variable Contains Secret |Alerts when deployments have environment variables that contain 'SECRET'. |Enabled
|Deploy |Fixable CVSS >= 6 and Privileged |Alerts when deployments run in privileged mode with fixable vulnerabilities that have a CVSS of at least 6. |Disabled by default in version 3.72.0 and later
|Deploy | Privileged Containers with Important and Critical Fixable CVEs |Alerts when containers that run in privileged mode have important or critical fixable vulnerabilities. |Enabled

|Runtime |iptables Execution |Detects when someone runs iptables, which is a deprecated way of managing network states in containers. |Enabled
|Runtime |Kubernetes Actions: Exec into Pod |Alerts when the Kubernetes API receives a request to run a command in a container. |Enabled
|Runtime |Linux Group Add Execution |Detects when someone runs the addgroup or groupadd binary to add a Linux group. |Enabled

|Runtime |Login Binaries |Indicates when someone tries to log in. |Disabled
|Runtime |Network Management Execution |Detects when someone runs binary files that can manipulate network configuration and management. |Enabled

|Runtime |Process Targeting Cluster Kubelet Endpoint |Detects the misuse of the healthz, kubelet API, or heapster endpoint. |Enabled
|Runtime |Process Targeting Cluster Kubernetes Docker Stats Endpoint |Detects the misuse of the Kubernetes docker stats endpoint. |Enabled
|Runtime |Process Targeting Kubernetes Service Endpoint |Detects the misuse of the Kubernetes Service API endpoint. |Enabled
|Runtime |Process with UID 0 |Alerts when deployments contain processes that run with UID 0. |Disabled
|Runtime |Secure Shell Server (sshd) Execution |Detects containers that run the SSH daemon. |Enabled
