The following table lists the default security policies in {product-title} that are of high severity. The policies are organized by lifecycle stage.

.High severity security policies
[options="header"]
|====
|Life cycle stage |Name |Description | Status
|Build or Deploy |Fixable Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) >= 7 |Alerts when deployments with fixable vulnerabilities have a CVSS of at least 7. However, Red{nbsp}Hat recommends that you create policies using Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) severity instead of CVSS score. |Disabled
|Build or Deploy |Fixable Severity at least Important |Alerts when deployments with fixable vulnerabilities have a severity rating of at least Important. |Enabled
|Build or Deploy |Rapid Reset: Denial of Service Vulnerability in HTTP/2 Protocol |Alerts on deployments with images containing components that are susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability for HTTP/2 servers. This addresses a flaw in the handling of multiplexed streams in HTTP/2. A client can rapidly create a request and immediately reset them, which creates extra work for the server while avoiding hitting any server-side limits, resulting in a denial of service attack. To use this policy, consider cloning the policy and adding the `Fixable` policy criteria before enabling it. |Disabled
|Build or Deploy |Secure Shell (ssh) Port Exposed in Image |Alerts when deployments expose port 22, which is commonly reserved for SSH access. |Enabled
|Deploy |Emergency Deployment Annotation |Alerts when deployments use the emergency annotation, such as "admission.stackrox.io/break-glass":"ticket-1234" to circumvent StackRox Admission controller checks. |Enabled
|Deploy |Environment Variable Contains Secret |Alerts when deployments have environment variables that contain 'SECRET'. |Enabled
|Deploy |Fixable CVSS >= 6 and Privileged |Alerts when deployments run in privileged mode with fixable vulnerabilities that have a CVSS of at least 6. However, Red{nbsp}Hat recommends that you create policies using CVE severity instead of CVSS score. |Disabled by default in version 3.72.0 and later
|Deploy | Privileged Containers with Important and Critical Fixable CVEs |Alerts when containers that run in privileged mode have important or critical fixable vulnerabilities. |Enabled
|Deploy |Secret Mounted as Environment Variable |Alerts when a deployment has a Kubernetes secret that is mounted as an environment variable. |Disabled
|Deploy |Secure Shell (ssh) Port Exposed |Alerts when deployments expose port 22, which is commonly reserved for SSH access. |Enabled
|Runtime |Cryptocurrency Mining Process Execution |Spawns the crypto-currency mining process. |Enabled
|Runtime |iptables Execution |Detects when someone runs iptables, which is a deprecated way of managing network states in containers. |Enabled
|Runtime |Kubernetes Actions: Exec into Pod |Alerts when the Kubernetes API receives a request to run a command in a container. |Enabled
|Runtime |Linux Group Add Execution |Detects when someone runs the addgroup or groupadd binary to add a Linux group. |Enabled
|Runtime |Linux User Add Execution |Detects when someone runs the useradd or adduser binary to add a Linux user. |Enabled
|Runtime |Login Binaries |Indicates when someone tries to log in. |Disabled
|Runtime |Network Management Execution |Detects when someone runs binary files that can manipulate network configuration and management. |Enabled
|Runtime |nmap Execution |Alerts when someone starts the nmap process in a container during run time. |Enabled
|Runtime |OpenShift: Kubeadmin Secret Accessed |Alerts when someone accesses the kubeadmin secret. |Enabled
|Runtime |Password Binaries |Indicates when someone attempts to change a password. |Disabled
|Runtime |Process Targeting Cluster Kubelet Endpoint |Detects the misuse of the healthz, kubelet API, or heapster endpoint. |Enabled
|Runtime |Process Targeting Cluster Kubernetes Docker Stats Endpoint |Detects the misuse of the Kubernetes docker stats endpoint. |Enabled
|Runtime |Process Targeting Kubernetes Service Endpoint |Detects the misuse of the Kubernetes Service API endpoint. |Enabled
|Runtime |Process with UID 0 |Alerts when deployments contain processes that run with UID 0. |Disabled
|Runtime |Secure Shell Server (sshd) Execution |Detects containers that run the SSH daemon. |Enabled
|Runtime |SetUID Processes |Use setuid binary files, which permit people to run certain programs with escalated privileges. |Disabled
|Runtime |Shadow File Modification |Indicates when someone tries to modify shadow files. |Disabled
|Runtime |Shell Spawned by Java Application |Detects when a shell, such as bash, csh, sh, or zsh, is run as a subprocess of a Java application. |Enabled
|Runtime |Unauthorized Network Flow |Generates a violation for any network flows that fall outside of the baselines of the "alert on anomalous violations" setting. |Enabled
|Runtime |Unauthorized Processed Execution |Generates a violation for any process execution that is not explicitly allowed by a locked process baseline for a container specification in a Kubernetes deployment. |Enabled
