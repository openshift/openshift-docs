= About the cluster high-availability mode API

{product-title} provides a cluster high-availability mode API that can be used by Operators to help detect infrastructure topology. The Infrastructure API holds cluster-wide information regarding infrastructure. Operators managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can use the Infrastructure API if they need to configure an Operand or managed workload differently based on the high-availability mode.

In the Infrastructure API, the `infrastructureTopology` status expresses the expectations for infrastructure services that do not run on control plane nodes, usually indicated by a node selector for a `role` value other than `master`. The `controlPlaneTopology` status expresses the expectations for Operands that normally run on control plane nodes.

The default setting for either status is `HighlyAvailable`, which represents the behavior Operators have in multiple node clusters. The `SingleReplica` setting is used in single-node clusters, also known as {sno}, and indicates that Operators should not configure their Operands for high-availability operation.

The {product-title} installer sets the `controlPlaneTopology` and `infrastructureTopology` status fields based on the replica counts for the cluster when it is created, according to the following rules:

* When the control plane replica count is less than 3, the `controlPlaneTopology` status is set to `SingleReplica`. Otherwise, it is set to `HighlyAvailable`.
* When the worker replica count is 0, the control plane nodes are also configured as workers. Therefore, the `infrastructureTopology` status will be the same as the `controlPlaneTopology` status.
* When the worker replica count is 1, the `infrastructureTopology` is set to `SingleReplica`. Otherwise, it is set to `HighlyAvailable`.
