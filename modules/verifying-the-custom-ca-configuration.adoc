= Verifying the custom CA configuration

After you add your custom CA certificate, you can verify that it has been successfully added to the cluster-wide trust bundle.

.Prerequisites

* You have permissions to view `ConfigMap` objects in the openshift-config namespace.

* You have the {oc-first} installed.

.Procedure

. Run the following command to view the contents of the cluster-wide CA trust bundle:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap trusted-ca-bundle -n openshift-config -o yaml
----

. In the YAML output, inspect the `data.ca-bundle.crt` field. This field contains all the trusted certificates for the cluster.

. Verify that the PEM-encoded certificate you added is included in the list of certificates. The output will resemble the following structure:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: trusted-ca-bundle
  namespace: openshift-config
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <A_SYSTEM_CA_CERTIFICATE>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <ANOTHER_SYSTEM_CA_CERTIFICATE>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <YOUR_CUSTOM_CA_CERTIFICATE_SHOULD_BE_HERE>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
If your certificate is present in the output, the cluster now trusts your custom PKI.
