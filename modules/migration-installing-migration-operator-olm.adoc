= Installing the CAM Operator with OLM

You can install the CAM Operator on the {product-title} 4 cluster with OLM. The CAM Operator installs the Cluster Application Migration tool on this cluster by default.

.Procedure

. Click *Administration* -> *Namespaces*.
. On the *Namespaces* page:
.. Click *Create Namespace*.
.. Enter `openshift-migration` in the *Name* field and click *Create*.

. Click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.
. On the *OperatorHub* page:
.. Scroll or type a keyword into the *Filter by keyword* field (in this case, *Migration*) to find the *Cluster Application Migration Operator*.
.. Select the *Cluster Application Migration Operator* and click *Install*.

. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page:
.. Select the *openshift-migration* namespace if it is not already selected.
.. Select an *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy.
.. Click *Subscribe*.

. Click *Catalog* -> *Installed Operators*. The *Cluster Application Migration Operator* is listed in the *openshift-migration* project with the status *InstallSucceeded*.

. On the *Installed Operators* page:

.. Under *Provided APIs*, click *View 12 more...*.
.. Click *Create New* -> *MigrationController*.

.. If you are installing the CAM Operator on an {product-title} _4.1_ cluster, add the following parameter:
+
----
spec:
  deprecated_cors_configuration: true
----

.. If you are installing the CAM Operator on an {product-title} 4 _source_ cluster, update the following parameter values so that the migration controller and CAM web console are not installed:

----
spec:

----

.. Click *Create*.

. If you installed the migration controller on this cluster:

.. Click *Workloads* -> *Pods* to verify that the controller manager, migration UI, Restic, and Velero pods are running.
