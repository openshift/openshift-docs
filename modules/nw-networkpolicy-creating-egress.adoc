= Egress network policies

By default, if no egress network policy is applied to a pod, then that pod is not isolated for egress traffic.  When a pod is not isolated for egress, all network egress is allowed _from_ the pod. 

With egress network policies, cluster administrators can explicitly restrict or allow outbound traffic to specified destinations. When an egress network policy is applied to a pod, then that pod is made _isolated_ for egress traffic. For isolated pods, egress traffic is allowed _only_ if it permitted by at least one of the egress network policies that applies to it.

Egress network policies help to ensure that only traffic intended for external destinations can leave the cluster or namespace, depending on configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Before configuring an egress network policy, cluster administrators should configure an ingress network policy. Attempting to configure both at the same time can make it difficult to determine which network policy is blocking traffic.

* Egress network policies are harder to effectively implement than ingress network policies. Restricting outbound traffic might lead to unexpected issues.
