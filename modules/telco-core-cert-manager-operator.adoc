= cert-manager Operator

New in this release::
* The cert-manager Operator is a new optional component in this release.

Description::
+
--
The cert-manager Operator for {product-title} manages the lifecycle of TLS certificates for cluster components and workloads.
The cert-manager Operator automates certificate issuance, renewal, and rotation, eliminating manual certificate management.
The reference configuration includes the cert-manager Operator to optionally manage certificates for the API server and ingress controller endpoints.
--

Limits and requirements::

* The reference configuration includes only the ACME DNS01 challenge type for platform certificate issuance.

Engineering considerations::

* Use {rh-rhacm} `CertificatePolicy` resources on the hub cluster to monitor certificate expiration and compliance across managed clusters.
