= Gathering the observability data from different clusters with the OpenTelemetry Collector

For a multicluster configuration, you can create one OpenTelemetry Collector instance in each one of the remote clusters and then forward all the telemetry data to one OpenTelemetry Collector instance.

.Prerequisites

* The {OTELOperator} is installed.
* The {TempoOperator} is installed.
* A TempoStack instance is deployed on the cluster.
* The following mounted certificates: Issuer, self-signed certificate, CA issuer, client and server certificates. To create any of these certificates, see step 1.

.Procedure

. Mount the following certificates in the OpenTelemetry Collector instance, skipping already mounted certificates.

.. An Issuer to generate the certificates by using the {cert-manager-operator}.
