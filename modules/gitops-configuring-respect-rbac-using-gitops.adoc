= Configuring respectRBAC using {gitops-title}

The `respectRBAC` feature in Argo CD controls how Argo CD watches resources on a cluster. By default, Argo CD attempts to watch all Kubernetes resources (CRDs) on a cluster at the cluster scope. With the `respectRBAC` feature, you can restrict the ArgoCD controller from discovering or syncing specific resources using only controller RBAC, without manually configuring resource exclusions.

To enable this feature, set the `.spec.controller.respectRBAC` key in the Argo CD resource. After you set this key, the controller automatically stops watching resources it cannot list or access. For example, this prevents a situation where the Argo CD cluster role restricts Argo CD from watching OpenShift Routes, which would otherwise result in an error during synchronization, stating that it cannot watch the resource.

You can enable the `respectRBAC` feature by creating an Argo CD instance through the command-line interface (CLI) or the web console.

.Prerequisites

Ensure that you created and updated a namespace in the `Subscription` resource, so `Subscription` can host a cluster-scoped Argo CD instance. For more information, see "Using an Argo CD instance to manage cluster-scoped resources".
