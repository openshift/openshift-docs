= Proxy support for {hcp}

[role="_abstract"]
To ensure that control-plane workloads, compute nodes, management clusters, and hosted clusters have the access they need for optimal performance, you can configure proxy support.

In standalone {product-title}, proxy support is mainly about ensuring that workloads in the cluster are configured to use the HTTP or HTTPS proxy to access external services, honoring the `NO_PROXY` setting if one is configured, and accepting any trust bundle that is configured for the proxy.

In {hcp}, proxy support includes use cases beyond those in standalone {product-title}.
