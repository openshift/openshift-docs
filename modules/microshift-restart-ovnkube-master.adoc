The following procedure restarts the `ovnkube-master` pod.

.Prerequisites

* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.

Use the following steps to restart the `ovnkube-master` pod.

. Access the remote cluster by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/kubeconfig
----

. Find the name of the `ovnkube-master` pod that you want to restart by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ pod=$(oc get pods -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes | awk -F " " '/ovnkube-master/{print $1}')
----

. Delete the `ovnkube-master` pod by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes delete pod $pod
----

. Confirm that a new `ovnkube-master` pod is running by using the following command:

[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes
