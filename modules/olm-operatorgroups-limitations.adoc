= Limitations for multi-tenant Operator management

{product-title} provides limited support for simultaneously installing different variations of an Operator on a cluster. Operators are control plane extensions. All tenants, or namespaces, share the same control plane of a cluster. Therefore, tenants in a multi-tenant environment also have to share Operators.

The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) installs Operators multiple times in different namespaces. One constraint of this is that the Operator’s API versions must be the same.

Different major versions of an Operator often have incompatible custom resource definitions (CRDs). This makes it difficult to quickly verify OLMs.
