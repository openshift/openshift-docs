= Optional: Configuring polling operations for NUMA resources updates

The daemons controlled by the NUMA Resources Operator in their `nodeGroup` poll resources to retrieve updates about available NUMA resources. You can fine-tune polling operations for these daemons by configuring the `spec.nodeGroups` specification in the `NUMAResourcesOperator` custom resource (CR). This provides advanced control of polling operations. Configure these specifications to improve scheduling behavior and troubleshoot suboptimal scheduling decisions.

The configuration options are the following:

* `infoRefreshMode`: Determines the trigger condition for polling the kubelet. The NUMA Resources Operator reports the resulting information to the API server.
* `infoRefreshPeriod`: Determines the duration between polling updates.
* `podsFingerprinting`: Determines if point-in-time information for the current set of pods running on a node is exposed in polling updates.
+
[NOTE]
====
The default value for `podsFingerprinting` is `EnabledExclusiveResources`. To optimize scheduler performance, set `podsFingerprinting` to either `EnabledExclusiveResources` or `Enabled`. Additionally, configure the `cacheResyncPeriod` in the `NUMAResourcesScheduler` custom resource (CR) to a value greater than 0. The `cacheResyncPeriod` specification helps to report more exact resource availability by monitoring pending resources on nodes.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Install the NUMA Resources Operator.

.Procedure

* Configure the `spec.nodeGroups` specification in your `NUMAResourcesOperator` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesOperator
metadata:
  name: numaresourcesoperator
spec:
  nodeGroups:
  - config:
      infoRefreshMode: Periodic <1>
      infoRefreshPeriod: 10s <2>
      podsFingerprinting: Enabled <3>
    name: worker
----
<1> Valid values are `Periodic`, `Events`, `PeriodicAndEvents`. Use `Periodic` to poll the kubelet at intervals that you define in `infoRefreshPeriod`. Use `Events` to poll the kubelet at every pod lifecycle event. Use `PeriodicAndEvents` to enable both methods.
<2> Define the polling interval for `Periodic` or `PeriodicAndEvents` refresh modes. The field is ignored if the refresh mode is `Events`.
<3> Valid values are `Enabled`, `Disabled`, and `EnabledExclusiveResources`. Setting to `Enabled` or `EnabledExclusiveResources` is a requirement for the `cacheResyncPeriod` specification in the `NUMAResourcesScheduler`.

.Verification

. After you deploy the NUMA Resources Operator, verify that the node group configurations were applied by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get numaresop numaresourcesoperator -o json | jq '.status'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
      ...

        "config": {
        "infoRefreshMode": "Periodic",
        "infoRefreshPeriod": "10s",
        "podsFingerprinting": "Enabled"
      },
      "name": "worker"

      ...
