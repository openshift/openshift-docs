= Jenkins authentication

Jenkins authentication is used by default if the image is run directly, without
using a template.

The first time Jenkins starts, the configuration is created along with the
administrator user and password. The default user credentials are `admin` and
`password`. Configure the default password by setting the `JENKINS_PASSWORD`
environment variable when using, and only when using, standard Jenkins
authentication.

.Procedure
