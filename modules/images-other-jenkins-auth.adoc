= Jenkins authentication

Jenkins authentication is used by default if the image is run directly, without using a template.

The first time Jenkins starts, the configuration is created along with the administrator user and password. The default user credentials are `admin` and `password`. Configure the default password by setting the `JENKINS_PASSWORD` environment variable when using, and only when using, standard Jenkins authentication.

.Procedure
