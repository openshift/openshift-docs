= Projecting the binding metadata

Depending on your workload requirements and environment, you can choose to project the binding metadata either as files or environment variables.

.Prerequisites

* You have understood the following concepts:
** Environment and requirements of your workload, and how it works with the provided services.
** Consumption of the binding metadata in your workload resource.
** Configuration of how the final path for metadata projection is computed for the default method.
* The binding metadata is exposed from the backing service.

.Procedure

. To project the binding metadata as files, determine the destination folder by ensuring that the existing `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` environment variable is present in the container where your workload runs.
. To project the binding metadata as environment variables, set the value for the `.spec.bindAsFiles` parameter to `false` from the `ServiceBinding` resource in the custom resource definition (CRD).
