= Lowering latency in {microshift-short} applications

Latency is defined as the time from an event to the response to that event. You can use low latency configurations and tuning in a {microshift-short} node running in an operational or software-defined control system where an edge device has to respond quickly to an external event. You can fully optimize low latency performance by combining {microshift-short} configurations with operating system tuning and workload partitioning.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The CPU set for management applications, such as the {microshift-short} service, OVS, CRI-O, {microshift-short} pods, and isolated cores, must contain all-online CPUs.

== Workflow for configuring low latency for {microshift-short} applications
To configure low latency for applications running in a {microshift-short} node, you must complete the following tasks:

Required::
* Install the `microshift-low-latency` RPM.
* Configure workload partitioning.
* Configure the `kubelet` section of the `config.yaml` file in the `/etc/microshift/` directory.
* Configure and activate a TuneD profile. TuneD is a {op-system-base-full} service that monitors the host system and optimizes performance under certain workloads.
* Restart the host.

Optional::
* If you are using the x86_64 architecture, you can install link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_real_time/9[Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Real Time 9].
