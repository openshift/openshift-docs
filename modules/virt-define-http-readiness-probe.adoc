= Defining an HTTP readiness probe

Define an HTTP readiness probe by setting the `spec.readinessProbe.httpGet` field of the virtual machine (VM) configuration.


.Procedure
. Include details of the readiness probe in the VM configuration file.

.Sample readiness probe with an HTTP GET test
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  readinessProbe:
    httpGet: <1>
      port: 1500 <2>
      path: /healthz <3>
      httpHeaders:
      - name: Custom-Header
        value: Awesome
    initialDelaySeconds: 120 <4>
    periodSeconds: 20 <5>
    timeoutSeconds: 10 <6>
    failureThreshold: 3 <7>
    successThreshold: 3 <8>
# ...
----
<1> The HTTP GET request to perform to connect to the VM.
<2> The port of the VM that the probe queries. In the above example, the probe queries port 1500.
<3> The path to access on the HTTP server. In the above example, if the handler for the serverâ€™s /healthz path returns a success code, the VM is considered to be healthy. If the handler returns a failure code, the VM is removed from the list of available endpoints.
<4> The time, in seconds, after the VM starts before the readiness probe is initiated.
<5> The delay, in seconds, between performing probes. The default delay is 10 seconds. This value must be greater than `timeoutSeconds`.
<6> The number of seconds of inactivity after which the probe times out and the VM is assumed to have failed. The default value is 1. This value must be lower than `periodSeconds`.
<7> The number of times that the probe is allowed to fail. The default is 3. After the specified number of attempts, the pod is marked `Unready`.
<8> The number of times that the probe must report success, after a failure, to be considered successful. The default is 1.

. Create the VM by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
