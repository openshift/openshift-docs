= Defining an HTTP readiness probe

Define an HTTP readiness probe by setting the `spec.readinessProbe.httpGet` field of the virtual machine instance (VMI) configuration.


.Procedure
. Include details of the readiness probe in the VMI configuration file.

.Sample readiness probe with an HTTP GET test
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  readinessProbe:
    httpGet: <1>
      port: 1500 <2>
      path: /healthz <3>
      httpHeaders:
      - name: Custom-Header
        value: Awesome
    initialDelaySeconds: 120 <4>
    periodSeconds: 20 <5>
    timeoutSeconds: 10 <6>
    failureThreshold: 3 <7>
    successThreshold: 3 <8>
# ...
----
<1> The HTTP GET request to perform to connect to the VMI.
<2> The port of the VMI that the probe queries. In the above example, the probe queries port 1500.
<3> The path to access on the HTTP server. In the above example, if the handler for the server’s /healthz path returns a success code, the VMI is considered to be healthy. If the handler returns a failure code, the VMI is removed from the list of available endpoints.
<4> The time, in seconds, after the VMI starts before the readiness probe is initiated.
<5> The delay, in seconds, between performing probes. The default delay is 10 seconds. This value must be greater than `timeoutSeconds`.
<6> The number of seconds of inactivity after which the probe times out and the VMI is assumed to have failed. The default value is 1. This value must be lower than `periodSeconds`.
<7> The number of times that the probe is allowed to fail. The default is 3. After the specified number of attempts, the pod is marked `Unready`.
<8> The number of times that the probe must report success, after a failure, to be considered successful. The default is 1.

. Create the VMI by running the following command:

[source,terminal]

$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
