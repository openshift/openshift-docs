= Enabling the PersistentReservation feature gate

You can enable the SCSI `persistentReservation` feature gate and allow a LUN-backed block mode virtual machine (VM) disk to be shared among multiple virtual machines.

The `persistentReservation` feature gate is disabled by default. You can enable the `persistentReservation` feature gate by using the web console or the command line.

.Prerequisites

* Cluster administrator privileges are required.
* The volume access mode `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) is required if the VMs that are sharing disks are running on different nodes. If the VMs that are sharing disks are running on the same node, the `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO) volume access mode is sufficient.
* The storage provider must support a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver that uses the SCSI protocol.
