= Ingress controller endpoint publishing strategy

*`NodePortService` endpoint publishing strategy*

The `NodePortService` endpoint publishing strategy publishes the Ingress Controller using a Kubernetes NodePort service.

In this configuration, the Ingress Controller deployment uses container networking. A `NodePortService` is created to publish the deployment. The specific node ports are dynamically allocated by {product-title}; however, to support static port allocations, your changes to the node port field of the managed `NodePortService` are preserved.

[NOTE]
====
The Ingress Operator ignores any updates to `.spec.ports[].nodePort` fields of the service.

By default, ports are allocated automatically and you can access the port allocations for integrations. However, sometimes static port allocations are necessary to integrate with existing infrastructure which may not be easily reconfigured in response to dynamic ports. To achieve integrations with static node ports, you can update the managed service resource directly.

*`HostNetwork` endpoint publishing strategy*

The `HostNetwork` endpoint publishing strategy publishes the Ingress Controller on node ports where the Ingress Controller is deployed.

An Ingress controller with the `HostNetwork` endpoint publishing strategy can have only one pod replica per node. If you want _n_ replicas, you must use at least _n_ nodes where those replicas can be scheduled. Because each pod replica requests ports `80` and `443` on the node host where it is scheduled, a replica cannot be scheduled to a node if another pod on the same node is using those ports.
