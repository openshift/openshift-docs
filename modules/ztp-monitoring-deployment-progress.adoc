= Monitoring deployment progress

The ArgoCD pipeline uses the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs in Git to generate the cluster configuration CRs & {rh-rhacm} policies and then sync them to the hub. The progress of this synchronization can be monitored in the ArgoCD dashboard.

.Procedure

When the synchronization is complete, the installation generally proceeds in two phases:

. The Assisted Service Operator installs OpenShift on the cluster. You can monitor the progress of cluster installation from the {rh-rhacm} dashboard or from the command line:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTER=<clusterName>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get agentclusterinstall -n $CLUSTER $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Completed")]}' | jq
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -sk $(oc get agentclusterinstall -n $CLUSTER $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.debugInfo.eventsURL}')  | jq '.[-2,-1]'
----

. The Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator (TALO) applies the configuration policies that are bound to the cluster.
+
After the cluster installation is complete and the cluster becomes `Ready`, a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR corresponding to this cluster, with a list of ordered policies defined by the `ran.openshift.io/ztp-deploy-wave annotations`, is automatically created by TALO. The cluster's policies are applied in the order listed in `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. The high-level progress of configuration policy reconciliation can be monitored using the following commmands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTER=<clusterName>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clustergroupupgrades -n ztp-install $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")]}'
----

. You can monitor the detailed policy compliant status using the {rh-rhacm} dashboard or the command line:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies -n $CLUSTER
----

The final policy that becomes compliant is the one defined in the `*-du-validator-policy` policies. This policy, when compliant on a cluster, ensures that all cluster configuration, Operator installation, and Operator configuration has completed.

After all policies become complaint, the `ztp-done` label is added to the cluster, indicating the entire ZTP pipeline has completed for the cluster.
