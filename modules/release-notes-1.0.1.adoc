== Bug fixes in {product-title} version 1.0.1

* Previously, leader election for {product-title} was not configured to tolerate disruption, which resulted in frequent crashing. With this release, the leader election values for {product-title} have been updated to match the durations recommended for {platform}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-58496[OCPBUGS-58496])

* Previously, the `ReadyReplicas` count was not set in the reconciler, which meant that the {product-title} Operator status would report that there were no replicas ready. With this release, the `ReadyReplicas` count is based on the number of ready replicas for the deployment, which ensures that the Operator shows as ready in the {platform} console when the `kueue-controller-manager` pods are ready. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59261[OCPBUGS-59261])

* Previously, when the `Kueue` custom resource (CR) was deleted from the `openshift-kueue-operator` namespace, the `kueue-manager-config` config map was not deleted automatically and could remain in the namespace. With this release, the `kueue-manager-config` config map, `kueue-webhook-server-cert` secret, and `metrics-server-cert` secret are deleted automatically when the `Kueue` CR is deleted.
