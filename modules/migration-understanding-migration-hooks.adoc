= About migration hooks

You can use migration hooks to run Ansible playbooks at certain points during the migration. The hooks are added when you create a migration plan.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not want to use Ansible playbooks, you can create a custom container image and add it to a migration plan.
====

Migration hooks perform tasks such as customizing application quiescence, manually migrating unsupported data types, and updating applications after migration.

A single migration hook runs on a source or target cluster at one of the following migration steps:

* PreBackup: Before backup tasks are started on the source cluster
* PostBackup: After backup tasks are complete on the source cluster
* PreRestore: Before restore tasks are started on the target cluster
* PostRestore: After restore tasks are complete on the target cluster
+
You can assign one hook to each migration step, up to a maximum of four hooks for a single migration plan.

The default `hook-runner` image is `registry.redhat.io/rhcam-1-2/openshift-migration-hook-runner-rhel7`. This image is based on Ansible Runner and includes `python-openshift` for Ansible Kubernetes resources and an updated `oc` binary. You can also create your own hook image with additional Ansible modules or tools.

The Ansible playbook is mounted on a hook container as a ConfigMap. The hook container runs as a Job on a cluster with a specified service account and namespace. The Job runs, even if the initial Pod is evicted or killed, until it reaches the default `backoffLimit` (`6`) or successful completion.
