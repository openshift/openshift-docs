= Add a service certificate

To secure communication to your service, generate a
signed serving certificate and key pair into a secret in the same
namespace as the service.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The generated certificate is only valid for the internal service DNS name
`<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc`, and are only valid for
internal communications.
====

.Prerequisites:

* You must have a service defined.

.Procedure

. Annotate the service with `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate service <service_name> \//<1>
     service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name=<secret_name> //<2>
----
<1> Replace `<service_name>` with the name of the service to secure.
<2> `<secret_name>` will be the name of the generated secret containing the
certificate and key pair. For convenience, it is recommended that this
be the same as `<service_name>`.
+
For example, use the following command to annotate the service `test1`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate service test1 service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name=test1
----

. Examine the service to confirm that the annotations are present:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe service <service_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
...
Annotations:              service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: <service_name>
                          service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-signed-by: openshift-service-serving-signer@1556850837
...
----

. After the cluster generates a secret for your service, your `Pod` spec can
mount it, and the pod will run after it becomes available.
