= Packaging your AI model into an OCI image

You can package your model into an OCI image and use the ModelCar approach to help you set up offline environments. With the ModelCar approach, your model can be embedded just like any other container image.

[NOTE]
====
If you already have S3-compatible object storage or a configured persistent volume claim, you can upload your AI model to those resources, but only the ModelCar approach is tested and supported.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have root user access to your machine.
* The {oc-first} is installed.
* Podman is installed.
* Your model is ready to use.
* You understand the concepts in the "How to build a ModelCar container" section of the following article about building an OCI image suitable for an vLLM model server, link:https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/01/30/build-and-deploy-modelcar-container-openshift-ai[Build and deploy a ModelCar container in OpenShift AI].
+
[NOTE]
====
The exact directory structure depends on the model server. The following example uses a Containerfile with a ResNet-50 model that is compatible with the {ovms} {ov}. {ov} generally does not require an additional hardware accelerator.
====

.Procedure

. Prepare a Containerfile with a compatible model and model server.

. Set the `IMAGE_REF` environment variable to simplify your process by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ IMAGE_REF=_<ovms-resnet50:test>_ <1>
----
<1> Replace `_<ovms-resnet50:test>_` with the name of your image reference. In this example, the `_<repo:tag>_` format is used. Your image reference name is specific to your use case.

. Build the Containerfile by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman build -t $IMAGE_REF <1>
----
<1> Because CRI-O and Podman share storage, using `sudo` is required to make the image part of the root's container storage and usable by {microshift-short}.

. Optional: Push the Containerfile to your registry by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman push $IMAGE_REF
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For offline use cases, include a tag other than `latest`. If the `latest` tag is used, the container that fetches and sets up the model is configured with the `imagePullPolicy:` parameter set to `Always` and the local image is ignored. If you use any other tag than `latest`, the `imagePullPolicy:` parameter is set to `IfNotPresent`.
====

.Verification

* Verify that the image exists by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman images ovms-resnet50

.Next steps

* Configure a model-serving runtime.
* Confirm that your AI model is ready for inferencing.
* Make requests against the model server.
