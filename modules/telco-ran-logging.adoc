= Logging

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
Use logging to collect logs from the far edge node for remote analysis. The recommended log collector is Vector.

Engineering considerations::
* Handling logs beyond the infrastructure and audit logs, for example, from the application workload requires additional CPU and network bandwidth based on additional logging rate.
* As of {product-title} 4.14, Vector is the reference log collector.
