= About the {external-secrets-operator} stable-v1.y channel

[role="_abstract"]
Select the stable-v1 channel to install and update the latest release of the {external-secrets-operator}. By selecting this channel, you can use the latest stable release and allows you to choose between automatic and manual updates.

The y-stream version of the {external-secrets-operator} installs updates from the `stable-v1.y` channels such as `stable-v1.0`, `stable-v1.1`, and `stable-v1.2`. Select the `stable-v1.y` channel if you want to use the y-stream version and stay updated to the z-stream version of the {external-secrets-operator}.

The `stable-v1.y` channel offers the following update approval strategies:

Automatic:: If you choose automatic updates for an installed {external-secrets-operator}, a new z-stream version of the {external-secrets-operator} is available in the `stable-v1.y` channel. OLM automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention.

Manual:: If you select manual updates, when a newer version of the {external-secrets-operator} is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the {external-secrets-operator} updated to the new version of the z-stream releases.
