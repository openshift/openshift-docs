= Verifying online snapshots by using snapshot indications

Snapshot indications are contextual information about online virtual machine (VM) snapshot operations. Indications are not available for offline virtual machine (VM) snapshot operations. Indications are helpful in describing details about the online snapshot creation.

.Prerequisites

* You must have attempted to create an online VM snapshot.

.Procedure

. Display the output from the snapshot indications by performing one of the following actions:
* Use the command line to view indicator output in the `status` stanza of the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object YAML.
* In the web console, click *VirtualMachineSnapshot* -> *Status* in the *Snapshot details* screen.

. Verify the status of your online VM snapshot by viewing the values of the `status.indications` parameter:
* `Online` indicates that the VM was running during online snapshot creation.
* `GuestAgent` indicates that the QEMU guest agent was running during online snapshot creation.
* `NoGuestAgent` indicates that the QEMU guest agent was not running during online snapshot creation. The QEMU guest agent could not be used to freeze and thaw the file system, either because the QEMU guest agent was not installed or running or due to another error.
