When using a `Custom` strategy, all the defined input secrets and ConfigMaps
are available inside the builder container in the *_/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/build_*
directory. The custom build image is responsible for using these secrets
and ConfigMaps appropriately. The `Custom` strategy also allows secrets to be
defined as described in Custom Strategy Options.

//[NOTE]
//====
//Add module above?
//====

There is no technical difference between existing strategy secrets and the input
secrets. However, your builder image might distinguish between them and use them
differently, based on your build use case.

The input secrets are always mounted into the
*_/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/build_* directory or your builder can parse the
`$BUILD` environment variable, which includes the full build object.
