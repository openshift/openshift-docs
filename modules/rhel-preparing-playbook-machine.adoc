= Preparing the machine to run the playbook

Before you can add compute machines that use {op-system-base-full} as the operating system to an {product-title} {product-version} cluster, you must prepare a {op-system-base} 8 machine to run an Ansible playbook that adds the new node to the cluster. This machine is not part of the cluster but must be able to access it.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) on the machine that you run the playbook on.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. Ensure that the `kubeconfig` file for the cluster and the installation program that you used to install the cluster are on the {op-system-base} 8 machine. One way to accomplish this is to use the same machine that you used to install the cluster.

. Configure the machine to access all of the {op-system-base} hosts that you plan to use as compute machines. You can use any method that your company allows, including a bastion with an SSH proxy or a VPN.

. Configure a user on the machine that you run the playbook on that has SSH access to all of the {op-system-base} hosts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use SSH key-based authentication, you must manage the key with an SSH agent.
====

. If you have not already done so, register the machine with RHSM and attach a pool with an `OpenShift` subscription to it:
.. Register the machine with RHSM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<user_name> --password=<password>
----

.. Pull the latest subscription data from RHSM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----

.. List the available subscriptions:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager list --available --matches '*OpenShift*'
----

.. In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for an {product-title} subscription and attach it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Enable the repositories required by {product-title} {product-version}:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms" \
    --enable="rhocp-{product-version}-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms"
----

. Install the required packages, including `openshift-ansible`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# yum install openshift-ansible openshift-clients jq
----
+
The `openshift-ansible` package provides installation program utilities and pulls in other packages that you require to add a {op-system-base} compute node to your cluster, such as Ansible, playbooks, and related configuration files. The `openshift-clients` provides the `oc` CLI, and the `jq` package improves the display of JSON output on your command line.
