= Testing an Ansible-based Operator locally

You can test the logic inside of an Ansible-based Operator running locally by using the `make run` command from the top-level directory of your Operator project. The `make run` Makefile target runs the `ansible-operator` binary locally, which reads from the `watches.yaml` file and uses your `~/.kube/config` file to communicate with a Kubernetes cluster just as the `k8s` modules do.

[NOTE]
====
You can customize the roles path by setting the environment variable `ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH` or by using the `ansible-roles-path` flag. If the role is not found in the `ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH` value, the Operator looks for it in `{{current directory}}/roles`.

.Prerequisites

- link:https://ansible-runner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html[Ansible Runner] version v1.1.0+
- link:https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner-http[Ansible Runner HTTP Event Emitter plug-in] version v1.0.0+
- Performed the previous steps for testing the Kubernetes Collection locally

.Procedure

. Install your custom resource definition (CRD) and proper role-based access control (RBAC) definitions for your custom resource (CR):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make install
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
/usr/bin/kustomize build config/crd | kubectl apply -f -
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/memcacheds.cache.example.com created
----

. Run the `make run` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make run
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

----

With the Operator now watching your CR for events, the creation of a CR will trigger your Ansible role to run.
+
[NOTE]
====
Consider an example `config/samples/<gvk>.yaml` CR manifest:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: <group>.example.com/v1alpha1
kind: <kind>
metadata:
  name: "<kind>-sample"
----

Because the `spec` field is not set, Ansible is invoked with no extra variables. Passing extra variables from a CR to Ansible is covered in another section. It is important to set reasonable defaults for the Operator.
====

. Create an instance of your CR with the default variable `state` set to `present`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f config/samples/<gvk>.yaml
----

. Check that the `example-config` config map was created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmaps
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                    STATUS    AGE
example-config          Active    3s
----

. Modify your `config/samples/<gvk>.yaml` file to set the `state` field to `absent`. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cache.example.com/v1
kind: Memcached
metadata:
  name: memcached-sample
spec:
  state: absent
----

. Apply the changes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f config/samples/<gvk>.yaml
----

. Confirm that the config map is deleted:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap
----
