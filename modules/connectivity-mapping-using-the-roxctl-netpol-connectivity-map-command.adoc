= Connectivity mapping using the roxctl netpol connectivity map command

Connectivity mapping provides details on the allowed connections between different workloads based on network policies defined in Kubernetes manifests.
You can visualize and understand how different workloads in your Kubernetes environment are allowed to communicate with each other according to the network policies you set up.

To retrieve connectivity mapping information, the `roxctl netpol connectivity map` command requires a directory path. This directory must contain your Kubernetes network policy, ANP, and BANP manifests. The command's output details the connectivity within the analyzed Kubernetes resources.
