[id="installation-vsphere-installer-infra-requirements_{context}"]
= vCenter requirements

Before you install an {product-title} cluster on your vCenter that uses infrastructure that the installer provisions, you must prepare your environment.

[id="installation-vsphere-installer-infra-requirements-account_{context}"]
== Required vCenter account privileges

To install an {product-title} cluster in a vCenter, the installation program requires access to an account with privileges to read and create the required resources. Using an account that has administrative privileges is the simplest way to access all of the necessary permissions.

A user requires the following privileges to install an {product-title} cluster:

* Datastore
** *Allocate space*
* Folder
** *Create folder*
** *Delete folder*
* vSphere Tagging
** All privileges
* Network
** *Assign network*
* Resource
** *Assign virtual machine to resource pool*
* Profile-driven storage
** All privileges
* vApp
** All privileges
* Virtual machine
** All privileges

For more information about creating an account with only the required privileges, see link: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-5372F580-5C23-4E9C-8A4E-EF1B4DD9033E.html[vSphere Permissions and User Management Tasks] in the vSphere documentation.

[id="installation-vsphere-installer-infra-requirements-resources_{context}"]
== Cluster resources

When you deploy an {product-title} cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, the installation program must be able to create several resources in your vCenter instance.

A standard {product-title} installation creates the following vCenter resources:

* 1 Folder
* 1 Tag category
* 1 Tag
* Virtual machines:
** 1 template
** 1 temporary bootstrap node
** 3 control plane nodes
** 3 compute machines

Although these resources use 856 GB of storage, the bootstrap node is destroyed during the cluster installation process. A minimum of 800 GB of storage is required to use a standard cluster.

If you deploy more compute machines, the {product-title} cluster will use more storage.

[discrete]
[id="installation-vsphere-installer-infra-requirements-limits_{context}"]
== Cluster limits

Available resources vary between clusters. The number of possible clusters within a vCenter is limited primarily by available storage space and any limitations on the number of required resources. Be sure to consider both limitations to the vCenter resources that the cluster creates and the resources that you require to deploy a cluster, such as IP addresses and networks.

[discrete]
[id="installation-vsphere-installer-infra-requirements-networking_{context}"]
== Networking requirements

In addition to using DHCP for the network, you must create the following networking resources before you install the {product-title} cluster:

[discrete]
[id="installation-vsphere-installer-infra-requirements-_{context}"]
=== Required IP Addresses

An installer-provisioned vSphere installation requires two static IP addresses:

* The **API** address is used to access the cluster API.
* The **Ingress** address is used for cluster ingress traffic.

You must provide these IP addresses to the installation program when you install the {product-title} cluster.

[discrete]
[id="installation-vsphere-installer-infra-requirements-dns-records_{context}"]
=== DNS records

You must create DNS records for two static IP addresses in the appropriate DNS server for the vCenter instance that hosts your {product-title} cluster. In each record, `<cluster_name>` is the cluster name and `<base_domain>` is the cluster base domain that you specify when you install the cluster. A complete DNS record takes the form: `<component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`.

|Component
|Record
|Description

|API VIP
|`api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|This DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record must point to the load balancer
for the control plane machines. This record must be resolvable by both clients
external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

|Ingress VIP
|`*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|A wildcard DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record that points to the load balancer that targets the
machines that run the Ingress router pods, which are the worker nodes by
default. This record must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster
and from all the nodes within the cluster.
