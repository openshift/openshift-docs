= Advanced CloudEvent filtering criteria

The `.spec.filters` method is optional but provides advanced criteria for event delivery. These filters allow you to restrict which events are permitted based not only on the source but also on the properties of the CloudEvent itself.

For example, you can specify filters that only allow events of type `com.github.push`, or events that match a CloudEvents SQL (CESQL) expression for particular event types such as `order.created`, `order.updated`, or `order.canceled`.

.Example of `spec.filters` method
[source,yaml]
----
filters:
  - cesql: "type IN ('order.created', 'order.updated', 'order.canceled')"
  - exact:
      type: com.github.push
----

[NOTE]
====
Filters are applied in addition to the `.spec.from` method. This means that an event must satisfy both the sender authorization and the filter criteria before it is delivered.
