= Setting the resync period for the pipelines controller

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure the resync period for the pipelines controller to optimize resource usage in clusters with a large number of pipeline and task runs. By adjusting this interval in the `TektonConfig` custom resource, you control how often the controller reconciles all resources regardless of events. 

The default resync period is 10 hours. If you have a large number of pipeline runs and task runs, a full reconciliation every 10 hours might consume too many resources. In this case, you can configure a longer resync period.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to your {OCP} cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* In the `TektonConfig` custom resource, configure the resync period for the pipelines controller, as shown in the following example.
