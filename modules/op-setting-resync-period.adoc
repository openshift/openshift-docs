= Setting the resync period for the pipelines controller

You can configure the resync period for the pipelines controller. Once every resync period, the controller reconciles all pipeline runs and task runs, regardless of events. 

The default resync period is 10 hours. If you have a large number of pipeline runs and task runs, a full reconciliation every 10 hours might consume too many resources. In this case, you can configure a longer resync period.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to your {OCP} cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* In the `TektonConfig` custom resource, configure the resync period for the pipelines controller, as shown in the following example.
