== Fixed issues

The following issue has been resolved in the current release:

* Before this update, all versions of Argo CD `v2.7.2` and later were vulnerable to cross-server request forgery (CSRF) attacks. As a result, Argo CD would accept non-GET requests even if they did not specify their content type. This update fixes the issue by upgrading the Argo CD to `v.2.7.16` and patching this vulnerability in the Argo CD API. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-4218[GITOPS-4218]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Breaking change: The Argo CD API will no longer accept non-GET requests that do not specify application or JSON as their content type. Although the accepted content types list is configurable, do not disable the content type check completely.
