= About NonAdminDownloadRequest CR

As a namespace admin user, you can use the `NonAdminDownloadRequest` (NADR) custom resource (CR) to access detailed information about your backups and restores for troubleshooting. 

This CR provides information that is equivalent to what a cluster administrator can access by using the `velero backup describe --details` command.

After the NADR CR request is validated, a secure download URL is generated to access the requested information.

You can download the following NADR resources:
