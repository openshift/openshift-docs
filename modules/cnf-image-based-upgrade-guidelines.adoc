= Guidelines for the image-based upgrade

For a successful image-based upgrade, your deployments must meet certain requirements.

There are different deployment methods in which you can perform the image-based upgrade:

{ztp}:: You use the {ztp-first} to deploy and configure your clusters.
Non-GitOps:: You only use {rh-rhacm-first} to deploy and configure your clusters.

You can perform an image-based upgrade in disconnected environments. For more information about how to mirror images for a disconnected environment, see "Mirroring images for a disconnected installation".
