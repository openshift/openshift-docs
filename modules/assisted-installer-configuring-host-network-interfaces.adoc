= Optional: Configuring host network interfaces

The {ai-full} supports IPv4 networking and dual stack networking. The {ai-full} also supports configuring host network interfaces with the NMState library, a declarative network manager API for hosts. You can use NMState to deploy hosts with static IP addressing, bonds, VLANs and other advanced networking features. If you chose to configure host network interfaces, you must set network-wide configurations. Then, you must create a host-specific configuration for each host and generate the discovery ISO with the host-specific settings.

.Procedure

. Select the internet protocol version. Valid options are *IPv4* and *Dual stack*.

. If the cluster hosts are on a shared VLAN, enter the VLAN ID.

. Enter the network-wide IP addresses. If you selected *Dual stack* networking, you must enter both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

.. Enter the cluster network's IP address range in CIDR notation.

.. Enter the default gateway IP address.

.. Enter the DNS server IP addresss.

. Enter the host-specific configuration.

.. If you are only setting a static IP address that uses a single network interface, use the form view to enter the IP address and the MAC address for the host.

.. If you are using multiple interfaces, bonding, or other advanced networking features, use the YAML view and enter the desired network state for the host using NMState syntax.

.. Add the MAC address and interface name for each interface used in your network configuration.
