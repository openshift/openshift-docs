= How the migration process works

The following table summarizes the migration process by segmenting between the user-initiated steps in the process and the actions that the migration performs in response.

.Migrating to {sdn} from {previous-sdn}
[cols="1,1a",options="header"]
|===

|User-initiated steps|Migration activity

|
Set the `migration` field of the `Network.operator.openshift.io` custom resource (CR) named `cluster` to `{type}`. Make sure the `migration` field is `null` before setting it to a value.
|
Cluster Network Operator (CNO):: Updates the status of the `Network.config.openshift.io` CR named `cluster` accordingly.
Machine Config Operator (MCO):: Rolls out an update to the systemd configuration necessary for {sdn}; the MCO updates a single machine per pool at a time by default, causing the total time the migration takes to increase with the size of the cluster.

|Update the `networkType` field of the `Network.config.openshift.io` CR.
|
CNO:: Performs the following actions:
+
--
* Destroys the {previous-sdn} control plane pods.
* Deploys the {sdn} control plane pods.
* Updates the Multus objects to reflect the new network plugin.
--

|
Reboot each node in the cluster.
|
Cluster:: As nodes reboot, the cluster assigns IP addresses to pods on the {sdn} cluster network.

If a rollback to OpenShift SDN is required, the following table describes the process.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must wait until the migration process from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes network plugin is successful before initiating a rollback.

Cluster:: As nodes reboot, the cluster assigns IP addresses to pods on the OpenShift-SDN network.

Enable the MCO after all nodes in the cluster reboot.

MCO:: Rolls out an update to the systemd configuration necessary for OpenShift SDN; the MCO updates a single machine per pool at a time by default, so the total time the migration takes increases with the size of the cluster.
