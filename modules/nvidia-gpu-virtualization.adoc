= GPUs and virtualization

Many developers and enterprises are moving to containerized applications and serverless infrastructures, but there is still a lot of interest in developing and maintaining applications that run on virtual machines (VMs). Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization provides this capability, enabling enterprises to incorporate VMs into containerized workflows within clusters.

You can choose one of the following methods to connect the worker nodes to the GPUs:

* GPU passthrough to access and use GPU hardware within a virtual machine (VM).

* GPU (vGPU) time-slicing, when GPU compute capacity is not saturated by workloads.
