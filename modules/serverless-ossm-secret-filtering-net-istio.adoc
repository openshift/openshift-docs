[id="serverless-ossm-secret-filtering-net-istio_{context}"]
= Improving net-istio memory usage by using secret filtering for {SMProductShortName}

By default, the link:https://aly.arriqaaq.com/kubernetes-informers/[informers] implementation for the Kubernetes `client-go` library fetches all resources of a particular type. This can lead to a substantial overhead when many resources are available, which can cause the Knative `net-istio` ingress controller to fail on large clusters due to memory leaking. However, a filtering mechanism is available for the Knative `net-istio` ingress controller, which enables the controller to only fetch Knative related secrets. You can enable this mechanism by adding an annotation to the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR).

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you enable secret filtering, all of your secrets need to be labeled with  `networking.internal.knative.dev/certificate-uid: "<id>"`. Otherwise, Knative Serving does not detect them, which leads to failures. You must label both new and existing secrets.

.Prerequisites

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster administrator access.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster or dedicated administrator access.
endif::[]

* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* Install {SMProductName}. {ServerlessProductName} with {SMProductShortName} only is supported for use with {SMProductName} version 2.0.5 or later.
* Install the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* Add the `serverless.openshift.io/enable-secret-informer-filtering` annotation to the `KnativeServing` CR:

<1> Adding this annotation injects an environment variable, `ENABLE_SECRET_INFORMER_FILTERING_BY_CERT_UID=true`, to the `net-istio` controller pod.
