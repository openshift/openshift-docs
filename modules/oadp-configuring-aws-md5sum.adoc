= Configuring the backup storage location with a MD5 checksum algorithm

You can configure the Backup Storage Location (BSL) in the Data Protection Application (DPA) to use a MD5 checksum algorithm for both Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and S3-compatible storage providers. The checksum algorithm calculates the checksum for uploading and downloading objects to Amazon S3. You can use one of the following options to set the `checksumAlgorithm` field in the `spec.backupLocations.velero.config.checksumAlgorithm` section of the DPA.

* `CRC32`
* `CRC32C`
* `SHA1`
* `SHA256`

[NOTE]
====
You can also set the `checksumAlgorithm` field to an empty value to skip the MD5 checksum check. 

If you do not set a value for the `checksumAlgorithm` field, then the default value is set to `CRC32`.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* You have configured Amazon S3, or S3-compatible object storage as a backup location.

.Procedure

* Configure the BSL in the DPA as shown in the following example:

<1> Specify the `checksumAlgorithm`. In this example, the `checksumAlgorithm` field is set to an empty value. You can select an option from the following list: `CRC32`, `CRC32C`, `SHA1`, `SHA256`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using Noobaa as the object storage provider, and you do not set the `spec.backupLocations.velero.config.checksumAlgorithm` field in the DPA, an empty value of `checksumAlgorithm` is added to the BSL configuration. 

The empty value is only added for BSLs that are created using the DPA. This value is not added if you create the BSL by using any other method.
