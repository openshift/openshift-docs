= Configuring the {microshift-short} TuneD profile

Configure a TuneD profile for your host to use low latency with {microshift-short} workloads using the `microshift-baseline-variables.conf` configuration file provided in the {op-system-base-full} `/etc/tuned/` host directory after you install the `microshift-low-latency` RPM package.

.Prerequisites

* You have root access to the cluster.
* You installed the `microshift-low-latency` RPM package.
* Your {op-system-base} host has TuneD installed. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/monitoring_and_managing_system_status_and_performance/getting-started-with-tuned_monitoring-and-managing-system-status-and-performance#the-location-of-tuned-profiles_getting-started-with-tuned[Getting started with TuneD] (RHEL documentation).

.Procedure

. You can use the default `microshift-baseline-variables.conf` TuneD profile in the `/etc/tuned/` directory profile, or create your own to add more tunings.

<1> Controls which cores should be isolated. By default, 1 core per socket is reserved in {microshift-short} for housekeeping. The other cores are isolated. Valid values are a core list or range. You can isolate any range, for example: `isolated_cores=2,4-7` or `isolated_cores=2-23`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must keep only one `isolated_cores=` variable.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
The Kubernetes CPU manager can use any CPU to run the workload except the reserved CPUs defined in the kubelet configuration. For this reason it is best that:

* The sum of the kubelet's reserved CPUs and isolated cores include all online CPUs.
* Isolated cores are complementary to the reserved CPUs defined in the kubelet configuration.
====
+
<2> Size of the hugepages. Valid values are 2M or 1G.
<3> Additional kernel arguments, for example, `additional_args=console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200`.
<4> The CPU set to be offlined.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Must not overlap with `isolated_cores`.

. Enable the profile or make changes active, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo tuned-adm profile microshift-baseline
----

. Reboot the host to make kernel arguments active.

.Verification

* Optional: You can read the `/proc/cmdline` file that contains the arguments given to the currently running kernel on start.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat /proc/cmdline

.Next steps
. Prepare your {microshift-short} workloads for low latency.
. Optional: Configure automatic enablement of your TuneD profile.
. Optional: If you are using the x86_64 architecture, you can install {op-system-rt-kernel}.
