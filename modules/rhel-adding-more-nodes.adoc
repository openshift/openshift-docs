= Adding more RHEL compute machines to your cluster

You can add more compute machines that use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system to an {product-title} {product-version} cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Your {product-title} cluster already contains RHEL compute nodes.
* The `hosts` file that you used to add the first RHEL compute machines to your cluster is on the machine that you use the run the playbook.
* The machine that you run the playbook on must be able to access all of the RHEL hosts. You can use any method that your company allows, including a bastion with an SSH proxy or a VPN.
* The `kubeconfig` file for the cluster and the installation program that you used to install the cluster are on the machine that you use the run the playbook.
* You must prepare the RHEL hosts for installation.
* Configure a user on the machine that you run the playbook on that has SSH access to all of the RHEL hosts.
* If you use SSH key-based authentication, you must manage the key with an SSH agent.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) on the machine that you run the playbook on.


.Procedure

. Open the Ansible inventory file at `/<path>/inventory/hosts` that defines your compute machine hosts and required variables.

. Rename the `[new_workers]` section of the file to `[workers]`.

. Add a `[new_workers]` section to the file and define the fully-qualified domain names for each new host. The file resembles the following example:
+
----
[all:vars]
ansible_user=root
#ansible_become=True

openshift_kubeconfig_path="~/.kube/config"

[workers]
mycluster-rhel8-0.example.com
mycluster-rhel8-1.example.com

[new_workers]
mycluster-rhel8-2.example.com
mycluster-rhel8-3.example.com
----
+
In this example, the `mycluster-rhel8-0.example.com` and `mycluster-rhel8-1.example.com` machines are in the cluster and you add the `mycluster-rhel8-2.example.com` and `mycluster-rhel8-3.example.com` machines.

. Navigate to the Ansible playbook directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
----

. Run the scaleup playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i /<path>/inventory/hosts playbooks/scaleup.yml <1>
----
<1> For `<path>`, specify the path to the Ansible inventory file that you created.
