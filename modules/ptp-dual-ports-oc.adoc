= Using dual-port NICs to improve redundancy for PTP ordinary clocks

{product-title} supports single-port networking interface cards (NICs) as ordinary clocks for PTP timing. To improve redundancy, you can configure a dual-port NIC with one port as active and the other as standby.

:FeatureName: Configuring linuxptp services as an ordinary clock with dual-port NIC redundancy
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

In this configuration, the ports in a dual-port NIC operate as follows:

* The active port functions as an ordinary clock in the `Following` port state.

* The standby port remains in the `Listening` port state.

* If the active port fails, the standby port transitions to active to ensure continued PTP timing synchronization.

* If both ports become faulty, the clock state moves to the `HOLDOVER` state, then the `FREERUN` state when the holdover timeout expires, before resyncing to a leader clock.

[NOTE]
====
You can configure PTP ordinary clocks with added redundancy on `x86` architecture nodes with dual-port NICs only.
