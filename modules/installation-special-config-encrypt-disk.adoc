= Encrypting disks during installation

During {product-title} installation, you can enable disk encryption on all master and worker nodes.
This feature:

* Is available for installer-provisioned infrastructure
and user-provisioned infrastructure deployments
* Is supported on {op-system-first} systems only
* Sets up disk encryption during the manifest installation phase so all data written to disk, from first boot forward, is encrypted
* Requires no user intervention for providing passphrases
* Uses AES-256-CBC encryption

There are two different supported encryption modes:

* TPM v2: This is the preferred mode. TPM v2 stores passphrases in a secure cryptoprocessor.
To implement TPM v2 disk encryption, create an Ignition config file as described below.

* Tang: To use Tang to encrypt your cluster, you need to use a Tang server. Clevis implements decryption on the client side.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of Tang encryption mode to encrypt your disks is only supported for bare metal and vSphere installations on user-provisioned infrastructure.
====

Follow one of the two procedures to enable disk encryption for the nodes in your cluster.
