== Known issues

* When the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) scales up the `broker-ingress` pod, the `imc-dispatcher` pod sometimes fails to forward replies. This is because the new `broker-ingress` pods are *Ready* before accepting connections, because they lack a readiness probe. If you are using HPA autoscaling and do not want to scale the `broker-ingress` pod manually, you must configure retries in the `Broker.Spec.Delivery`.
* Using the `eventing.knative.dev/scope: namespace` annotation with Kafka channels is not supported.
