= Tuning Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

As a {op-system-base-full} system administrator, you can use the TuneD service to optimize the performance profile of {op-system-base} for a variety of use cases. TuneD monitors and optimizes system performance under certain workloads, including latency performance.

* Use TuneD profiles to tune your system for different use cases, such as deploying a low-latency {microshift-short} cluster.
* You can modify the rules defined for each profile and customize tuning for a specific device.
* When you switch to another profile or deactivate TuneD, all changes made to the system settings by the previous profile revert back to their original state.
* You can also configure TuneD to react to changes in device usage and adjusts settings to improve performance of active devices and reduce power consumption of inactive devices.
