== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the LokiStack ruler pods would not format the IPv6 pod IP in HTTP URLs used for cross pod communication, causing querying rules and alerts through the Prometheus-compatible API to fail. With this update, the LokiStack ruler pods encapsulate the IPv6 pod IP in square brackets, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4890[LOG-4890])

* Before this update, the developer console logs did not account for the current namespace, resulting in query rejection for users without cluster-wide log access. With this update, namespace inclusion has been corrected, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4947[LOG-4947])

* Before this update, the logging view plugin of the {Product-Title} web console did not allow for custom node placement and tolerations. With this update, defining custom node placements and tolerations has been added to the logging view plugin of the {Product-Title} web console. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4912[LOG-4912])

////
* Before this update, in {Product-Title} Release Candidate 4.15, the Loki ruler was not able to send alerts to  `Alertmanager` user workload monitoring due to a permissions issue. With this update, the Loki Operator RBAC permissions allow sending alerts to `Alertmanager`, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4951[LOG-4951])
