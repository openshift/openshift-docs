[id="cli-logging-in-kubeadmin_{context}"]
= Logging into the cluster

You can log into your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster `kubeconfig` file.
The `kubeconfig` file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server.
The file is specific to a cluster and is created during {product-title} installation.

.Prerequisites

* Deploy an {product-title} cluster.
* Install the `oc` CLI.

.Procedure

. Export the `kubeadmin` credentials:
+
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig <1>

$ oc whoami
system:admin
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the path to the directory that you stored
the installation files in.

////
. Log in to the `oc` CLI:
+
----
$ oc login
----
+
Specify `kubeadmin` as the user and the password that displayed when the
installation process completed. If you no longer have the password for the `kubeadmin`
user, it is also listed in the `.openshift_install.log` file in your
installation directory.
