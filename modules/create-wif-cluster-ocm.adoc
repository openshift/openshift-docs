= Creating a Workload Identity Federation cluster using {cluster-manager}

.Procedure

. Log in to {cluster-manager-url} and click *Create cluster*.
. In the *Cloud* tab, click *Create cluster* in the *Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated* row.

. Under *Billing model*, configure the subscription type and infrastructure type.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Workload Identity Federation is supported by Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) infrastructure type only.
====
+
.. Select a subscription type. For information about {product-title} subscription options, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_cluster_manager/1-latest/html-single/managing_clusters/index#assembly-cluster-subscriptions[Cluster subscriptions and registration] in the {cluster-manager} documentation.
+

.. Select the *Customer cloud subscription* infrastructure type.

.. Click *Next*.
. Select *Run on Google Cloud Platform*.
. Select *Workload Identity Federation* as the Authentication type.
.. Read and complete all the required prerequisites.

.. Click the checkbox indicating that you have read and completed all the required prerequisites.
+
. To create a new WIF configuration, run the following OCM CLI command.
+
// [NOTE]
// ====
// This command will create a new WIF configuration in auto mode. To create a WIF configuration in manual mode, see....
// ====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ocm gcp create wif-config --name $WIF_NAME --project $GCP_PROJECT_ID
----
+
. Select a configured WIF configuration from the *WIF configuration* drop-down list. If you want to select the WIF configuration you created in the last step, click *Refresh* first.
+
// [NOTE]
// ====
// Only WIF configurations without assigned clusters will be available to select from the drop-down list.
// ====
// +
. Click *Next*.
. On the *Details* page, provide a name for your cluster and specify the cluster details:
.. Add a *Cluster name*.
.. Optional: Cluster creation generates a domain prefix as a subdomain for your provisioned cluster on `openshiftapps.com`. If the cluster name is less than or equal to 15 characters, that name is used for the domain prefix. If the cluster name is longer than 15 characters, the domain prefix is randomly generated as a 15-character string.
+
To customize the subdomain prefix, select the *Create custom domain prefix* checkbox, and enter your domain prefix name in the *Domain prefix* field. The domain prefix cannot be longer than 15 characters, must be unique within your organization, and cannot be changed after cluster creation.
.. Select a cluster version from the *Version* drop-down menu.
+
[NOTE]
====
Workload Identity Federation requires {product-title} version 4.17.0 version or higher.
====
+
.. Select a cloud provider region from the *Region* drop-down menu.
.. Select a *Single zone* or *Multi-zone* configuration.
+
.. Optional: Select *Enable Secure Boot for Shielded VMs* to use Shielded VMs when installing your cluster. For more information, see link:https://cloud.google.com/security/products/shielded-vm[Shielded VMs].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To successfully create a cluster, you must select *Enable Secure Boot support for Shielded VMs* if your organization has the policy constraint `constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm` enabled. For more information regarding GCP organizational policy constraints, see link:https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints[Organization policy constraints].
====
+
.. Leave *Enable user workload monitoring* selected to monitor your own projects in isolation from Red Hat Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) platform metrics. This option is enabled by default.

. Optional: Expand *Advanced Encryption* to make changes to encryption settings.

.. Select *Use custom KMS keys* to use custom KMS keys. If you prefer not to use custom KMS keys, leave the default setting *Use default KMS Keys*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To use custom KMS keys, the IAM service account `osd-ccs-admin` must be granted the *Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter* role. For more information about granting roles on a resource, see link:https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/iam#granting_roles_on_a_resource[Granting roles on a resource].
====
+
With *Use Custom KMS keys* selected:

... Select a key ring location from the *Key ring location* drop-down menu.
... Select a key ring from the *Key ring* drop-down menu.
... Select a key name from the *Key name* drop-down menu.
... Provide the *KMS Service Account*.

+
.. Optional: Select *Enable FIPS cryptography* if you require your cluster to be FIPS validated.
+
[NOTE]
====
If *Enable FIPS cryptography* is selected, *Enable additional etcd encryption* is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. You can select *Enable additional etcd encryption* without selecting *Enable FIPS cryptography*.
====
+
.. Optional: Select *Enable additional etcd encryption* if you require etcd key value encryption.
With this option, the etcd key values are encrypted, but not the keys. This option is in addition to the control plane storage encryption that encrypts the etcd volumes in {product-title} clusters by default.
+
[NOTE]
====
By enabling etcd encryption for the key values in etcd, you incur a performance overhead of approximately 20%. The overhead is a result of introducing this second layer of encryption, in addition to the default control plane storage encryption that encrypts the etcd volumes. Consider enabling etcd encryption only if you specifically require it for your use case.
====
+
. Click *Next*.

. On the *Machine pool* page, select a *Compute node instance type* and a *Compute node count*. The number and types of nodes that are available depend on your {product-title} subscription. If you are using multiple availability zones, the compute node count is per zone.
+
[NOTE]
====
After your cluster is created, you can change the number of compute nodes, but you cannot change the compute node instance type in a created machine pool. You can add machine pools after installation that use a customized instance type. The number and types of nodes available to you depend on your {product-title} subscription.
====

. Optional: Expand *Add node labels* to add labels to your nodes. Click *Add additional label* to add more node labels.

. Click *Next*.

. In the *Cluster privacy* dialog, select *Public* or *Private* to use either public or private API endpoints and application routes for your cluster.
+
. Optional: To install the cluster in an existing GCP Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):
.. Select *Install into an existing VPC*.
.. If you are installing into an existing VPC and you want to enable an HTTP or HTTPS proxy for your cluster, select *Configure a cluster-wide proxy*.

+
. Click *Next*.
+

. Optional: To install the cluster into a GCP Shared VPC:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====

To install a cluster into a Shared VPC, you must use {product-title} version 4.13.15 or above. Additionally, the VPC owner of the host project must enable a project as a host project in their Google Cloud console. For more information, see link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#set-up-shared-vpc[Enable a host project].
====

.. Select *Install into GCP Shared VPC*.
.. Specify the *Host project ID*. If the specified host project ID is incorrect, cluster creation fails.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Once you complete the steps within the cluster configuration wizard and click *Create Cluster*, the cluster will go into the "Installation Waiting" state. At this point, you must contact the VPC owner of the host project, who must assign the dynamically-generated service account the following roles: *Computer Network Administrator*, *Compute Security Administrator*, and *DNS Administrator*.
The VPC owner of the host project has 30 days to grant the listed permissions before the cluster creation fails.
For information about Shared VPC permissions, see link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#migs-service-accounts[Provision Shared VPC].
====
+
. If you opted to install the cluster in an existing GCP VPC, provide your *Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) subnet settings* and select *Next*.
You must have created the Cloud network address translation (NAT) and a Cloud router. See the "Additional resources" section for information about Cloud NATs and Google VPCs.

+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing a cluster into a Shared VPC, the VPC name and subnets are shared from the host project.
====
+
. Click *Next*.
. If you opted to configure a cluster-wide proxy, provide your proxy configuration details on the *Cluster-wide proxy* page:
+
.. Enter a value in at least one of the following fields:
** Specify a valid *HTTP proxy URL*.
** Specify a valid *HTTPS proxy URL*.
** In the *Additional trust bundle* field, provide a PEM encoded X.509 certificate bundle. The bundle is added to the trusted certificate store for the cluster nodes. An additional trust bundle file is required if you use a TLS-inspecting proxy unless the identity certificate for the proxy is signed by an authority from the {op-system-first} trust bundle. This requirement applies regardless of whether the proxy is transparent or requires explicit configuration using the `http-proxy` and `https-proxy` arguments.
+
.. Click *Next*.
+
For more information about configuring a proxy with {product-title}, see _Configuring a cluster-wide proxy_.

+
. In the *CIDR ranges* dialog, configure custom classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) ranges or use the defaults that are provided.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
CIDR configurations cannot be changed later. Confirm your selections with your network administrator before proceeding.

If the cluster privacy is set to *Private*, you cannot access your cluster until you configure private connections in your cloud provider.
====

. On the *Cluster update strategy* page, configure your update preferences:
.. Choose a cluster update method:
** Select *Individual updates* if you want to schedule each update individually. This is the default option.
** Select *Recurring updates* to update your cluster on your preferred day and start time, when updates are available.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can review the end-of-life dates in the update lifecycle documentation for {product-title}. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/4/html/introduction_to_openshift_dedicated/policies-and-service-definition#osd-life-cycle[OpenShift Dedicated update life cycle].
====
+
.. Provide administrator approval based on your cluster update method:
** Individual updates: If you select an update version that requires approval, provide an administrator’s acknowledgment and click *Approve and continue*.
** Recurring updates: If you selected recurring updates for your cluster, provide an administrator’s acknowledgment and click *Approve and continue*. {cluster-manager} does not start scheduled y-stream updates for minor versions without receiving an administrator’s acknowledgment.
+
.. If you opted for recurring updates, select a preferred day of the week and upgrade start time in UTC from the drop-down menus.
.. Optional: You can set a grace period for *Node draining* during cluster upgrades. A *1 hour* grace period is set by default.
.. Click *Next*.
+
[NOTE]
====
In the event of critical security concerns that significantly impact the security or stability of a cluster, Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) might schedule automatic updates to the latest z-stream version that is not impacted. The updates are applied within 48 hours after customer notifications are provided. For a description of the critical impact security rating, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification[Understanding Red Hat security ratings].
====

. Review the summary of your selections and click *Create cluster* to start the cluster installation. The installation takes approximately 30-40 minutes to complete.
+
. Optional: On the *Overview* tab, you can enable the delete protection feature by selecting *Enable*, which is located directly under *Delete Protection: Disabled*. This will prevent your cluster from being deleted. To disable delete protection, select *Disable*.
By default, clusters are created with the delete protection feature disabled.
+

.Verification

* You can monitor the progress of the installation in the *Overview* page for your cluster. You can view the installation logs on the same page. Your cluster is ready when the *Status* in the *Details* section of the page is listed as *Ready*.
