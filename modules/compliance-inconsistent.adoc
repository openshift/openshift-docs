= Inconsistent ComplianceScan
The `ScanSetting` object lists the node roles that the compliance scans generated from the `ScanSetting` or `ScanSettingBinding` objects would scan. Each node role usually maps to a machine config pool.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is expected that all machines in a machine config pool are identical and all scan results from the nodes in a pool should be identical.
====

If some of the results are different from others, the Compliance Operator flags a `ComplianceCheckResult` object where some of the nodes will report as `INCONSISTENT`. All `ComplianceCheckResult` objects are also labeled with `compliance.openshift.io/inconsistent-check`.

Because the number of machines in a pool might be quite large, the Compliance Operator attempts to find the most common state and list the nodes that differ from the common state. The most common state is stored in the `compliance.openshift.io/most-common-status` annotation and the annotation `compliance.openshift.io/inconsistent-source` contains pairs of `hostname:status` of check statuses that differ from the most common status. If no common state can be found, all the `hostname:status` pairs are listed in the `compliance.openshift.io/inconsistent-source annotation`.

If possible, a remediation is still created so that the cluster can converge to a compliant status. However, this might not always be possible and correcting the difference between nodes must be done manually. The compliance scan must be re-run to get a consistent result by annotating the scan with the `compliance.openshift.io/rescan=` option:
