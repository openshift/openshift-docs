= Network Observability deployment in specific nodes
You can configure the `FlowCollector` to control the deployment of Network Observability components in specific nodes. The `spec.agent.ebpf.advanced.scheduling`, `spec.processor.advanced.scheduling`, and `spec.consolePlugin.advanced.scheduling` specifications have the following configurable settings: 

* `NodeSelector`
* `Tolerations`
* `Affinity`
* `PriorityClassName`
