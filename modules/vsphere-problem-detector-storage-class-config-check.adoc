= About the storage class configuration check

The names for persistent volumes that use vSphere storage are related to the datastore name and cluster ID.

When a persistent volume is created, `systemd` creates a mount unit for the persistent volume. The `systemd` process has a 255 character limit for the length of the fully qualified path to the VDMK file that is used for the persistent volume.

The fully qualified path is based on the naming conventions for `systemd` and vSphere. The naming conventions use the following pattern:

[source,text]
----
/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume/mounts/[<datastore>] 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/<cluster_id>-dynamic-pvc-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.vmdk
----

* The naming conventions require 205 characters of the 255 character limit.

* The datastore name and the cluster ID are determined from the deployment.

* The datastore name and cluster ID are substituted into the preceding pattern. Then the path is processed with the `systemd-escape` command to escape special characters. For example, a hyphen character uses four characters after it is escaped. The escaped value is `\x2d`.

* After processing with `systemd-escape` to ensure that `systemd` can access the fully qualified path to the VDMK file, the length of the path must be less than 255 characters.
