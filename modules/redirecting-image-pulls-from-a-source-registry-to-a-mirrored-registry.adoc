{rh-rhacs-first} supports scanning images from registry mirrors that you have configured by using one of the following {ocp} custom resources (CRs):

* `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP)
* `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS)
* `ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS) 

For more information about how to configure image registry repository mirroring, see "Configuring image registry repository mirroring".

You can automatically scan images from registry mirrors by using delegated image scanning.
