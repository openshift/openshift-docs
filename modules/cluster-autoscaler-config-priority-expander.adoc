= Configuring a priority expander for the cluster autoscaler

When the cluster autoscaler uses the priority expander, it scales up by using the machine set with the highest user-assigned priority.
To use this expander, you must create a config map that defines the priority of your machine sets.

For each specified priority level, you must create regular expressions to identify machine sets that you want to use when prioritizing a machine set for selection.
The regular expressions must match the name of any compute machine set that you want the cluster autoscaler to consider for selection.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed an {product-title} cluster that uses the Machine API.
* You have access to the cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. List the compute machine sets on your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinesets.machine.openshift.io
----
+

. Using regular expressions, construct one or more patterns that match the name of any compute machine set that you want to set a priority level for.
+
For example, use the regular expression pattern `\*fast*` to match any compute machine set that includes the string `fast` in its name.

. Create a `cluster-autoscaler-priority-expander.yml` YAML file that defines a config map similar to the following:
+
--
.Example priority expander config map
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-autoscaler-priority-expander # <1>
  namespace: openshift-machine-api # <2>
data:
  priorities: |- # <3>
    10:
      - *fast*
      - *archive*
    40:
      - *prod*
----
<1> You must name config map `cluster-autoscaler-priority-expander`.
<2> You must create the config map in the same namespace as cluster autoscaler pod, which is the `openshift-machine-api` namespace.
<3> Define the priority of your machine sets.
+
The `priorities` values must be positive integers.
The cluster autoscaler uses higher-value priorities before lower-value priorities.
+
For each priority level, specify the regular expressions that correspond to the machine sets you want to use.
--

. Create the config map by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap cluster-autoscaler-priority-expander \
  --from-file=<location_of_config_map_file>/cluster-autoscaler-priority-expander.yml
----

.Verification

* Review the config map by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmaps cluster-autoscaler-priority-expander -o yaml
----

.Next steps

* To use the priority expander, ensure that the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource definition is configured to use the `expanders: ["Priority"]` parameter.
