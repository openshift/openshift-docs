= Completing and verifying the OpenShift installation

When the bootstrap node is done with its work and has handed off control to the new OpenShift cluster, the bootstrap node is destroyed. The installer waits for the cluster to initialize, creates a route to the OpenShift console, and presents the information and credentials you need to log into the cluster. Here’s an example:

----
INFO Install complete!                                

INFO Run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/joe/ocp/auth/kubeconfig' to manage the cluster with 'oc', the OpenShift CLI.

INFO The cluster is ready when 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p 39RPg-y4c7V-n4bbn-vAF3M' succeeds (wait a few minutes).

INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.devel.example.com

INFO Login to the console with user: kubeadmin, password: 39RPg-y4c7V-n4bbn-vAF3M
----

To access the OpenShift cluster from your web browser, log in as kubeadmin with the password (for example, 39RPg-y4c7V-n4bbn-vAF3M), using the URL shown:

     https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.devel.example.com

To access the OpenShift cluster from the command line, identify the location of the credentials file (export the KUBECONFIG variable) and log in as kubeadmin with the provided password:
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=/home/joe/ocp/auth/kubeconfig

$ oc login -u kubeadmin -p 39RPg-y4c7V-n4bbn-vAF3M
----

At this point, you can begin using the OpenShift cluster. To understand the management of your OpenShift cluster going forward, you should explore the OpenShift control plane.
