= Verifying node state after installation

[role="_abstract"]
The {product-title} installation completes when the following installation health checks are successful:

* The provisioner can access the {product-title} web console.

* All control plane nodes are ready.

* All cluster Operators are available.

[NOTE]
====
After the installation completes, the specific cluster Operators responsible for the worker nodes continuously attempt to provision all worker nodes. It can take some time before all worker nodes report as `READY`. For installations on bare metal, wait a minimum of 60 minutes before troubleshooting a worker node. For installations on all other platforms, wait a minimum of 40 minutes before troubleshooting a worker node. A `DEGRADED` state for the cluster Operators responsible for the worker nodes depends on the Operators' own resources and not on the state of the nodes.
====

After your installation completes, you can continue to monitor the condition of the nodes in your cluster by using the following steps.

.Prerequisites
* The installation program resolves successfully in the terminal.
