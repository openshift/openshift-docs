= Verifying node state after installation

The {product-title} installation completes when the following installation health checks are successful:

* The provisioner can access the {product-title} web console.

* All control plane nodes are ready.

* All cluster Operators are available.

[NOTE]
====
After the installation completes, the specific cluster Operators responsible for the worker nodes continuously attempt to provision all worker nodes. Some time is required before all worker nodes report as `READY`. For installations on bare metal, wait a minimum of 60 minutes before troubleshooting a worker node. For installations on all other platforms, wait a minimum of 40 minutes before troubleshooting a worker node. A `DEGRADED` state for the cluster Operators responsible for the worker nodes depends on the Operators' own resources and not on the state of the nodes.
====

After your installation completes, you can continue to monitor the condition of the nodes in your cluster.

.Prerequisites
* The installation program resolves successfully in the terminal.
