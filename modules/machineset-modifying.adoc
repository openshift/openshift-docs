= Modifying a machine set

To make changes to a machine set, edit the `MachineSet` YAML. Then, remove all machines associated with the machine set by deleting each machine or scaling down the machine set to `0` replicas. Then, scale the replicas back to the desired number. Changes you make to a machine set do not affect existing machines.

If you need to scale a machine set without making other changes, you do not need to delete the machines.

[NOTE]
====
By default, the {product-title} router pods are deployed on workers. Because the router is required to access some cluster resources, including the web console, do not scale the worker machine set to `0` unless you first relocate the router pods.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install an {product-title} cluster and the `oc` command line.
* Log in to `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. Edit the machine set:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Scale down the machine set to `0`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=0 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Wait for the machines to be removed.

. Scale up the machine set as needed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Wait for the machines to start. The new machines contain changes you made to the machine set.
