= Modifying a MachineSet

To make changes to a MachineSet, edit the MachineSet YAML. Then, remove all
machines associated with the MachineSet by deleting each machine 'or scaling
down the MachineSet to 0 replicas. Then, scale the replicas back to the desired
number. Changes you make to a MachineSet do not affect existing machines.

If you need to scale a MachineSet without making other changes, you do not need
to delete the machines.

[NOTE]
====
By default, the {product-title} router pods are deployed on workers. Because the router
is required to access some cluster resources, including the web console,
do not scale the worker MachineSet to `0` unless you first relocate the router pods.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install an {product-title} cluster and the oc command line.
* Log in to  `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. Edit the MachineSet:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Scale down the MachineSet to `0`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=0 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Wait for the machines to be removed.

. Scale up the MachineSet as needed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Wait for the machines to start. The new Machines contain changes you made
to the MachineSet.
