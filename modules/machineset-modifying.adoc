= Modifying a compute machine set

To make changes to a compute machine set, edit the `MachineSet` YAML. Then, remove all machines associated with the compute machine set by deleting each machine or scaling down the compute machine set to `0` replicas. Then, scale the replicas back to the desired number. Changes you make to a compute machine set do not affect existing machines.

If you need to scale a compute machine set without making other changes, you do not need to delete the machines.

[NOTE]
====
By default, the {product-title} router pods are deployed on workers. Because the router is required to access some cluster resources, including the web console, do not scale the compute machine set to `0` unless you first relocate the router pods.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install an {product-title} cluster and the `oc` command line.
* Log in to `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. Edit the compute machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Scale down the compute machine set to `0` by running one of the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=0 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to scale the compute machine set:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  name: <machineset>
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  replicas: 0
----
====
+
Wait for the machines to be removed.

. Scale up the compute machine set as needed by running one of the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+

Wait for the machines to start. The new machines contain changes you made to the compute machine set.
