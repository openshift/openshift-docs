= Extending the port range for NodePort services

The `serviceNodePortRange` setting extends the port range available to NodePort services. This option is useful when specific standard ports under the `30000-32767` range need to be exposed. For example, if your device needs to expose the `1883/tcp` MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) port on the network because client devices cannot use a different port.

[IMPORTANT]
====
NodePorts can overlap with system ports, causing a malfunction of the system or {microshift-short}.
====

Consider the following when configuring the NodePort service ranges:

* Do not create any NodePort service without an explicit `nodePort` selection. When an explicit `nodePort` is not specified, the port is assigned randomly by the `kube-apiserver` and cannot be predicted.

* Do not create any NodePort service for any system service port, {microshift-short} port, or other services you expose on your device `HostNetwork`.

* Table one specifies ports to avoid when extending the port range:

.Ports to avoid.
