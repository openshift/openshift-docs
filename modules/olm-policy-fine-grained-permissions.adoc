= Fine-grained permissions

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) uses the service account specified in an Operator group to create or update the following resources related to the Operator being installed:

* `ClusterServiceVersion`
* `Subscription`
* `Secret`
* `ServiceAccount`
* `Service`
* `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding`
* `Role` and `RoleBinding`

In order to confine Operators to a designated namespace, cluster administrators can start by granting the following permissions to the service account:
