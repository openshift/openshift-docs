= Fine-grained permissions

OLM uses the service account specified in OperatorGroup to create or update the
following resources related to the Operator being installed:

* ClusterServiceVersion
* Subscription
* Secret
* ServiceAccount
* Service
* ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding
* Role and RoleBinding

In order to confine Operators to a designated namespace, cluster administrators
can start by granting the following permissions to the service account:

[NOTE]
====
The following role is a generic example and additional rules might be required
based on the specific Operator.
