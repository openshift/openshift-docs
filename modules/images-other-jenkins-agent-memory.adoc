= Jenkins agent memory requirements

A JVM is used in all Jenkins agents to host the Jenkins JNLP agent as well as
to run any Java applications such as `javac`, Maven, or Gradle.

By default, the Jenkins JNLP agent JVM uses 50% of the container memory limit for
its heap. This value can be modified by the `CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT`
environment variable. It can also be capped at an upper limit or overridden
entirely.

By default, any other processes run in the Jenkins agent container, such as
shell scripts or `oc` commands run from pipelines, cannot use more
than the remaining 50% memory limit without provoking an OOM kill.

By default, each further JVM process that runs in a Jenkins agent container uses
up to 25% of the container memory limit for it's heap. It might be necessary to
tune this limit for many build workloads.
