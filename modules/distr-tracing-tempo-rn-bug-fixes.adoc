The {TempoShortName} 3.8.1 patch release includes a fix for the following issue:

CVE-2025-58183::
Before this update, malicious tar archives could be used for denial of service by triggering memory overuse by the `tar.Reader` decompressor. With this update, the Go version upgrade to 1.25.3 enforces a maximum limit on the count of sparse region data blocks. As a result, memory usage when processing these archives is bounded and secure.

The {TempoShortName} 3.8 release fixes the following issues:

Resolved issue with TLS certificates affecting Tempo pods::

Tempo query frontend no longer fails to fetch trace JSON::
Before this update, clicking on *Trace* in the Jaeger UI and refreshing the page, or accessing *Trace* -> *Trace Timeline* -> *Trace JSON* from the Tempo query frontend, might result in the Tempo query pod failing with an EOF error. With this update, this issue is resolved.
