Resolved issue with TLS certificates affecting Tempo pods::
Before this update, the Tempo pods would stop to communicate because internal TLS certificates were renewed. With this update, the Tempo pods automatically restart when certificates are renewed.

Tempo query frontend no longer fails to fetch trace JSON::
Before this update, clicking on *Trace* in the Jaeger UI and refreshing the page, or accessing *Trace* -> *Trace Timeline* -> *Trace JSON* from the Tempo query frontend, might result in the Tempo query pod failing with an EOF error. With this update, this issue is resolved.
