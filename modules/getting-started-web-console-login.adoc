= Logging in to the web console

You can log in to the {product-title} web console to access and manage your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to an {product-title} cluster.

.Procedure

* Log in to the {product-title} web console using your login credentials.

You are redirected to the *Projects* page. For non-administrative users, the default view is the *Developer* perspective. For cluster administrators, the default view is the *Administrator* perspective. If you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges, you will not see the *Administrator* perspective in your web console.

The web console provides two perspectives: the *Administrator* perspective and *Developer* perspective. The *Developer* perspective provides workflows specific to the developer use cases.
