= Collecting Windows application event logs

The `Get-WinEvent` shim on the kubelet `logs` endpoint can be used to collect application event logs from Windows machines.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
* You have created a Windows compute machine set.

.Procedure

* To view logs from all applications logging to the event logs on the Windows machine, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm node-logs -l kubernetes.io/os=windows --path=journal
----
+
The same command is executed when collecting logs with `oc adm must-gather`.
+
Other Windows application logs from the event log can also be collected by specifying the respective service with a `-u` flag. For example, you can run the following command to collect logs for the docker runtime service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm node-logs -l kubernetes.io/os=windows --path=journal -u docker
----
