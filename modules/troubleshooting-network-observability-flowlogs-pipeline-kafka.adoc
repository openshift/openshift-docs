= Flowlogs-Pipeline does not consume network flows after installing Kafka

[role="_abstract"]
Resolve issues where the flow-pipeline fails to consume network flows from Kafka by manually restarting the flow-pipeline pods to restore the connection between the flow collector and your Kafka deployment.

If you deployed the flow collector first with `deploymentModel: KAFKA` and then deployed Kafka, the flow collector might not connect correctly to Kafka. Manually restart the flow-pipeline pods where Flowlogs-pipeline does not consume network flows from Kafka.

.Procedure

. Delete the flow-pipeline pods to restart them by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pods -n netobserv -l app=flowlogs-pipeline-transformer
