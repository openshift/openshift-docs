= Modifying policy categories by using the Policy categories tab

Beginning with version 3.74, {product-title-short} provides a new method to create and manage policy categories in {product-title-managed} or in {product-title-short} if you have the PostgreSQL database enabled. All policy workflows other than policy creation remain unchanged when using this feature.

You can also configure policy categories by using the `PolicyCategoryService` API object. For more information, go to *Help* -> *API reference* in the {product-title-short} portal.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Policy Management*.
. Click the *Policy categories* tab. This tab provides a list of existing categories and allows you to filter the list by category name. You can also click *Show all categories* and select the checkbox to remove default or custom categories from the displayed list.
. Click a policy name to edit or delete it. Default policy categories cannot be selected, edited, or deleted.
