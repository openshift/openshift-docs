= Modifying policy categories using the Policy categories tab

{product-title-short} version 3.74 provides a new method to create and manage policy categories in {product-title-managed} or in {product-title-short} if you have the PostgreSQL database (Technology Preview) enabled. All policy workflows other than policy creation remain unchanged when using this feature. For instructions on using this feature, see the second procedure in the following section.

You can also configure policy categories by using the `PolicyCategoryService` API object. For more information, navigate to *Help* -> *API reference* in the {product-title-short} portal.
