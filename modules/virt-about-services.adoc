= About services

A Kubernetes service exposes network access for clients to an application running on a set of pods. Services offer abstraction, load balancing, and, in the case of the `NodePort` and `LoadBalancer` types, exposure to the outside world.

ClusterIP:: Exposes the service on an internal IP address and as a DNS name to other applications within the cluster. A single service can map to multiple virtual machines. When a client tries to connect to the service, the client's request is load balanced among available backends. `ClusterIP` is the default service type.

NodePort:: Exposes the service on the same port of each selected node in the cluster. `NodePort` makes a port accessible from outside the cluster, as long as the node itself is externally accessible to the client.

LoadBalancer:: Creates an external load balancer in the current cloud (if supported) and assigns a fixed, external IP address to the service.

[NOTE]
====
For on-premise clusters, you can configure a load-balancing service by deploying the MetalLB Operator.
