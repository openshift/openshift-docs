[id="ossm-config-disable-networkpolicy_{context}"]
= Disabling network policies

{ProductName} automatically creates and manages a number of `NetworkPolicies` resources in the control plane and application namespaces. This is to ensure that applications and the control plane can communicate with each other.

If you want to disable the automatic creation and management of `NetworkPolicies` resources, for example to enforce company security policies, you can do so.  You can edit the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` to set the `spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy` setting to `false`

[NOTE]
====
When you disable `spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy` {ProductName} will not create *any* `NetworkPolicy` objects.  The system administrator is responsible for managing the network and fixing any issues this might cause.
====

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Select the project where you installed the control plane, for example `istio-system`, from the Project menu.

. Click the {ProductName} Operator. In the *Istio Service Mesh Control Plane* column, click the name of your `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, for example `basic-install`.

. On the *Create ServiceMeshControlPlane Details* page, click `YAML` to modify your configuration.

. Set the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` field `spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy` to `false`, as shown in this example.
