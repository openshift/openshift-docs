= Live migration for compute nodes

While the management cluster for hosted cluster virtual machines (VMs) is undergoing updates or maintenance, the hosted cluster VMs can be automatically live migrated to prevent disrupting hosted cluster workloads. As a result, the management cluster can be updated without affecting the availability and operation of the KubeVirt platform hosted clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The live migration of KubeVirt VMs is enabled by default provided that the VMs use `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) storage for both the root volume and the storage classes that are mapped to the `kubevirt-csi` CSI provider.
====

You can verify that the VMs in a node pool are capable of live migration by checking the `KubeVirtNodesLiveMigratable` condition in the `status` section of a `NodePool` object. 

In the following example, the VMs cannot be live migrated because RWX storage is not used.

While live migration can protect VMs from disruption in normal circumstances, events such as infrastructure node failure can result in a hard restart of any VMs that are hosted on the failed node. For live migration to be successful, the source node that a VM is hosted on must be working correctly.

When the VMs in a node pool cannot be live migrated, workload disruption might occur on the hosted cluster during maintenance on the management cluster. By default, the {hcp} controllers try to drain the workloads that are hosted on KubeVirt VMs that cannot be live migrated before the VMs are stopped. Draining the hosted cluster nodes before stopping the VMs allows pod disruption budgets to protect workload availability within the hosted cluster.
