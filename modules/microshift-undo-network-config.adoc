= Restoring {microshift-short} networking settings to default

You can remove networking customizations and return the network to default settings by stopping {microshift-short} and running a clean-up script.

.Prerequisites
* RHEL 9 or newer.
* MicroShift 4.14 or newer.
* Access to the host CLI.

.Procedure

. Stop the {microshift-short} service by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl stop microshift
----

. Stop the `kubepods.slice` systemd unit by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl stop kubepods.slice
----

. {microshift-short} installs a helper script to undo network changes made by OVN-K. Run the cleanup script by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo /usr/bin/microshift-cleanup-data --ovn
----

//Q: any sample output? what should we see when we run the script?
