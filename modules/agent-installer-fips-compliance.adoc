= About FIPS compliance

For many {product-title} customers, regulatory readiness, or compliance, on some level is required before any systems can be put into production. That regulatory readiness can be imposed by national standards, industry standards or the organization's corporate governance framework.
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliance is one of the most critical components required in highly secure environments to ensure that only supported cryptographic technologies are allowed on nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a {op-system-base-full} computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/assembly_installing-the-system-in-fips-mode_security-hardening[Installing the system in FIPS mode]. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
