= Configuring alert notifications

[role="_abstract"]
In {ocp}, an administrator can enable alert routing for user-defined projects with one of the following methods:

* Use the default platform Alertmanager instance.
* Use a separate Alertmanager instance only for user-defined projects.

Developers and other users with the `alert-routing-edit` cluster role can configure custom alert notifications for their user-defined projects by configuring alert receivers.

[NOTE]
====
Review the following limitations of alert routing for user-defined projects:

* User-defined alert routing is scoped to the namespace in which the resource is defined. For example, a routing configuration in namespace `ns1` only applies to `PrometheusRules` resources in the same namespace.

* When a namespace is excluded from user-defined monitoring, `AlertmanagerConfig` resources in the namespace cease to be part of the Alertmanager configuration.
