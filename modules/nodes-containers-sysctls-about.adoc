= About sysctls

In Linux, the sysctl interface allows an administrator to modify kernel
parameters at runtime. Parameters are available via the *_/proc/sys/_* virtual
process file system. The parameters cover various subsystems, such as:

- kernel (common prefix: *_kernel._*)
- networking (common prefix: *_net._*)
- virtual memory (common prefix: *_vm._*)
- MDADM (common prefix: *_dev._*)

More subsystems are described in
link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/README[Kernel documentation].
To get a list of all parameters, run:

[[namespaced-vs-node-level-sysctls]]
== Namespaced versus node-level sysctls

A number of sysctls are _namespaced_ in the Linux kernels. This means that
you can set them independently for each pod on a node. Being namespaced is a
requirement for sysctls to be accessible in a pod context within Kubernetes.

The following sysctls are known to be namespaced:

- *_kernel.shm*_*
- *_kernel.msg*_*
- *_kernel.sem_*
- *_fs.mqueue.*_*

Additionally, most of the sysctls in the *net.** group are known
to be namespaced. Their namespace adoption differs based on the kernel
version and distributor.

Sysctls that are not namespaced are called _node-level_ and must be set
manually by the cluster administrator, either by means of the underlying Linux
distribution of the nodes, such as by modifying the *_/etc/sysctls.conf_* file,
or by using a daemon set with privileged containers. You can use
the Node Tuning Operator to set _node-level_ sysctls.


[NOTE]
====
Consider marking nodes with special sysctls as tainted. Only schedule pods onto
them that need those sysctl settings. Use the taints and toleration feature to mark the nodes.

[[safe-vs-unsafe-sysclts]]
== Safe versus unsafe sysctls

Sysctls are grouped into _safe_ and _unsafe_ sysctls.

For a sysctl to be considered safe, it must use proper
namespacing and must be properly isolated between pods on the same
node. This means that if you set a sysctl for one pod it must not:

- Influence any other pod on the node
- Harm the node's health
- Gain CPU or memory resources outside of the resource limits of a pod

{product-title} supports, or whitelists, the following sysctls
in the safe set:

- *_kernel.shm_rmid_forced_*
- *_net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range_*
- *_net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies_*
- *_net.ipv4.ping_group_range_*

All safe sysctls are enabled by default. You can use a sysctl in a pod by modifying
the `Pod` spec.

Any sysctl not whitelisted by {product-title} is considered unsafe for {product-title}.
Note that being namespaced alone is not sufficient for the sysctl to be considered safe.

All unsafe sysctls are disabled by default, and the cluster administrator must
manually enable them on a per-node basis. Pods with disabled unsafe sysctls 
are scheduled but do not launch.
