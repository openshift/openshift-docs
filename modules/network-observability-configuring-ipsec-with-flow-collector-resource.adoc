= Configuring IPsec with the FlowCollector custom resource

[role="_abstract"]
Enable IPsec tracking in the `FlowCollector` resource to monitor encrypted traffic, adding an IPsec status column to the traffic flow view and generating a dedicated encryption dashboard.

In {product-title}, IPsec is disabled by default. You can enable IPsec by following the instructions in "Configuring IPsec encryption".

.Prerequisite

* You have enabled IPsec encryption on {product-title}.

.Procedure
. In the web console, navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster* then select the *YAML* tab.
. Configure the `FlowCollector` custom resource for IPsec:

.Verification

When IPsec is enabled:

* A new column named *IPsec Status* is displayed in the network observability *Traffic flows* view to show whether a flow was successfully IPsec-encrypted or if there was an error during encryption/decryption.

* A new dashboard showing the percent of encrypted traffic is generated.
