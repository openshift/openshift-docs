= Velero plugins returning "received EOF, stopping recv loop" message

[NOTE]
====
Velero plugins are started as separate processes. After the Velero operation has completed, either successfully or not, they exit. Receiving a `received EOF, stopping recv loop` message in the debug logs indicates that a plugin operation has completed. It does not mean that an error has occurred.
