= Troubleshoot the Splunk add-on

[role="_abstract"]
If you stop receiving events from the {product-title} add-on, check the Splunk add-on debug logs for errors.

Splunk creates a debug log file for every configured input in the `/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk` directory. Find the file named `stackrox_<input>_<uid>.log`, for example, `stackrox_compliance_29a3e14798aa2363d.log` and look for issues.
