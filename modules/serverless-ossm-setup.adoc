= Integrating {SMProductShortName} with {ServerlessProductName}

You can integrate {SMProductShortName} with {ServerlessProductName} without using Kourier as the default ingress. To do this, do not install the Knative Serving component before completing the following procedure. There are additional steps required when creating the `KnativeServing` custom resource definition (CRD) to integrate Knative Serving with {SMProductShortName}, which are not covered in the general Knative Serving installation procedure. This procedure might be useful if you want to integrate {SMProductShortName} as the default and only ingress for your {ServerlessProductName} installation.

.Prerequisites

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster administrator access.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster or dedicated administrator access.
endif::[]

* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

* Install the {SMProductName} Operator and create a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource in the `istio-system` namespace. If you want to use mTLS functionality, you must also set the `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls` field for the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to `true`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Using {ServerlessProductName} with {SMProductShortName} is only supported with {SMProductName} version 2.0.5 or later.
====

* Install the {ServerlessOperatorName}.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Add the namespaces that you would like to integrate with {SMProductShortName} to the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` object as members:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  members: <1>
    - knative-serving
    - <namespace>
----
<1> A list of namespaces to be integrated with {SMProductShortName}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
This list of namespaces must include the `knative-serving` namespace.
====

. Apply the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

. Create the necessary gateways so that {SMProductShortName} can accept traffic:
+
.Example `knative-local-gateway` object using HTTP
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: knative-ingress-gateway
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
    - port:
        number: 443
        name: https
        protocol: HTTPS
      hosts:
        - "*"
      tls:
        mode: SIMPLE
        credentialName: <wildcard_certs> <1>
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
 name: knative-local-gateway
 namespace: knative-serving
spec:
 selector:
   istio: ingressgateway
 servers:
   - port:
       number: 8081
       name: http
       protocol: HTTP <2>
     hosts:
       - "*"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
 name: knative-local-gateway
 namespace: istio-system
 labels:
   experimental.istio.io/disable-gateway-port-translation: "true"
spec:
 type: ClusterIP
 selector:
   istio: ingressgateway
 ports:
   - name: http2
     port: 80
     targetPort: 8081
----
<1> Add the name of the secret that contains the wildcard certificate.
<2> The `knative-local-gateway` serves HTTP traffic. Using HTTP means that traffic coming from outside of {SMProductShortName}, but using an internal hostname, such as `example.default.svc.cluster.local`, is not encrypted. You can set up encryption for this path by creating another wildcard certificate and an additional gateway that uses a different `protocol` spec.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: knative-local-gateway
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
    - port:

      hosts:
        - "*"
      tls:
        mode: SIMPLE
        credentialName: <wildcard_certs>
----

. Apply the `Gateway` resources:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

. Install Knative Serving by creating the following `KnativeServing` custom resource definition (CRD), which also enables the Istio integration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeServing
metadata:
  name: knative-serving
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  ingress:
    istio:
      enabled: true <1>
  deployments: <2>
  - name: activator
    annotations:
      "sidecar.istio.io/inject": "true"
      "sidecar.istio.io/rewriteAppHTTPProbers": "true"
  - name: autoscaler
    annotations:
      "sidecar.istio.io/inject": "true"
      "sidecar.istio.io/rewriteAppHTTPProbers": "true"
----
<1> Enables Istio integration.
<2> Enables sidecar injection for Knative Serving data plane pods.

. Apply the `KnativeServing` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

. Create a Knative Service that has sidecar injection enabled and uses a pass-through route:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: <service_name>
  namespace: <namespace> <1>
  annotations:
    serving.knative.openshift.io/enablePassthrough: "true" <2>
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true" <3>
        sidecar.istio.io/rewriteAppHTTPProbers: "true"
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: <image_url>
----
<1> A namespace that is part of the Service Mesh member roll.
<2> Instructs Knative Serving to generate an {product-title} pass-through enabled route, so that the certificates you have generated are served through the ingress gateway directly.
<3> Injects {SMProductShortName} sidecars into the Knative service pods.

. Apply the `Service` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

.Verification

* Access your serverless application by using a secure connection that is now trusted by the CA:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl --cacert root.crt <service_url>
----
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl --cacert root.crt https://hello-default.apps.openshift.example.com
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Hello Openshift!
