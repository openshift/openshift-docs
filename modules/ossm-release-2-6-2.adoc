== Fixed issues

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-8099[OSSM-8099] Previously, there was an issue supporting persistent session labels when the endpoints were in the draining phase. Now, there is a method of handling draining endpoints for the stateful header sessions.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-8001[OSSM-8001] Previously, when `runAsUser` and `runAsGroup` were set to the same value in pods, the proxy GID was incorrectly set to match the container's GID, causing traffic interception issues with iptables rules applied by Istio CNI. Now, containers can have the same value for runAsUser and runAsGroup, and iptables rules apply correctly.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-8074[OSSM-8074] Previously, the Kiali Operator failed to install the Kiali server when a {SMProductShortName} had a numeric-only namespace (e.g., `12345`). Now, namespaces with only numerals work correctly.
