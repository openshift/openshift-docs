= Creating a manifest object that includes a customized br-ex bridge

[role="_abstract"]
ifndef::postinstall-bare-metal[]
As an alternative to using the `configure-ovs.sh` shell script to set a `br-ex` bridge on a bare-metal platform, you can create a `MachineConfig` object that includes an NMState configuration file. The host `nmstate-configuration.service` and `nmstate.service` apply the NMState configuration file to each node that runs in your cluster.
endif::postinstall-bare-metal[]

ifdef::postinstall-bare-metal[]
As an alternative to using the `configure-ovs.sh` shell script to set a `br-ex` bridge on a bare-metal platform, you can create a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) custom resource (CR) that includes an NMState configuration file. 

The Kubernetes NMState Operator uses the NMState configuration file to create a customized `br-ex` bridge network configuration on each node in your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After creating the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` CR, copy content from the NMState configuration file that was created during cluster installation into the NNCP CR. An incomplete NNCP CR file means that the network policy described in the file cannot get applied to nodes in the cluster. 
====

This feature supports the following tasks:

* Modifying the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for your cluster.
* Modifying attributes of a different bond interface, such as MIImon (Media Independent Interface Monitor), bonding mode, or Quality of Service (QoS).
* Updating DNS values.
endif::postinstall-bare-metal[]

Consider the following use cases for creating a manifest object that includes a customized `br-ex` bridge:

* You want to make postinstallation changes to the bridge, such as changing the Open vSwitch (OVS) or OVN-Kubernetes `br-ex` bridge network. The `configure-ovs.sh` shell script does not support making postinstallation changes to the bridge.
* You want to deploy the bridge on a different interface than the interface available on a host or server IP address.
* You want to make advanced configurations to the bridge that are not possible with the `configure-ovs.sh` shell script. Using the script for these configurations might result in the bridge failing to connect multiple network interfaces and facilitating data forwarding between the interfaces.

ifndef::postinstall-bare-metal[]
[NOTE]
====
If you require an environment with a single network interface controller (NIC) and default network settings, use the `configure-ovs.sh` shell script.
====

After you install {op-system-first} and the system reboots, the Machine Config Operator injects Ignition configuration files into each node in your cluster, so that each node received the `br-ex` bridge network configuration. To prevent configuration conflicts, the `configure-ovs.sh` shell script receives a signal to not configure the `br-ex` bridge.
endif::postinstall-bare-metal[]

[WARNING]
====
The following list of interface names are reserved and you cannot use the names with NMstate configurations:

* `br-ext`
* `br-int`
* `br-local`
* `br-nexthop`
* `br0`
* `ext-vxlan`
* `ext`
* `genev_sys_*`
* `int`
* `k8s-*`
* `ovn-k8s-*`
* `patch-br-*`
* `tun0`
* `vxlan_sys_*`
====

.Prerequisites
ifndef::postinstall-bare-metal[]
* Optional: You have installed the link:https://nmstate.io/[`nmstate`] API so that you can validate the NMState configuration.
endif::postinstall-bare-metal[]

ifdef::postinstall-bare-metal[]
* You set a customized `br-ex` by using the alternative method to `configure-ovs`.
* You installed the Kubernetes NMState Operator.

ifndef::postinstall-bare-metal[]
. Create an NMState configuration file and define a customized `br-ex` bridge network configuration in the file:

where:

`interfaces.name`:: Name of the interface.
`interfaces.type`:: The type of ethernet.
`interfaces.state`:: The requested state for the interface after creation.
`ipv4.enabled`:: Disables IPv4 and IPv6 in this example.
`port.name`:: The node NIC to which the bridge attaches.
`auto-route-metric`:: Set the parameter to `48` to ensure the `br-ex` default route always has the highest precedence (lowest metric). This configuration prevents routing conflicts with any other interfaces that are automatically configured by the `NetworkManager` service.

. Use the `cat` command to base64-encode the contents of the NMState configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <nmstate_configuration>.yml | base64
----
+
where:
+
`<nmstate_configuration>`:: Replace `<nmstate_configuration>` with the name of your NMState resource YAML file.

. Create a `MachineConfig` manifest file and define a customized `br-ex` bridge network configuration analogous to the following example:
+

        mode: 0644
        overwrite: true
        path: /etc/nmstate/openshift/worker-1.yml
# ...
----
+
where:
+
`metadata.name`:: The name of the policy.
`contents.source`:: Writes the encoded base64 information to the specified path.
`path`:: For each node in your cluster, specify the hostname path to your node and the base-64 encoded Ignition configuration file data for the machine type. The `worker` role is the default role for nodes in your cluster. You must use the `.yml` extension for configuration files, such as `$(hostname -s).yml` when specifying the short hostname path for each node or all nodes in the `MachineConfig` manifest file.
+
If you have a single global configuration specified in an `/etc/nmstate/openshift/cluster.yml` configuration file that you want to apply to all nodes in your cluster, you do not need to specify the short hostname path for each node, such as `/etc/nmstate/openshift/<node_hostname>.yml`. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
      - contents:
          source: data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,<base64_encoded_nmstate_configuration>
        mode: 0644
        overwrite: true
        path: /etc/nmstate/openshift/cluster.yml
# ...
----

. Apply the updates from the `MachineConfig` object to your cluster by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <machine_config>.yml

endif::postinstall-bare-metal[]

ifdef::postinstall-bare-metal[]
* Create a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) CR and define a customized `br-ex` bridge network configuration. The `br-ex` NNCP CR must include the OVN-Kubernetes masquerade IP address and subnet of your network. The example NNCP CR includes default values in the `ipv4.address.ip` and `ipv6.address.ip` parameters. You can set the masquerade IP address in the `ipv4.address.ip`, `ipv6.address.ip`, or both parameters.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
As a post-installation task, you cannot change the primary IP address of the customized `br-ex` bridge. If you want to convert your single-stack cluster network to a dual-stack cluster network, you can add or change a secondary IPv6 address in the NNCP CR, but the existing primary IP address cannot be changed.
