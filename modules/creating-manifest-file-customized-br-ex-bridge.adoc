== Creating a manifest object that includes a customized `br-ex` bridge

ifndef::postinstall-bare-metal-ipi,postinstall-bare-metal-upi[]
As an alternative to using the `configure-ovs.sh` shell script to set a customized `br-ex` bridge on a bare-metal platform, you can create a `MachineConfig` object that includes a customized `br-ex` bridge network configuration.

As an alternative to using the `configure-ovs.sh` shell script to set a customized `br-ex` bridge on a bare-metal platform, you can create a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` custom resource (CR) that includes a customized `br-ex` bridge network configuration.

:FeatureName: Creating a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` CR that includes a customized `br-ex` bridge
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

This feature supports the following tasks:

* Modifying the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for your cluster.
* Modifying attributes of a different bond interface, such as MIImon (Media Independent Interface Monitor), bonding mode, or Quality of Service (QoS).
* Updating DNS values.
endif::postinstall-bare-metal-ipi,postinstall-bare-metal-upi[]

Consider the following use cases for creating a manifest object that includes a customized `br-ex` bridge:

* You want to make postinstallation changes to the bridge, such as changing the Open vSwitch (OVS) or OVN-Kubernetes `br-ex` bridge network. The `configure-ovs.sh` shell script does not support making postinstallation changes to the bridge.
* You want to deploy the bridge on a different interface than the interface available on a host or server IP address.
* You want to make advanced configurations to the bridge that are not possible with the `configure-ovs.sh` shell script. Using the script for these configurations might result in the bridge failing to connect multiple network interfaces and facilitating data forwarding between the interfaces.

ifndef::postinstall-bare-metal-ipi,postinstall-bare-metal-upi[]

[NOTE]
====
If you require an environment with a single network interface controller (NIC) and default network settings, use the `configure-ovs.sh` shell script.
====

After you install {op-system-first} and the system reboots, the Machine Config Operator injects Ignition configuration files into each node in your cluster, so that each node received the `br-ex` bridge network configuration. To prevent configuration conflicts, the `configure-ovs.sh` shell script receives a signal to not configure the `br-ex` bridge.

.Prerequisites
ifndef::postinstall-bare-metal-ipi,postinstall-bare-metal-upi[]
* Optional: You have installed the link:https://nmstate.io/[`nmstate`] API so that you can validate the NMState configuration.

ifdef::postinstall-bare-metal-ipi,postinstall-bare-metal-upi[]
* You set a customized `br-ex` by using the alternative method to `configure-ovs`.
* You installed the Kubernetes NMState Operator.

.Procedure

ifndef::postinstall-bare-metal-ipi,postinstall-bare-metal-upi[]
. Create a NMState configuration file that has decoded base64 information for your customized `br-ex` bridge network:

. Use the `cat` command to base64-encode the contents of the NMState configuration:
+

----
$ cat <nmstate_configuration>.yaml | base64 <1>
----
<1> Replace `<nmstate_configuration>` with the name of your NMState resource YAML file.

. Create a `MachineConfig` manifest file and define a customized `br-ex` bridge network configuration analogous to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]

# ...
----
<1> For each node in your cluster, specify the hostname path to your node and the base-64 encoded Ignition configuration file data for the machine type. If you have a single global configuration specified in an `/etc/nmstate/openshift/cluster.yml` configuration file that you want to apply to all nodes in your cluster, you do not need to specify the hostname path for each node. The `worker` role is the default role for nodes in your cluster. The `.yaml` extension does not work when specifying the hostname path for each node or all nodes in the `MachineConfig` manifest file.
<2> The name of the policy.
<3> Writes the encoded base64 information to the specified path.

. Create a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) CR and define a customized `br-ex` bridge network configuration. Depending on your needs, ensure that you set a masquerade IP for either the `ipv4.address.ip`, `ipv6.address.ip`, or both parameters. A masquerade IP address must match an in-use IP address block.
