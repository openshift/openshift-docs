= Mirroring from mirror to mirror

You can use the oc-mirror plugin to mirror an image set directly to a target mirror registry that is accessible during image set creation.

You are required to specify a storage backend in the image set configuration file. This storage backend can be a local directory or a Docker v2 registry. The oc-mirror plugin stores metadata in this storage backend during image set creation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not delete or modify the metadata that is generated by the oc-mirror plugin. You must use the same storage backend every time you run the oc-mirror plugin for the same mirror registry.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the internet to get the required container images.
* You installed the {oc-first}.
* You installed the oc-mirror CLI plugin.
* You created the image set configuration file.

.Procedure

* Run the `oc mirror` command to mirror the images from the specified image set configuration to a specified registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror --config=./<imageset-config.yaml> \// <1>
  docker://registry.example:5000             <2>
----
<1> Specify the image set configuration file that you created. For example, `imageset-config.yaml`.
<2> Specify the registry to mirror the image set file to. The registry must start with `docker://`. If you specify a top-level namespace for the mirror registry, you must also use this same namespace on subsequent executions.

.Verification

. Navigate into the `oc-mirror-workspace/` directory that was generated.
. Navigate into the results directory, for example, `results-1639608409/`.
. Verify that YAML files are present for the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` and `CatalogSource` resources.

[NOTE]
====
The `repositoryDigestMirrors` section of the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` YAML file is used for the `install-config.yaml` file during installation.
====

.Next steps
* Convert the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` YAML content for use in manually configuring CRI-O.
* If required, mirror the images from mirror to disk for disconnected or offline use.
* Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror.
