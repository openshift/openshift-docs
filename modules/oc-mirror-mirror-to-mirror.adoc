= Mirroring from mirror to mirror

You can use the oc-mirror plugin to mirror an image set directly to a target mirror registry that is accessible during image set creation.

// TODO: This note might be obsolete come GA, if they change the impl
[IMPORTANT]
====
Depending on the configuration specified in the image set configuration file, using oc-mirror to mirror images might download several hundreds of gigabytes of data to disk before mirroring to the destination mirror registry.

The initial image set download when you populate the mirror registry is often the largest. Because you only download the images that changed since the last time you ran the command, when you run the oc-mirror plugin again, the generated image set is often smaller.
====

You are required to specify a storage backend in the image set configuration file. This storage backend can be a local directory or a Docker v2 registry. The oc-mirror plugin stores metadata in this storage backend during image set creation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not delete or modify the metadata that is generated by the oc-mirror plugin. You must use the same storage backend every time you run the oc-mirror plugin for the same mirror registry.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have installed the `oc-mirror` CLI plugin.
* You have created the image set configuration file.

.Procedure

* Run the `oc mirror` command to mirror the images from the specified image set configuration to a specified registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror --config=./imageset-config.yaml \ <1>
  docker://registry.example:5000              <2>
----
<1> Pass in the image set configuration file that was created. This procedure assumes that it is named `imageset-config.yaml`.
<2> Specify the registry to mirror the image set file to. The registry must start with `docker://`. If you specify a top-level namespace for the mirror registry, you must also use this same namespace on subsequent executions.

.Verification

. Navigate into the `oc-mirror-workspace/` directory that was generated.
. Navigate into the results directory, for example, `results-1639608409/`.
. Verify that YAML files are present for the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` and `CatalogSource` resources.
+
// TODO: Test and get some better wording/example output.

.Next steps

* Install the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` and `CatalogSource` resources into the cluster.
