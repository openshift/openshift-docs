= Creating an {cluster-manager} IAM role

You create your {cluster-manager} IAM roles by using the command-line interface (CLI).

.Prerequisites

* You have an AWS account.
* You have Red Hat Organization Administrator privileges in the {cluster-manager} organization.
* You have the permissions required to install AWS account-wide roles.
* You have installed and configured the latest AWS (`aws`) and ROSA (`rosa`) CLIs on your installation host.

.Procedure
* To create an ocm-role IAM role with basic privileges, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create ocm-role
----
+
* To create an ocm-role IAM role with admin privileges, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create ocm-role --admin
----
+
This command allows you create the role by specifying specific attributes. The following example output shows the "auto mode" selected, which lets the `rosa` CLI to create your Operator roles and policies. See "Methods of account-wide role creation" in the Additional resources for more information.

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Creating ocm role
? Role prefix: ManagedOpenShift <1>
? Enable admin capabilities for the OCM role (optional): No <2>
? Permissions boundary ARN (optional):  <3>
? Role creation mode: auto <4>
I: Creating role using 'arn:aws:iam::<ARN>:user/<UserName>'
? Create the 'ManagedOpenShift-OCM-Role-182' role? Yes <5>
I: Created role 'ManagedOpenShift-OCM-Role-182' with ARN  'arn:aws:iam::<ARN>:role/ManagedOpenShift-OCM-Role-182'
I: Linking OCM role
? OCM Role ARN: arn:aws:iam::<ARN>:role/ManagedOpenShift-OCM-Role-182 <6>
? Link the 'arn:aws:iam::<ARN>:role/ManagedOpenShift-OCM-Role-182' role with organization '<AWS ARN'? Yes <7>
I: Successfully linked role-arn 'arn:aws:iam::<ARN>:role/ManagedOpenShift-OCM-Role-182' with organization account '<AWS ARN>'

<5> The auto method asks if you want to create a specific `ocm-role` using your prefix.
<6> Confirm that you want to associate your IAM role with your {cluster-manager}.
<7> Links the created role with your AWS organization.
