= Fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
The following issues are fixed with this release:

* Before this update, the router incorrectly assumed that only `SHA1` leaf certificates were rejected by HAProxy. As a consequence, the router failed because it also rejected `SHA1` intermediate certificates. With this release, the router inspects all non-self-signed certificates and rejects any certificates that use `SHA1`. As a result, the router no longer fails. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-49392[OCPBUGS-49392])

* Before this update, the `/auth/error` page did not render correctly. As a consequence, the page was empty and error details did not appear. With this release, the front end error page content now renders on the `/auth/error` page. As a result, the expected error content is displayed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65601[OCPBUGS-65601])

* Before this update, a recent regression in `runc` prevented the successful start of pods when the `shareProcessNamespace` parameter was set to `true`. With this release, a subsequent update to `runc` corrects the regression.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65979[OCPBUGS-65979])
