[id="fixed-issues-1-5-1_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

The following list highlights fixed issues in {builds-shortname} 1.5.1.

* Before this update, adding volumes to `Build` and `Buildrun` custom resources (CR) failed due to empty fields in the Custom Resource Definition (CRD). With this update, the empty fields in the CRD are removed.
* Before this update, using `ExtKeyUsageAny` field in an `x509` certificate disabled policy validation in `crypto/x509`. This affected certificate chains that contain policy graphs. With this update, using `ExtKeyUsageAny` field does not disable the policy validation. link:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-22874[CVE-2025-22874] 
* Before this update, the correct build container images were not pulled in a disconnected cluster because the image SHAs were not synchronized. With this fix, the SHAs of the images are updated and synced between the operator bundle and the build strategies. This ensures that correct build container images are pulled in a disconnected cluster.
