[id="logging-5-5-1-enhancements_{context}"]
== Enhancements
* This enhancement adds an *Aggregated Logs* tab to the *Pod Details* page of the {product-title} web console when the Logging Console Plug-in is in use. This enhancement is only available on {product-title} 4.10 and later. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2647[LOG-2647])

* This enhancement adds Google Cloud Logging as an output option for log forwarding. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1482[LOG-1482])

[id="logging-5-5-1-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the Operator did not ensure that the pod was ready, which caused the cluster to reach an inoperable state during a cluster restart. With this update, the Operator marks new pods as ready before continuing to a new pod during a restart, which resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2745[LOG-2745])

* Before this update, Fluentd would sometimes not recognize that the Kubernetes platform rotated the log file and would no longer read log messages. This update corrects that by setting the configuration parameter suggested by the upstream development team. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2995[LOG-2995])

* Before this update, the addition of multi-line error detection caused internal routing to change and forward records to the wrong destination. With this update, the internal routing is correct. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2801[LOG-2801])

* Before this update, changing the {product-title} web console's refresh interval created an error when the *Query* field was empty. With this update, changing the interval is not an available option when the *Query* field is empty. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2917[LOG-2917])
