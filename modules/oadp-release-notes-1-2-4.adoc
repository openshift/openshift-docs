There are no resolved issues in {oadp-short} 1.2.4.


[id="known-issues-1-2-4_{context}"]
== Known issues

The {oadp-short} 1.2.4 has the following known issue:

.Data Protection Application (DPA) does not reconcile when the credentials secret is updated

Currently, the {oadp-short} Operator does not reconcile when you update the `cloud-credentials` secret. This occurs because there are no {oadp-short} specific labels or owner references on the `cloud-credentials` secret. If you create a `cloud-credentials` secret with incorrect credentials, such as empty data, the Operator reconciles and creates a Backup Storage Location (BSL) and registry deployment with the empty data. As a result, when you update the `cloud-credentials` secret with the correct credentials, the Operator does not immediately reconcile to catch the new credentials.

Workaround: Update to {oadp-short} 1.3.
