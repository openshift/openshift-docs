= About configuring parallel container image pulls

To help control bandwidth issues, you can configure the number of workload images that can be pulled at the same time. 

By default, the cluster pulls images in parallel, which allows multiple workloads to pull images at the same time. Pulling multiple images in parallel can improve workload start-up time because workloads can pull needed images without waiting for each other. However, pulling too many images at the same time can use excessive network bandwidth and cause latency issues throughout your cluster.

The default setting allows unlimited simultaneous image pulls. But, you can configure the maximum number of images that can be pulled in parallel. You can also force serial image pulling, which means that only one image can be pulled at a time.

To control the number of images that can be pulled simultaneously, use a kubelet configuration to set the `maxParallelImagePulls` to specify a limit. Additional image pulls above this limit are held until one of the current pulls is complete.

To force serial image pulls, use a kubelet configuration to set `serializeImagePulls` field to `true`.
