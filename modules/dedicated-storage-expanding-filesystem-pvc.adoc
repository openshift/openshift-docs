= Expanding {product-title} Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)

Expanding PVCs based on volume types that need file system re-sizing,
such as AWS EBS, is a two-step process.
This process involves expanding volume objects in the cloud provider and
then expanding the file system on the actual node. These steps occur automatically
after the PVC object is edited and might require a pod restart to take effect.

Expanding the file system on the node only happens when a new pod is started
with the volume.

.Prerequisites

* The controlling StorageClass must have `allowVolumeExpansion` set
to `true`. This is the default configuration in {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Decreasing the size of an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume is not supported. However, you
can create a smaller volume and then migrate your data to it by using a
tool such as `oc rsync`. After modifying a volume, you must wait at least six hours before
making additional modifications to the same volume.
====

.Procedure

. Edit the PVC and request a new size by editing the `spec.resources.requests.storage`
value. The following `oc patch` command will change the PVC's size:
+
----
$ oc patch pvc <pvc_name> -p '{"spec": {"resources": {"requests": {"storage": "8Gi"}}}}'
----

. Once the cloud provider object has finished re-sizing, the PVC might be set to
`FileSystemResizePending`. The following command is used to check
the condition:
+

. If the output of the previous command included a message to restart the pod, delete the mounting pod that it specified:
+
----
$ oc delete pod mysql-1-q4nz7

. Once the pod is running, the newly requested size is available and the
`FileSystemResizePending` condition is removed from the PVC.
