= About the {operator-name}

The {operator-name} checks clusters that are deployed on vSphere for common installation and misconfiguration issues that are related to storage.

The Operator runs in the `openshift-cluster-storage-operator` namespace and is started by the Cluster Storage Operator when the Cluster Storage Operator detects that the cluster is deployed on vSphere. The {operator-name} communicates with the vSphere vCenter Server to determine the virtual machines in the cluster, the default datastore, and other information about the vSphere vCenter Server configuration. The Operator uses the credentials from the Cloud Credential Operator to connect to vSphere.

The Operator runs the checks according to the following schedule:

* The checks run every 8 hours.

* If any check fails, the Operator runs the checks again in intervals of 1 minute, 2 minutes, 4, 8, and so on. The Operator doubles the interval up to a maximum interval of 8 hours.

* When all checks pass, the schedule returns to an 8 hour interval.

The Operator increases the frequency of the checks after a failure so that the Operator can report success quickly after the failure condition is remedied. You can run the Operator manually for immediate troubleshooting information.
