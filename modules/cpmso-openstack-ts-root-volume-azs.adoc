= Configuring {rh-openstack} clusters that have machines with root volume availability zones after an upgrade

For some clusters that run on {rh-openstack-first} that you upgrade, you must manually update machine resources before you can use control plane machine sets if the following configurations are true:

* You upgraded the cluster from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14.

* The cluster infrastructure is installer-provisioned.

* Machines were distributed across multiple availability zones.

* Machines were configured to use root volumes for which block storage availability zones were not defined.

To understand why this procedure is necessary, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7013893[Solution #7024383].

.Procedure

. For all control plane machines, edit the provider spec for all control plane machines that match the environment. For example, to edit the machine `master-0`, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machine/<cluster_id>-master-0 -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
where:
+
`<cluster_id>`:: Specifies the ID of the upgraded cluster.

. In the provider spec, set the value of the property `rootVolume.availabilityZone` to the volume of the availability zone you want to use.

----
<1> Set the zone name as this value.

[NOTE]
====
If you edited or recreated machine resources after your initial cluster deployment, you might have to adapt these steps for your configuration.

In your {rh-openstack} cluster, find the availability zone of the root volumes for your machines and use that as the value.
====

. Run the following command to retrieve information about the control plane machine set resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster --namespace openshift-machine-api
----

. Run the following command to edit the resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster --namespace openshift-machine-api
----

. For that resource, set the value of the `spec.state` property to `Active` to activate control plane machine sets for your cluster.

Your control plane is ready to be managed by the Cluster Control Plane Machine Set Operator.
