= Creating a welcome page

Since Rails 4 no longer serves a static `public/index.html` page in production,
you must create a new root page.

In order to have a custom welcome page must do following steps:

* Create a *controller* with an index action
* Create a *view* page for the `welcome` controller `index` action
* Create a *route* that will serve applications root page with the created
*controller* and *view*

Rails offers a generator that will do all necessary steps for you.

.Procedure

. Run Rails generator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rails generate controller welcome index
----
+
All the necessary files are created.

. edit line 2 in `config/routes.rb` file as follows:
+
----
root 'welcome#index'
----

. Run the rails server to verify the page is available:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rails server
----
+
You should see your page by visiting *http://localhost:3000* in your browser.
If you do not see the page, check the logs that are output to your server to debug.
