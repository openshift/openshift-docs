= Set soft dependencies between kernel modules

Some configurations require that several kernel modules be loaded in a specific order to work properly, even though the modules do not directly depend on each other through symbols.
These are called soft dependencies.
`depmod` is usually not aware of these dependencies, and they do not appear in the files it produces.
For example, if `mod_a` has a soft dependency on `mod_b`, `modprobe mod_a` will not load `mod_b`.

You can resolve these situations by declaring soft dependencies in the Module Custom Resource Definition (CRD) using the `modulesLoadingOrder` field.

spec:
  moduleLoader:
    container:
      modprobe:
        moduleName: mod_a
        dirName: /opt
        firmwarePath: /firmware
        parameters:
          - param=1
        modulesLoadingOrder:
          - mod_a
          - mod_b
----

In the configuration above:

* The loading order is `mod_b`, then `mod_a`.
* The unloading order is `mod_a`, then `mod_b`.

[NOTE]
====
The first value in the list, to be loaded last, must be equivalent to the `moduleName`.
