= Scheduling recurring upgrades for your cluster

You can schedule recurring, automatic upgrades for z-stream patch versions for your {product-title} cluster through the {cluster-manager} console.

.Procedure

. Log in to {cluster-manager-url}.
. Select a cluster to upgrade.
. Click the *Settings* tab.
. In the *Update strategy* pane, select *Recurring updates*.
. Select a preferred day of the week and start time for the upgrade, when updates are available.
. Provide an administrator’s acknowledgment and click *Approve and continue*. {cluster-manager} does not start scheduled y-stream updates for minor versions without receiving an administrator’s acknowledgment.
+
For information about administrator acknowledgment, see xref:./../upgrading/rosa-upgrading-cluster-prepare.adoc#upgrade-49-acknowledgement_rosa-updating-cluster-prepare[Administrator acknowledgment when upgrading to OpenShift 4.9].
. In the *Node draining* pane, select a grace period interval from the list. The grace period enables the nodes to gracefully drain before forcing the pod eviction. The default is *1 hour*.
. In the *Update strategy* pane, click *Save* to apply your update strategy.
+
When upgrades are available, they are automatically applied to the cluster on the preferred day of the week and start time.
