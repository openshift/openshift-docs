= About the {insights-operator}

The {insights-operator} periodically gathers configuration and component failure status and, by default, reports that data every two hours to Red{nbsp}Hat. This information enables Red{nbsp}Hat to assess configuration and deeper failure data than is reported through Telemetry.

Users of {product-title} can display the report of each cluster in the {insights-advisor-url} service on {hybrid-console}. If any issues have been identified, {red-hat-lightspeed} provides further details and, if available, steps on how to solve a problem.

The {insights-operator} does not collect identifying information, such as user names, passwords, or certificates. See link:https://console.redhat.com/security/insights[{red-hat-lightspeed} Data & Application Security] for information about {red-hat-lightspeed} data collection and controls.

Red Hat uses all connected cluster information to:

* Identify potential cluster issues and provide a solution and preventive actions in the {insights-advisor-url} service on {hybrid-console}
* Improve {product-title} by providing aggregated and critical information to product and support teams
* Make {product-title} more intuitive
