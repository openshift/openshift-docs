= About the Insights Operator

The Insights Operator periodically gathers configuration and component failure status and, by default, reports that data every two hours to Red Hat. This information enables Red Hat to assess configuration and deeper failure data than is reported through Telemetry.

Users of {product-title} can display the report of each cluster in {cloud-redhat-com}. If any issues have been identified, Insights provides further details and, if available, steps on how to solve a problem.

The Insights Operator does not collect identifying information, such as user names, passwords, or certificates. However, to provide specific remediation steps, the Insights Operator does not anonymize certain information internal to the cluster, such as IP addresses and host names of nodes.

Red Hat uses all connected cluster information to:

* Proactively identify potential cluster issues and provide a solution and preventive actions in {cloud-redhat-com}
* Improve {product-title}
* Make {product-title} more intuitive

The information the Insights Operator sends is available only to Red Hat Support and engineering teams with the same restrictions as accessing data reported in support cases. Red Hat does not share this information with third parties.
