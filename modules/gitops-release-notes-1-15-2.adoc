== Fixed issues

* Before this update, you might have experienced crashes in the Argo CD components, such as, `server`, `repo-server`, and `application-controller`, when accessing the Redis instance due to network or DNS instabilities within the cluster. These crashes occured from a race condition in the `go-redis` client library when multiple connections in a connection pool call the `dial hook` function. With this update, integrating an updated `go-redis` client library that eliminates race conditions during `dial hook` function calls resolves the issue, and improves the handling and recovery from network and DNS errors, ensuring greater stability for Argo CD components. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6287[GITOPS-6287]

* Before this update, upgrading the {gitops-title} Operator to v1.15.1 raised a health check error that prevented {rh-rhacm-first} policies from syncing. With this update, adding a missing nil check to `.status.placement` for *Policy* resolves the issue. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6664[GITOPS-6664]

* Before this update, when `.spec.source.targetRevision` was set to an annotated Git tag, Argo CD treated resource drift as needing reconciliation and reverted the manual changes on the cluster, despite self-healing being disabled. This behavior was inconsistent with that of lightweight tags. With this update, when `selfHeal` is set to `false`, manual changes to live resources are no longer reverted, even if you are using an annotated Git tag as the source, and Argo CD now handles annotated and lightweight tags consistently.  link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6150[GITOPS-6150]

* Before this update, Argo CD monitoring worked automatically when deployed in any namespace and user-workload monitoring support for workloads did not require any manual configuration.  With this update, if you deploy Argo CD in a non-{OCP} namespace, you must enable user-workload monitoring in {OCP}.
