= Uninstalling the web terminal

Uninstalling the web terminal is a two-step process:

. Uninstall the {web-terminal-op} and related custom resources (CRs) that were added when you installed the Operator.
. Uninstall the DevWorkspace Operator and its related custom resources that were added as a dependency of the {web-terminal-op}.

Uninstalling the {web-terminal-op} does not remove any of its custom resource definitions (CRDs) or managed resources that are created when the Operator is installed. These components must be manually uninstalled for security purposes. Removing these components also allows you to save cluster resources by ensuring that terminals do not idle when the Operator is uninstalled.

.Prerequisites
* Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

== Removing the Web Terminal Operator and the custom resources that support it

Use the console and the CLI to delete any existing web terminals and CRs that were created during the installation of the {web-terminal-op}.

.Procedure

. Uninstall the {web-terminal-op} using the web console:
.. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators -> Installed Operators*.
.. Scroll the filter list or type a keyword into the *Filter by name* box to find the {web-terminal-op}.
.. Click the Options menu {kebab} for the {web-terminal-op}, and then select *Uninstall Operator*.
.. In the *Uninstall Operator* confirmation dialog box, click *Uninstall* to remove the Operator, Operator deployments, and pods from the cluster. The Operator stops running and no longer receives updates.
+
. Remove the CRs used by the Operator.

== Deleting the DevWorkspace Operator dependency

Use the CLI to delete the custom resource definitions (CRDs) and additional resources that are created during installation of the {web-terminal-op}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The DevWorkspace Operator functions as a standalone Operator and may be required as a dependency for other Operators installed on the cluster (for example, the {openshift-dev-spaces-productname} Operator may depend on it). Follow the steps below only if you are sure the DevWorkspace Operator is no longer needed.
====

.Procedure
. Remove the `DevWorkspace` custom resources used by the Operator, along with any related Kubernetes objects, such as deployments.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete devworkspaces.workspace.devfile.io --all-namespaces --all --wait
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete devworkspaceroutings.controller.devfile.io --all-namespaces --all --wait
----
+
[WARNING]
====
If this step is not complete, finalizers make it difficult to fully uninstall the Operator easily.
====
+
. Remove the CRDs used by the Operator:
+
[WARNING]
====
The DevWorkspace Operator provides custom resource definitions (CRDs) that use conversion webhooks. Failing to remove these CRDs can cause issues on the cluster.

----

[source,terminal]

$ oc delete customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io devworkspaceoperatorconfigs.controller.devfile.io
----
+
. Verify that all involved custom resource definitions are removed. The following command should not display any result.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io | grep "devfile.io"
----
+
. Remove the `devworkspace-webhook-server` deployment, mutating, and validating webhooks:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete deployment/devworkspace-webhook-server -n openshift-operators
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations controller.devfile.io
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete validatingwebhookconfigurations controller.devfile.io
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you remove the `devworkspace-webhook-server` deployment without removing the mutating and validating webhooks, you will not be able to use `oc exec` commands to run commands in a container on the cluster. After you remove the webhooks you will be able to use the `oc exec` commands again.
====
+
. Remove any remaining services, secrets, and config maps. Depending on the installation, some resources included in the following command may not exist on the cluster.
+
[source,terminal]

$ oc delete all --selector app.kubernetes.io/part-of=devworkspace-operator,app.kubernetes.io/name=devworkspace-webhook-server -n openshift-operators

. Uninstall the Operator using the web console:
.. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators -> Installed Operators*.
.. Scroll the filter list or type a keyword into the *Filter by name* box to find the *DevWorkspace* Operator.
.. Click the Options menu {kebab} for the DevWorkspace Operator, and then select *Uninstall Operator*.
.. In the *Uninstall Operator* confirmation dialog box, click *Uninstall* to remove the Operator, Operator deployments, and pods from the cluster. The Operator stops running and no longer receives updates.
