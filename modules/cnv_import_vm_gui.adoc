=== Importing a virtual machine into a template from the web console

WARNING: This procedure has been deprecated from 1.3 onwards.

The `Import Virtual Machine` Ansible playbook has the option to import a 
virtual machine as a `template` object, which you can use to create virtual 
machines.

Templates are useful when you want to create multiple virtual machines from the 
same base image with minor changes to resource parameters.

. Click `Create` to begin importing the virtual machine.

A temporary pod, with the generated names of `importer-template-<name>-dv-01-<random>`, is built to handle the process of importing 
the data and creating the template. Upon completion, this temporary pod is 
discarded and the `<name>-template` (`fedora-template` in the previous step) 
will be visible in the catalog and can be used to create virtual machines.


NOTE: You may need to refresh your browser to see the template upon 
completion. This is due to a limitation of the Template Service Broker.
