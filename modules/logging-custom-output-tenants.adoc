= Custom tenants for outputs

Many logging outputs have the concept of customizable _tenants_. For example, Apache Kafka uses topics, and Elasticsearch uses indices.

In {logging} 5.9 and newer versions, administrators can control how data is organized by modifying the default tenants for some logging outputs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot configure custom tenants for the `default` log store (an internal Elasticsearch or LokiStack instance), a custom LokiStack instance, external Elasticsearch instances without JSON parsing, or Fluent Forward.
