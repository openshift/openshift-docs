[id="ztp-manually-install-a-single-managed-cluster_{context}"]
= Installing a single managed cluster

You can manually deploy a single managed cluster using the assisted service and {rh-rhacm-first}.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created the baseboard management controller (BMC) `Secret` and the image pull-secret `Secret` custom resources (CRs). See "Creating the managed bare-metal host secrets" for details.

* Your target bare-metal host meets the networking and hardware requirements for managed clusters.

.Procedure

. Create a `ClusterImageSet` for each specific cluster version to be deployed, for example `clusterImageSet-{product-version}.yaml`. A `ClusterImageSet` has the following format:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hive.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterImageSet
metadata:
  name: openshift-4.10.0-rc.0 <1>
spec:
   releaseImage: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.10.0-x86_64 <2>
----
<1> The descriptive version that you want to deploy.
<2> Specifies the `releaseImage` to deploy and determines the operating system image version. The discovery ISO is based on the image version as set by `releaseImage`, or the latest version if the exact version is unavailable.

. Apply the `clusterImageSet` CR:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc apply -f clusterImageSet-{product-version}.yaml
----

. Create the `Namespace` CR in the `cluster-namespace.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
     name: <cluster_name> <1>
     labels:
        name: <cluster_name> <1>
----
<1>  The name of the managed cluster to provision.

. Apply the `Namespace` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cluster-namespace.yaml
----

. Apply the generated day-0 CRs that you extracted from the `ztp-site-generate` container and customized to meet your requirements:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -R ./site-install/site-sno-1
----
