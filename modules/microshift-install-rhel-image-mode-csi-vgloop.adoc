[id="microshift-rhel-image-mode-csi_{context}"]
= Configuring container storage for the bootc image and the {microshift-short} CSI

Use this procedure when a volume group with the necessary storage is not available on the host. Create and allocate an additional LVM volume group loop device to be shared with the container and used by the {microshift-short} Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Container Storage Interface (CSI).

[NOTE]
====
If you found a volume group with adequate space when you checked the host configuration for the {microshift-short} CSI, you do not need to complete this step. Proceed to running your bootc image.
====

.Prerequisites

* A {op-system-base-full} {op-system-version} host with an active Red Hat subscription for building {microshift-short} bootc images and running containers.
* You are logged into the {op-system-base} {op-system-version} host using the user credentials that have `sudo` permissions.

.Procedure

. Create a file to be used for LVM partitioning by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
VGFILE=/var/lib/microshift-lvm-storage.img

sudo losetup -f "${VGFILE}"
----

. Resize the file to your specified size by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
VGSIZE=1G # <1>

$ sudo truncate --size="${VGSIZE}" "${VGFILE}"
----
<1> Specify the size for the file.

. Query the loop device name by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ VGLOOP=$(losetup -j ${VGFILE} | cut -d: -f1)
----

. Create a free volume group on the loop device by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo vgcreate -f -y <my-volume-group> "${VGLOOP}" # <1>
----
<1> Replace _<my-volume-group>_ with the name of the volume group you are creating.
