= Understanding Intel hardware accelerator cards for {product-title}

Hardware accelerator cards from Intel accelerate 4G/LTE and 5G Virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRAN) workloads. This in turn increases the overall compute capacity of a commercial, off-the-shelf platform.

== Intel FPGA PAC N3000

The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 is a reference FPGA and uses 4G/LTE or 5G forward error correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G/LTE RAN layer 1 (L1) base station network function. Flash the Intel FPGA PAC N3000 card with 4G/LTE or 5G bitstreams to support vRAN workloads.

The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration.

When the Intel FPGA PAC N3000 is programmed with a 4G/LTE or 5G bitstream, it exposes the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) virtual function (VF) devices used to accelerate the FEC in the vRAN workload.
To take advantage of this functionality for a cloud-native deployment, the physical function (PF) of the device must be bound to the `pf-pci-stub` driver to create several VFs. After the VFs are created, the VFs must be bound to a DPDK userspace driver (vfio) to allocate them to specific pods running the vRAN workload.

Intel FPGA PAC N3000 support on {product-title} depends on two Operators:

* OpenNESS Operator for Intel FPGA PAC N3000 (Programming)
* OpenNESS Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators

== vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100

The vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100, based on Intel’s eASIC technology is designed to offload and accelerate the computing-intensive process of forward error correction for 4G/LTE and 5G technology, freeing up processing power.
Intel eASIC devices are structured ASICs, an intermediate technology between FPGAs and standard application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).

Intel vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100 support on {product-title} uses one Operator:

* OpenNESS Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators
