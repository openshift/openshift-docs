= Creating an Ingress Controller for manual DNS management

As a cluster administrator, you can create a new custom Ingress Controller with the Unmanaged DNS management policy.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You are logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create an `IngressController` custom resource (CR) file named `sample-ingress.yaml` with the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
  name: <name>
spec:
  domain: <domain>
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    type: LoadBalancerService
    loadBalancer:
      scope: External
      dnsManagementPolicy: Unmanaged
----
where:

name (metadata):: Specify the `<name>` with a name for the `IngressController` object.
domain:: Specify the `domain` based on the DNS record that was created as a prerequisite.
scope:: Specify the `scope` as `External` to expose the load balancer externally.
dnsManagementPolicy:: `dnsManagementPolicy` indicates if the Ingress Controller is managing the lifecycle of the wildcard DNS record associated with the load balancer. The valid values are `Managed` and `Unmanaged`. The default value is `Managed`.

. Apply the manifest to create the `IngressController` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f sample-ingress.yaml
----

. Verify that the Ingress Controller was created with the correct policy by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ingresscontroller <name> -n openshift-ingress-operator -o=jsonpath={.spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.loadBalancer}
----
+
Inspect the output and confirm that `dnsManagementPolicy` is set to `Unmanaged`.
