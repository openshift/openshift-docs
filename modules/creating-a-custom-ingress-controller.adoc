= Creating a custom Ingress Controller with the `Unmanaged` DNS management policy

[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, you can create a new custom Ingress Controller with the Unmanaged DNS management policy.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a custom resource (CR) file named `sample-ingress.yaml` containing the following:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
  name: <name>
spec:
  domain: <domain>
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    type: LoadBalancerService
    loadBalancer:
      scope: External
      dnsManagementPolicy: Unmanaged
----
+
where:
+
`metadata.name`:: Specify the `<name>` with a name for the `IngressController` object.
`spec.domain`:: Specify the `domain` based on the DNS record that was created as a prerequisite.
`loadBalancer.scope`:: Specify the `scope` as `External` to expose the load balancer externally.
`loadBalancer.dnsManagementPolicy`: Specifies if the Ingress Controller is managing the lifecycle of the wildcard DNS record associated with the load balancer. The valid values are `Managed` and `Unmanaged`. The default value is `Managed`.


. Save the file to apply the changes.
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc apply -f <name>.yaml <1>
----
+
Inspect the output and confirm that `dnsManagementPolicy` is set to `Unmanaged`.
