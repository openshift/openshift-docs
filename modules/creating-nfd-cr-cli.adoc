= Creating a NodeFeatureDiscovery CR by using the CLI

As a cluster administrator, you can create a `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR instance by using the {oc-first}.

[NOTE]
====
The `spec.operand.image` setting requires a `-rhel9` image to be defined for use with {product-title} releases 4.13 and later.
====

The following example shows the use of `-rhel9` to acquire the correct image.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster
* You installed the {oc-first}.
* You logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You installed the NFD Operator.

.Procedure
