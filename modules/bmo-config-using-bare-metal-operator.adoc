= Configuration using the Bare Metal Operator

When deploying {product-title} on bare-metal hosts, there are times when you need to make changes to the host either before or after provisioning. This can include inspecting the host's hardware, firmware, and firmware details. It can also include formatting disks or changing modifiable firmware settings.

You can use the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) to provision, manage, and inspect bare-metal hosts in your cluster. The BMO can complete the following operations:

* Provision bare-metal hosts to the cluster with a specific image.
* Turn on or off a host.
* Inspect hardware details of the host and report them to the bare-metal host.
* Upgrade or downgrade a host's firmware to a specific version.
* Inspect firmware and configure BIOS settings.
* Clean disk contents for the host before or after provisioning the host.

The BMO uses the following resources to complete these tasks:

* `BareMetalHost`
* `HostFirmwareSettings`
* `FirmwareSchema`
* `HostFirmwareComponents`

The BMO maintains an inventory of the physical hosts in the cluster by mapping each bare-metal host to an instance of the `BareMetalHost` custom resource definition. Each `BareMetalHost` resource features hardware, software, and firmware details. The BMO continually inspects the bare-metal hosts in the cluster to ensure each `BareMetalHost` resource accurately details the components of the corresponding host.

The BMO also uses the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource, the `FirmwareSchema` resource, and the `HostFirmwareComponents` resource to detail firmware specifications and upgrade or downgrade firmware for the bare-metal host.

The BMO interfaces with bare-metal hosts in the cluster by using the Ironic API service. The Ironic service uses the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) on the host to interface with the machine.
