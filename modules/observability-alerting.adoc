[source,terminal]

      - alert: etcdHighFsyncDurations
        annotations:
          description: 'etcd cluster "{{ $labels.job }}": 99th percentile fsync durations

== Alert notifications

You can view alerts in the {product-title} console. However, an administrator must configure an external receiver to forward the alerts to. 
{product-title} supports the following receiver types:

PagerDuty:: A third-party incident response platform.
Webhook:: An arbitrary API endpoint that receives an alert through a `POST` request and can take any necessary action.
Email:: Sends an email to a designated address.
Slack:: Sends a notification to either a Slack channel or an individual user.
