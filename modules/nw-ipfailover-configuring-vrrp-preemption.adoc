= Configuring VRRP preemption

When a Virtual IP (VIP) on a node leaves the `fault` state by passing the check script, the VIP on the node enters the `backup` state if it has lower priority than the VIP on the node that is currently in the `master` state. However, if the VIP on the node that is leaving `fault` state has a higher priority, the preemption strategy determines its role in the cluster.

The `nopreempt` strategy does not move `master` from the lower priority VIP on the host to the higher priority VIP on the host. With `preempt_delay 300`, the default, Keepalived waits the specified 300 seconds and moves `master` to the higher priority VIP on the host.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* To specify preemption enter `oc edit deploy ipfailover-keepalived` to edit the router deployment configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit deploy ipfailover-keepalived
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: OPENSHIFT_HA_PREEMPTION  <1>
          value: preempt_delay 300
...
----
<1> Set the `OPENSHIFT_HA_PREEMPTION` value:
- `preempt_delay 300`: Keepalived waits the specified 300 seconds and moves `master` to the higher priority VIP on the host. This is the default value.
- `nopreempt`: does not move `master` from the lower priority VIP on the host to the higher priority VIP on the host.
