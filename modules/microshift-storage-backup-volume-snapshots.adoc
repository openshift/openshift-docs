= Backing up a volume snapshot

Snapshots of data from applications running on a {microshift-short} node are created as read-only logical volumes (LVs) located on the same devices as the original data. You must manually mount local volumes before they can be copied as persistent volumes (PVs) and used as backup copies. To use a snapshot of a {microshift-short} storage volume as a backup, find it on the local host and then move it to a secure location.

To find specific snapshots and copy them, use the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* You have root access to the host machine.
* You have an existing volume snapshot.

.Procedure

. Get the name of the volume snapshot by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get volumesnapshot -n <namespace> <snapshot_name> -o 'jsonpath={.status.volumeSnapshotContentName}' # <1>
----
<1> Replace _<namespace>_ and _<snapshot_name>_ with the namespace and snapshot name you used.

. Get the unique identity of the volume created on the storage backend by using the following command and inserting the name retrieved in the previous step:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get volumesnapshotcontent snapcontent-<retrieved_volume_identity> -o 'jsonpath={.status.snapshotHandle}' # <1>
----
<1> Replace _<retrieved_volume_identity>_ with the volume identity.

. Display the snapshots by using the unique identity of the volume you retrieved in the previous step to determine which one you want to backup by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo lvdisplay <retrieved_volume_identity> # <1>
----
<1> Replace _<retrieved_volume_identity>_ with the volume identity.

----

. Create a directory to use for mounting the LV by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/snapshot
----

. Mount the LV using the device name for the retrieved snapshot handle by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mount /dev/<retrieved_snapshot_handle> /mnt/snapshot # <1>
----
<1> Replace _<retrieved_snapshot_handle>_ with the device name.

. Copy the files from the mounted location and store them in a secure location by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo cp -r /mnt/snapshot <destination> # <1>
----
<1> Replace _<destination>_ with the path to the secure location.
