= About the {cli-manager}

The {cli-manager} makes it easier to install and update CLI plugins. It runs in both connected and disconnected environments, and it is particularly useful in disconnected environments. Cluster administrators can add CLI plugins and plugin updates to the {cli-manager}, and users can then install and update CLI plugins when needed regardless of whether or not the environment is disconnected.
