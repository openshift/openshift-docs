= Understanding ConfigMaps

Many applications require configuration using some combination of configuration files, command line arguments, and environment variables. In {product-title}, these configuration artifacts are decoupled from image content in order to keep containerized applications portable.

The `ConfigMap` object provides mechanisms to inject containers with configuration data while keeping containers agnostic of {product-title}. A ConfigMap can be used to store fine-grained information like individual properties or coarse-grained information like entire configuration files or JSON blobs.

The ConfigMap API object holds key-value pairs of configuration data that can be consumed in pods or used to store configuration data for system components such as controllers. For example:

.ConfigMap Object Definition
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2016-02-18T19:14:38Z
  name: example-config
  namespace: default
data: <1>
  example.property.1: hello
  example.property.2: world
  example.property.file: |-
    property.1=value-1
    property.2=value-2
    property.3=value-3
binaryData:
  bar: L3Jvb3QvMTAw <2>
----
<1> Contains the configuration data.
<2> Points to a file that contains non-UTF8 data, for example, a binary Java keystore file. Enter the file data in Base 64.

[NOTE]
====
You can use the `binaryData` field when you create a ConfigMap from a binary file, such as an image.
====

Configuration data can be consumed in pods in a variety of ways. A ConfigMap can be used to:

* Populate environment variable values in containers
* Set command-line arguments in a container
* Populate configuration files in a volume

Users and system components can store configuration data in a ConfigMap.

A ConfigMap is similar to a secret, but designed to more conveniently support working with strings that do not contain sensitive information.

== ConfigMap restrictions

*A ConfigMap must be created before its contents can be consumed in pods.*

Controllers can be written to tolerate missing configuration data. Consult individual components configured by using ConfigMaps on a case-by-case basis.

*`ConfigMap` objects reside in a project.*

They can only be referenced by pods in the same project.

*The Kubelet only supports the use of a ConfigMap for pods it gets from the API server.*

This includes any pods created by using the CLI, or indirectly from a replication controller. It does not include pods created by using the {product-title} node's `--manifest-url` flag, its `--config` flag, or its REST API because these are not common ways to create pods.
