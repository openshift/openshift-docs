= Understanding horizontal pod autoscaler status conditions by using the CLI

You can use the status conditions set to determine
whether or not the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) is able to scale and whether or not it is currently restricted
in any way.

The HPA status conditions are available with the `v2beta1` version of the
autoscaling API.

The HPA responds with the following status conditions:

* The `AbleToScale` condition indicates whether HPA is able to fetch and update metrics, as well as whether any backoff-related conditions could prevent scaling.
** A `True` condition indicates scaling is allowed.
** A `False` condition indicates scaling is not allowed for the reason specified.

* The `ScalingActive` condition indicates whether the HPA is enabled (for example, the replica count of the target is not zero) and is able to calculate desired metrics.
** A `True` condition indicates metrics is working properly.
** A `False` condition generally indicates a problem with fetching metrics.

* The `ScalingLimited` condition indicates that the desired scale was capped by the maximum or minimum of the horizontal pod autoscaler.
** A `True` condition indicates that you need to raise or lower the minimum or maximum replica count in order to scale.
** A `False` condition indicates that the requested scaling is allowed.
