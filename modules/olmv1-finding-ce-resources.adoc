= Finding API groups and resources exposed by a cluster extension

To create appropriate RBAC policies for granting user access to cluster extension resources, you must know which API groups and resources are exposed by the installed extension. As an administrator, you can inspect custom resource definitions (CRDs) installed on the cluster by using {oc-first}.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster extension has been installed on your cluster.

.Procedure

* To list installed CRDs while specifying a label selector targeting a specific cluster extension by name to find only CRDs owned by that extension, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get crds -l 'olm.operatorframework.io/owner-kind=ClusterExtension,olm.operatorframework.io/owner-name=<cluster_extension_name>'
----

* Alternatively, you can search through all installed CRDs and individually inspect them by CRD name:

.. List all available custom resource definitions (CRDs) currently installed on the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get crds
----
+
Find the CRD you are looking for in the output.

.. Inspect the individual CRD further to find its API groups by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get crd <crd_name> -o yaml
----
