= C3 and N4 instance type limitations
The GCP PD CSI driver support for the C3 instance type for bare metal and N4 machine series have the following limitations:

* Cloning volumes is not supported when using storage pools.

* For cloning or resizing, hyperdisk-balanced disks original volume size must be 6Gi or greater.

* The default storage class is standard-csi. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You need to manually create a storage class.

For information about creating the storage class, see Step 2 in Section _Setting up hyperdisk-balanced disks_.
====

* Clusters with mixed virtual machines (VMs) that use different storage types, for example, N2 and N4, are not supported. This is due to hyperdisks-balanced disks not being usable on most legacy VMs. Similarly, regular persistent disks are not usable on N4/C3 VMs.

* A GCP cluster with c3-standard-2, c3-standard-4, n4-standard-2, and n4-standard-4 nodes can erroneously exceed the maximum attachable disk number, which should be 16 (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39258[JIRA link]).
