= Creating a passthrough route

You can configure a secure route using passthrough termination by using the `oc create route` command. With passthrough termination, encrypted traffic is sent straight to the destination without the router providing TLS termination. Therefore no key or certificate is required on the route.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a service that you want to expose.

.Procedure

* Create a `Route` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create route passthrough route-passthrough-secured --service=frontend --port=8080
----
+
If you examine the resulting `Route` resource, it should look similar to the following:
+
.A Secured Route Using Passthrough Termination
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: route-passthrough-secured <1>
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  port:
    targetPort: 8080
  tls:
    termination: passthrough <2>
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: None <3>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: frontend
----
<1> The name of the object, which is limited to 63 characters.
<2> The `*termination*` field is set to `passthrough`. This is the only required `tls` field.
<3> Optional `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy`. The only valid values are `None`, `Redirect`, or empty for disabled.
+
The destination pod is responsible for serving certificates for the
traffic at the endpoint. This is currently the only method that can support requiring client certificates, also known as two-way authentication.
