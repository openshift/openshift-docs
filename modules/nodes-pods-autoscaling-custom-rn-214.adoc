== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.14.1-467 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.14.1-467 provides a CVE and a bug fix for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The following advisory is available for the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:7348[RHSA-2024:7348].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler (KEDA).
====

Bug fixes::

* Previously, the root file system of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator pod was writable, which is unnecessary and could present security issues. This update makes the pod root file system read-only, which addresses the potential security issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37989[OCPBUGS-37989])

== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.14.1-454 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.14.1-454 provides a CVE, a new feature, and bug fixes for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The following advisory is available for the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2024:5865[RHBA-2024:5865].

New features and enhancements::

Note the new features and enhancements in this release:

* Support for the Cron trigger with the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator
+
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator can now use the Cron trigger to scale pods based on an hourly schedule. When your specified time frame starts, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator scales pods to your desired amount. When the time frame ends, the Operator scales back down to the previous level.
+
For more information, see "Understanding the Cron trigger".

Bug fixes::

* Previously, if you made changes to audit configuration parameters in the `KedaController` custom resource, the `keda-metrics-server-audit-policy` config map would not get updated. As a consequence, you could not change the audit configuration parameters after the initial deployment of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler. With this fix, changes to the audit configuration now render properly in the config map, allowing you to change the audit configuration any time after installation.
