= Specifying limits and requests for monitoring components 

To configure CPU and memory resources, specify values for resource limits and requests in the appropriate `ConfigMap` object for the namespace in which the monitoring component is located:

* The `cluster-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace for core platform monitoring
* The `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace for components that monitor user-defined projects

.Prerequisites

* *If you are configuring core platform monitoring components*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
** You have created a `ConfigMap` object named `cluster-monitoring-config`.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. To configure core platform monitoring components, edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map object in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Add values to define resource limits and requests for each core platform monitoring component you want to configure.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that the value set for a limit is always higher than the value set for a request.
Otherwise, an error will occur, and the container will not run.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you save changes to the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map, the pods and other resources in the `openshift-monitoring` project might be redeployed.
The running monitoring processes in that project might also restart.
