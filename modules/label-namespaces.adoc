= Labeling namespaces to allow {product-title} to manage jobs

The {product-title} Operator uses an opt-in webhook mechanism to ensure that policies are only enforced for the jobs and namespaces that it is expected to target.

You must label the namespaces where you want {product-title} to manage jobs with the `kueue.openshift.io/managed=true` label.

.Procedure

* Add the `kueue.openshift.io/managed=true` label to a namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label namespace <namespace> kueue.openshift.io/managed=true
----

When you add this label, you instruct the {product-title} Operator that the namespace is managed by its webhook admission controllers. As a result, any {product-title} resources within that namespace are properly validated and mutated.
