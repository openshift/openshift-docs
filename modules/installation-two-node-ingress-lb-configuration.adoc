= Configuring an Ingress load balancer for a two-node cluster with fencing

[role="_abstract"]
Configure an external Ingress load balancer to forward application traffic to Ingress Controller pods on control plane nodes. You must configure this load balancer before installing a two-node OpenShift cluster with fencing to allow both nodes to actively receive traffic.

[NOTE]
====
An external load balancer is recommended for production deployments but is not required.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have two control plane nodes with fencing enabled.
* You have network connectivity from the load balancer to both control plane nodes.
* You created DNS records for `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` and `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`.

.Procedure

. Configure the load balancer to forward traffic for the following ports:
+
* `6443`: Kubernetes API server
* `80` and `443`: Application ingress
+
You must forward traffic to both control plane nodes.

. Configure health checks on the load balancer. You must monitor the backend endpoints so that the load balancer only sends traffic to nodes that respond.

. Configure the load balancer to forward traffic to both control plane nodes. The following example shows how to configure two control plane nodes:

[source,terminal]
----
frontend api_frontend
    bind *:6443
    mode tcp
    default_backend api_backend

backend api_backend
    mode tcp
    balance roundrobin
    server cp0 <cp0_ip>:6443 check
    server cp1 <cp1_ip>:6443 check

frontend ingress_frontend
    bind *:80
    bind *:443
    mode tcp
    default_backend ingress_backend

backend ingress_backend
    mode tcp
    balance roundrobin
    server cp0 <cp0_ip>:80 check
    server cp1 <cp1_ip>:80 check
    server cp0 <cp0_ip>:443 check
    server cp1 <cp1_ip>:443 check
----

. Verify the load balancer configuration:

.. From an external client, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -k https://api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>:6443/version
----

.. From an external client, access an application route by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl https://<app>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
----

You can shut down a control plane node and verify that the load balancer stops sending traffic to that node while the other node continues to serve requests.
