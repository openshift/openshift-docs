= Resource groups and flavors

You can configure resource groups within cluster queues to define a list of resources and a list of flavors that provide quotas for these resources.
Each resource type and flavor can only belong to one resource group.

<1> You can define up to 16 resource groups for your cluster.
<2> Defines the resource types governed the first resource group. This resource group governs CPU and memory resources.
<3> Defines the resource flavor that is applied to the resource types listed in the first resource group. In this example, the `resource-flavor-a` resource flavor is applied to CPU and memory.
<4> Defines the resource types governed the second resource group. This resource group governs pods and GPU resources.
<5> Defines the resource flavor that is applied to the resource types listed in the second resource group. In this example, the `resource-flavor-b` resource flavor is applied to pods and GPU.
