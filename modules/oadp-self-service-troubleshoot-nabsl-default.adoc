= NonAdminBackupStorageLocation cannot be set as default

As a non-admin user, if you have created a `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` (NABSL) custom resource (CR) in your authorized namespace, you cannot set the NABSL CR as the default backup storage location.

In such a scenario, the NABSL CR fails to validate and the `NonAdminController` (NAC) gives an error message.

.Solution

To successfully validate and reconcile the NABSL CR, ensure that the `default` field is set to `false` in the NABSL CR.
