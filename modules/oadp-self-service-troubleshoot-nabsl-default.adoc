= Resolving error NonAdminBackupStorageLocation cannot be set as default

[role="_abstract"]
Resolve the error that occurs when you set a `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` (NABSL) custom resource (CR) as the default backup storage location. This helps you resolve validation errors and configure backup storage locations correctly.

As a non-admin user, if you have created a NABSL CR in your authorized namespace, you cannot set the NABSL CR as the default backup storage location.

If you set the NABSL CR as the default backup storage location, the NABSL CR fails to validate and the `NonAdminController` (NAC) gives an error message.
