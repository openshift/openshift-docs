[id="hcp-ts-bm-nodes-not-added_{context}"]
= Nodes fail to be added to {hcp} on bare metal

When you scale up a {hcp} cluster with nodes that were provisioned by using Assisted Installer, the host fails to pull the ignition with a URL that contains port 22642. That URL is invalid for {hcp} and indicates that an issue exists with the cluster.

.Procedure

. To determine the issue, review the assisted-service logs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n multicluster-engine <assisted_service_pod_name> <1>
----
+
<1> Specify the Assisted Service pod name.

. In the logs, find errors that resemble these examples:
+
[source,terminal]
----
error="failed to get pull secret for update: invalid pull secret data in secret pull-secret"
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
pull secret must contain auth for \"registry.redhat.io\"
----

. To fix this issue, see "Add the pull secret to the namespace" in the {mce} documentation.

[NOTE]
====
To use {hcp}, you must have {mce-short} installed, either as a standalone operator or as part of {rh-rhacm-title}. Because the operator has a close association with {rh-rhacm-title}, the documentation for the operator is published within that product's documentation. Even if you do not use {rh-rhacm-title}, the parts of its documentation that cover {mce-short} are relevant to {hcp}.
