= Troubleshooting an incorrect NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy configuration

You can apply changes to the node network configuration across your entire cluster by applying a
NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy. If you apply an incorrect configuration, you can use the
following example to troubleshoot and correct the failed network Policy.

In this example, a Linux bridge Policy is applied to an example cluster that has 3 master nodes and 3 worker nodes.
The Policy fails to be applied because it references an incorrect interface. To find the error, investigate
the available nmstate resources. You can then update the Policy with the correct configuration.

.Procedure

. Create a Policy and apply it to your cluster. The following example creates a simple bridge on the `ens01` interface:
+

----

----
$ oc apply -f ens01-bridge-testfail.yaml
----
+
----
nodenetworkconfigurationpolicy.nmstate.io/ens01-bridge-testfail created
----

. Verify the status of the Policy by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc get nncp
----
+
The output shows that the Policy failed:
+
----
NAME                    STATUS
ens01-bridge-testfail   FailedToConfigure
----
+
However the Policy status alone does not indicate if it failed on all nodes or a subset of nodes.

. List the Enactments to see if the Policy was successful on any of the nodes. If the Policy failed for only a subset it suggests the problem is with specific node configuration; if the Policy failed on all nodes it suggest the problem is with the Policy.
+
----
$ oc get nnce
----
+
The output shows that the Policy failed on all nodes:
+
----
NAME                                   STATUS
utput
master-1.ens01-bridge-testfail         FailedToConfigure

worker-2.ens01-bridge-testfail         FailedToConfigure
worker-3.ens01-bridge-testfail         FailedToConfigure
----

. View one of the failed Enactments and look at the traceback. The following command uses the output tool `jsonpath` to filter the output:
+
----
$ oc get nnce worker-1.ens01-bridge-testfail -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Failing")].message}'
----
+
This command returns a large traceback that has been edited for brevity:

The `NmstateVerificationError` lists the `desired` Policy configuration, the `current` configuration of the Policy on the node, and the `difference` highlighting the parameters that do not match. In this example, the `port` is included in the `difference`, which suggests that the problem is the port configuration in the Policy.

. To ensure that the Policy is configured properly, view the network configuration for one or all of the nodes by requesting the `NodeNetworkState`. The following command returns the network configuration for the `master-1` node:
+
----
$ oc get nns master-1 -o yaml
----
+
The output shows that the interface name on the nodes is `ens1` but the failed Policy incorrectly uses `ens01`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
   - ipv4:
 ...
      name: ens1
      state: up
      type: ethernet
----

. Correct the error by editing the existing Policy:
+
----
$ oc edit nncp ens01-bridge-testfail
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
          port:
            - name: ens1
----
+
Save the Policy to apply the correction.

. Check the status of the Policy to ensure it updated successfully:
+
----
$ oc get nncp
----
+
----
NAME                    STATUS
ens01-bridge-testfail   SuccessfullyConfigured
----

The updated Policy is successfully configured on all nodes in the cluster.
