= Troubleshooting an incorrect node network configuration policy configuration

You can apply changes to the node network configuration across your entire cluster by applying a node network configuration policy.
If you apply an incorrect configuration, you can use the following example to troubleshoot and correct the failed node network policy.

In this example, a Linux bridge policy is applied to an example cluster that has three control plane nodes and three compute nodes.
The policy fails to be applied because it references an incorrect interface.
To find the error, investigate the available NMState resources. You can then update the policy with the correct configuration.

.Procedure

. Create a policy and apply it to your cluster. The following example creates a simple bridge on the `ens01` interface:

$ oc apply -f ens01-bridge-testfail.yaml
----

----

. Verify the status of the policy by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nncp
----
+
The output shows that the policy failed:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                    STATUS
ens01-bridge-testfail   FailedToConfigure
----
+
However, the policy status alone does not indicate if it failed on all nodes or a subset of nodes.

. List the node network configuration enactments to see if the policy was successful on any of the nodes. If the policy failed for only a subset of nodes, it suggests that the problem is with a specific node configuration. If the policy failed on all nodes, it suggests that the problem is with the policy.

$ oc get nnce

The output shows that the policy failed on all nodes:

. View one of the failed enactments and look at the traceback. The following command uses the output tool `jsonpath` to filter the output:

$ oc get nnce compute-1.ens01-bridge-testfail -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Failing")].message}'

This command returns a large traceback that has been edited for brevity:

The `NmstateVerificationError` lists the `desired` policy configuration, the `current` configuration of the policy on the node, and the `difference` highlighting the parameters that do not match. In this example, the `port` is included in the `difference`, which suggests that the problem is the port configuration in the policy.

. To ensure that the policy is configured properly, view the network configuration for one or all of the nodes by requesting the `NodeNetworkState` object. The following command returns the network configuration for the `control-plane-1` node:
+
----
$ oc get nns control-plane-1 -o yaml
----
+
The output shows that the interface name on the nodes is `ens1` but the failed policy incorrectly uses `ens01`:
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
   - ipv4:
# ...
      name: ens1
      state: up
      type: ethernet
----

. Correct the error by editing the existing policy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit nncp ens01-bridge-testfail
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
          port:
            - name: ens1
----
+
Save the policy to apply the correction.

. Check the status of the policy to ensure it updated successfully:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nncp
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                    STATUS
ens01-bridge-testfail   SuccessfullyConfigured
----

The updated policy is successfully configured on all nodes in the cluster.
