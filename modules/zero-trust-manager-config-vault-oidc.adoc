= How to configure the Vault OpenID Connect

The Vault OpenID Connect (OIDC) allows a SPIRE-identified workload to authenticate against a federated Vault server. The SPIRE Server issues JSON Web Token SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Documents (JWT-SVIDs) to workloads and the workloads then present the JWT-SVID to Vault to authenticate and retrieve the secrets it is authorized to access.

The steps to configure Vault OIDC are:

* Install Vault

* Initialize Vault
