= Configuring route timeouts

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure the default timeouts for an existing route when you have services in need of a low timeout, which is required for Service Level Availability (SLA) purposes, or a high timeout, for cases with a slow back end.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you configured a user-managed external load balancer in front of your {product-title} cluster, ensure that the timeout value for the user-managed external load balancer is higher than the timeout value for the route. This configuration prevents network congestion issues over the network that your cluster uses.
====

.Prerequisites

* You deployed an Ingress Controller on a running cluster.

.Procedure

* Using the `oc annotate` command, add the timeout to the route:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate route <route_name> \
    --overwrite haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout=<timeout><time_unit>
----
* `<timeout>`: Supported time units are microseconds (us), milliseconds (ms), seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h), or days (d).
+
The following example sets a timeout of two seconds on a route named `myroute`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate route myroute --overwrite haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout=2s
----
