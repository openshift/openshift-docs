= Using the Azure Marketplace offering
ifndef::mapi[]
Using the Azure Marketplace offering lets you deploy an {product-title} cluster, which is billed on pay-per-use basis (hourly, per core) through Azure, while still being supported directly by Red{nbsp}Hat.

To deploy an {product-title} cluster using the Azure Marketplace offering, you must first obtain the Azure Marketplace image. The installation program uses this image to deploy worker or control plane nodes. When obtaining your image, consider the following:

ifdef::mapi[]
You can create a machine set running on Azure that deploys machines that use the Azure Marketplace offering. To use this offering, you must first obtain the Azure Marketplace image. When obtaining your image, consider the following:
endif::mapi[]

* While the images are the same, the Azure Marketplace publisher is different depending on your region. If you are located in North America, specify `redhat` as the publisher. If you are located in EMEA, specify `redhat-limited` as the publisher.
* The offer includes a `rh-ocp-worker` SKU and a `rh-ocp-worker-gen1` SKU. The `rh-ocp-worker` SKU represents a Hyper-V generation version 2 VM image. The default instance types used in {product-title} are version 2 compatible. If you plan to use an instance type that is only version 1 compatible, use the image associated with the `rh-ocp-worker-gen1` SKU. The `rh-ocp-worker-gen1` SKU represents a Hyper-V version 1 VM image.
//What happens with control plane machines? "worker" SKU seems incorrect

[IMPORTANT]
====
Installing images with the Azure marketplace is not supported on clusters with 64-bit ARM instances.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the Azure CLI client `(az)`.
* Your Azure account is entitled for the offer and you have logged into this account with the Azure CLI client.

.Procedure

. Display all of the available {product-title} images by running one of the following commands:

. Record the image details of your offer. You must update the `compute` section in the `install-config.yaml` file with values for `publisher`, `offer`, `sku`, and `version` before deploying the cluster. You may also update the `controlPlane` section to deploy control plane machines with the specified image details, or the `defaultMachinePlatform` section to deploy both control plane and compute machines with the specified image details. Use the latest available image for control plane and compute nodes.

. Record the image details of your offer. If you use the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to deploy your compute nodes:
+
.. Update `storageProfile.imageReference` by deleting the `id` parameter and adding the `offer`, `publisher`, `sku`, and `version` parameters by using the values from your offer.
.. Specify a `plan` for the virtual machines (VMs).
