= Error NonAdminBackupStorageLocation not found in the namespace

Consider the following scenario of a namespace `admin` backup:

* You have created two `NonAdminBackupStorageLocations` (NABLs) custom resources (CRs) in two different namespaces, for example, `nabsl-1` in `namespace-1` and `nabsl-2` in `namespace-2`.
* You are taking a backup of `namespace-1` and use `nabsl-2` in the `NonAdminBackup` (NAB) CR.

In this scenario, after creating the NAB CR, you get the following error:

[source,text]
----
NonAdminBackupStorageLocation not found in the namespace: NonAdminBackupStorageLocation.oadp.openshift.io
---- 

The cause of the error is that the NABSL CR does not belong to the namespace that you are trying to back up.

.Solution

Use the NABSL that belongs to the same namespace that you are trying to back up. 

In this scenario, you must use `nabsl-1` in the NAB CR to back up `namespace-1`.
