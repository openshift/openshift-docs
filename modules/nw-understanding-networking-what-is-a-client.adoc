= Understanding external clients

An external client is any entity outside the cluster that interacts with the services and applications running within the cluster. External can include end users, external services, and external devices. End users are people who access a web application hosted in the cluster through their browsers or mobile devices. External services are other software systems or applications that interact with the services in the cluster, often through APIs. External devices are any hardware outside the cluster network that needs to communicate with the cluster services, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
