= Using raw tailored profiles
While the TailoredProfile CR enables the most common tailoring operations, the XCCDF standard allows even more flexibility in tailoring OpenSCAP profiles. In addition, if your organization has been using OpenScap previously, you may have an existing XCCDF tailoring file and can reuse it.

The ComplianceSuite object contains an optional TailoringConfigMap attribute that you can point to a custom tailoring file. The value of the TailoringConfigMap attribute is a name of a ConfigMap which must contain a key called `tailoring.xml` and the value of this key is the tailoring contents.

.Procedure
. Create the ConfigMap from a file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap <scan-name> --from-file=tailoring.xml=/path/to/the/tailoringFile.xml
----

. Reference the tailoring file in a Scan that belongs to a Suite:
+
[source,yaml]
----
