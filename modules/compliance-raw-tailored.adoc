= Using raw tailored profiles
While the `TailoredProfile` CR enables the most common tailoring operations, the XCCDF standard allows even more flexibility in tailoring OpenSCAP profiles. In addition, if your organization has been using OpenScap previously, you may have an existing XCCDF tailoring file and can reuse it.

The `ComplianceSuite` object contains an optional `TailoringConfigMap` attribute that you can point to a custom tailoring file. The value of the `TailoringConfigMap` attribute is a name of a config map which must contain a key called `tailoring.xml` and the value of this key is the tailoring contents.

.Procedure
. Create the `ConfigMap` object from a file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap <scan_name> --from-file=tailoring.xml=/path/to/the/tailoringFile.xml
----

. Reference the tailoring file in a scan that belongs to a suite:
+
[source,yaml]
----
