= Understanding how to create secrets

As an administrator you must create a secret before developers can create the pods that depend on that secret.

When creating secrets:

- Create a secret object with secret data.
- Update the pod's service account to allow the reference to the secret.
- Create a pod, which consumes the secret as an environment variable or as a file
(using a `secret` volume).

== Secret creation restrictions

To use a secret, a pod needs to reference the secret. A secret can be used with
a pod in three ways:

- To populate environment variables for containers.
- As files in a volume mounted on one or more of its containers.
- By kubelet when pulling images for the pod.

Volume type secrets write data into the container as a file using the volume
mechanism. Image pull secrets use service accounts for the automatic injection of
the secret into all pods in a namespaces.

When a template contains a secret definition, the only way for the template to
use the provided secret is to ensure that the secret volume sources are
validated and that the specified object reference actually points to a `Secret` object. Therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that
depend on it. The most effective way to ensure this is to have it get injected
automatically through the use of a service account.

Secret API objects reside in a namespace. They can only be referenced by pods in
that same namespace.

Individual secrets are limited to 1MB in size. This is to discourage the
creation of large secrets that could exhaust apiserver and kubelet memory.
However, creation of a number of smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.
