= SPIRE agent

The SPIRE Agent is responsible for workload attestation, ensuring that workloads receive a verified identity when requesting authentication through the SPIFFE Workload API. It accomplishes this by using configured workload attestor plugins. In Kubernetes environments, the Kubernetes workload attestor plugin is used.

SPIRE and the SPIRE agent perform node attestation via node plugins. The plugins are used to verify the identity of the node on which the agent is running. For more information, see link:https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about/spire-concepts/#all-about-the-agent[About the SPIRE Agent].
