= About deploying the {logging-title}

Administrators can deploy the {logging} by using the {product-title} web console or the {oc-first} to install the {logging} Operators. The Operators are responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining the {logging}.

Administrators and application developers can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access.

[id="cluster-logging-about-custom-resources_{context}"]
== Logging custom resources

You can configure your {logging} deployment with custom resource (CR) YAML files implemented by each Operator.

*Red Hat Openshift Logging Operator*:

* `ClusterLogging` (CL) - After the Operators are installed, you create a `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) to schedule {logging} pods and other resources necessary to support the {logging}. The `ClusterLogging` CR deploys the collector and forwarder, which currently are both implemented by a daemonset running on each node. The Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator watches the `ClusterLogging` CR and adjusts the logging deployment accordingly.

* `ClusterLogForwarder` (CLF) - Generates collector configuration to forward logs per user configuration.

*Loki Operator*:

* `LokiStack` - Controls the Loki cluster as log store and the web proxy with OpenShift Container Platform authentication integration to enforce multi-tenancy.

*OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator*:

[NOTE]
====
These CRs are generated and managed by the Red Hat OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. Manual changes cannot be made without being overwritten by the Operator.
====

* `ElasticSearch` - Configure and deploy an Elasticsearch instance as the default log store.

* `Kibana` - Configure and deploy Kibana instance to search, query and view logs.
