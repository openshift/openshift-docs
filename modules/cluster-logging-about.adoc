= About deploying cluster logging

{product-title} cluster administrators can deploy cluster logging using 
the {product-title}  web console or CLI to install the Elasticsearch
Operator and Cluster Logging Operator. When the operators are installed, you create
a `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) to schedule cluster logging pods and
other resources necessary to support cluster logging. The operators are
responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining cluster logging.

{product-title} administrators can deploy the Cluster Logging Operator and the
OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator by using the {product-title} web console and can configure logging in the
`openshift-logging` namespace. Configuring logging will deploy Elasticsearch,
Fluentd, and Kibana in the `openshift-logging` namespace. The operators are
responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining cluster logging.
endif::openshift-dedicated[]

The `ClusterLogging` CR defines a complete cluster logging environment that includes all the components
of the logging stack to collect, store and visualize logs.  The Cluster Logging Operator watches the Cluster Logging
CR and adjusts the logging deployment accordingly.

Administrators and application developers can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access.
