= {product-title-managed} architecture overview

{rh-rhacscs-first} is a Red{nbsp}Hat managed Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that lets you protect your Kubernetes and {ocp} clusters and applications throughout the build, deploy, and runtime lifecycles.

{product-title-managed-short} includes many built-in DevOps enforcement controls and security-focused best practices based on industry standards such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks and the National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST) guidelines.
You can also integrate it with your existing DevOps tools and workflows to improve security and compliance.

The following graphic shows the architecture with the StackRox Scanner and Scanner V4, which is Technology Preview for version 4.4. Installation of Scanner V4 is optional, but provides additional benefits.

Central services include the user interface (UI), data storage, {product-title-short} application programming interface (API), and image scanning capabilities.
You deploy your Central service through the link:https://console.redhat.com/[Red{nbsp}Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.] When you create a new ACS instance, Red{nbsp}Hat creates your individual control plane for {product-title-short}.

{product-title-managed-short} allows you to secure self-managed clusters that communicate with a Central instance.
The clusters you secure, called Secured Clusters, are managed by you, and not by Red{nbsp}Hat.
Secured Cluster services include optional vulnerability scanning services, admission control services, and data collection services used for runtime monitoring and compliance.
You install Secured Cluster services on any OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster you want to secure.
