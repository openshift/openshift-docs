= About the Special Resource Operator

The Special Resource Operator (SRO) helps you manage the deployment of kernel modules and drivers on an existing {product-title} cluster. The SRO can be used for a case as simple as building and loading a single kernel module, or as complex as deploying the driver, device plugin, and monitoring stack for a hardware accelerator.

For loading kernel modules, the SRO is designed around the use of driver containers. Driver containers are increasingly being used in cloud-native environments, especially when run on pure container operating systems, to deliver hardware drivers to the host. Driver containers extend the kernel stack beyond the out-of-the-box software and hardware features of a specific kernel. Driver containers work on various container-capable Linux distributions. With driver containers, the host operating system stays clean and there is no clash between different library versions or binaries on the host.
