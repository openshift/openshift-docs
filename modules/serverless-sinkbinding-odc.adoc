.Verification steps

You can verify that the Kubernetes events were sent to the Knative event sink by looking at the message dumper function logs.

You can view the message dumper function logs by entering:
----
$ oc get pods
$ oc logs $(oc get pod -o name | grep event-display) -c user-container
----

The logs should contain lines similar to the following:
