= Application developer workflow

[role="_abstract"]
As an application developer, you can use {prodname} to deploy applications and APIs on {ocp} clusters and gateways that are set up by platform engineers. You can also monitor workloads and the status of {ocp} resource metrics and tracing by using Grafana-based observability dashboards and alerts.

Protect applications::
You can route to applications from the gateway, configure protection for your services with root-level authentication, external authorization, and rate limiting.

Create application routes and definitions::
Set up application routes and API definitions and publish them to the cluster.

Observe application and API performance::
You can also monitor workloads and the status of {ocp} resource metrics and tracing by using Grafana-based observability dashboards and alerts. View API metrics, such as uptime, requests per second, latency, and errors per minute, to ensure that APIs meet performance and availability benchmarks achieved by other data centers.

The following diagram shows a high-level overview of the {prodname} application developer workflow:
