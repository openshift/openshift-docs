= ZTP support for deployment of multi-node clusters

The Telco 5G zero touch provisioning (ZTP) flow uses the Assisted Service, which is part of {rh-rhacm-first} on the hub cluster, to install clusters. This is done by generating all of the custom resources (CRs) required by Assisted Service including:

* `AgentClusterInstall`
* `ClusterDeployment`
* `NMStateConfig`
* `ManagedCluster and `KlusterletAddonConfig` (integration with {rh-rhacm})
* `InfraEnv`
* `BareMetalHost`
* `ConfigMap` for extra install manifests

Extending ZTP to support three-node clusters and standard clusters requires updates to these CRs,including multiple instantiations of some.

ZTP provides support for deploying single node clusters, three-node clusters, and standard OpenShift clusters. This includes the installation of OpenShift and deployment of the distributed units (DUs) at scale.

The overall flow is identical to the ZTP support for single node clusters, with some differentiation in configuration depending on the type of cluster:

`SiteConfig`:

* For single node clusters, the `SiteConfig` file must have exactly one entry in the `nodes` section.
* For three-node clusters, the `SiteConfig` file must have exactly three entries defined in the `nodes` section.
* For standard clusters, the `SiteConfig` file must have exactly three entries in the `nodes` section with `role: master` and two or more additional entries with `role: worker`.

`PolicyGenTemplate`:

* The example common `PolicyGenTemplate` is common across all types of clusters.
* There are example group `PolicyGenTemplate` files for each single node, three-node,
and standard clusters.
* Site-specific `PolicyGenTemplate` files are still specific to each site.
