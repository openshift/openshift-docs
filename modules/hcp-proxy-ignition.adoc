= Compute nodes that need to access an ignition endpoint

When compute nodes need a proxy to access the ignition endpoint, you must configure the proxy in the user-data stub that is configured on the compute node when it is created. For cases where machines need a proxy to access the ignition URL, the proxy configuration is included in the stub.

The stub resembles the following example:
