== Using CA certificates with the velero command aliased for Velero deployment

[role="_abstract"]
You might want to use the Velero CLI without installing it locally on your system by creating an alias for it.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed.

.Procedure

. To use an aliased Velero command, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ alias velero='oc -n openshift-adp exec deployment/velero -c velero -it -- ./velero'
----

. Check that the alias is working by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]

.Example
----
$ velero version
Client:
	Version: v1.12.1-OADP
	Git commit: -
Server:
	Version: v1.12.1-OADP
----

. To use a CA certificate with this command, you can add a certificate to the Velero deployment by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ CA_CERT=$(oc -n openshift-adp get dataprotectionapplications.oadp.openshift.io <dpa-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.backupLocations[0].velero.objectStorage.caCert}')

$ [[ -n $CA_CERT ]] && echo "$CA_CERT" | base64 -d | oc exec -n openshift-adp -i deploy/velero -c velero -- bash -c "cat > /tmp/your-cacert.txt" || echo "DPA BSL has no caCert"
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ velero describe backup <backup_name> --details --cacert /tmp/<your_cacert>.txt
----

. To fetch the backup logs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ velero backup logs  <backup_name>  --cacert /tmp/<your_cacert.txt>
----
+
You can use these logs to view failures and warnings for the resources that you cannot back up.

. If the Velero pod restarts, the `/tmp/your-cacert.txt` file disappears, and you must re-create the `/tmp/your-cacert.txt` file by re-running the commands from the previous step.

. You can check if the `/tmp/your-cacert.txt` file still exists, in the file location where you stored it, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -n openshift-adp -i deploy/velero -c velero -- bash -c "ls /tmp/your-cacert.txt"
/tmp/your-cacert.txt
----

In a future release of OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP), we plan to mount the certificate to the Velero pod so that this step is not required.
