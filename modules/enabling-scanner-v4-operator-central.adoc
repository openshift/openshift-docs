= Enabling RHACS Scanner V4 for Central when installing with the Operator

[role="_abstract"]
Scanner V4 is not enabled by default, but you can enable it during installation. Use this procedure to understand the steps you must follow when enabling Scanner V4. However, you might need to refer to the detailed installation documentation in "Additional resources", depending on the configuration of your other components.

.Procedure

. On the cluster where Central is installed, follow the installation procedures as described in "Installing Central using the Operator method". Choose one of these methods to enable Scanner V4:
* As described in that procedure, when configuring the available options for Central, go to the *Scanner V4 Component Settings* section and in the *Scanner V4 Component* menu, select *Enabled*.
* In the Central custom resource (CR) YAML, configure the following parameter:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  scannerV4:
    scannerComponent: Enabled
----
. Configure your init bundle or cluster registration secret (CRS) to allow communication between Central and the secured cluster. For more information, see "Generating and applying an init bundle or cluster registration secret for RHACS on Red Hat OpenShift".
