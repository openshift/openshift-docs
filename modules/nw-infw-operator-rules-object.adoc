= Ingress Node Firewall rules object

The fields for the Ingress Node Firewall rules object are described in the following table:

.Ingress Node Firewall rules object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6a",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|The name of the CR object.

|`interfaces`
|`array`
|The fields for this object specify the interfaces to apply the firewall rules to. For example, `- en0` and
`- en1`.

|`nodeSelector`
|`array`
|You can use `nodeSelector` to select the nodes to apply the firewall rules to. Set the value of your named `nodeselector` labels to `true` to apply the rule.

|`ingress`
|`object`
|`ingress` allows you to configure the rules that allow outside access to the services on your cluster.

=== Ingress object configuration

The values for the `ingress` object are defined in the following table:

.`ingress` object
[cols=".^3,.^2,.^5a",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`sourceCIDRs`
|`array`
|Allows you to set the CIDR block. You can configure multiple CIDRs from different address families.

[NOTE]
====
Different CIDRs allow you to use the same order rule. In the case that there are multiple `IngressNodeFirewall` objects for the same nodes and interfaces with overlapping CIDRs, the `order` field will specify which rule is applied first. Rules are applied in ascending order.
====

|`rules`
|`array`
|Ingress firewall `rules.order` objects are ordered starting at `1` for each `source.CIDR` with up to 100 rules per CIDR. Lower order rules are executed first.

`rules.protocolConfig.protocol` supports the following protocols: TCP, UDP, SCTP, ICMP and ICMPv6. ICMP and ICMPv6 rules can match against ICMP and ICMPv6 types or codes. TCP, UDP, and SCTP rules can match against a single destination port or a range of ports using `<start : end-1>` format.

Set `rules.action` to `allow` to apply the rule or `deny` to disallow the rule.

[NOTE]
====
Ingress firewall rules are verified using a verification webhook that blocks any invalid configuration. The verification webhook prevents you from blocking any critical cluster services such as the API server or SSH.

[id="nw-ingress-node-firewall-zero-trust-example-cr_{context}"]
== Zero trust Ingress Node Firewall rules object example

Zero trust Ingress Node Firewall rules can provide additional security to multi-interface clusters. For example, you can use zero trust Ingress Node Firewall rules to drop all traffic on a specific interface except for SSH.

A complete configuration of a zero trust Ingress Node Firewall rule set is specified in the following example:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Users need to add all ports their application will use to their allowlist in the following case to ensure proper functionality.
