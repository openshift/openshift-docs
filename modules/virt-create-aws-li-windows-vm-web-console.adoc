= Creating a license-compliant AWS EC2 Windows VM by using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can create license-compliant Windows virtual machines (VMs) by enabling the `dedicatedCpuPlacement` attribute. This attribute is enabled by default on instance types from the `d1` family. In the {product-title} web console, you can create a compliant VM by selecting from a list of available bootable volumes.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, go to *Virtualization* -> *Catalog*. The *InstanceTypes* tab opens by default.

. Click *Add volume* to create a Windows boot source. You can create a Windows boot source by uploading a new volume or by using an existing persistent volume claim (PVC), a volume snapshot, or a `containerDisk` volume.

. In the *Volume metadata* section, select a preference with a name that begins with `windows` and is followed by the Windows version of your choice. For example, `windows.11.virtio`. Click *Save*.

. Select a bootable volume from the list. If the list is truncated, click *Show all* to display the entire list. The bootable volume table contains the previously uploaded boot source.

. In the *User provided* tab, select an instance type with a name that begins with `d1`. For example, `d1.2xmedium` for a Windows 11 VM.

. Optional: You can mount a Windows driver disk by completing the following steps:
.. Click *Customize VirtualMachine*.
.. On the *VirtualMachine details* page, click *Storage*.
.. Select the *Mount Windows drivers* disk checkbox.

. Click *Create VirtualMachine*.
