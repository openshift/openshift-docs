= EgressIP object

[role="_abstract"]
View the following YAML files to better understand how you can effectively configure an `EgressIP` object to better meet your needs.

When the `EgressIP` namespace selector matches the label on multiple namespaces, consider the following behaviors:

* All traffic for selected pods must pass through a single node. During times of high traffic, the network interface of the node might experience performance issues.
* An error in a label selector might change the outbound IP address for many cluster namespaces.
* Only a cluster administrator can create or change cluster-scoped objects.
* Packets must move from a pod that exists in a node to the named host node that is referenced in the `EgressIP` object. This approach adds a network hop.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not create egress rules, such as a single label selector, that forces all namespaces that exist in a cluster to use the same outbound IP address. This configuration can cause the node that hosts the IP address to crash during times of high network traffic.

apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: EgressIP
metadata:
  name: <name> <1>
spec:
  egressIPs: <2>
  - <ip_address>
  namespaceSelector: <3>
    ...
  podSelector: <4>
    ...
----
<1> The name for the `EgressIPs` object.

<2> An array of one or more IP addresses.

<3> One or more selectors for the namespaces to associate the egress IP addresses with.

<4> Optional: One or more selectors for pods in the specified namespaces to associate egress IP addresses with. Applying these selectors allows for the selection of a subset of pods within a namespace.

The following YAML describes the stanza for the namespace selector:

.Namespace selector stanza
[source,yaml]
----
namespaceSelector: <1>
  matchLabels:
    <label_name>: <label_value>
----
<1> One or more matching rules for namespaces. If more than one match rule is provided, all matching namespaces are selected.

The following YAML describes the optional stanza for the pod selector:

.Pod selector stanza
[source,yaml]
----
podSelector: <1>
  matchLabels:
    <label_name>: <label_value>
----
<1> Optional: One or more matching rules for pods in the namespaces that match the specified `namespaceSelector` rules. If specified, only pods that match are selected. Others pods in the namespace are not selected.

In the following example, the `EgressIP` object associates the `192.168.126.11` and `192.168.126.102` egress IP addresses with pods that have the `app` label set to `web` and are in the namespaces that have the `env` label set to `prod`:

In the following example, the `EgressIP` object associates the `192.168.127.30` and `192.168.127.40` egress IP addresses with any pods that do not have the `environment` label set to `development`:
