:FeatureName: Enclave Support
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The purpose of a network enclave is to limit internal access to a portion of a network. A major difference between a DMZ or demilitarized zone and a network enclave is a DMZ allows inbound and outbound traffic access, where firewall boundaries are traversed. In an enclave, firewall boundaries are not traversed.

This specific feature addresses use cases where mirroring is needed for several enclaves (disconnected environments), that are secured behind at least one intermediate disconnected network.

With enclave support:

- You can mirror content for multiple enclaves and centralize it in a single internal registry. Some customers want to run security checks on the mirrored content, vetting it before allowing mirroring to downstream enclaves.
- You can mirror content directly from the centralized internal registry to enclaves without restarting the mirroring process from the internet for each enclave.
- You can minimize data transfer between network stages, ensuring that a blob or image is transferred only once from one stage to another.
