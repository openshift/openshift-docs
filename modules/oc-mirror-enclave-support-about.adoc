= Benefits of enclave support

Enclave support restricts internal access to a specific part of a network. Unlike a demilitarized zone (DMZ) network, which allows inbound and outbound traffic access through firewall boundaries, enclaves do not cross firewall boundaries.

:FeatureName: Enclave Support
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The new enclave support functionality is for scenarios where mirroring is needed for multiple enclaves that are secured behind at least one intermediate disconnected network.

Enclave support has the following benefits:

* You can mirror content for multiple enclaves and centralize it in a single internal registry. Because some customers want to run security checks on the mirrored content, with this setup they can run these checks all at once. The content is then vetted before being mirrored to downstream enclaves.

* You can mirror content directly from the centralized internal registry to enclaves without restarting the mirroring process from the internet for each enclave.

* You can minimize data transfer between network stages, so to ensure that a blob or image is transferred only once from one stage to another.
