= Opting out of Tekton Hub in the Developer perspective

[role="_abstract"]
Cluster administrators can opt out of displaying {tekton-hub} resources, such as tasks and pipelines, in the **Pipeline builder** page of the **Developer** perspective of an {product-title} cluster.

[discrete]
.Prerequisite

* Ensure that the {pipelines-title} Operator is installed on the cluster, and the `oc` command-line tool is available.

[discrete]
.Procedure

* To opt of displaying {tekton-hub} resources in the **Developer** perspective, set the value of the `enable-devconsole-integration` field in the `TektonConfig` custom resource (CR) to `false`.

apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
  kind: TektonConfig
  metadata:
    name: config
  spec:
    targetNamespace: openshift-pipelines
    ...
    hub:
      params:
        - name: enable-devconsole-integration
          value: "false"
    ...
----
+
By default, the `TektonConfig` CR does not include the `enable-devconsole-integration` field, and the {pipelines-title} Operator assumes that the value is `true`.

[NOTE]
====
Instead of opting out of displaying {tekton-hub} resources in the **Developer** perspective, if you want to completely disable the {tekton-hub} UI, set the `enableUI` field to `false` in the `TektonHub` CR.
