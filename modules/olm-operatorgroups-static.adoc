= Static OperatorGroups

An OperatorGroup is _static_ if its `spec.staticProvidedAPIs` field is set to
`true`. As a result, OLM does not modify the OperatorGroup's `olm.providedAPIs`
annotation, which means that it can be set in advance. This is useful when a
user wants to use an OperatorGroup to prevent resource contention in a set of
namespaces but does not have active member CSVs that provide the APIs for those
resources.

Below is an example of an OperatorGroup that protects Prometheus resources in
all namespaces with the `something.cool.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"`
annotation:

[source,yaml]
