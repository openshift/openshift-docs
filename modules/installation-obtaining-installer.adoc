= Obtaining the installation program

Before you install {product-title}, download the installation file on a local
computer.

.Prerequisites

* You must install the cluster from a computer that uses Linux or macOS.
* You need 300 MB of local disk space to download the installation program.

.Procedure

. Access the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install[OpenShift Infrastructure Providers]
page. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do
not, create an account.

. Download the installation program for your operating system and place the file
in the directory where you will store the installation configuration files.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to
install your cluster. You must keep both the installation program and the files
that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster.
====

. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux
operating system, run the following command:
+
----
$ tar xvf <installation_program>.tar.gz
----

. From the
link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install[OpenShift Infrastructure Providers]
page, download your installation pull secret. This pull secret allows you to
authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities,
including Quay.io, which serves the container images for {product-title}
components.
