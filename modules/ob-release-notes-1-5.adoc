= Release notes for {builds-shortname} 1.5

[role="_abstract"]
{builds-shortname} 1.5 is now available on {ocp-product-title} 4.16, 4.17, 4.18, and 4.19.

[id="new-features-1-5_{context}"]
== New features

The new features in {builds-shortname} 1.5 include the following:

* With this update, {builds-operator} deploys Shipwright v0.16 components.
* With this update, you can use the optional `.spec.nodeSelector` value with `shp` CLI to specify the nodes on which build run pods should run.
* With this update, you can use the optional `--scheduler-name` flag with `shp` CLI to specify the scheduler for scheduling build run pods.
* With this update, the following two buildpacks `ClusterBuildStrategy` options are available for {builds-shortname}:
+
** `buildpacks` strategy
** `buildpacks-extender` strategy
+
[NOTE]
====
The `buildpacks-extender` strategy is compatible with the experimental buildpacks `extender` lifecycle phase. You can use this strategy, for example, for builds based on Node.js. However, the `extender` phase does not support Quarkus, or any other Java-based builds. For such builds, use the `buildpacks` strategy instead.
====
+
These strategies introduce new features, enhance compliance with Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNB) 0.12 specifications, and improve the overall stability and usability of the `ClusterBuildStrategy` buildpacks.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Buildpacks is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red{nbsp}Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red{nbsp}Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red{nbsp}Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].
====
* With this update, the `source.git.depth` parameter was added to the `Build` resource to specify the depth of the Git history. The default value is 1, meaning no history is cloned.
This method provides fastest way to clone a Git repository and is suitable for all cases where your build logic doesn't rely on Git history.
+
Any value greater than 1 will create a clone with the specified depth. For a full Git history clone, set the depth to 0.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you specify a commit SHA as a revision, the full history is always cloned before this commit is checked out.

[id="fixed-issues-1-5_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the build controller had permission to modify `CustomResourceDefinitions`. This caused the controller to have excessive permissions, resulting in a minor security risk. With this update, the issue is fixed.
Before this update, if the {builds-operator} failed to reconcile the `ShipwrightBuild` or `SharedResource` objects but the status update of the build controller succeeded, the controller was not requeued for reconciliation. With this update, the issue is resolved, and the controller is correctly requeued for reconciliation after a failure.

[id="deprecated-features-1-5_{context}"]
== Deprecated features

* With this update, the following channels are deprecated:
** builds-1.3
+
Instead, use the builds-1.5 channel.
