= Release notes for {builds-shortname} 1.5

{builds-shortname} 1.5 is now available on {ocp-product-title} 4.16, 4.17, 4.18, and 4.19.

[id="new-features-1-5_{context}"]
== New features

The following sections highlight what is new in {builds-shortname} 1.5.

* With this update, {builds-operator} deploys Shipwright v0.16 components.
* With this update, you can use the optional `.spec.nodeSelector` value with `shp` CLI to specify which nodes build run pods should run on.
* With this update, you can use the optional `--scheduler-name` flag with `shp` CLI to specify the scheduler to use for scheduling build run pods.
* With this update, two buildpacks `ClusterBuildStrategy` options are available for {builds-shortname}:
+
** `buildpacks` strategy
** `buildpacks-extender` strategy
+
[NOTE]
====
The `buildpacks-extender` strategy is compatible with the experimental buildpacks `extender` lifecycle phase. You can use this strategy, for example, for builds based on Node.js. However, the `extender` phase does not support Quarkus, or any other Java-based builds. For such builds, use the `buildpacks` strategy instead.
====
+
Both strategies introduce new features, enhance compliance with Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNB) 0.12 specifications, and improve the overall stability and usability of the buildpacks `ClusterBuildStrategy`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Buildpacks is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red{nbsp}Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red{nbsp}Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red{nbsp}Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].
====
* With this update,
the `source.git.depth` parameter was added to the `Build` resource to specify the depth of the Git history.
The default value is 1 and no history is cloned.
This is the fastest way to clone a Git repository
and is applicable for all cases where your build logic doesn't rely on Git history.
+
Any value greater than 1 will create a clone with the specified depth. For a full Git history clone, set the depth to 0.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you specify a commit SHA as a revision, the full history is always cloned before this commit is checked out.

[id="fixed-issues-1-5_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

The following list highlights fixed issues in {builds-shortname} 1.5.

* Before this update, the build controller had permission to modify `CustomResourceDefinitions`. This caused the controller to have excessive permissions, resulting in a minor security risk. With this update, the issue is fixed.
* Before this update, if the {builds-operator} failed to reconcile the `ShipwrightBuild` or the `SharedResource` objects, but the status update of the build controller succeeded, build controller was not requeued for reconciliation despite the previous failure. With this update, the issue is solved.

[id="deprecated-features-1-5_{context}"]
== Deprecated features

The following section highlights deprecated features in {builds-shortname} 1.5.

* With this update, the following channels are deprecated:
** builds-1.3

Instead, use the builds-1.5 channel.
