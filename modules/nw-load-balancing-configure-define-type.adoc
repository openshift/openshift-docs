= Define the default load balancer type

When installing the cluster, you can specify the type of load balancer that you want to use. The type of load balancer you choose at cluster installation gets applied to the entire cluster.

This example shows how to define the default load-balancer type for a cluster deployed on {aws-short}.You can apply the procedure on other supported platforms.
