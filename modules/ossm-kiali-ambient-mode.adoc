= About Kiali and Istio ambient mode

When running in {istio} ambient mode, Kiali introduces new behaviors and visualizations to support the Ambient data plane. The following information describes key aspects of Kiali in this context:

Access requirements:: Kiali requires access to the `ztunnel` namespace to detect whether ambient mode is enabled. Without this access, Kiali does not display ambient-related features.

Visualizations and features:: 
With ambient badges, Kiali displays badges for namespaces and workloads that are enrolled in the ambient mesh, allowing quick identification.

Traffic graph adjustments:: 
Ambient mode introduces new telemetry sources. Kiali collects and displays metrics from both ztunnel and waypoint proxies to provide complete visibility into mesh traffic. New filters and selectors in Kiali allow users to focus on ambient-specific traffic sources. Kiali provides a display option for visualizing waypoint nodes in the traffic graph.

The traffic graph changes based on the ambient enrollment:

* Without waypoint proxies, the traffic graph displays only Layer 4 (L4) traffic.

* With waypoint proxies, the graph includes Layer 7 (L7) traffic and may also include L4 traffic.

Workload proxy logs:: Kiali aggregates and filters logs from both ztunnel and waypoint proxies. This unified view simplifies troubleshooting by showing only the relevant log entries for each workload.

Distributed tracing:: Tracing data is available only when waypoint proxies are deployed, because traces are generated by waypoint services. Kiali automatically correlates workload traces with their associated waypoint proxies.

Dedicated pages for ambient components:: 
The dedicated pages allow users to analyze ambient components separately from workloads and services:

* Waypoint pages display detailed information about captured workloads.

* Ztunnel pages focus on telemetry, metrics, and diagnostics, based on data from `istioctl` utilities.

Kiali integration with ambient mode ensures full observability for workloads running in the ambient mesh and simplifies operational monitoring and troubleshooting tasks.
