= Configuring host firmware for low latency and high performance

Bare-metal hosts require the firmware to be configured before the host can be provisioned. The firmware configuration is dependent on the specific hardware and the particular requirements of your installation.

.Procedure

. Set the *UEFI/BIOS Boot Mode* to `UEFI`.
. In the host boot sequence order, set *Hard drive first*.
. Apply the specific firmware configuration for your hardware. The following table describes a representative firmware configuration for an Intel Xeon Skylake server and later hardware generations, based on the Intel FlexRAN 4G and 5G baseband PHY reference design.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The exact firmware configuration depends on your specific hardware and network requirements. The following sample configuration is for illustrative purposes only.
