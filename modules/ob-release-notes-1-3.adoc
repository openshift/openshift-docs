= Release notes for {builds-shortname} General Availability 1.3

{builds-shortname} General Availability (GA) 1.3 is now available on {ocp-product-title} <version>.

[id="new-features-1-3_{context}"]
== New features

The following section highlight what is new in {builds-shortname} 1.3.

* With this update, {builds-shortname} for OpenShift components, including the Operator, Shipwright-Builds, and the Shared Resource Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver, are FIPS-validated and run on FIPS-compliant clusters.

* With this update, the {builds-operator} deploys Shipwright v0.14 APIs, controllers and webhook.

* With this update, while creating the `build` or `buildRun` resources using OpenShift Builds Client, you can set the parameters using the `--param-value` flag.

[id="fixed-issues-1-3_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

The following section highlights fixed issues in {builds-shortname} 1.3.

* Before this update, when you installed {builds-shortname} without installing {pipelines-shortname}, the {builds-shortname} attempts to deploy {pipelines-shortname} and enables the Tekton Pipeline controllers. Previously, {builds-shortname} incorrectly configured {pipelines-shortname} and failed to deploy the Tekton Pipeline controllers. With this change, {builds-shortname} creates a valid TektonConfig and deploys the Tekton Pipeline controllers.

* Before this update, when you tried to execute builds using {builds-title} installed on ARM, IBM Power, or IBM Z worker node CPU architectures, the builds failed due to AMD only build strategies images. Now, the AMD only image is replaced with a multi-arch image in `buildah` and `source-to-image` build strategies and you can execute builds on all the architectures.

* Before this update, when you enabled cluster monitoring in the `openshift-builds` namespace, the TargetDown alert was received on the Shared Resources CSI Driver Metrics Service Monitor. Now, the ServerName is updated to the correct address in Shared Resources CSI Driver Metrics Service Monitor. 

* Before this update, the operator logo was not displayed in the Operator Hub. Previously, to display the operator logo in the Operator Hub, you had to update the operator logo in the File Based Catalog(FBC) catalog format even after specifying it in the CSV file. With this update, the operator logo data is specified in the catalog config yaml files and the operator logo is displayed in the Operator Hub.
