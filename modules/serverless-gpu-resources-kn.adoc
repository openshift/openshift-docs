= Specifying GPU requirements for a service

After GPU resources are enabled for your {product-title} cluster, you can specify GPU requirements for a Knative service using the Knative (`kn`) CLI.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Serving and Knative Eventing are installed on the cluster.
* You have installed the Knative (`kn`) CLI.
* GPU resources are enabled for your {product-title} cluster.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

Using NVIDIA GPU resources is not supported for {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-power-name}.

.Procedure

. Create a Knative service and set the GPU resource requirement limit to `1` by using the `--limit nvidia.com/gpu=1` flag:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service create hello --image <service-image> --limit nvidia.com/gpu=1
----
+
A GPU resource requirement limit of `1` means that the service has 1 GPU resource dedicated. Services do not share GPU resources. Any other services that require GPU resources must wait until the GPU resource is no longer in use.
+
A limit of 1 GPU also means that applications exceeding usage of 1 GPU resource are restricted. If a service requests more than 1 GPU resource, it is deployed on a node where the GPU resource requirements can be met.

. Optional. For an existing service, you can change the GPU resource requirement limit to `3` by using the `--limit nvidia.com/gpu=3` flag:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service update hello --limit nvidia.com/gpu=3
----
