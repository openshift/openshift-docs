= About Kuryr

Kuryr is a container network interface (CNI) plug-in that uses Neutron and Octavia to provide networking to pods and services. It is primarily designed for {product-title} clusters that run on OpenStack VMs.

Kuryr improves network performance by connecting pods to the OpenStack SDN. It also provides connections between pods and OpenStack virtual instances.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Kuryr is recommended for deployments on encapsulated OpenStack tenant networks to avoid double encapsulation. For example, on a deployment of an encapsulated OpenShift SDN over an OpenStack network.

The default OpenShift SDN is recommended if:

* You use provider networks or tenant VLANs.
* The deployment will use many services on a few hypervisors. Each service creates an Octavia Amphora virtual machine in OpenStack that hosts a required load balancer.
* You need UDP services.
====

You can enable Kuryr in your project by editing a parameter in `install-config.yaml`.

To learn more about Kuryr, see https://docs.openstack.org/kuryr-kubernetes/latest/[its documentation].

== Known limitations

When using Kuryr SDN:

* An Amphora load balancer VM is deployed deployed per OpenShift service with the default Octavia load balancer driver (Amphora driver). If the environment is resource-constrained, creating a large number of services can negatively impact performance.
* Some versions of Octavia do not support UDP listeners. Using these versions of Octavia means that you cannot use OpenShift UDP services.
* Octavia does not support UDP and TCP listeners on the same port. If there is a conflict, only the TCP listener is created.
** Due to this limitation, Kuryr forces pods to use TCP for DNS resolution (`use-vc` option at `resolv.conf`). Pods that run Go applications compiled with the `CGO_DEBUG` flag disabled may fail because the `go` resolver only uses UDP.
