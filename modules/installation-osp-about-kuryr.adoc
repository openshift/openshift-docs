= About Kuryr SDN

link:https://docs.openstack.org/kuryr-kubernetes/latest/[Kuryr] is a container
network interface (CNI) plug-in solution that uses the
link:https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/[Neutron] and
link:https://docs.openstack.org/octavia/latest/[Octavia] {rh-openstack-first} services
to provide networking for Pods and Services.

Kuryr and {product-title} integration is primarily designed for
{product-title} clusters running on {rh-openstack} VMs. Kuryr improves the
network performance by plugging {product-title} Pods into {rh-openstack} SDN.
In addition, it provides interconnectivity between Pods and
{rh-openstack} virtual instances.

Kuryr components are installed as Pods in {product-title} using the
`openshift-kuryr` namespace:

* `kuryr-controller` - a single Service instance installed on a `master` node.
This is modeled in {product-title} as a `Deployment`.
* `kuryr-cni` - a container installing and configuring Kuryr as a CNI driver on
each {product-title} node. This is modeled in {product-title} as a `DaemonSet`.

The Kuryr controller watches the OpenShift API server for Pod, Service, and
namespace create, update, and delete events. It maps the {product-title} API
calls to corresponding objects in Neutron and Octavia. This means that every
network solution that implements the Neutron trunk port functionality can be
used to back {product-title} via Kuryr. This includes open source solutions
such as Open vSwitch (OVS) and Open Virtual Network (OVN) as well as
Neutron-compatible commercial SDNs.

Kuryr is recommended for {product-title} deployments on encapsulated {rh-openstack} tenant
networks to avoid double encapsulation, such as running an encapsulated
{product-title} SDN over an {rh-openstack} network.

Conversely, Kuryr is not recommended in the following cases:

* You use provider networks or tenant VLANs.
* Your deployment uses many Services on a few hypervisors. Each OpenShift
  Service creates an Octavia Amphora virtual machine in OpenStack that hosts a
  required load balancer.
* UDP Services are needed.
