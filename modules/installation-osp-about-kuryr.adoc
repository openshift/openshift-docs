= About Kuryr SDN

link:https://docs.openstack.org/kuryr-kubernetes/latest/[Kuryr] is a container
network interface (CNI) plug-in solution that uses the
link:https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/[Neutron] and
link:https://docs.openstack.org/octavia/latest/[Octavia] {rh-openstack-first} services
to provide networking for pods and Services.

Kuryr and {product-title} integration is primarily designed for
{product-title} clusters running on {rh-openstack} VMs. Kuryr improves the
network performance by plugging {product-title} pods into {rh-openstack} SDN.
In addition, it provides interconnectivity between pods and
{rh-openstack} virtual instances.

Kuryr components are installed as pods in {product-title} using the
`openshift-kuryr` namespace:

* `kuryr-controller` - a single service instance installed on a `master` node.
This is modeled in {product-title} as a `Deployment` object.
* `kuryr-cni` - a container installing and configuring Kuryr as a CNI driver on
each {product-title} node. This is modeled in {product-title} as a `DaemonSet` object.

The Kuryr controller watches the {product-title} API server for pod, service, and
namespace create, update, and delete events. It maps the {product-title} API
calls to corresponding objects in Neutron and Octavia. This means that every
network solution that implements the Neutron trunk port functionality can be
used to back {product-title} via Kuryr. This includes open source solutions
such as Open vSwitch (OVS) and Open Virtual Network (OVN) as well as
Neutron-compatible commercial SDNs.

Kuryr is recommended for {product-title} deployments on encapsulated {rh-openstack} tenant
networks to avoid double encapsulation, such as running an encapsulated
{product-title} SDN over an {rh-openstack} network.

If you use provider networks or tenant VLANs, you do not need to use Kuryr to
avoid double encapsulation. The performance benefit is negligible. Depending on
your configuration, though, using Kuryr to avoid having two overlays might still
be beneficial.

Kuryr is not recommended in deployments where all of the following criteria are true:

* The {rh-openstack} version is less than 16.
* The deployment uses UDP services, or a large number of TCP services on few hypervisors.

or

* The `ovn-octavia` Octavia driver is disabled.
* The deployment uses a large number of TCP services on few hypervisors.
