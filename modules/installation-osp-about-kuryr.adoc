= About Kuryr

Kuryr is a container network interface (CNI) plug-in that uses Neutron and Octavia to provide networking to Pods and Services. It is primarily designed for {product-title} clusters that run on OpenStack instances.

Kuryr improves network performance by connecting Pods to the OpenStack SDN. It also provides connections between Pods and OpenStack instances.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Kuryr is recommended for deployments on encapsulated OpenStack tenant networks to avoid double encapsulation. For example, on a deployment of an encapsulated OpenShift SDN over an OpenStack network.

The default OpenShift SDN is recommended if:

* You use provider networks or tenant VLANs.
* The deployment will use many Services on a few hypervisors. Each Service creates an Octavia Amphora virtual machine in OpenStack that hosts a required load balancer.
* You need UDP Services.
====

You can enable Kuryr in your project by editing a parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file.

To learn more about Kuryr, see https://docs.openstack.org/kuryr-kubernetes/latest/[its documentation].

[id="known-limitations_{context}"]
== Known limitations

When using Kuryr SDN:

* An Amphora load balancer VM is deployed deployed per {product-title} Service with the default Octavia load balancer driver, the Amphora driver. If the environment is resource-constrained, creating a large number of Services can negatively impact performance.
+
[NOTE]
====
Remember that the {product-title} cluster itself and its supporting components create Services. For example, Kuryr itself creates around 40 load balancers.
====
* Some versions of Octavia do not support UDP listeners. Using these versions of Octavia means that you cannot use {product-title} UDP Services.
* Octavia does not support UDP and TCP listeners on the same port. If there is a conflict, only the TCP listener is created.
** Due to this limitation, Kuryr forces Pods to use TCP for DNS resolution (`use-vc` option at `resolv.conf`). Pods that run Go applications compiled with the `CGO_DEBUG` flag disabled might fail because the `go` resolver only uses UDP.
