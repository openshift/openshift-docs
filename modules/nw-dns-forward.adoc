= Using DNS forwarding

You can use DNS forwarding to override the default forwarding configuration in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file in the following ways:

* Specify name servers for every zone. If the forwarded zone is the Ingress domain managed by {product-title}, then the upstream name server must be authorized for the domain.
+
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must specify at least one zone. Otherwise, your cluster can lose functionality.
====
endif::[]
+
* Provide a list of upstream DNS servers.
* Change the default forwarding policy.

[NOTE]
====
A DNS forwarding configuration for the default domain can have both the default servers specified in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file and the upstream DNS servers.
====

.Procedure

. Modify the DNS Operator object named `default`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit dns.operator/default
----
+
After you issue the previous command, the Operator creates and updates the config map named `dns-default` with additional server configuration blocks based on `Server`.
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When specifying values for the `zones` parameter, ensure that you only forward to specific zones, such as your intranet. You must specify at least one zone. Otherwise, your cluster can lose functionality.
====
+
endif::[]
If none of the servers have a zone that matches the query, then name resolution falls back to the upstream DNS servers.

<1> Must comply with the `rfc6335` service name syntax.
<2> Must conform to the definition of a subdomain in the `rfc1123` service name syntax. The cluster domain, `cluster.local`, is an invalid subdomain for the `zones` field.
<3> Defines the policy to select upstream resolvers. Default value is `Random`. You can also use the values `RoundRobin`, and `Sequential`.
<4> A maximum of 15 `upstreams` is allowed per `forwardPlugin`.
<5> Optional. You can use it to override the default policy and forward DNS resolution to the specified DNS resolvers (upstream resolvers) for the default domain. If you do not provide any upstream resolvers, the DNS name queries go to the servers in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
<6> Determines the order in which upstream servers are selected for querying. You can specify one of these values: `Random`, `RoundRobin`, or `Sequential`. The default value is `Sequential`.
<7> Optional. You can use it to provide upstream resolvers.
<8> You can specify two types of `upstreams` - `SystemResolvConf` and `Network`. `SystemResolvConf` configures the upstream to use `/etc/resolv.conf` and `Network` defines a `Networkresolver`. You can specify one or both.
<9> If the specified type is `Network`, you must provide an IP address. The `address` field must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
<10> If the specified type is `Network`, you can optionally provide a port. The `port` field must have a value between `1` and `65535`. If you do not specify a port for the upstream, by default port 853 is tried.

. Optional: When working in a highly regulated environment, you might need the ability to secure DNS traffic when forwarding requests to upstream resolvers so that you can ensure additional DNS traffic and data privacy.

<3> When configuring TLS for forwarded DNS queries, set the `transport` field to have the value `TLS`.
By default, CoreDNS caches forwarded connections for 10 seconds. CoreDNS will hold a TCP connection open for those 10 seconds if no request is issued. With large clusters, ensure that your DNS server is aware that it might get many new connections to hold open because you can initiate a connection per node. Set up your DNS hierarchy accordingly to avoid performance issues.
<4> When configuring TLS for forwarded DNS queries, this is a mandatory server name used as part of the server name indication (SNI) to validate the upstream TLS server certificate.
<5> Defines the policy to select upstream resolvers. Default value is `Random`. You can also use the values `RoundRobin`, and `Sequential`.
<6> Required. You can use it to provide upstream resolvers. A maximum of 15 `upstreams` entries are allowed per `forwardPlugin` entry.
<7> Optional. You can use it to override the default policy and forward DNS resolution to the specified DNS resolvers (upstream resolvers) for the default domain. If you do not provide any upstream resolvers, the DNS name queries go to the servers in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
<8> `Network` type indicates that this upstream resolver should handle forwarded requests separately from the upstream resolvers listed in `/etc/resolv.conf`. Only the `Network` type is allowed when using TLS and you must provide an IP address.
<9> The `address` field must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
<10> You can optionally provide a port. The `port` must have a value between `1` and `65535`. If you do not specify a port for the upstream, by default port 853 is tried.

[NOTE]
====
If `servers` is undefined or invalid, the config map only contains the default server.
