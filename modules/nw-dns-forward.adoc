= Using DNS forwarding

You can use DNS forwarding to override the default forwarding configuration in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file in the following ways:

* Specify name servers for every zone. If the forwarded zone is the Ingress domain managed by {product-title}, then the upstream name server must be authorized for the domain.
* Provide a list of upstream DNS servers.
* Change the default forwarding policy.

[NOTE]
=====
A DNS forwarding configuration for the default domain can have both the default servers specified in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file and the upstream DNS servers.
=====

.Procedure

. Modify the DNS Operator object named `default`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit dns.operator/default
----
+
This allows the Operator to create and update the ConfigMap named `dns-default` with additional server configuration blocks based on `Server`. If none of the servers has a zone that matches the query, then name resolution falls back to the upstream DNS servers.
+
.Sample DNS

metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  servers:
  - name: foo-server <1>
    zones: <2>
    - foo.com
    forwardPlugin:
      policy: Random <3>

      - 1.1.1.1
      - 2.2.2.2:5353
  - name: bar-server
    zones:
    - bar.com
    - example.com
    forwardPlugin:
      policy: Random
      upstreams:
      - 3.3.3.3

      port: 53 <10>
----
<1> Must comply with the `rfc6335` service name syntax.
<2> Must conform to the definition of a `subdomain` in `rfc1123`. The cluster domain, `cluster.local`, is an invalid `subdomain` for `zones`.
<3> Defines the policy to select upstream resolvers. Default value is `Random`. You can also use `RoundRobin`, and `Sequential`.
<4> A maximum of 15 `upstreams` is allowed per `forwardPlugin`.
<5> Optional. You can use it to override the default policy and forward DNS resolution to the specified DNS resolvers (upstream resolvers) for the default domain. If you do not provide any upstream resolvers, the DNS name queries go to the servers in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
<6> Determines the order in which upstream servers are selected for querying. You can specify one of these values: `Random`, `RoundRobin`, or `Sequential`. The default value is `Sequential`.
<7> Optional. You can use it to provide upstream resolvers.
<8> You can specify two types of `upstreams` - `SystemResolvConf` and `Network`. `SystemResolvConf` configures the upstream to use ``/etc/resolv.conf` and `Network` defines a `Networkresolver`. You can specify one or both.
<9> If the specified type is `Network`, you must provide an IP address. `address` must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
<10> If the specified type is `Network`, you can optionally provide a port. `port` must be between 1 and 65535.
+
[NOTE]
====
If `servers` is undefined or invalid, the ConfigMap only contains the default server.
