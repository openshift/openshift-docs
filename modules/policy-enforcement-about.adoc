= About policy enforcement

[role="_abstract"]
When you configure policies in {product-title-short}, you can choose how {product-title-short} responds when it detects a condition that violates a security policy.

{product-title-short} can perform different types of policy enforcement, or actions that address a violation, depending on the phase in which the violation is discovered. When configuring policy enforcement, you can select multiple stages when configuring enforcement in the policy. For example, you can select *Build* and *Deploy* so that {product-title-short} alerts the build pipeline to the problem, but if the developer allows the build to succeed, the deployment is prevented.

In _build time enforcement_, you can configure {product-title-short} to fail your continuous integration (CI) builds when images match the criteria of the policy. This means that when there is a condition in the build which violates the policy, for example, if there is a fixable CVE of a severity level and you have configured a policy for that condition, the build should fail. As an example, if you have configured {product-title-short} to check an image or deployment and you have integrated that check into a CI/CD pipeline, if {product-title-short} detects a condition that means a policy should fail, the {product-title-short} API returns a non-zero exit code. The pipeline then uses that code to fail the build.

* Sensor enforcement: Also known as _soft_ enforcement, if a workload is examined and violates a policy, Sensor scales down pods by using the Kubernetes API.
* Admission controller enforcement: Also known as _hard_ enforcement, an admission controller works with validating webhooks and the Kubernetes API server to block workload admission or update attempts that violate an enforced policy. When a request is made to deploy or update, the validating webhooks communicate with the admission controller and the admission controller responds to either allow or block the action based on whether a policy is enforced. The API server accepts or rejects the request based on whether it violates the policy and if the policy is enforced.
