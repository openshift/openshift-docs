= About policy enforcement

[role="_abstract"]
When you configure policies in {product-title-short}, you can choose how {product-title-short} responds when it detects a condition that violates a security policy.

{product-title-short} can perform different types of policy enforcement, or actions that address a violation, depending on the phase in which the violation is discovered. When configuring policy enforcement, you can select multiple stages when configuring enforcement in the policy. For example, you can select *Build* and *Deploy* so that {product-title-short} alerts the build pipeline to the problem, but if the developer allows the build to succeed, the deployment is prevented.

In _build time enforcement_, you can configure {product-title-short} to fail your continuous integration (CI) builds when images match the criteria of the policy. This means that when there is a condition in the build which violates the policy, for example, if there is a fixable CVE of a severity level and you have configured a policy for that condition, the build should fail. As an example, if you have configured {product-title-short} to check an image or deployment and you have integrated that check into a CI/CD pipeline, if {product-title-short} detects a condition that means a policy should fail, the {product-title-short} API returns a non-zero exit code. The pipeline then uses that code to fail the build.

In _deploy time enforcement_, {product-title-short} works with Kubernetes admission controllers and {ocp} admission plugins to allow you to enforce security policies. {product-title-short} prevents Kubernetes or {ocp} from creating or updating workloads, for example, deployments, daemon sets or jobs, that match the conditions of the policy. This is useful for shutting down deployments with serious problems even if the build was successful.
