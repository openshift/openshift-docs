= About policy enforcement

[role="_abstract"]
When you configure policies in {product-title-short}, you can configure how {product-title-short} responds when it detects a condition that violates a security policy.

{product-title-short} allows you to enforce security policies during all phases of the development lifecycle: build, deploy, and runtime.

{product-title-short} provides two types of policy enforcement:

* Sensor enforcement: Also known as _soft_ enforcement, if a workload is examined and violates a policy, Sensor scales down pods by using the Kubernetes API.
* Admission controller enforcement: Also known as _hard_ enforcement, an admission controller works with validating webhooks and the Kubernetes API server to block workload admission or update attempts that violate an enforced policy. When a request is made to deploy or update, the validating webhooks communicate with the admission controller and the admission controller responds to either allow or block the action based on whether a policy is enforced. The API server accepts or rejects the request based on whether it violates the policy and if the policy is enforced.

For more information about admission controller enforcement, see "Understanding admission controller enforcement".
