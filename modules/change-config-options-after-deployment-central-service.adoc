= Changing configuration options after deploying the central-services Helm chart

You can make changes to any configuration options after you have deployed the `central-services` Helm chart.

When using the `helm upgrade` command to make changes, the following guidelines and requirements apply:

* You can also specify configuration values using the `--set` or `--set-file` parameters.
However, these options are not saved, and you must manually specify all the options again whenever you make changes.
* Some changes, such as enabling a new component, require new certificates to be issued for the component. Therefore, you must provide a CA when making these changes.
** If the CA was generated by the Helm chart during the initial installation, you must retrieve these automatically generated values from the cluster and provide them to the `helm upgrade` command. The post-installation notes of the `central-services` Helm chart include a command for retrieving the automatically generated values.
** If the CA was generated outside of the Helm chart and provided during the installation of the `central-services` chart, then you must perform that action again when using the `helm upgrade` command, for example, by using the `--reuse-values` flag with the `helm upgrade` command.


.Procedure

. Update the `values-public.yaml` and `values-private.yaml` configuration files with new values.
. Run the `helm upgrade` command and specify the configuration files using the `-f` option:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ helm upgrade -n stackrox \
  stackrox-central-services rhacs/central-services \
  --reuse-values \// <1>
  -f <path_to_init_bundle_file \
  -f <path_to_values_public.yaml> \
  -f <path_to_values_private.yaml>
----
<1> If you have modified values that are not included in the `values_public.yaml` and `values_private.yaml` files, include the `--reuse-values` parameter.
