= Troubleshooting Envoy proxy

The Envoy proxy intercepts all inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service mesh. Envoy also collects and reports telemetry on the service mesh. Envoy is deployed as a sidecar to the relevant service in the same pod.

== Enabling Envoy access logs

Envoy access logs are useful in diagnosing traffic failures and flows, and help with end-to-end traffic flow analysis.

To enable access logging for all istio-proxy containers, edit the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` (SMCP) object to add a file name for the logging output.

.Procedure

. Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform CLI as a user with the cluster-admin role. Enter the following command. Then, enter your username and password when prompted.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login https://{HOSTNAME}:6443
----
+
. Change to the project where you installed the control plane, for example `istio-system`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project istio-system
----
+
. Edit the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` file.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit smcp <smcp_name>
----
+
. As show in the following example, use `name` to specify the file name for the proxy log. If you do not specify a value for `name`, no log entries will be written.
