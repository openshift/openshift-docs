= Default security policies

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} includes a set of default policies that provide broad coverage to identify security issues and ensure best practices for security in your environment. You can use the {product-title-short} portal to view default policies, clone them, and edit the cloned default policies.

[NOTE]
====
Default policies are not supported with the policies as code feature.
====

To view the default policies:

* In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Policy Management*.

The *Policies* view also enables you to configure the policies.

The policy information is organized into the following groups:

* *Policy*: A name for the policy.
* *Description*: A longer, more detailed description of the alert for the policy.
* *Status*: The current status of the policy, either *Enabled* or *Disabled*.
* *Notifiers*: The list of notifiers that are configured for the policy.
* *Severity*: A ranking of the policy, either critical, high, medium, or low, for the amount of attention required.
* *Lifecycle*: The phase of the container lifecycle (build, deploy, or runtime) that this policy applies to, and the phase at which enforcement applies, when the policy is enabled.
* *Policy categories*: Lists the categories and enables you to manage the categories for your policies. By default, all the categories are listed. You optionally filter the categories by using the category name.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot delete default policies or edit policy criteria for default policies.
