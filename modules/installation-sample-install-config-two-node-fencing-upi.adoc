= Sample install-config.yaml for a two-node user-provisioned infrastructure cluster with fencing

You can use the following `install-config.yaml` configuration as a template for deploying a two-node OpenShift cluster with fencing by using the user-provisioned infrastructure method:

----
* `compute.replicas`: Set this field to `0` because a two-node fencing cluster does not include worker nodes.  
* `controlPlane.replicas`: Set this field to `2` for a two-node fencing deployment.  
* `fencing.credentials.hostname`: Provide BMC credentials for each control plane node.  
* `metadata.name`: Cluster name is used as a prefix for hostnames and DNS records.  
* `featureSet`: Enables two-node OpenShift cluster deployments.  
* `platform.none` Set the platform to `none` for user-provisioned infrastructure deployments. Bare-metal hosts are pre-provisioned outside of the installation program.
* `pullSecret`: Contains credentials required to pull container images for the cluster components.  
* `sshKey`: The SSH public key for accessing cluster nodes after installation.
