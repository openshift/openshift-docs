= Selecting multiple projects during quota creation

When creating quotas, you can select multiple projects based on annotation
selection, label selection, or both.

.Procedure

. To select projects based on annotations, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create clusterquota for-user \
     --project-annotation-selector openshift.io/requester=<user_name> \
     --hard pods=10 \
     --hard secrets=20
----
+
This creates the following ClusterResourceQuota object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ClusterResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: for-user
spec:
  quota: <1>
    hard:
      pods: "10"
      secrets: "20"
  selector:
    annotations: <2>
      openshift.io/requester: <user_name>
    labels: null <3>
status:
  namespaces: <4>
  - namespace: ns-one
    status:
      hard:
        pods: "10"
        secrets: "20"
      used:
        pods: "1"
        secrets: "9"
  total: <5>
    hard:
      pods: "10"
      secrets: "20"
    used:
      pods: "1"
      secrets: "9"
----
<1> The `ResourceQuotaSpec` object that will be enforced over the selected projects.
<2> A simple key-value selector for annotations.
<3> A label selector that can be used to select projects.
<4> A per-namespace map that describes current quota usage in each selected project.
<5> The aggregate usage across all selected projects.
+
This multi-project quota document controls all projects requested by
`<user_name>` using the default project request endpoint. You are limited to 10
pods and 20 secrets.

. Similarly, to select projects based on labels, run this command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc create clusterresourcequota for-name \//<1>
    --project-label-selector=name=frontend \//<2>
    --hard=pods=10 --hard=secrets=20
----
+
<1> Both `clusterresourcequota` and `clusterquota` are aliases of the same
command. `for-name` is the name of the ClusterResourceQuota object.
<2> To select projects by label, provide a key-value pair by using the format `--project-label-selector=key=value`.
+
This creates the following ClusterResourceQuota object definition:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ClusterResourceQuota
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: for-name
spec:
  quota:
    hard:
      pods: "10"
      secrets: "20"
  selector:
    annotations: null
    labels:
      matchLabels:
        name: frontend
