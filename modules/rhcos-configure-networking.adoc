= Configuring networking with kernel arguments on {op-system}

While network configuration is usually handled by Ignition, there are some situations where you might want to use kernel arguments to configure networking if you need it in the initramfs. In these cases, you can have the initramfs propogate network configuration to the nodes.

The follow procedure configures networking at installation time and appends kernel arguments to the `coreos-installer install` command so that the installed system itself will use the specified network settings beginning from first boot.

[NOTE]
====
If you provide networking configuring in multiple ways, such as with Ignition and using kernel arguments, then the configuration supplied using Ignition will be what gets applied to the real root of the machine. However, this procedure can be used in these partial configuration situations, even if some networking was configured using Ignition.

.Prerequisites
. You are in the {op-system} live environment.
. You have reviewed the `coreos.inst` boot options for ISO or PXE installations

.Procedure
