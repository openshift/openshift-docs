= Embed application RPMs tutorial

The following tutorial reviews the {product-title} installation steps and adds a description of the workflow for embedding applications. If you are already familiar with `rpm-ostree` systems such as {op-system-ostree-first} and {product-title}, you can go straight to the procedures.

== Installation workflow review
Embedding applications requires a similar workflow to embedding {product-title} into a {op-system-ostree} image. Reviewing those steps can help you understand the steps needed to embed an application:

. To embed {product-title} on {op-system-ostree}, you added the {product-title} repositories to Image Builder.

. You created a blueprint that declared all the RPMs, container images, files and customizations you needed, including the addition of {product-title}.

. You added the blueprint to Image Builder and ran a build with the Image Builder CLI tool (`composer-cli`). This step created `rpm-ostree` commits, which were used to create the container image. This image contained {op-system-ostree}.

. You added the installer blueprint to Image Builder to create an `rpm-ostree` image (ISO) to boot from. This build contained both {op-system-ostree} and {product-title}.

. You downloaded the ISO with {product-title} embedded, prepared it for use, provisioned it, then installed it onto your edge devices.

== Embed application RPMs workflow

After you have set up a build host that meets the Image Builder requirements, you can add your application in the form of a directory of manifests to the image. After those steps, the simplest way to embed your application or workload into a new ISO is to create your own RPMs that include the manifests. Your application RPMs contain all of the configuration files describing your deployment.

The following procedures use the `rpmbuild` tool to create a `.spec` file and local repository. The `.spec` file defines how the package is built, moving your application manifests to the correct location inside the RPM package for {product-title} to pick them up. That RPM package is then embedded in the ISO.
