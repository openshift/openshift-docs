= Creating a {hcp} for ROSA cluster using the CLI

When using {product-title} (ROSA) CLI (`rosa`) to create a cluster, you can select the default options to create the cluster quickly.

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the AWS prerequisites for {hcp} for ROSA.
* You have available AWS service quotas.
* You have enabled the ROSA service in the AWS Console.
* You have installed and configured the latest ROSA CLI (`rosa`) on your installation host.
+
[NOTE]
====
To successfully install ROSA clusters, use the latest version of the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).
====
* You have logged in to your Red Hat account by using the `rosa` CLI.
* You have verified that the AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service role exists in your AWS account.

.Procedure

//. Create environmental variables for your region and cluster name.
//+
//[source,terminal]
//----
//CLUSTER_NAME="<cluster-name>"
//REGION="<region>"
//----

. You can create your {hcp} for ROSA cluster with one of the following commands. 
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using your own OIDC provider, you must include the OIDC config ID, such as `--oidc-config-id <oidc_config_id>`.
====

** Create a cluster with a single, initial machine pool, publicly available API, and publicly available Ingress by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create cluster --cluster-name=<cluster_name> \
    --sts --mode=auto --hosted-cp --subnet-ids=<public-subnet-id>,<private-subnet-id>
----

** Create a cluster with a single, initial machine pool, privately available API, and privately available Ingress by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create cluster --private --cluster-name=<cluster_name> \
    --sts --mode=auto --hosted-cp --subnet-ids=<private-subnet-id>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When you specify `--mode auto`, the `rosa create cluster` command creates the cluster-specific Operator IAM roles and the OIDC provider automatically. The Operators use the OIDC provider to authenticate.
====

. Check the status of your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe cluster --cluster=<cluster_name>
----
+
The following `State` field changes are listed in the output as the cluster installation progresses:
+
* `waiting (Waiting for OIDC configuration)`
* `pending (Preparing account)`
* `installing (DNS setup in progress)`
* `installing`
* `ready`
+
[NOTE]
====
If the installation fails or the `State` field does not change to `ready` after more than 10 minutes, check the installation troubleshooting documentation for details. For more information, see _Troubleshooting installations_. For steps to contact Red Hat Support for assistance, see _Getting support for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS_.
====

. Track the progress of the cluster creation by watching the {product-title} installation program logs. To check the logs, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa logs install --cluster=<cluster_name> --watch <1>
----
<1> Optional: To watch for new log messages as the installation progresses, use the `--watch` argument.
