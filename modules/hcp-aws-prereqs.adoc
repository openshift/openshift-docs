= Prerequisites to configure a management cluster

You must have the following prerequisites to configure the management cluster:

* You have installed the {mce} 2.5 and later on an {product-title} cluster. The {mce-short} is automatically installed when you install {rh-rhacm-first}. The {mce-short} can also be installed without {rh-rhacm} as an Operator from the {product-title} OperatorHub.

* You have at least one managed {product-title} cluster for the {mce-short}. The `local-cluster` is automatically imported in the {mce-short} version 2.5 and later. You can check the status of your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedclusters local-cluster
----

* You have installed the link:https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[`aws` command-line interface (CLI)].

* You have installed the hosted control plane CLI, `hcp`.
