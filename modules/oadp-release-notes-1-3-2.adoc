.DPA fails to reconcile if a valid custom secret is used for BSL

DPA fails to reconcile if a valid custom secret is used for Backup Storage Location (BSL), but the default secret is missing. The workaround is to create the required default `cloud-credentials` initially. When the custom secret is re-created, it can be used and checked for its existence.

.CVE-2023-45290: `oadp-velero-container`: Golang `net/http`: Memory exhaustion in `Request.ParseMultipartForm`

A flaw was found in the `net/http` Golang standard library package, which impacts previous versions of {oadp-short}. When parsing a `multipart` form, either explicitly with `Request.ParseMultipartForm` or implicitly with `Request.FormValue`, `Request.PostFormValue`, or `Request.FormFile`, limits on the total size of the parsed form are not applied to the memory consumed while reading a single form line. This permits a maliciously crafted input containing long lines to cause the allocation of arbitrarily large amounts of memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion. This flaw has been resolved in {oadp-short} 1.3.2.

.CVE-2023-45289: `oadp-velero-container`: Golang `net/http/cookiejar`: Incorrect forwarding of sensitive headers and cookies on HTTP redirect

A flaw was found in the `net/http/cookiejar` Golang standard library package, which impacts previous versions of {oadp-short}. When following an HTTP redirect to a domain that is not a subdomain match or exact match of the initial domain, an `http.Client` does not forward sensitive headers such as `Authorization` or `Cookie`. A maliciously crafted HTTP redirect could cause sensitive headers to be unexpectedly forwarded. This flaw has been resolved in {oadp-short} 1.3.2.

.CVE-2024-24783: `oadp-velero-container`: Golang `crypto/x509`: Verify panics on certificates with an unknown public key algorithm

A flaw was found in the `crypto/x509` Golang standard library package, which impacts previous versions of {oadp-short}. Verifying a certificate chain that contains a certificate with an unknown public key algorithm causes `Certificate.Verify` to panic. This affects all `crypto/tls` clients and servers that set `Config.ClientAuth` to `VerifyClientCertIfGiven` or `RequireAndVerifyClientCert`. The default behavior is for TLS servers to not verify client certificates. This flaw has been resolved in {oadp-short} 1.3.2.

.CVE-2024-24784: `oadp-velero-plugin-container`: Golang `net/mail`: Comments in display names are incorrectly handled

A flaw was found in the `net/mail` Golang standard library package, which impacts previous versions of {oadp-short}. The `ParseAddressList` function incorrectly handles comments, text in parentheses, and display names. Because this is a misalignment with conforming address parsers, it can result in different trust decisions being made by programs using different parsers. This flaw has been resolved in {oadp-short} 1.3.2.

For more details, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-24784[CVE-2024-24784].

.CVE-2024-24785: `oadp-velero-container`: Golang: html/template: errors returned from `MarshalJSON` methods may break template escaping

A flaw was found in the `html/template` Golang standard library package, which impacts previous versions of {oadp-short}. If errors returned from `MarshalJSON` methods contain user-controlled data, they may be used to break the contextual auto-escaping behavior of the HTML/template package, allowing subsequent actions to inject unexpected content into the templates. This flaw has been resolved in {oadp-short} 1.3.2.

For more details, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-24785[CVE-2024-24785].

.Cassandra application pods enter into the `CrashLoopBackoff` status after restoring OADP

After {oadp-short} restores, the Cassandra application pods might enter in the `CrashLoopBackoff` status. To work around this problem, delete the `StatefulSet` pods that are returning an error or the `CrashLoopBackoff` state after restoring {oadp-short}. The `StatefulSet` controller recreates these pods and it runs normally.
