== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

.Updating the replication repository to a different storage provider type is not respected by the UI
After updating the replication repository to a different type and clicking *Update Repository*, it shows connection successful, but the UI is not updated with the correct details. When clicking on the *Edit* button again, it still shows the old replication repository information.

Furthermore, when trying to update the replication repository again, it still shows the old replication details. When selecting the new repository, it also shows all the information you entered previously and the *Update repository* is not enabled, as if there are no changes to be submitted. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102020[*BZ#2102020*])

.Migrations fails because the backup is not found
Migration fails at the restore stage because of initial backup has not been found. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104874[*BZ#2104874*])

.Update Cluster button is not enabled when updating Azure resource group
When updating the remote cluster, selecting the *Azure resource group* checkbox, and adding a resource group does not enable the *Update cluster* option. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098594[*BZ#2098594*])

.Error pop-up in UI on deleting migstorage resource
When creating a `backupStorage` credential secret in {OCP}, if the `migstorage` is removed from the UI, a 404 error is returned and the underlying secret is not removed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2100828[*BZ#2100828*])

.Miganalytic resource displaying resource count as 0 in UI
After creating a migplan from backend, the Miganalytic resource displays the resource count as `0` in UI. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102139[*BZ#2102139*])

.Registry validation fails when two trailing slashes are added to the Exposed route host to image registry
After adding two trailing slashes, meaning `//`, to the exposed registry route, the MigCluster resource is showing the status as `connected`. When creating a migplan from backend with DIM, the plans move to the `unready` status. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104864[*BZ#2104864*])

.Service Account Token not visible while editing source cluster
When editing the source cluster that has been added and is in *Connected* state, in the UI, the service account token is not visible in the field. To save the wizard, you have to fetch the token again and provide details inside the field. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097668[*BZ#2097668*])
