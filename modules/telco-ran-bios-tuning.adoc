= Host firmware tuning

New in this release::
//CNF-2026
* You can now configure host firmware settings for managed clusters that you deploy with {ztp}.

Description::
Tune host firmware settings for optimal performance during initial cluster deployment.
The managed cluster host firmware settings are available on the hub cluster as `BareMetalHost` custom resources (CRs) that are created when you deploy the managed cluster with the `SiteConfig` CR and {ztp}.

Limits and requirements::
* Hyperthreading must be enabled

Engineering considerations::
* Tune all settings for maximum performance.

* All settings are expected to be for maximum performance unless tuned for power savings.

* You can tune host firmware for power savings at the expense of performance as required.

* Enable secure boot.
With secure boot enabled, only signed kernel modules are loaded by the kernel.
Out-of-tree drivers are not supported.
