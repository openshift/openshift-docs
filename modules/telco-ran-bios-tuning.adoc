= Host firmware tuning

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
Configure system level performance.
See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-reference-cluster-configuration-for-vdu.html#ztp-du-configuring-host-firmware-requirements_sno-configure-for-vdu[Configuring host firmware for low latency and high performance] for recommended settings.
+
If Ironic inspection is enabled, the firmware setting values are available from the per-cluster `BareMetalHost` CR on the hub cluster.
You enable Ironic inspection with a label in the `spec.clusters.nodes` field in the `SiteConfig` CR that you use to install the cluster.
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
  - hostName: "example-node1.example.com"
    ironicInspect: "enabled"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The {rds} reference `SiteConfig` does not enable the `ironicInspect` field by default.
====

Limits and requirements::
* Hyperthreading must be enabled

Engineering considerations::
* Tune all settings for maximum performance
+
[NOTE]
====
You can tune firmware selections for power savings at the expense of performance as required.
