= Scaling up the deployment

In Kubernetes, a `Deployment` object defines how an application deploys. In most cases when you deploy an application, {product-title} creates the `Pod`, `Service`, `ReplicaSet`, and `Deployment` resources for you.

When you deploy the `parksmap` image, a deployment resource is created. In this example, only one pod is deployed. You might want to scale up your application to keep up with user demand or to ensure that your application is always running even if one pod is down.

The following procedure scales the `parksmap` deployment to use two instances.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed the `parksmap` front-end application.

.Procedure

* Scale your deployment from one pod instance to two pod instances by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 deployment/parksmap
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
deployment.apps/parksmap scaled
----

.Verification

* Verify that your deployment scaled up properly by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-5f9579955-6sng8   1/1     Running   0          7m39s
parksmap-5f9579955-8tgft   1/1     Running   0          24s
----
+
Verify that two `parksmap` pods are listed.

[TIP]
====
To scale your deployment back down to one pod instance, pass in `1` to the `--replicas` option:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=1 deployment/parksmap
