= Mounting the hostPath share in a privileged pod

After the persistent volume claim has been created, it can be used inside by an application. The following example demonstrates mounting this share inside of a pod.

.Prerequisites
* A persistent volume claim exists that is mapped to the underlying hostPath share.

.Procedure

* Create a privileged pod that mounts the existing persistent volume claim:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-name <1>
spec:
  containers:
    ...
    securityContext:
      privileged: true <2>
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /data <3>
      name: hostpath-privileged
  ...
  securityContext: {}
  volumes:
    - name: hostpath-privileged
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: task-pvc-volume <4>
----
<1> The name of the pod.
<2> The pod must run as privileged to access the node's storage.
<3> The path to mount the hostPath share inside the privileged pod.
<4> The name of the `PersistentVolumeClaim` object that has been previously created.
