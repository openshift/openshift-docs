== Static IP addresses for vSphere nodes

You can provision bootstrap, control plane, and compute nodes to be configured with static IP addresses in environments where Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) does not exist. To configure this environment, you must provide values to the `platform.vsphere.hosts.role` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file.

By default, the installation program is configured to use the DHCP for the network, but this network has limited configurable capabilities.

After you define one or more machine pools in your `install-config.yaml` file, you can define network definitions for nodes on your network. Ensure that the number of network definitions matches the number of machine pools that you configured for your cluster.

The following example shows a network configuration for a node with the role `compute`:

[source,yaml]
----
---
platform:
  vsphere:
    hosts:
    - role: compute <1>
      networkDevice:
        ipAddrs:
        - 192.168.204.10/24 <2>
        gateway: 192.168.204.1 <3>
        nameservers:
        - 192.168.204.1 <4>
---
----
<1> Valid network definition values include `bootstrap`, `control-plane`, and `compute`. You must list at least one `bootstrap` network definition in your `install-config.yaml` configuration file.
<2> Lists IPv4, IPv6, or both IP addresses that the installation program passes to the network interface. The machine API controller assigns all configured IP addresses to the default network interface.
<3> The default gateway for the network interface.
<4> Lists up to 3 DNS nameservers.

After you deployed your cluster to run nodes with static IP addresses, you can scale a machine to use one of these static IP addresses. Additionally, you can use a machine set to configure a machine to use one of the configured static IP addresses.
