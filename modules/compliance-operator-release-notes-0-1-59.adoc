[id="compliance-operator-0-1-59-new-features-and-enhancements"]

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-59-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

* Previously, the Compliance Operator did not support the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) `ocp4-pci-dss` and `ocp4-pci-dss-node` profiles on different architectures such as `ppc64le`. Now, the Compliance Operator supports `ocp4-pci-dss` and `ocp4-pci-dss-node` profiles on the `ppc64le` architecture. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3252[*OCPBUGS-3252*])

* Previously, after the recent update to version 0.1.57, the `rerunner` service account (SA) was no longer owned by the cluster service version (CSV), which caused the SA to be removed during the Operator upgrade. Now, the CSV owns the `rerunner` SA in 0.1.59, and upgrades from any previous version will not result in a missing SA. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3452[*OCPBUGS-3452*])
