[id="removing-unused-ca-bundle_{context}"]
= Removing an unused certificate authority from the bundle

A manual rotation does not immediately update the trust bundle to remove the public key of a previous signer certificate. 

The public key of the signer certificate is removed at the expiration date, however if the public key must be removed before it expires, you can delete it.

.Procedure

. Delete the key by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete configmap -n openshift-etcd etcd-ca-bundle
----

. Wait for the static pod rollout by running the following command. The bundle regenerates with the current signer certificate and all unknown or unused keys are deleted.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm wait-for-stable-cluster --minimum-stable-period 2m
----
