= Enabling automatic sidecar injection

When deploying an application, you must opt-in to injection by setting the `sidecar.istio.io/inject` annotation to `"true"`. Opting in ensures that the sidecar injection does not interfere with other {product-title} features such as builder pods used by numerous frameworks within the {product-title} ecosystem.

.Prerequisites

* Identify the deployments for which you want to enable automatic sidecar injection.

.Procedure

. Open the application's deployment configuration YAML file in an editor. To find a deployment use the `oc get` command. For example, for an app called `sleep` in the `sleep` namespace, use the following command to see the resource in YAML format.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment sleep -o yaml
----

. Add `sidecar.istio.io/inject` to the configuration YAML with a value of `"true"` in the `spec.template.metadata.annotations.sidecar.istio/inject` field. See the following example for an app called `sleep`.

        command: ["/bin/sleep","3650d"]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
----

. Save the configuration file.

. Add the file back to the project that contains your app. In this example,  `sleep` is the name of the project that contains the `sleep` app and `sleep.yaml` is the file you edited.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -n sleep -f sleep.yaml
----

. To verify that the resource uploaded successfully, run the following command.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment sleep -o yaml
