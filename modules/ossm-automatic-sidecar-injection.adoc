= Enabling automatic sidecar injection

When deploying an application into the {ProductName} you must opt in to injection by specifying the `sidecar.istio.io/inject` annotation with a value of `"true"`. Opting in ensures that the sidecar injection does not interfere with other OpenShift features such as builder pods used by numerous frameworks within the OpenShift ecosystem.

.Prerequisites

* Identify the deployments for which you want to enable automatic sidecar injection.
* Locate the application's YAML configuration file.

.Procedure

. Open the application's configuration YAML file in an editor.

. Add `sidecar.istio.io/inject` to the configuration YAML with a value of `"true"` as illustrated here:
