= Accepting a private offer

[role="_abstract"]
You can accept private offers from other team members within your Red{nbsp}Hat organization account.

.Procedure
. When you get a private offer for {product-title}, you are provided with a unique URL that is accessible only by a specific AWS account ID that was specified by the seller.
+
[NOTE]
====
Verify that you are logged in using the AWS account that was specified as the buyer. Attempting to access the offer using another AWS account produces a "page not found" error message as shown in Figure 11 in the troubleshooting section below.
====
+
.. You can see the offer selection drop down menu with a regular private offer pre-selected in Figure 1. This type of offer can be accepted only if the {product-title} was not activated before using the public offer or another private offer.

. Optional: you can link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-purchase-orders.html[add your own purchase order (PO) number] to the subscription that is being purchased, so it is included on your subsequent AWS invoices. Also, check the "Additional usage fees" that are charged for any usage above the scope of the "New offer configuration details".
+
[NOTE]
====
Private offers have several available configurations. 

* It is possible that the private offer you are accepting is set up with a fixed future start date. 
* If you do not have another active {product-title} subscription at the time of accepting the private offer, a public offer or an older private offer entitlement, accept the private offer itself and continue with the account linking and cluster deployment steps after the specified service start date. 

You must have an active {product-title} entitlement to complete these steps. Service start dates are always reported in the UTC time zone
====

. Create or upgrade your contract. 
+
.. For private offers accepted by an AWS account that does not have {product-title} activated yet and is creating the first contract for this service, click the *Create contract button*.
+

. If the accepted private offer has a future start date specified, return to the private offer page after the service start date, and click the *Setup your account* button to proceed with the Red{nbsp}Hat and AWS account linking. 
+
[NOTE]
====
With no agreement active, the account linking described below is not triggered, the "Account setup" process can be done only after the "Service start date".

These are always in UTC time zone.
