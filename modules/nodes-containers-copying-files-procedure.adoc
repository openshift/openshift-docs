= Copying files to and from containers

Support for copying local files to or from a container is built into the CLI.

.Prerequisites

When working with `oc rsync`, note the following:

rsync must be installed::
The `oc rsync` command uses the local `rsync` tool if present on the client
machine and the remote container.

If `rsync` is not found locally or in the remote container, a *tar* archive
is created locally and sent to the container where the *tar* utility is used to
extract the files. If *tar* is not available in the remote container, the
copy will fail.

The *tar* copy method does not provide the same functionality as `oc rsync`. For
example, `oc rsync` creates the destination directory if it does not exist and
only sends files that are different between the source and the destination.

[NOTE]
====
In Windows, the `cwRsync` client should be installed and added to the PATH for
use with the `oc rsync` command.

For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsync /home/user/source devpod1234:/src -c user-container
----

* To copy a pod directory to a local directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsync devpod1234:/src /home/user/source
