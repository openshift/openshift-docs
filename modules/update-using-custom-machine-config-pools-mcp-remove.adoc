[id="update-using-custom-machine-config-pools-mcp-remove_{context}"]
= Moving a node to the original machine config pool

In this canary rollout update process, after you have unpaused a custom machine config pool (MCP) and verified that the applications on the nodes associated with that MCP are working as expected, you should move the node back to its original MCP by removing the custom label you added to the node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A node must have a role to be properly functioning in the cluster.
====

To move a node to its original MCP:

////
. Ensure that the nodes have a `worker` label or a label from an MCP that is updated.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node ci-ln-0qv1yp2-f76d1-kl2tq-worker-a-j2ssz node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=
----
+
.Example output if the `worker` label is present:
+
[source,terminal]
----
error: 'node-role.kubernetes.io/worker' already has a value (), and --overwrite is false
----
+
If the node does not have a `worker` label or a label from an updated MCP, add the label.
////

. Remove the custom label from the node.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/<custom-label>-
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node ci-ln-0qv1yp2-f76d1-kl2tq-worker-a-j2ssz node-role.kubernetes.io/workerpool-canary-
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
node/ci-ln-0qv1yp2-f76d1-kl2tq-worker-a-j2ssz labeled
----
+
The MCO moves the nodes back to the original MCP and reconciles the node to the MCP configuration.

The node is removed from the custom MCP and moved back to the original MCP. It can take several minutes to update the machine counts. In this example, one node was moved from the removed `workerpool-canary` MCP to the `worker`MCP.

. Optional: Delete the custom MCP:
