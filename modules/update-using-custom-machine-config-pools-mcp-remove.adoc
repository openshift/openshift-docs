= Moving a node to the original machine config pool

After you update and verify applications on nodes in a custom machine config pool (MCP), move the nodes back to their original MCP by removing the custom label that you added to the nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A node must have a role to be properly functioning in the cluster.
====

.Procedure

////
. Ensure that the nodes have a `worker` label or a label from an MCP that is updated.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node ci-ln-0qv1yp2-f76d1-kl2tq-worker-a-j2ssz node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=
----
+
.Example output if the `worker` label is present
+
[source,terminal]
----
error: 'node-role.kubernetes.io/worker' already has a value (), and --overwrite is false
----
+
If the node does not have a `worker` label or a label from an updated MCP, add the label.
////

. For each node in a custom MCP, remove the custom label from the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/<custom_label>-
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node ci-ln-0qv1yp2-f76d1-kl2tq-worker-a-j2ssz node-role.kubernetes.io/workerpool-canary-
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
node/ci-ln-0qv1yp2-f76d1-kl2tq-worker-a-j2ssz labeled
----
+
The Machine Config Operator moves the nodes back to the original MCP and reconciles the node to the MCP configuration.

. To ensure that node has been removed from the custom MCP, view the list of MCPs in the cluster and their current state by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mcp

When the node is removed from the custom MCP and moved back to the original MCP, it can take several minutes to update the machine counts. In this example, one node was moved from the removed `workerpool-canary` MCP to the `worker` MCP.

. Optional: Delete the custom MCP by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete mcp <mcp_name>
