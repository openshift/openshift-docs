= Explanation of fields in the CertManager custom resource

You can use the `CertManager` custom resource (CR) to configure the following core components of the {cert-manager-operator}:

* Cert-manager controller: You can use the `spec.controllerConfig` field to configure the cert‑manager controller pod.
* Webhook: You can use the `spec.webhookConfig` field to configure the webhook pod, which handles validation and mutation requests.
* CA injector: You can use the `spec.cainjectorConfig` field to configure the CA injector pod.

== Overridable arguments for the cert-manager components

You can configure the overridable arguments for the cert-manager components in the `spec.controllerConfig`, `spec.webhookConfig`, and `spec.cainjectorConfig` sections in the `CertManager` CR.

The following table describes the overridable arguments for the cert-manager components:

.Overridable arguments the cert-manager components
[cols=".^5a,.^2,.^4a",options="header"]
|====

|Argument|Component|Description

|`--dns01-recursive-nameservers=<server_address>`
|Controller
|Provide a comma-separated list of nameservers to query for the DNS-01 self check. The nameservers can be specified either as `<host>:<port>`, for example, `1.1.1.1:53`, or use DNS over HTTPS (DoH), for example, `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query`.

[NOTE]
====
DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is supported starting only from {cert-manager-operator} version 1.13.0 and later.
====

|`--dns01-recursive-nameservers-only`
|Controller
|Specify to only use recursive nameservers instead of checking the authoritative nameservers associated with that domain.

|`--acme-http01-solver-nameservers=<host>:<port>`
|Controller
|Provide a comma-separated list of `<host>:<port>` nameservers to query for the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) HTTP01 self check. For example, `--acme-http01-solver-nameservers=1.1.1.1:53`.

|`--metrics-listen-address=<host>:<port>`
|Controller
|Specify the host and port for the metrics endpoint. The default value is `--metrics-listen-address=0.0.0.0:9402`.

|`--issuer-ambient-credentials`
|Controller
|You can use this argument to configure an ACME Issuer to solve DNS-01 challenges by using ambient credentials.

|`--enable-certificate-owner-ref`
|Controller
|This argument sets the certificate resource as an owner of the secret where the TLS certificate is stored. For more information, see "Deleting a TLS secret automatically upon Certificate removal".

|`--acme-http01-solver-resource-limits-cpu`
|Controller
|Defines the maximum CPU limit for ACME HTTP‑01 solver pods. The default value is `100m`.

|`--acme-http01-solver-resource-limits-memory`
|Controller
|Defines the maximum memory limit for ACME HTTP‑01 solver pods. The default value is `64Mi`.

|`--acme-http01-solver-resource-request-cpu`
|Controller
|Defines the minimum CPU request for ACME HTTP‑01 solver pods. The default value is `10m`.

|`--acme-http01-solver-resource-request-memory`
|Controller
|Defines the minimum memory request for ACME HTTP‑01 solver pods. The default value is `64Mi`.

|`--v=<verbosity_level>`
|Controller, Webhook, CA injector
|Specify the log level verbosity to determine the verbosity of log messages.

|Environment variable|Description

|`HTTP_PROXY`
|Proxy server for outgoing HTTP requests.

|`HTTPS_PROXY`
|Proxy server for outgoing HTTPS requests.

|`NO_PROXY`
|Comma‑separated list of hosts that bypass the proxy.
