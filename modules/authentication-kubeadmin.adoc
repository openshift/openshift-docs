= The kubeadmin user

{product-title} creates a cluster administrator, `kubeadmin`, after the
installation process completes.

This user has the `cluster-admin` role automatically applied and is treated
as the root user for the cluster. The password is dynamically generated
and unique to your {product-title} environment. After installation
completes the password is provided in the installation program's output.
For example:

[source,terminal]
----

INFO The cluster is ready when 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p <provided>' succeeds (wait a few minutes).
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.demo1.openshift4-beta-abcorp.com
INFO Login to the console with user: kubeadmin, password: <provided>
