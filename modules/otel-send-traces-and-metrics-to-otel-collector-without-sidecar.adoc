[id="sending-traces-and-metrics-to-otel-collector-without-sidecar_{context}"]
= Sending traces and metrics to the OpenTelemetry Collector without sidecar injection

You can set up sending telemetry data to an OpenTelemetry Collector instance without sidecar injection, which involves manually setting several environment variables.

.Prerequisites

* The {TempoName} is installed, and a TempoStack instance is deployed.

* You have access to the cluster through the web console or the {oc-first}:

** You are logged in to the web console as a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

** An active {oc-first} session by a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

** For {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Create a project for an OpenTelemetry Collector instance.
