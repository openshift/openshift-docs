= Resource guidelines

Your quota should meet the following requirements to run the {product-title} installer in OpenStack:

.Recommended resources for a default OpenShift cluster on OpenStack
[options="header"]
|================================
|Resource              | Value
|Floating IP addresses | 2
|Routers               | 1
|Subnets               | 1
|RAM                   | 112 GB
|vCPUs                 | 28
|Volume storage        | 175 GB
|Instances             | 7
|Security groups       | 3
|Security group rules  | 60
|Swift containers      | 2
|Swift objects         | 1
|Swift available space | 10 MB or more
|================================

[NOTE]
Swift space requirements vary depending on the size of the bootstrap Ignition file and image registry.

A cluster may function with fewer than recommended resources, but its performance is not guaranteed.

[NOTE]
By default, your security group and security group rule quotas may be low. If you encounter problems, run `openstack quota set --secgroups 3 --secgroup-rules 60 <project>` to increase them.

A {product-title} deployment comprises control plane machines, compute machines, and a bootstrap machine.

== Control plane and compute machines

By default, the {product-title} installer stands up three control plane and compute machines.

Each machine requires:

* An instance from the OpenStack quota
* A port from the OpenStack quota
* A flavor with at least 16 GB memory, 4 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space

[TIP]
Compute machines host the applications that you run on {product-title}; aim to run as many as you can.

// == Compute machines

// By default, the {product-title} installer stands up three compute machines.

// What about instances and ports?
// Each worker node requires:

// * An instance from the OpenStack quota
// * A port from the OpenStack quota
// * A flavor with at least 16 GB memory, 4 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space

// Each compute machine requires a flavor with at least 8 GB memory, 2 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space.


== Bootstrap machine

At installation, a bootstrap machine is temporarily provisioned to stand up the control plane. After the production control plane is ready, the bootstrap machine is deprovisioned.

The bootstrap machine requires:

* An instance from the OpenStack quota
* A port from the OpenStack quota
* A flavor with at least 16 GB memory, 4 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space

[NOTE]
The installer cannot pass certificate authority bundles to Ignition on control plane machines. Therefore, the bootstrap machine cannot retrieve Ignition configurations from Swift if your endpoint uses self-signed certificates.
