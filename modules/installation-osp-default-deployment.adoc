= Resource guidelines for installing {product-title} on {rh-openstack}

To support an {product-title} installation, your {rh-openstack-first} quota must meet the following requirements:

.Recommended resources for a default {product-title} cluster on {rh-openstack}
[options="header"]
|======================================
|Resource              | Value
|Floating IP addresses | 3
|Ports                 | 15
|Routers               | 1
|Subnets               | 1
|RAM                   | 88 GB
|vCPUs                 | 22
|Volume storage        | 275 GB
|Instances             | 7
|Security groups       | 3
|Security group rules  | 60
|======================================

A cluster might function with fewer than recommended resources, but its performance is not guaranteed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If {rh-openstack} object storage (Swift) is available and operated by a user account with the `swiftoperator` role, it is used as the default backend for the {product-title} image registry. In this case, the volume storage requirement is 175 GB. Swift space requirements vary depending on the size of the image registry.
====

[NOTE]
By default, your security group and security group rule quotas might be low. If you encounter problems, run `openstack quota set --secgroups 3 --secgroup-rules 60 <project>` as an administrator to increase them.

An {product-title} deployment comprises control plane machines, compute machines, and a bootstrap machine.
