= Understanding swap memory and QOS

You can disable swap by default on your nodes to preserve quality of
service (QOS) guarantees. Otherwise, physical resources on a node can oversubscribe,
affecting the resource guarantees the Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod
placement.

For example, if two guaranteed pods have reached their memory limit, each
container could start using swap memory. Eventually, if there is not enough swap
space, processes in the pods can be terminated due to the system being
oversubscribed.

Failing to disable swap results in nodes not recognizing that they are
experiencing *MemoryPressure*, resulting in pods not receiving the memory they
made in their scheduling request. As a result, additional pods are placed on the
node to further increase memory pressure, ultimately increasing your risk of
experiencing a system out of memory (OOM) event.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If swap is enabled, any out-of-resource handling eviction thresholds for available memory will not work as
expected. Take advantage of out-of-resource handling to allow pods to be evicted
from a node when it is under memory pressure, and rescheduled on an alternative
node that has no such pressure.
