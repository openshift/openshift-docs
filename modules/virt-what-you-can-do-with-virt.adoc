= What you can do with {VirtProductName}

{VirtProductName} is an add-on to {product-title} that allows you to run and manage
 virtual machine workloads alongside container workloads.

{VirtProductName} adds new objects into your {product-title} cluster via Kubernetes
custom resources to enable virtualization tasks. These tasks include:

* Creating and managing Linux and Windows virtual machines
* Connecting to virtual machines through a variety of consoles and CLI tools
* Importing and cloning existing virtual machines
* Managing network interface controllers and storage disks attached to virtual machines
* Live migrating virtual machines between nodes

An enhanced web console provides a graphical portal to manage these virtualized
resources alongside the {product-title} cluster containers and infrastructure.

You can use {VirtProductName} with either the xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#learn-about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes] or the xref:../networking/openshift_sdn/about-openshift-sdn.adoc#about-openshift-sdn[OpenShiftSDN] network provider.
