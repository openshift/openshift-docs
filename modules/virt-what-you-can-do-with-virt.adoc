You can use it to manage virtual machines (VMs) exclusively or alongside container workloads.

[NOTE]
====
If you have a {ove-first} subscription, you can run unlimited VMs on subscribed hosts, but you cannot run application instances in containers. For more information, see the subscription guide section about link:https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/self-managed-openshift-subscription-guide#section-8[{ove-first} and related products].

{VirtProductName} adds new objects into your {product-title} cluster by using Kubernetes custom resources to enable virtualization tasks. These tasks include:

* Creating and managing Linux and Windows VMs
* Running pod and VM workloads alongside each other in a cluster
* Connecting to VMs through a variety of consoles and CLI tools
* Importing and cloning existing VMs
* Managing network interface controllers and storage disks attached to VMs
* Live migrating VMs between nodes

You can manage your cluster and virtualization resources by using the *Virtualization* perspective of the {product-title} web console, and by using the {oc-first}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For supported and unsupported OVN-Kubernetes network plugin use cases, see "OVN-Kubernetes purpose".

{VirtProductName} is designed and tested to work well with {rh-storage-first} features.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you deploy {VirtProductName} with {rh-storage}, you must create a dedicated storage class for Windows virtual machine disks. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6978371[Optimizing ODF PersistentVolumes for Windows VMs] for details.

// A line about support for OVN and OpenShiftSDN network providers has been moved to the `about-virt` assembly due to xrefs.
// If you are re-using this module, you might also want to include that line in your assembly.
