= About using multiple networks with the OVN-K CNI

[role="_abstract"]
You can define more than one _additional network_ for your cluster. This gives you flexibility when you configure pods that deliver network functionality, such as switching or routing.

By default, OVN-Kubernetes serves as the Container Network Interface (CNI) of an {product-title} cluster. This network interface is what administrators use to create default networks. During cluster installation, you configure your _default_ pod network. The default network handles all ordinary network traffic for the cluster.

{product-title} uses the Multus CNI plugin to allow chaining of CNI plugins. You can define an _additional network_ based on the available CNI plugins and attach one or more of these networks to your pods.
