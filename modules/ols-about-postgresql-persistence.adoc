= About {ols-short} and PostgreSQL persistence 

Using PostgreSQL persistence, you can save data, such as {ols-long} conversation history or quota usage, to a PostgreSQL database so that the data is retained in persistent volume. With PostgreSQL persistence, the data persists if the PostgreSQL pod restarts or is rescheduled in your {ocp-product-title} installation. 

:FeatureName: PostgreSQL persistence
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

PostgreSQL persistence is disabled by default. To enable the functionality, add the  `spec.ols.storage` specification to the `OLSConfig` custom resource (CR).
