= Creating a drop-in file for the default CRI-O capabilities

You can change some of the settings associated with the {product-title} CRI-O runtime for the nodes associated with a specific machine config pool (MCP). By using a controller custom resource (CR), you set the configuration values and add a label to match the MCP. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) then rebuilds the `crio.conf` and `default.conf` configuration files on the associated nodes with the updated values.

Earlier versions of {product-title} included specific machine configs by default. If you updated to a later version of {product-title}, those machine configs were retained to ensure that clusters running on the same {product-title} version have the same machine configs.

You can create multiple `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CRs, as needed, with a limit of 10 per cluster. For the first `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR, the MCO creates a machine config appended with `containerruntime`. With each subsequent CR, the controller creates a `containerruntime` machine config with a numeric suffix. For example, if you have a `containerruntime` machine config with a `-2` suffix, the next `containerruntime` machine config is appended with `-3`.

If you want to delete the machine configs, delete them in reverse order to avoid exceeding the limit. For example, delete the `containerruntime-3` machine config before you delete the `containerruntime-2` machine config.

[NOTE]
====
If you have a machine config with a `containerruntime-9` suffix and you create another `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CR, a new machine config is not created, even if there are fewer than 10 `containerruntime` machine configs.
