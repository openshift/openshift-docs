= Overview of the Operator Lifecycle Manager

In {product-title} {product-version}, the _Operator Lifecycle Manager_ (OLM) helps users
install, update, and manage the lifecycle of all Operators and their associated
services running across their clusters. It is part of the
link:https://github.com/operator-framework[Operator Framework],
an open source toolkit designed to manage Kubernetes native applications
(Operators) in an effective, automated, and scalable way.

The OLM runs by default in {product-title} {product-version}, which aids cluster
administrators in installing, upgrading, and granting access to Operators
running on their cluster. The {product-title} web console provides management
screens for cluster administrators to install Operators, as well as grant
specific projects access to use the catalog of Operators available on the
cluster.

For developers, a self-service experience allows provisioning and configuring
instances of databases, monitoring, and big data services without having to be
subject matter experts, because the Operator has that knowledge baked into it.
