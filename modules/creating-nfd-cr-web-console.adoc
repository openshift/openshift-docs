= Creating a NodeFeatureDiscovery CR by using the web console

As a cluster administrator, you can create a `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR by using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster
* You logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You installed the NFD Operator.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.
. In the *Node Feature Discovery* section, under *Provided APIs*, click *Create instance*.
. Edit the values of the `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR.
. Click *Create*.

[NOTE]
====
Starting with version 4.12, the `operand.image` field in the `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR is mandatory. If the NFD Operator is deployed by using {olm-first}, OLM automatically sets the `operand.image` field. If you create the `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR by using the {product-title} CLI or the {product-title} web console, you must set the `operand.image` field explicitly.
