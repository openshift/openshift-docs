= Using {ibm-cloud-title} DNS Services for DNS resolution

The installation program uses {ibm-cloud-name} DNS Services to configure cluster DNS resolution and provide name lookup for a private cluster.

You configure DNS resolution by creating a DNS services instance for the cluster, and then adding a DNS zone to the DNS Services instance. Ensure that the zone is authoritative for the domain. You can do this using a root domain or subdomain.

[NOTE]
====
{ibm-cloud-name} does not support IPv6, so dual stack or IPv6 environments are not possible.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the link:https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cli[{ibm-cloud-name} CLI].
* You have an existing domain and registrar. For more information, see the {ibm-name} link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dns?topic=dns-getting-started[documentation].

.Procedure

. Create a DNS Services instance to use with your cluster:

.. Install the DNS Services plugin by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud plugin install cloud-dns-services
----

.. Create the DNS Services instance by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud dns instance-create <instance-name> standard-dns <1>
----
<1> At a minimum, a `Standard` plan is required for DNS Services to manage the cluster subdomain and its DNS records.

. Create a DNS zone for the DNS Services instance:

.. Set the target operating DNS Services instance by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud dns instance-target <instance-name>
----

.. Add the DNS zone to the DNS Services instance by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud dns zone-create <zone-name> <1>
----
<1> The fully qualified zone name. You can use either the root domain or subdomain value as the zone name, depending on which you plan to configure. A root domain uses the form `openshiftcorp.com`. A subdomain uses the form `clusters.openshiftcorp.com`.

. Record the name of the DNS zone you have created. As part of the installation process, you must update the `install-config.yaml` file before deploying the cluster. Use the name of the DNS zone as the value for the `baseDomain` parameter.

[NOTE]
====
You do not have to manage permitted networks or configure an "A" DNS resource record. As required, the installation program configures these resources automatically.
