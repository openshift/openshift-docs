= Provided APIs annotation

Information about what `GroupVersionKinds` (GVKs) are provided by an
OperatorGroup are shown in an `olm.providedAPIs` annotation. The annotation's
value is a string consisting of `<kind>.<version>.<group>` delimited with
commas. The GVKs of CRDs and APIServices provided by all active member CSVs of
an OperatorGroup are included.

Review the following example of an OperatorGroup with a single active member CSV
that provides the PackageManifest resource:
