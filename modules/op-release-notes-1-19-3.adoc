= Release notes for {pipelines-title} 1.19.3

With this update, {pipelines-title} General Availability (GA) 1.19.3 is available on {OCP} 4.15 and later versions.

[id="fixed-issues-1-19-3_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Before this update, upgrading to version 1.19.0 of the {pipelines-title} Operator could cause the Operator pod to crash. This issue was caused by an empty pointer reference at startup when the `spec.tektonpruner.disabled` field in the `tektonconfig` custom resource (CR) was `nil`. With this update, the issue is fixed.

* Before this update, the `tekton_pipelines_controller_running_pipelineruns` metric included pending `PipelineRun` objects in its count, causing inaccurate reporting. With this update, the metric counts only actively running `PipelineRun` objects, excluding those in a pending state, improving monitoring accuracy.

* Before this update, the default {tekton-results} TLS secret was mistakenly deleted during pre-upgrade steps on the {OCP}. This deletion caused the {tekton-results} API to fail during the upgrade process. With this update, {pipelines-shortname} prevents the deletion of the TLS secret, ensuring the {tekton-results} API remains operational throughout the upgrade.

* Before this update, a recent regression caused the git resolver to bypass the `Proxy` custom-configured public key infrastructure (PKI), which could prevent it from resolving references to self-hosted Git providers. With this update, the git resolver trusts the full CA bundle configured in the `Proxy`, including any certificates in your custom PKI, restoring secure connectivity to self-hosted Git providers.

* Before this update, if a `TaskRun` object failed to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) due to a `ResourceQuota` conflict, such as a concurrent update or exhausted quota, the `TaskRun` was immediately marked as `Failed`. With this update, when a `TaskRun` encounters a PVC creation failure caused by a `ResourceQuota` issue, it remains in a pending state and retries PVC creation instead of failing immediately.
