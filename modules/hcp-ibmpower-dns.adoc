[id="hcp-ibmpower-dns_{context}"]
= DNS configuration for {hcp} on {ibm-power-title}

The API server for the hosted cluster is exposed. A DNS entry must exist for the `api.<hosted_cluster_name>.<basedomain>` entry that points to the destination where the API server is reachable.

The DNS entry can be as simple as a record that points to one of the nodes in the managed cluster that is running the hosted control plane.

The entry can also point to a load balancer that is deployed to redirect incoming traffic to the ingress pods.

See the following example of a DNS configuration:

<1> The record refers to the IP address of the API load balancer that handles ingress and egress traffic for {hcp}.

For {ibm-power-title}, add IP addresses that correspond to the IP address of the agent.
