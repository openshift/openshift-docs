= Changing the update channel for an Operator

The subscription of an installed Operator specifies an update channel, which is used to track and receive updates for the Operator. To upgrade the Operator to start tracking and receiving updates from a newer channel, you can change the update channel in the subscription.

The names of update channels in a subscription can differ between Operators, but the naming scheme should follow a common convention within a given Operator. For example, channel names might follow a minor release update stream for the application provided by the Operator (`1.2`, `1.3`) or a release frequency (`stable`, `fast`).

[NOTE]
====
Installed Operators cannot change to a channel that is older than the current channel.
====

If the approval strategy in the subscription is set to *Automatic*, the upgrade process initiates as soon as a new Operator version is available in the selected channel. If the approval strategy is set to *Manual*, you must manually approve pending upgrades.

.Prerequisites

* An Operator previously installed using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Operators -> Installed Operators*.

. Click the name of the Operator you want to change the update channel for.

. Click the *Subscription* tab.

. Click the name of the update channel under *Channel*.

. Click the newer update channel that you want to change to, then click *Save*.

. For subscriptions with an *Automatic* approval strategy, the upgrade begins automatically. Navigate back to the *Operators -> Installed Operators* page to monitor the progress of the upgrade. When complete, the status changes to *Succeeded* and *Up to date*.
+
For subscriptions with a *Manual* approval strategy, you can manually approve the upgrade from the *Subscription* tab.
