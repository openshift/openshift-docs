= Changing the update channel for an Operator

The Subscription of an installed Operator specifies an update channel, which is
used to track and receive updates for the Operator. To upgrade the Operator to
start tracking and receiving updates from a newer channel, you can change the
update channel in the Subscription.

The names of update channels in a Subscription can differ between Operators, but
should follow a common convention within a given Operator. Some naming
schemes include:

- `4.3`, `4,4`, `4.5`
- `stable-4.3`, `stable-4.4`, `stable-4.5`
- `alpha`, `beta`, `stable`, `latest`

Alternatively, the channel names might follow the version numbers of the
application provided by the Operator.

[NOTE]
====
Installed Operators cannot change to a channel that is older than the current
channel.
====

If the approval strategy in the subscription is set to *Automatic*, the upgrade process initiates as soon as a new Operator version is available in the selected channel. If the approval strategy is set to *Manual*, you must manually approve pending upgrades.

.Prerequisites

* An Operator previously installed using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the {product-title} web console, navigate
to *Operators -> Installed Operators*.

. Click the name of the Operator you want to change the update channel for.

. Click the *Subscription* tab.

. Click the name of the update channel under *Channel*.

. Click the newer update channel that you want to change to, then click *Save*.

. For Subscriptions with an *Automatic* approval strategy, the upgrade begins automatically. Navigate back to the *Operators -> Installed Operators*
page to monitor the progress of the upgrade. When complete, the status changes
to *Succeeded* and *Up to date*.
+
For Subscriptions with a *Manual* approval strategy, you can manually approve
the upgrade from the Subscription tab.
