= Changing the update channel for an Operator

The Subscription of an installed Operator specifies an update channel, which is
used to track and receive updates for the Operator. To upgrade the Operator to
start tracking and receiving updates from a newer channel, you can change the
update channel in the Subscription.

The names of update channels in a Subscription can differ between Operators, but
should follow a common convention within a given Operator. Some naming
schemes include:

- `4.3`, `4,4`, `4.5`
- `stable-4.3`, `stable-4.4`, `stable-4.5`
- `alpha`, `beta`, `stable`, `latest`

Alternatively, the channel names might follow the version numbers of the
application provided by the Operator.

[NOTE]
====
Installed Operators cannot change to a channel that is older than the current
channel.
====

If the approval strategy in the Subscription is set to *Automatic*, the upgrade
process initiates immediately. If the approval strategy is set to *Manual*, you
must manually approve the pending upgrade.

.Prerequisites

* An Operator previously installed using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

.Procedure

page to monitor the progress of the upgrade. When complete, the status changes
to *Succeeded* and *Up to date*.

the upgrade from the Subscription tab.
