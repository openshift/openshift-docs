= Ensure high disk performance with HyperPAV on z/VM

DASD and ECKD devices are commonly used disk types in IBM Z environments. In a typical {product-title} setup in z/VM environments, DASD disks are commonly used to support the local storage for the nodes. You can set up HyperPAV alias devices to provide more throughput and overall better I/O performance for the DASD disks that support the z/VM guests.  

Using HyperPAV for the local storage devices leads to a significant performance benefit. However, you must be aware that there is a trade-off between throughput and CPU costs.

== Use the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to activate HyperPAV aliases in nodes using z/VM full-pack minidisks

For z/VM-based {product-title} setups that use full-pack minidisks, you can leverage the advantage of MCO profiles by activating HyperPAV aliases in all of the nodes. You must add YAML configurations for both control plane and compute nodes. 

.Procedure

. Copy the following MCO sample profile into a YAML file for the control plane node. For example, `05-master-kernelarg-hpav.yaml`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat 05-master-kernelarg-hpav.yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
  name: 05-master-kernelarg-hpav
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.1.0
  kernelArguments:
    - rd.dasd=800-805
----

. Copy the following MCO sample profile into a YAML file for the compute node. For example, `05-worker-kernelarg-hpav.yaml`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat 05-worker-kernelarg-hpav.yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: 05-worker-kernelarg-hpav
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.1.0
  kernelArguments:
    - rd.dasd=800-805
----

+
[NOTE]
====
You must modify the `rd.dasd` arguments to fit the device IDs.
====

. Create the MCO profiles:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f 05-master-kernelarg-hpav.yaml
----

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f 05-worker-kernelarg-hpav.yaml
----

. To deactivate, enter:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f 05-master-kernelarg-hpav.yaml
----

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f 05-worker-kernelarg-hpav.yaml
