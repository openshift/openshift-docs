= Configuring the Image Registry Operator for local caching of images

{product-title} manages image caching using a local registry. In edge computing use cases, clusters are often subject to bandwidth restrictions when communicating with centralized image registries, which might result in long image download times.

Long download times are unavoidable during initial deployment. Over time, there is a risk that CRI-O will erase the `/var/lib/containers/storage` directory in the case of an unexpected shutdown.
To address long image download times, you can create a local image registry on remote managed clusters using GitOps ZTP. This is useful in Edge computing scenarios where clusters are deployed at the far edge of the network.

Before you can set up the local image registry with GitOps ZTP, you need to configure disk partitioning in the `SiteConfig` CR that you use to install the remote managed cluster. After installation, you configure the local image registry using a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR. Then, the ZTP pipeline creates Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) CRs and patches the `imageregistry` configuration.

[NOTE]
====
The local image registry can only be used for user application images and cannot be used for the {product-title} or Operator Lifecycle Manager operator images.
