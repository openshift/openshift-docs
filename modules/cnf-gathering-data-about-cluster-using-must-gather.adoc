= Gathering data about your cluster for the PPC

The Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool requires `must-gather` data. As a cluster administrator, run the `must-gather` command to capture information about your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You identified a target MCP that you want to configure with a performance profile.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.

. Collect cluster information by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather
----
+
The command creates a folder with the `must-gather` data in your local directory with a naming format similar to the following: `must-gather.local.1971646453781853027`.

. Optional: Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz <must_gather_folder> <1>
----
<1> Replace with the name of the `must-gather` data folder.
+
[NOTE]
====
Compressed output is required if you are running the Performance Profile Creator wrapper script.
