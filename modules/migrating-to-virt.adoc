= Migrating to {VirtProductName}

To migrate virtual machines from an external provider such as {vmw-first}, {rh-openstack-first}, Red Hat Virtualization, or another {product-title} cluster, use the {mtv-first}. You can also migrate Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) files created by {vmw-full}.

[NOTE]
====
{mtv-full} is not part of {VirtProductName} and requires separate installation. For this reason, all links in this procedure lead outside of {VirtProductName} documentation.
