= Modifying trust policy when installing into a shared VPC
If you install your cluster using a shared VPC, you can use the `Passthrough` or `Manual` credentials mode. You must add the IAM role used to install the cluster as a principal in the trust policy of the account that owns the VPC.

If you use `Passthrough` mode, add the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the account that creates the cluster, such as `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/clustercreator`, to the trust policy as a principal.

If you use `Manual` mode, add the ARN of the account that creates the cluster as well as the ARN of the ingress operator role in the cluster owner account, such as `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/<cluster-name>-openshift-ingress-operator-cloud-credentials`, to the trust policy as principals.

You must add the following actions to the policy:
