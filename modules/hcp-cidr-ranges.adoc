= CIDR ranges for {hcp}

[role="_abstract"]
To successfully deploy {hcp} on {product-title}, define the network environment by using specific Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) subnet ranges. Establishing these nonoverlapping ranges ensures reliable communication between cluster components and prevents internal IP address conflicts.

For deploying {hcp} on {product-title}, use the following required Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) subnet ranges:

* `v4InternalSubnet`: 100.65.0.0/16 (OVN-Kubernetes)
* `clusterNetwork`: 10.132.0.0/14 (pod network)
* `serviceNetwork`: 172.31.0.0/16
