= Cluster Operators

In {product-title}, all cluster functions are divided into a series of default _cluster Operators_. Cluster Operators manage a particular area of cluster functionality, such as cluster-wide application logging, management of the Kubernetes control plane, or the machine provisioning system.

Cluster Operators are represented by a `ClusterOperator` object, which

cluster administrators
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
administrators with the `dedicated-admin` role
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
can view in the {product-title} web console from the *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* page. Each cluster Operator provides a simple API for determining cluster functionality. The Operator hides the details of managing the lifecycle of that component. Operators can manage a single component or tens of components, but the end goal is always to reduce operational burden by automating common actions.
