= Configuring huge pages

Nodes must pre-allocate huge pages used in an {product-title} cluster. Use the
Performance Addon Operator to allocate huge pages on a specific node.

{product-title} provides a method for creating and allocating huge pages.
Performance Addon Operator provides an easier method for doing this using the
PerformanceProfile.

For example, in the `hugepages` `pages` section of the PerformanceProfile,
you can specify multiple blocks of `size`, `count`, and, optionally, `node`:

----
hugepages:
   defaultHugepagesSize: "1Gi"
   pages:
   - size:  "1Gi"
     count:  4
     node:  0 <1>
----

<1> `node` is the NUMA node in which the huge pages are allocated. If you omit `node`, the pages are evenly spread across all NUMA nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Wait for the relevant machineconfigpool status that indicates the update is finished.
====

These are the only configuration steps you need to do to allocate huge pages.

.Verification steps

* To verify the configuration, see the `/proc/meminfo` file on the node:
+
----
$ oc debug node/ip-10-0-141-105.ec2.internal
----
+
----
# grep -i huge /proc/meminfo
----
+

* Use `oc describe` to report the new size:

$ oc describe node worker-0.ocp4poc.example.com | grep -i huge
