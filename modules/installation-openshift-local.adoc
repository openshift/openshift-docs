= OpenShift Local overview

OpenShift Local supports rapid application development to get started building {product-title} clusters. OpenShift Local is designed to run on a local computer to simplify setup and testing, and to emulate the cloud development environment locally with all of the tools needed to develop container-based applications.

Regardless of the programming language you use, OpenShift Local hosts your application and brings a minimal, preconfigured Red Hat {product-title} cluster to your local PC without the need for a server-based infrastructure.

On a hosted environment, OpenShift Local can create microservices, convert them into images, and run them in Kubernetes-hosted containers directly on your laptop or desktop running Linux, macOS, or Windows 10 or later.
