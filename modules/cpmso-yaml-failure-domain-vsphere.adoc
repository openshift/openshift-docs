= Sample {vmw-full} failure domain configuration

On {vmw-full} infrastructure, the cluster-wide infrastructure Custom Resource Definition (CRD), `infrastructures.config.openshift.io`, defines failure domains for your cluster.
The `providerSpec` in the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` custom resource (CR) specifies names for failure domains that the control plane machine set uses to ensure control plane nodes are deployed to the appropriate failure domain.
A failure domain is an infrastructure resource made up of a control plane machine set, a vCenter datacenter, vCenter datastore, and a network.

By using a failure domain resource, you can use a control plane machine set to deploy control plane machines on  separate clusters or datacenters.
A control plane machine set also balances control plane machines across defined failure domains to provide fault tolerance capabilities to your infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
If you modify the `ProviderSpec` configuration in the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` CR, the control plane machine set updates all control plane machines deployed on the primary infrastructure and each failure domain infrastructure.

<1> A failure domain defines the vCenter location for {product-title} cluster nodes.
<2> Defines failure domains by name for the control plane machine set.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, the `vsphere.name` field is the only supported failure domain field that you can specify in the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` CR.
Each `failureDomains.platform.vsphere.name` field value in the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` CR must match the corresponding value defined in the `failureDomains.name` field of the cluster-wide infrastructure CRD.

You can find the value of the `failureDomains.name` field by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get infrastructure cluster -o=jsonpath={.spec.platformSpec.vsphere.failureDomains[0].name
