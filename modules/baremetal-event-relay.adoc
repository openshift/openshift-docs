== Purpose
The OpenShift {redfish-operator} manages the life-cycle of the Bare Metal Event Relay. The Bare Metal Event Relay enables you to configure the types of cluster event that are monitored using Redfish hardware events.

== Configuration objects
You can use this command to edit the configuration after installation: for example, the webhook port.
You can edit configuration objects with:

[source,terminal]
