= Provisioning

Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be
mounted as a volume in {product-title}. To provision NFS volumes,
a list of NFS servers and export paths are all that is required.

.Procedure

. Create an object definition for the PV:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0001 <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi <2>
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce <3>
  nfs: <4>
    path: /tmp <5>
    server: 172.17.0.2 <6>
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain <7>
----
<1> The name of the volume. This is the PV identity in various `oc <command>
pod` commands.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> Though this appears to be related to controlling access to the volume,
it is actually used similarly to labels and used to match a PVC to a PV.
Currently, no access rules are enforced based on the `accessModes`.
<4> The volume type being used, in this case the `nfs` plug-in.
<5> The path that is exported by the NFS server.
<6> The hostname or IP address of the NFS server.
<7> The reclaim policy for the PV. This defines what happens to a volume
when released.
+
[NOTE]
====
Each NFS volume must be mountable by all schedulable nodes in the cluster.

. Verify that the PV was created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pv
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     LABELS    CAPACITY     ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM  REASON    AGE
pv0001   <none>    5Gi          RWO           Available                    31s
----

. Create a persistent volume claim that binds to the new PV:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: nfs-claim1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce <1>
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi <2>
  volumeName: pv0001
  storageClassName: ""
----
<1> The access modes do not enforce security, but rather act as labels to match a PV to a PVC.
<2> This claim looks for PVs offering *5Gi* or greater capacity.

. Verify that the persistent volume claim was created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pvc
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME         STATUS   VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
nfs-claim1   Bound    pv0001   5Gi        RWO                           2m
