== Known Issues for xPaaS Images

These are the current known issues along with any known workarounds.

*JWS*

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-57[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-57]: Tomcat's access log valve logs to file in container instead of
stdout
+
Due to this issue, the logging data is not available for the central logging
facility. To work around this issue, use the `oc exec` command to get the
contents of the log file.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-153[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-153]: `mvn clean` in JWS STI can fail
+
It is not possible to clean up after a build in JWS STI because the Maven
command `mvn clean` fails. This command fails due to Maven not being able to
build the object model during startup.
+
To work around this issue, add Red Hat and JBoss repositories into the
*_pom.xml_* file of the application if the application uses dependencies from
there.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-156[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-156]: Datasource realm configuration is incorrect for JWS
+
It is not possible to do correct JNDI lookup for datasources in the current JWS
image if an invalid combination of datasource and realm properties is defined.
If a datasource is configured in the *_context.xml_* file and a realm in the
*_server.xml_* file, then the *_server.xml_* file's `*localDataSource*` property
should be set to *true*.

*EAP*

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-61[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-61]: JPA application fails to start when the database is not available
+
JPA applications fail to deploy in the EAP OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 image if an
underlying database instance that the EAP instance relies on is not available at
the start of the deployment. The EAP application tries to contact the database
for initialization, but because it is not available, the server starts but the
application fails to deploy.
+
There are no known workarounds available at this stage for this issue.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-158[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-158]: Continuous HornetQ errors after scale down "Failed to create netty
connection"
+
In the EAP image, an application not using messaging complains about messaging
errors related to HornetQ when being scaled.
+
Since there are no configuration options to disable messaging to work around
this issue, simply include the *_standalone-openshift.xml_* file within the
source of the image and remove or alter the following lines related to
messaging:
+
----
Line 18:

<!-- ##MESSAGING_EXTENSION## -->

Line 318:

<!-- ##MESSAGING_SUBSYSTEM## -->
----

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-161[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-161]:
EAP pod serving requests before it joins cluster, some sessions reset after
failure
+
In a distributed web application deployed on an EAP image, a new container
starts serving requests before it joins the cluster.
+
There are no known workarounds available at this stage for this issue.

*EAP and JWS*

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-159[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-159]: Database pool configurations should contain validation SQL setting
+
In both the EAP and JWS images, when restarting a crashed database instance, the
connection pools contain stale connections.
+
To work around this issue, restart all instances in case of a database failure.

*A-MQ*

There are no known issues in the A-MQ image.

[[ose-3-0-1-0]]

=== OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.1.0

OpenShift Enterprise release 3.0.1.0
(https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver=3.0.0.0/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2015:1540[RHBA-2015:1540])
is now available. Ensure that you follow the instructions on
xref:../install_config/upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[upgrading your OpenShift cluster] properly,
including steps specific to this release.

This release includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:

*Backwards Compatibility*

.API
* The `pods/exec` endpoint is being moved to `POST` instead of `GET`. For
backwards compatibility, `GET` continues to be supported. Clients will try to
use `POST`, and if that fails, will try to use `GET`. If you have an existing
deployment, the default policy will need to be updated prior to 1.1.0. See
https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/3717[Issue #3717] for more
information.
* The `*hostDir*` volume type has been renamed `*hostPath*` in all `*Pod*` and
`*PodTemplate*` objects.
* `*Pod*`: The `*serviceAccount*` field changed to `*serviceAccountName*`.
OpenShift will continue to accept and output both fields;
`*serviceAccountName*` takes precedence.
* `*Pod*`: The `*host*` field changed to `*nodeName*`. OpenShift will continue
to accept and output both fields; `*nodeName*` takes precedence.
* `*Service*`: The `*portalIP*` field changed to `*clusterIP*`. OpenShift will
continue to accept and output both fields; `*clusterIP*` takes precedence.
* `*Service*`: The protocol for a port under a `*Service*`, `*Endpoint*`, or
`*Container*` must be uppercased: *TCP* instead of *tcp*, and *UDP* instead of
*udp*. OpenShift will continue to accept all case variations.

.Stored Objects
* Build pods previously inherited the labels of the build. This resulted in
pods from builds being accidentally being included in deployments that had
similar labels. It was never intended that build pods should share labels
with existing components, so this behavior has been removed. Queries that
attempt to retrieve build pods by label will no longer work.

*Enhancements*

.For Administrators
* Kubernetes was updated to v1.0.0.
* To make it easier to xref:../install_config/upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[upgrade your cluster],
the `oadm reconcile-cluster-roles` command has been added to
xref:../install_config/upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[update your
cluster roles] to match the internal default. Use this command to verify the
cluster infrastructure users have the appropriate permissions.
* A new
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider[LDAP
authentication identity provider] has been added, allowing administrators to
configure OpenShift to verify passwords and users against an LDAP server
directly.
* The master's CA certificate can be made available as a secret inside pods,
making it easier to manage secure TLS inside the cluster. To enable this in an
existing configuration,
xref:../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#enabling-service-account-authentication[set
the `*masterCA*` field] in the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file].
* The current version of the master is now shown on startup, and startup
logging has been cleaned up.
* The ability to use host ports and the `*hostNetwork*` option is now properly
secured by
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#security-context-constraints[security
context constraints] (SCCs), and only restricted or higher users can use them.
* The `*RunAsNonRoot*` option for pod SCCs has been added. It is now possible to
restrict users to running pods that are non-root (i.e., pods that have an
explicit *USER* numeric value set in their container image or have specified the
user ID on their pod SCC).

.For Developers
* Output for `oc status` has been improved to make it easier to see the types of
objects being presented.
* You can now search for images, templates, and other inputs for the `oc
new-app` command using the `--search` and `--list` flags. For example, to find
all of the images or templates that include PHP:
+
----
$ oc new-app --search php
----
* The `oc new-app` command now always add an `app=<name>` label on the created
objects when you do not specify labels with `--labels`. The name is inferred
from `--name` or the name of the first component passed to the command. For
example:
+
----
$ oc new-app php
----
+
adds a label `app=php` to all of objects it creates. You can then easily delete
all of those components using:
+
----
$ oc delete all -l app=php
----
* The `oc rsh <pod>` command has been added, which is a shortcut for:
+
----
$ oc exec -itp POD -- bash
----
+
The new command makes it easier to get a remote shell into your pods.
* Rolling updates can now be done by percentage: you can specify the percentage
of pods to update by a negative or positive amount that adjusts the amount of
replicas in chunks. If negative, old deployments are scaled down first. If
positive, extra pods are created first. The rolling update works to keep the
desired amount of pods running (100% of the old deployment size when a
positive percentage or 100%-`*UpdatePercent*` when negative) as it goes.

*Bug Fixes*

.For Cluster Administrators
* The `openshift start --print-ip` command was added, which reports the IP that
the master will use if no `--master` address is provided, then exits.
* OpenShift performance when idling has been improved by removing an inefficient
timer loop.
* The router and internal registry now default to using the `*RollingUpdate*`
strategy deployment. Red Hat recommends updating any existing router or
registry installations if you plan on scaling them up to multiple pods.
* The `oadm policy who-can` command now shows additional information.
* Master startup no longer has a chance to generate certificates with duplicate
serial numbers, which previously rendered them unusable.

.For Developers
* For the `oc new-app` command:
** http://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala] Git repositories are now detected.
** A bug was fixed where explicit tags were being set on new image streams,
 which confused builds.
** Ports are now exposed that were defined in the source *_Dockerfile_* when
 creating an application from a Git repository.
** The *FROM* instruction in a *_Dockerfile_* can now point to an image stream
 or invalid image.
** For any image that has volumes, `*emptyDir*` volumes are now created and the
user is informed.
** All ports defined on the image can now be exposed on the generated service.
** The `--name` argument now also changes
the name of the image stream.
** Labels passed with `--labels` are now properly set onto the pod template and
selector for the deployment.
* The `oc status` command now shows standalone replication controllers and a
number of other warnings about issues.
* The timeout for log sessions and the `oc exec` and `oc portforward` commands
has been increased from 5 minutes to 1 hour.
* Cleanup and improvements were made to the *Browse* pages in the web console,
including a better layout at smaller resolutions.
* OpenShift now avoids writing excessive log errors on initial deployments when
the image is not yet available.
* https://quay.io/[Quay.io] registries are now supported by using cookies when
importing images.
* Container images of the form *<registry>/<name>* are now properly handled by the
`oc new-app` command and the image import functionality.
* Secret volumes are now unique for push and pull secrets during builds.
* The `oc secret` commands now provide better usage errors.
* Builds are now filtered by completion time in the *Overview* page of the web
console.
* A race condition was fixed when service accounts with *_.dockercfg_* files
(for pull secrets) were deleted.
* When generating and adding secrets to a service account, the `oc secrets add`
command now allows the user to specify which type of secret is being added:
`mount` or `pull`.
* The custom builder build type now allows image output to be disabled instead
of requiring it on input.
* WebSocket errors in the web console are now handled more effectively.
* The `*http_proxy*` and `*HTTP_PROXY*` environment variables can now be passed
to builds.
* Routes now default to using the route name when creating a virtual host, not
the service name.
* The `oc expose` command no longer defaults to creating routes, except when a
service is exposed.
* More detail is now shown on the image streams page in the web console.
* Source code revision information is now shown in the `oc describe build`
output.
* TLS termination output is now shown in `oc describe route` output.
* Image importing now works with registries that do not implement the whole
container image registry API (e.g., Pulp read-only registries).
* Deployment configurations now trigger deployment when the `*metadata*` field
of the pod template is changed, not just when the `*spec*` is changed.
* The project request template now allows Kubernetes objects as well as
OpenShift objects.
* The `oc volume` command can now change the volume type when the `--mount-path`
is unambiguous.
* Builds now properly cancel when the user requests them, rather than running to
completion.
* The `oc export` command no longer fails when exporting image streams that do
not have tags under their `*spec*`.
* Attempting to use the default PostgreSQL database service templates after
using a default MySQL template failed with errors reporting "mysql" already
exists. This was due to an incorrect value in the PostgreSQL templates, which
has now been fixed.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1245559[BZ#1245559])
* Previously when creating from templates in the web console, the creation would
fail if the template contained certain API object types, including persistent
volume claims, secrets, and service accounts. This was due to the web console
missing these types from its API type map. The type map has now been updated
to include these missing types, and the web console also now gracefully
handles unrecognized object types, reporting a relevant error message.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1244254[BZ#1244254])
* The web console previously produced errors when users attempted to create from
templates that had a Custom build strategy. The errors obscured the template
parameters from being shown or managed. The web console has now been updated
to properly handle Custom and Docker build strategies in templates. As a
result, the errors no longer occur, and template parameters can be viewed and
managed. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1242312[BZ#1242312])
* If the *nfs-utils* package was not installed on a node host, when a user tried
to add an NFS volume to an application, the mount operation would fail for the
pod. This bug fix adds the *nfs-utils* package as a dependency for the
*atomic-openshift-node* package so it is installed on all node hosts by default.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1238565[BZ#1238565])
* Previously, pruning images associated with an image stream that had been
removed would fail. This bug fix updates layer pruning to always delete blobs
from the registry, even if the image stream(s) that referenced the layer no
longer exists. In the event that there are no longer any image streams
referencing the layer, the blob can still be deleted, but not the registry
image repository layer link files.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1237271[BZ#1237271])
* The *Documentation* link in the header of the web console previously linked to
the latest OpenShift Origin documentation. It has been updated to now point to
the OpenShift Enterprise documentation for the current version.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1233772[BZ#1233772])
* The *Create* page in the web console has been updated to make it more obvious
that there are two options rather than one. The headings have been modified to
"Create Using Your Code" and "Create Using a Template", and a separator has
been added between the two options.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1233488[BZ#1233488])
* Previously using the CLI, labels could be set to empty values, and setting
labels to invalid values produced an unfriendly error. This bug fix updates
the CLI to no longer allow setting labels to empty values, and setting labels
to invalid values produces a better error message.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1230581[BZ#1230581])

=== OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.2.0

OpenShift Enterprise release 3.0.2.0
https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver=3.0.0.0/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2015:1835[(RHBA-2015:1835)]
is now available. Ensure that you follow the instructions on
xref:../install_config/upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[upgrading your OpenShift cluster] properly,
including steps specific to this release.

This release includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:

*Backwards Compatibility*

.API
* If a deployment configuration is created without specifying the `*triggers*`
field, the deployment now defaults to having a
xref:../dev_guide/builds.adoc#config-change-triggers[configuration change
trigger].
* The new `*subjects*` field (a list of object references) is now available when
creating xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[role
bindings]. You can pass object references to `*User*`, `*SystemUser*`,
`*Group*`, `*SystemGroup*`, or `*ServiceAccount*` when defining the binding.
Passing a reference to a service account resolves the correct name, making it
easier to grant access to service accounts in the current namespace. If users
or groups are also specified, they take priority over values set in
`*subjects*`.
* Template parameters now support `*displayName*`, which is an optional field to
use from user interfaces when your template is shown.
* xref:../dev_guide/builds.adoc#custom-secrets[Secrets can now be added to
custom builds] and mounted at user-specified locations.
* Validation of the `*container.ports.name*` field was changed:
** If specified, the value must be no more than 15 characters, have at least one letter [a-z]
and contain only [a-z0-9-].  Hyphens cannot be leading or trailing characters, or adjacent to
each other.
** Resources generated by the web console, command line tooling, or templates were all updated
to conform to the updated syntax.
** Existing data may require manual modification to either remove the `*container.ports.name*`
or update its value to conform to the new validation rules.  Failure to do so may result in an
inability to create pod resources that specify the invalid syntax.
** A symptom of an invalid configuration would be the production of a large number of *Event*
resources whose *Event.Reason* is *failedCreate* and whose *Event.Message* includes the string
*must be an IANA_SVC_NAME*.  Operators must edit the *Event.InvolvedObject* to address the invalid
configuration by doing an `oc edit` command.
* Pending removal:
** Support for `v1beta3` from the API and from client commands will be removed
in OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.
** Builds marked only with the *build* label will no longer be considered part
of their parent build configuration in OpenShift Enterprise 3.1. You can see
a list of affected builds by running:
+
----
$ oc get builds --all-namespaces
----
+
Then look for builds that only have the *build* label and not
*openshift.io/build*. See https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/3502[Issue
#3502] for more information.
** The `*spec.rollingParams.updatePercent*` field on deployment configurations
will no longer be recognized in OpenShift Enterprise 3.1. Use
`*maxUnavailable*` and `*maxSurge*` instead.

*Enhancements*

.Security
* Secrets were previously limited to only being available in pods when the
service account referenced them. To make it easier to use secrets in
templates, this is now disabled by default. Cluster administrators can
override this by setting the `*serviceAccountConfig.limitSecretReferences*`
variable to *true* in the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file] to force this for the whole platform. Project
administrators can also set the *"kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets"*
annotation to *"true"* on a particular service account to require that check.

.Platform
* xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/other_api_objects.adoc#group[Groups]
of users are now supported. Cluster administrators can use the `oadm groups`
command to manage them.
* Service accounts are now more easily bound to roles through the new
`*subjects*` field, as described in *Backwards Compatibility* above.

.Web Console
* You can now deploy, rollback, retry, and cancel deployments from the web
console.
* You can now cancel running builds from the web console.
* Improvements have been made to layout and readability at mobile resolutions.
* You can now xref:../install_config/web_console_customization.adoc#install-config-web-console-customization[customize the
web console and login page].

.Networking/Routing
* The `--host-network` flag has been added to the `openshift router` command to
allow the router to run with the container network stack when set to *false*.
* The default host name for a route has been changed to the form
`<route-name>-<namespace>.<suffix>`. This allows TLS wildcards on `<suffix>`
to work properly.
* A xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#f5-router[new *F5 BIG-IP®*
router plug-in] has been added, allowing F5 routers to be dynamically
configured.
* The router can now be configured to serve a subset of the routes in your
deployment:
** Pass `--namespace` to the router command to select routes in a single
namespace.
** Pass `--labels=<selector>` or `--fields=<selector>` to select only routes
with the provided labels or fields.
** Pass `--project-labels=*` to show routes in all labels that the router's
service account is granted access to, `--project-labels=<selector>` to filter
that list by label, or `--namespace-labels=<selector>` to filter all labels
when the router service account has that permission.
+
[NOTE]
====
The label list is updated every 10 minutes or when the router restarts, so new
projects may not instantly get served.
====
* Both the F5 and HAProxy routers now allow only the first route (by creation
timestamp) with a given `*host*` or generated host (when you omit the `*Host*`
field) to claim that route name. If multiple routes with the same host but
different paths are defined, all routes in the same namespace as the oldest
route with that host will be included. If the oldest route is deleted, and the
next oldest route is in a different namespace, only routes in that other
namespace will be served.

.Images
* Importing and pulling from Docker v2 registries is now supported.
* The `oc import-image` command can now create image streams with the `--from`
flag, specifying the image repository you want to import.
* When you tag an image with `oc tag` into an image stream that does not exist,
an image stream can now be automatically created.

.Storage
* The `oc volume` command now lists by default and shows you additional
information about each volume type.
* Persistent volume claims now show whether they are provisioned or not, their
size, and details about their bound persistent volume. The `oc volume` command
can also now create a new persistent volume claim for you if you specify the
`--claim-size` flag.

.CLI
* The `--list` flag has been added to the `oc new-app` command to display list
of available images and templates.
* The `--short` and `-q` flags have been added to the `oc project` command to
only display the project name.

.Builds
* Custom builds now allow a `*forcePull*` flag to indicate that the
xref:../dev_guide/builds.adoc#custom-force-pull[custom builder image must be
pulled].
* xref:../dev_guide/builds.adoc#image-change-triggers[Multiple image change
triggers] are now allowed in build configurations.
* The `--commit=<commit>` flag has been added to `oc start-build`, which
triggers a build of the exact Git commit specified.
* The `--env` flag has been added to `oc new-build`, allowing you to set
environment variables on your S2I builds.
* The `--wait` flag has been added to `oc start-build`, allowing you to wait for
the build completion without viewing the logs.

.Templates
* The `*required*` attribute has been added to template parameters. Templates
now cannot be instantiated without supplying a value for all required
parameters.

.Remote Execution
* The `oc rsh` command now accepts commands and arguments after the pod is
specified:
+
----
oc rsh <pod> <command> [<arguments>]
----
+
This behavior more closely mimics the `ssh` command. A TTY is automatically
allocated if your current shell passes one, otherwise you can specify `-t` to
force a TTY or `-T` to disable it.
* A number of stability and hanging issues have been resolved with `oc exec` and
`oc rsh`. However, Docker 1.6.2 has a known issue with hangs to remote shells
via `docker exec`, so Red Hat recommends upgrading Docker to a 1.7 or 1.8
build.

*Bug Fixes*

.For Developers
* The web console now allows users to specify the Git reference (branch or tag)
from which their build will be created.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1250153[BZ#1250153])
* Users may now specify the replica count by adjusting the scale of a deployment
configuration. This is useful for setting the replica count before a
replication controller has been created so that the value will be used for
replication controllers created in the future.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1250652[BZ#1250652])
* Docker client libraries were updated, and OpenShift can now import images from
authenticated Docker v2
registries.(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1255502[BZ#1255502])
* Git URI parsing has been updated to account for _git://_ style URIs, and as a
result builds using these URIs no longer fail.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1261449[BZ#1261449])
* Project administrators can now change a project's display name and description
by updating the project using `oc edit`.
* Updated the set of labels generated when creating a new application from
source in the web console, just as in the CLI with `oc new-app`.
* Improved the display of builds in the web console.
* Builds in which a pod is not created are no longer marked as successful in the
web console.
* S2I builds that may run as root are now prevented from starting, based on
security context constraints on the builder service account.
* Remote shell access to builder containers is now prevented.
* Builds are now listed in the CLI according to creation timestamp.
* Builds from `oc new-app` are now started immediately with the configuration change
trigger.
* The help text for `oc get projects` has been fixed.
* Hangs when using `oc exec` without a TTY no longer occur.
* The `oc import-image` command no longer panics when an error occurs.
* The `--search` and `--list` options are now suggested when calling `oc
new-app` with no arguments.
* When running `oc scale` against a deployment configuration with no
deployments, the replicas are now set directly.

.For Cluster Administrators

* Administrators can now configure the IP address used for SDN traffic. Passing
node IPs as a configuration option on the node allows it to be set distinct from
the node host name for listening on other interfaces. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1253596[BZ#1253596])
* SDN node events are now triggered when a node IP changes.
* The Rolling deployment strategy is now used for router deployments.
* The `*mode http*` configuration has been added to the HAProxy front end SNI
definition.
* Upgraded the integrated *etcd* to v2.1.2.
* Upgraded the internal container image registry to v2.0.1.
* The Kubernetes master service address (the first address in the service CIDR
range) has been added to the generated certificates to allow pods to verify
TLS connections to the API.
* Permissions are now preserved during image builds.
* Panics in the API server are now recovered instead of allowing the server to
crash.
* The OpenShift SDN MTU is now configurable.
