= Listing Workload Identity Federation clusters

[role="_abstract"]
You can list {product-title} clusters that have been deployed using Workload Identity Federation (WIF) authentication by using the {cluster-manager} CLI (`ocm`).

.Procedure

* To list all of your {product-title} clusters that have been deployed using the WIF authentication type, run one of the following commands:
+
** Using the `--parameter` flag with the `search` option:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ocm list clusters --parameter search="gcp.authentication.wif_config_id != ''"
----
+
** Using a specific wif-config ID to filter the clusters associated with that configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ocm list clusters --parameter search="gcp.authentication.wif_config_id = '<wif_config_id>'" <1>
----
<1> Replace `<wif_config_id>` with the ID of the WIF configuration.
