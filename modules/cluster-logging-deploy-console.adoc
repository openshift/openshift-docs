= Installing cluster logging using the web console

You can use the {product-title} web console to install the Elasticsearch and Cluster Logging operators.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have the necessary persistent storage for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch node
requires its own storage volume.
+
Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. By default, {product-title} installs three Elasticsearch nodes with memory requests and limits of 16 GB. This initial set of three {product-title} nodes might not have enough memory to run Elasticsearch within your cluster. If you experience memory issues that are related to Elasticsearch, add more Elasticsearch nodes to your cluster rather than increasing the memory on existing nodes.

.Procedure

To install the Elasticsearch Operator and Cluster Logging Operator using the {product-title} web console:

. Install the Elasticsearch Operator:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose  *Elasticsearch Operator* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.

.. Ensure that the *All namespaces on the cluster* is selected under *Installation Mode*.

.. Ensure that *openshift-operators-redhat* is selected under *Installed Namespace*.
+
You must specify the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace. The `openshift-operators`
namespace might contain Community Operators, which are untrusted and could publish
a metric with the same name as an {product-title} metric, which would cause
conflicts.

.. Select *Enable operator recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace*.
+
This option sets the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label in the Namespace object.
You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring
scrapes the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace.

.. Select *4.6* as the *Update Channel*.

.. Select an *Approval Strategy*.
+
* The *Automatic* strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
+
* The *Manual* strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.

.. Click *Install*.

.. Verify that the Elasticsearch Operator installed by switching to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *Elasticsearch Operator* is listed in all projects with a *Status* of *Succeeded*.

. Install the Cluster Logging Operator:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose  *Cluster Logging* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.

.. Ensure that the *A specific namespace on the cluster* is selected under *Installation Mode*.

.. Ensure that *Operator recommended namespace* is *openshift-logging* under *Installed Namespace*.

.. Select *Enable operator recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace*.
+
This option sets the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label in the Namespace object. 
You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring
scrapes the `openshift-logging` namespace.

.. Select *4.6* as the *Update Channel*.

.. Select an *Approval Strategy*.
+
* The *Automatic* strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
+
* The *Manual* strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.

.. Click *Install*.

.. Verify that the Cluster Logging Operator installed by switching to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *Cluster Logging* is listed in the *openshift-logging* project with a *Status* of *Succeeded*.
+
If the Operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:
+
* Switch to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page and inspect
the *Status* column for any errors or failures.
* Switch to the *Workloads* → *Pods* page and check the logs in any pods in the
`openshift-logging` project that are reporting issues.

. Create a cluster logging instance:

.. Switch to the *Administration* -> *Custom Resource Definitions* page.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click *ClusterLogging*.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definition Overview* page, select *View Instances* from the *Actions* menu.

.. On the *ClusterLoggings* page, click *Create ClusterLogging*.
+
You might have to refresh the page to load the data.

.. In the YAML field, replace the code with the following:

This default cluster logging configuration should support a wide array of environments. Review the topics on tuning and
configuring the cluster logging components for information on modifications you can make to your cluster logging cluster.

<1> The name must be `instance`.
<2> The cluster logging management state. In some cases, if you change the cluster logging defaults, you must set this to `Unmanaged`.
However, an unmanaged deployment does not receive updates until the cluster logging is placed back into a managed state.
<3> Settings for configuring Elasticsearch. Using the CR, you can configure shard replication policy and persistent storage.
<4> Specify the length of time that Elasticsearch should retain each log source. Enter an integer and a time designation: weeks(w), hours(h/H), minutes(m) and seconds(s). For example, `7d` for seven days. Logs older than the `maxAge` are deleted. You must specify a retention policy for each log source or the Elasticsearch indices will not be created for that source.
<5> Specify the number of Elasticsearch nodes. See the note that follows this list.
<6> Enter the name of an existing StorageClass for Elasticsearch storage. For best performance, specify a StorageClass that allocates block storage. If you do not specify a StorageClass, {product-title} deploys cluster logging with ephemeral storage only.
<7> Settings for configuring Kibana. Using the CR, you can scale Kibana for redundancy and configure the CPU and memory for your Kibana nodes. For more information, see *Configuring Kibana*.
<8> Settings for configuring the Curator schedule. Curator is used to remove data that is in the Elasticsearch index format prior to {product-title} 4.5 and will be removed in a later release.
<9> Settings for configuring Fluentd. Using the CR, you can configure Fluentd CPU and memory limits. For more information, see *Configuring Fluentd*.

====
The maximum number of Elasticsearch master nodes is three. If you specify a `nodeCount` greater than `3`, {product-title} creates three Elasticsearch nodes that are Master-eligible nodes, with the master, client, and data roles. The additional Elasticsearch nodes are created as Data-only nodes, using client and data roles. Master nodes perform cluster-wide actions such as creating or deleting an index, shard allocation, and tracking nodes. Data nodes hold the shards and perform data-related operations such as CRUD, search, and aggregations. Data-related operations are I/O-, memory-, and CPU-intensive. It is important to monitor these resources and to add more Data nodes if the current nodes are overloaded.

For example, if `nodeCount=4`, the following nodes are created:
