= Installing the {clo} by using the web console

You can install the {clo} by using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrator permissions.
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.
. Type `OpenShift Logging` in the *Filter by keyword* box.
. Choose  *Red Hat OpenShift Logging* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.
. Ensure that *A specific namespace on the cluster* is selected under *Installation mode*.
. Ensure that *Operator recommended namespace* is *openshift-logging* under *Installed Namespace*.
. Select *Enable operator recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace*.
+
This option sets the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label in the `Namespace` object. You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the `openshift-logging` namespace.

. Select *stable-5.y* as the *Update channel*.

. Select an *Update approval*.
** The *Automatic* strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
** The *Manual* strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.

. Select *Enable* or *Disable* for the *Console plugin*.
. Click *Install*.

.Verification

. Verify that the *Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator* is installed by switching to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.
. In the *Status* column, verify that you see green checkmarks with *InstallSucceeded* and the text *Up to date*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
An Operator might display a `Failed` status before the installation finishes. If the Operator install completes with an `InstallSucceeded` message, refresh the page.
====

If the Operator does not show as installed, choose one of the following troubleshooting options:

* Go to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page, and inspect the *Status* column for any errors or failures.
* Go to the *Workloads* → *Pods* page, and check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-logging` project that are reporting issues.
