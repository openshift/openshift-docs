An Operator might display a `Failed` status before the installation finishes. If the Operator install completes with an `InstallSucceeded` message, refresh the page.
====

If the Operator does not show as installed, choose one of the following troubleshooting options:

* Go to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page, and inspect the *Status* column for any errors or failures.
* Go to the *Workloads* → *Pods* page, and check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-logging` project that are reporting issues.
