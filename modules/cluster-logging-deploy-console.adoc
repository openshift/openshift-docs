= Installing the {logging-title} using the web console

[NOTE]
====
If you do not want to use the default Elasticsearch log store, you can remove the internal Elasticsearch `logStore` and Kibana `visualization` components from the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR). Removing these components is optional but saves resources.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.
. Choose  *Red Hat OpenShift Logging* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.
. Ensure that *A specific namespace on the cluster* is selected under *Installation mode*.
. Ensure that *Operator recommended namespace* is *openshift-logging* under *Installed Namespace*.
. Select *Enable operator recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace*.
+
This option sets the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label in the Namespace object. You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the `openshift-logging` namespace.

. Select *stable-5.y* as the *Update channel*.
+
--
include::snippets/logging-stable-updates-snip.adoc[]
--

. Select an *Update approval*.
** The *Automatic* strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
** The *Manual* strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.

. Select *Enable* or *Disable* for the *Console plugin*.
. Click *Install*.

.Verification

. Verify that the *Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator* is installed by switching to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *Red Hat OpenShift Logging* is listed in the *openshift-logging* project with a *Status* of *Succeeded*.

.. Verify that the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator installed by switching to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *Red Hat OpenShift Logging* is listed in the *openshift-logging* project with a *Status* of *Succeeded*.
+
If the Operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:
+
* Switch to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page and inspect the *Status* column for any errors or failures.
* Switch to the *Workloads* → *Pods* page and check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-logging` project that are reporting issues.

. Create a *ClusterLogging* instance.
+
[NOTE]
====
The form view of the web console does not include all available options. The *YAML view* is recommended for completing your setup.
====
+
.. In the *collection* section, select a Collector Implementation.

include::snippets/logging-fluentd-dep-snip.adoc[]
--
.. In the *logStore* section, select a type.
+
--
include::snippets/logging-elastic-dep-snip.adoc[]
--

.. Click *Create*.

. Create an OpenShift Logging instance:

.. Switch to the *Administration* -> *Custom Resource Definitions* page.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click *ClusterLogging*.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definition details* page, select *View Instances* from the *Actions* menu.

.. On the *ClusterLoggings* page, click *Create ClusterLogging*.
+
You might have to refresh the page to load the data.

.. In the YAML field, replace the code with the following:

[NOTE]
====
This default OpenShift Logging configuration should support a wide array of environments. Review the topics on tuning and
configuring {logging} components for information on modifications you can make to your OpenShift Logging cluster.

<1> The name must be `instance`.
<2> The OpenShift Logging management state. In some cases, if you change the OpenShift Logging defaults, you must set this to `Unmanaged`.
However, an unmanaged deployment does not receive updates until OpenShift Logging is placed back into a managed state.
<3> Settings for configuring Elasticsearch. Using the CR, you can configure shard replication policy and persistent storage.
<4> Specify the length of time that Elasticsearch should retain each log source. Enter an integer and a time designation: weeks(w), hours(h/H), minutes(m) and seconds(s). For example, `7d` for seven days. Logs older than the `maxAge` are deleted. You must specify a retention policy for each log source or the Elasticsearch indices will not be created for that source.
<5> Specify the number of Elasticsearch nodes. See the note that follows this list.
<6> Enter the name of an existing storage class for Elasticsearch storage. For best performance, specify a storage class that allocates block storage. If you do not specify a storage class, OpenShift Logging uses ephemeral storage.
<7> Specify the CPU and memory requests for Elasticsearch as needed. If you leave these values blank, the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator sets default values that should be sufficient for most deployments. The default values are `16Gi` for the memory request and `1` for the CPU request.
<8> Specify the CPU and memory requests for the Elasticsearch proxy as needed. If you leave these values blank, the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator sets default values that should be sufficient for most deployments. The default values are `256Mi` for the memory request and `100m` for the CPU request.
<9> Settings for configuring Kibana. Using the CR, you can scale Kibana for redundancy and configure the CPU and memory for your Kibana nodes. For more information, see *Configuring the log visualizer*.
<10> Settings for configuring Fluentd. Using the CR, you can configure Fluentd CPU and memory limits. For more information, see the section named *Configuring the logging collector*.

[NOTE]

====
The maximum number of Elasticsearch control plane nodes is three. If you specify a `nodeCount` greater than `3`, {product-title} creates three Elasticsearch nodes that are Master-eligible nodes, with the master, client, and data roles. The additional Elasticsearch nodes are created as Data-only nodes, using client and data roles. Control plane nodes perform cluster-wide actions such as creating or deleting an index, shard allocation, and tracking nodes. Data nodes hold the shards and perform data-related operations such as CRUD, search, and aggregations. Data-related operations are I/O-, memory-, and CPU-intensive. It is important to monitor these resources and to add more Data nodes if the current nodes are overloaded.

For example, if `nodeCount=4`, the following nodes are created:

[source,terminal]

$ oc get deployment

.. Click *Create*. This creates the {logging} components, the `Elasticsearch` custom resource and components, and the Kibana interface.

. Verify the installation:

.. Switch to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page.

.. Select the *openshift-logging* project.
+
Confirm that pods exist for the Operator and the Elasticsearch, collector, and Kibana components:
+
* cluster-logging-operator-595f9bf9c4-txrp4
* collector-29bw8
* collector-4kvnl
* collector-7rr7w
* collector-9m2xp
* collector-xt45j

* kibana-5c6b7cd56-66c9l

.Troubleshooting
* If Alertmanager logs alerts such as `Prometheus could not scrape fluentd for more than 10m`, make sure that `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring` is set to `"true"` for the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator and OpenShift Logging Operator. See the Red Hat KnowledgeBase for more information: link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5692801[Prometheus could not scrape fluentd for more than 10m alert in Alertmanager]
