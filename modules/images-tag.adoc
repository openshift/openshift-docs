= Image tags

[role="_abstract"]
Image tags are labels applied to container images in image streams to distinguish specific versions of images. They help you organize and reference specific versions of images in {product-title}.

Typically, an image tag represents a version number of some sort. The following example shows the `registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7` image with the tag `:v3.11.59-2`:

[source,text]
----
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7:v3.11.59-2
----

You can add additional tags to an image. For example, an image might be assigned the tags `:v3.11.59-2` and `:latest`.

{product-title} provides the `oc tag` command, which is similar to the `docker tag` command, but operates on image streams instead of directly on images.
