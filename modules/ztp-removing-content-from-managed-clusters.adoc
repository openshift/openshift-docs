= Changing applied managed cluster CRs using policies

You can remove content from a custom resource (CR) that is deployed in a managed cluster through a policy.

By default, all `Policy` CRs created from a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR have the `complianceType` field set to `musthave`.
A `musthave` policy without the removed content is still compliant because the CR on the managed cluster has all the specified content.
With this configuration, when you remove content from a CR, {cgu-operator} removes the content from the policy but the content is not removed from the CR on the managed cluster.

With the `complianceType` field to `mustonlyhave`, the policy ensures that the CR on the cluster is an exact match of what is specified in the policy.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have deployed a managed cluster from a hub cluster running {rh-rhacm}.

* You have installed {cgu-operator-full} on the hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Remove the content that you no longer need from the affected CRs. In this example, the `disableDrain: false` line was removed from the `SriovOperatorConfig` CR.
+
.Example CR

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovOperatorConfig
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  configDaemonNodeSelector:
    "node-role.kubernetes.io/$mcp": ""
  disableDrain: true
  enableInjector: true
  enableOperatorWebhook: true
----

. Change the `complianceType` of the affected policies to `mustonlyhave` in the `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` file.
+
.Example YAML
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
- fileName: SriovOperatorConfig.yaml
  policyName: "config-policy"
  complianceType: mustonlyhave
# ...
----

. Create a `ClusterGroupUpdates` CR and specify the clusters that must receive the CR changes::
+
.Example ClusterGroupUpdates CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: cgu-remove
  namespace: default
spec:
  managedPolicies:
    - ztp-group.group-du-sno-config-policy
  enable: false
  clusters:
  - spoke1
  - spoke2
  remediationStrategy:
    maxConcurrency: 2
    timeout: 240
  batchTimeoutAction:
----

. Create the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f cgu-remove.yaml
----

. When you are ready to apply the changes, for example, during an appropriate maintenance window, change the value of the `spec.enable` field to `true` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --namespace=default patch clustergroupupgrade.ran.openshift.io/cgu-remove \
--patch '{"spec":{"enable":true}}' --type=merge
----

.Verification

. Check the status of the policies by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get <kind> <changed_cr_name>
----

+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE   NAME                                                   REMEDIATION ACTION   COMPLIANCE STATE   AGE
default     cgu-ztp-group.group-du-sno-config-policy               enforce                                 17m
default     ztp-group.group-du-sno-config-policy                   inform               NonCompliant       15h
----

+
When the `COMPLIANCE STATE` of the policy is `Compliant`, it means that the CR is updated and the unwanted content is removed.

. Check that the policies are removed from the targeted clusters by running the following command on the managed clusters:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get <kind> <changed_cr_name>
----

+
If there are no results, the CR is removed from the managed cluster.
