|Alert
|Description
|Severity


|ElasticsearchClusterNotHealthy
|The cluster health status has been RED for at least 2 minutes. The cluster does not accept writes, shards may be missing, or themaster
 node hasn't been elected yet.
|critical

|ElasticsearchClusterNotHealthy
|The cluster health status has been YELLOW for at least 20 minutes. Some shard replicas are not allocated.
|warning
 
|ElasticsearchDiskSpaceRunningLow
|The cluster is expected to be out of disk space within the next 6 hours.
|Critical

|ElasticsearchHighFileDescriptorUsage
|The cluster is predicted to be out of file descriptors within the next hour.
|warning

|ElasticsearchJVMHeapUseHigh
|The JVM Heap usage on the specified node is high.
|Alert

|ElasticsearchNodeDiskWatermarkReached
|The specified node has hit the low watermark due to low free disk space. Shards can not be allocated to this node anymore. You should consider adding more disk space to the node.
|info

|ElasticsearchNodeDiskWatermarkReached
|The specified node has hit the high watermark due to low free disk space. Some shards will be re-allocated to different
nodes if possible. Make sure more disk space is added to the node or drop old indices allocated to this node.
|warning

|ElasticsearchNodeDiskWatermarkReached
|The specified node has hit the flood watermark due to low free disk space. Every index that has a shard allocated on this node is enforced a read-only block. The index block must be manually released when the disk use falls below the high watermark.
|critical

|ElasticsearchJVMHeapUseHigh
|The JVM Heap usage on the specified node is too high.
|alert

|ElasticsearchWriteRequestsRejectionJumps
|Elasticsearch is experiencing an increase in write rejections on the specified node. This node might not be keeping up with the indexing speed.
|Warning

|AggregatedLoggingSystemCPUHigh
|The CPU used by the system on the specified node is too high.
|alert

|ElasticsearchProcessCPUHigh
|The CPU used by Elasticsearch on the specified node is too high.
