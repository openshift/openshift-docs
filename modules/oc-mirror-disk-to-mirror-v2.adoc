== Mirroring from disk to mirror

You can use the oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror image sets from a disk to a target mirror registry.

The oc-mirror plugin v2 retrieves container images from a local disk and transfers them to the specified mirror registry.

.Procedure

. Transfer the disk containing mirrored image sets to the environment that contains the target mirror registry.

. Process the image set file on the disk and mirror the contents to a target mirror registry by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror -c <image_set_configuration> --from file://<file_path> docker://<mirror_registry_url> --v2
----
+
where:

<image_set_configuration>:: Specifies the name of the image set configuration file.
<file_path>:: Specifies the directory on the disk containing the archives. This folder will also contain cluster resources generated for you apply to the cluster, for example the ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS) or ImageTagMirrorSet (ITMS) resources.
<mirror_registry_url>:: Specifies the URL or address of the mirror registry where the images are stored.

.Verification

. Navigate to the `cluster-resources` directory within the `working-dir` directory that was generated in the `<file_path>` directory.
. Verify that the YAML files are present for the `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, `ImageTagMirrorSet`, and `CatalogSource` resources.

.Next steps

* Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2.
