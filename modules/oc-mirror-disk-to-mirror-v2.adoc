== Mirroring from disk to mirror

You can use the `oc-mirror` plugin v2 to mirror image sets from a disk to a target mirror registry.

The `oc-mirror` plugin v2 retrieves container images from a local disk and transfers them to the specified mirror registry.

.Procedure

* Process the image set file on the disk and mirror the contents to a target mirror registry by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror -c isc.yaml --from file://<file_path> docker://<mirror_registry_url> --v2 <1>
----
<1> Specify the URL or address of the mirror registry where the images are stored and from which they need to be deleted.

.Verification

. Navigate to the `cluster-resources` directory within the `working-dir` directory that was generated in the `<file_path>` directory.
. Verify that the YAML files are present for the `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, `ImageTagMirrorSet` and `CatalogSource` resources.

.Next steps

* Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2.
