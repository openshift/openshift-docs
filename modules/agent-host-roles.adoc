= Host roles

Each host in the cluster is assigned a role of either `master` or `worker`.
You can define the role for each host in the `agent-config.yaml` file by using the `role` parameter.
If you do not assign a role to the hosts, the roles will be assigned at random during installation.

It is recommended to explicitly define roles for your hosts.

The `rendezvousIP` must be assigned to a host with the `master` role. This can be done manually or by allowing the Agent-based Installer to assign the role.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You do not need to explicitly define the `master` role for the rendezvous host, however you cannot create configurations that conflict with this assignment.

For example, if you have 4 hosts with 3 of the hosts explicitly defined to have the `master` role, the last host that is automatically assigned the `worker` role during installation cannot be configured as the rendezvous host.
