= Constructing Pipelines using the Pipeline Builder

In the *Developer* perspective of the console, you can use the *Add* -> *Pipeline* -> *Pipeline Builder* option to:

* Construct a Pipeline flow using existing Tasks and ClusterTasks. When you install the OpenShift Pipelines Operator, it adds reusable Pipeline ClusterTasks to your cluster.
* Specify the type of resources required for the Pipeline Run, and if required, add additional parameters to the Pipeline.
* Reference these Pipeline resources in each of the Tasks in the Pipeline as input and output resources.
* The parameters for a Task are prepopulated based on the specifications of the Task. If required, reference any additional parameters added to the Pipeline in the Task.

.Procedure

. In the *Add* view of the *Developer* perspective, click the *Pipeline* tile to see the *Pipeline Builder* page.
. Enter a unique name for the Pipeline.
. Select a Task from the *Select task* list to add a Task to the Pipeline. This example uses the *s2i-nodejs* Task.
.. To add sequential Tasks to the Pipeline, click the plus icon to the right or left of the Task, and from the *Select task* list, select the Task you want to add to the Pipeline. For this example, use the plus icon to the right of the *s2i-nodejs* Task to add an *openshift-client* Task.
.. To add a parallel Task to the existing Task, click the plus icon displayed below the Task, and from the *Select Task* list, select the parallel Task you want to add to the Pipeline.

. Click *Add Resources* to specify the name and type of resources that the Pipeline Run will use. These resources are then used by the Tasks in the Pipeline as inputs and outputs.
For this example:
.. Add an input resource. In the *Name* field, enter `Source`, and from the *Resource Type* drop-down list, select *Git*.
.. Add an output resource. In the *Name* field, enter `Img`, and from the *Resource Type* drop-down list, select *Image*.
. The *Parameters* for a Task are prepopulated based on the specifications of the Task. If required, use the *Add Parameters* link to add additional parameters.
+
. A *Missing Resources* warning is displayed on a Task if the resources for the Task are not specified. Click the *s2i-nodejs* Task to see the side panel with details for the Task.

+
. In the Task side panel, specify the resources and parameters for it:

.. In the *Input Resources* -> *Source* section, the *Select Resources* drop-down list displays the resources that you added to the Pipeline. For this example, select *Source*.
.. In the *Output Resources* -> *Image* section, click the *Select Resources* list, and select *Img*.
.. If required, in the *Parameters* section, add more parameters to the default ones, by using the `$(params.<param-name>)` syntax.
. Similarly, add an input resource for the *openshift-client* Task.
. Click *Create* to create the Pipeline. You are redirected to the *Pipeline Details* page that displays the details of the created Pipeline.
. Click the *Actions* drop-down menu, and then click *Start* to start the Pipeline.

Optionally, you can also use the *Edit YAML* link, on the upper right of the *Pipeline Builder* page, to directly modify a Pipeline YAML file in the console. You can also use the operator-installed, reusable snippets and samples to create detailed Pipelines.
