= Constructing pipelines using the Pipeline builder

[role="_abstract"]
In the *Developer* perspective of the console, you can use the *+Add* -> *Pipeline* -> *Pipeline builder* option to:

* Configure pipelines using either the *Pipeline builder* or the *YAML view*.
* Construct a pipeline flow using existing tasks and cluster tasks. When you install the {pipelines-shortname} Operator, it adds reusable pipeline cluster tasks to your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {pipelines-title} 1.10, cluster task functionality is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release.
====

* Specify the type of resources required for the pipeline run, and if required, add additional parameters to the pipeline.
* Reference these pipeline resources in each of the tasks in the pipeline as input and output resources.
* If required, reference any additional parameters added to the pipeline in the task. The parameters for a task are prepopulated based on the specifications of the task.
* Use the Operator-installed, reusable snippets and samples to create detailed pipelines.
* Search and add tasks from your configured local Tekton Hub instance.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In the developer perspective, you can create a customized pipeline using your own set of curated tasks. To search, install, and upgrade your tasks directly from the developer console, your cluster administrator needs to install and deploy a local Tekton Hub instance and link that hub to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. For more details, see _Using Tekton Hub with {pipelines-shortname}_ in the _Additional resources_ section.
If you do not deploy any local Tekton Hub instance, by default, you can only access the cluster tasks, namespace tasks and public Tekton Hub tasks.

.Procedure

. In the *+Add* view of the *Developer* perspective, click the *Pipeline* tile to see the *Pipeline builder* page.
. Configure the pipeline using either the *Pipeline builder* view or the *YAML view*.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Pipeline builder* view supports a limited number of fields whereas the *YAML view* supports all available fields. Optionally, you can also use the Operator-installed, reusable snippets and samples to create detailed pipelines.
====

+
. Configure your pipeline by using *Pipeline builder*:

.. In the *Name* field, enter a unique name for the pipeline.
.. In the *Tasks* section:
... Click *Add task*.
... Search for a task using the quick search field and select the required task from the displayed list.
... Click *Add* or *Install and add*. In this example, use the *s2i-nodejs* task.
+
[NOTE]
====
The search list contains all the Tekton Hub tasks and tasks available in the cluster. Also, if a task is already installed it will show *Add* to add the task whereas it will show *Install and add* to install and add the task. It will show *Update and add* when you add the same task with an updated version.
====

*** To add sequential tasks to the pipeline:
**** Click the plus icon to the right or left of the task -> click *Add task*.
**** Search for a task using the quick search field and select the required task from the displayed list.
**** Click *Add* or *Install and add*.

*** To add a final task:
**** Click the *Add finally task* -> Click *Add task*.
**** Search for a task using the quick search field and select the required task from the displayed list.
**** Click *Add* or *Install and add*.

.. In the *Resources* section, click *Add Resources* to specify the name and type of resources for the pipeline run. These resources are then used by the tasks in the pipeline as inputs and outputs. For this example:
... Add an input resource. In the *Name* field, enter `Source`, and then from the *Resource Type* drop-down list, select *Git*.
... Add an output resource. In the *Name* field, enter `Img`, and then from the *Resource Type* drop-down list, select *Image*.
+
[NOTE]
====
A red icon appears next to the task if a resource is missing.
====

.. Optional: The *Parameters* for a task are pre-populated based on the specifications of the task. If required, use the *Add Parameters* link in the *Parameters* section to add additional parameters.

.. In the *Workspaces* section, click *Add workspace* and enter a unique workspace name in the *Name* field. You can add multiple workspaces to the pipeline.

.. In the *Tasks* section, click the *s2i-nodejs* task to see the side panel with details for the task. In the task side panel, specify the resources and parameters for the *s2i-nodejs* task:

... If required, in the *Parameters* section, add more parameters to the default ones, by using the $(params.<param-name>) syntax.
... In the *Image* section, enter `Img` as specified in the *Resources* section.
... Select a workspace from the *source* drop-down under *Workspaces* section.

.. Add resources, parameters, and workspaces to the *openshift-client* task.

. Click *Create* to create and view the pipeline in the *Pipeline Details* page.

. Click the *Actions* drop-down menu then click *Start*, to see the *Start Pipeline* page.

. The *Workspaces* section lists the workspaces you created earlier. Use the respective drop-down to specify the volume source for your workspace. You have the following options: *Empty Directory*, *Config Map*, *Secret*, *PersistentVolumeClaim*, or *VolumeClaimTemplate*.
