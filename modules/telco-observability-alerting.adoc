{product-title} includes a large number of alert rules, which can change from release to release. 

[id="viewing-default-alerts"]
== Viewing default alerts

Use the following procedure to review all of the alert rules in a cluster.

.Procedure

* To review all the alert rules in a cluster, you can run the following command:
[source,terminal]
+
----
$ oc get cm -n openshift-monitoring prometheus-k8s-rulefiles-0 -o yaml
----
+
Rules can include a description and provide a link to additional information and mitigation steps. 
For example, this is the rule for `etcdHighFsyncDurations`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
      - alert: etcdHighFsyncDurations
        annotations:
          description: 'etcd cluster "{{ $labels.job }}": 99th percentile fsync durations
            are {{ $value }}s on etcd instance {{ $labels.instance }}.'
          runbook_url: https://github.com/openshift/runbooks/blob/master/alerts/cluster-etcd-operator/etcdHighFsyncDurations.md
          summary: etcd cluster 99th percentile fsync durations are too high.
        expr: |
          histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(etcd_disk_wal_fsync_duration_seconds_bucket{job=~".*etcd.*"}[5m]))
          > 1
        for: 10m
        labels:
          severity: critical

[id="alert-notifications"]
== Alert notifications  
You can view alerts in the {product-title} console, however an administrator should configure an external receiver to forward the alerts to. 
{product-title} supports the following receiver types:

* PagerDuty: a 3rd party incident response platform
* Webhook: an arbitrary API endpoint that receives an alert via a POST request and can take any necessary action
* Email: sends an email to designated address
* Slack: sends a notification to either a slack channel or an individual user
