= Installing managed clusters with ClusterInstance resources and {rh-rhacm}

{ztp-first} uses `ClusterInstance` custom resources (CRs) in a Git repository to manage the processes that install {product-title} clusters. The `ClusterInstance` CR contains cluster-specific parameters required for installation. It has options for applying select configuration CRs during installation including user defined extra manifests.

The {ztp} plugin processes `ClusterInstance` CRs to generate a collection of CRs on the hub cluster. This triggers the assisted service in {rh-rhacm-first} to install {product-title} on the bare-metal host. You can find installation status and error messages in these CRs on the hub cluster.
You can provision single clusters manually or in batches with {ztp}:

Provisioning a single cluster:: Create a single `ClusterInstance` CR and related configuration CRs for the cluster, and apply them in the hub cluster to begin cluster provisioning. This is a good way to test your CRs before deploying on a larger scale.

Provisioning many clusters:: Install managed clusters in batches of up to 500 by defining `ClusterInstance` and related CRs in a Git repository. ArgoCD uses the `ClusterInstance` CRs to deploy the clusters. The {rh-rhacm} policy generator creates the manifests and applies them to the hub cluster. This starts the cluster provisioning process.
