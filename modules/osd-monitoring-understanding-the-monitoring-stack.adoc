= Understanding the monitoring stack

The {product-title} monitoring stack is based on the link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] open source project and its wider ecosystem. The monitoring stack includes the following:

* *Default platform monitoring components*. A set of platform monitoring components are installed in the `openshift-monitoring` project by default during an {product-title} installation. This provides monitoring for core {product-title}. The default monitoring stack also enables remote health monitoring for clusters. Critical metrics, such as CPU and memory, are collected from all of the workloads in every namespace and are made available for your use.

These components are illustrated in the *Installed by default* section in the following diagram.

* *Components for monitoring user-defined projects*. This feature is enabled by default and provides monitoring for user-defined projects. These components are illustrated in the *User* section in the following diagram.
