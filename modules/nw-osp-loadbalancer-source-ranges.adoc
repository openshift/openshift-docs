= Load balancer source ranges

Use the `.spec.loadBalancerSourceRanges` property to restrict the traffic that can pass through the load balancer according to source IP. This property is supported for use with the Amphora Octavia provider only. If your cluster uses the OVN Octavia provider, the option is ignored and traffic is unrestricted.
