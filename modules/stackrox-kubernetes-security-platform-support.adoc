StackRox supports the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform versions for up to six months after its release, which corresponds to the previous nine released versions. StackRox will make reasonable efforts and assist you in supporting some older versions. However, the support team may request you to upgrade to a newer released version of the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform for full support.

[NOTE]
====
For the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform, StackRox supports:

* The latest released version (reffered as N).
* Nine earlier versions.

The support window of the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform versions is known as N-9 where: N (latest release) - 9 (earlier versions).

Along with our N-9 support window, StackRox might support version N-10 to N-13, depending on a case-by-case basis. StackRox will not support any earlier versions than N-13.
