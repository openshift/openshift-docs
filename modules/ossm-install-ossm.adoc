= Installing the {ProductName} Operator

.Prerequisites

* Access to the {product-title} web console.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.
* The Elasticsearch Operator must be installed.
* The Jaeger Operator must be installed.
* The Kiali Operator must be installed.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type *{ProductName}* into the filter box to find the {ProductName} Operator.

. Click the {ProductName} Operator provided by Red Hat to display information about the Operator.  Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page, select *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` project and makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.

. If an Operator is available through multiple channels, you can choose which channel you want to subscribe to.  Select the *1.0* Update Channel.

. You can choose *Automatic* or *Manual* updates. If you choose Automatic updates for an installed Operator, when a new version of that Operator is available, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention. If you select Manual updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, the OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.
