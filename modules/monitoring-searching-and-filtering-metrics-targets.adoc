= Searching and filtering metrics targets

The list of metrics targets can be long. You can filter and search these targets based on various criteria.

In the *Administrator* perspective, the *Metrics Targets* page provides details about targets for default {product-title} and user-defined projects.
This page lists the following information for each target:

* the service endpoint URL being scraped
* the ServiceMonitor component being monitored
* the up or down status of the target
* the namespace
* the last scrape time
* the duration of the last scrape

You can filter the list of targets by status and source. The following filtering options are available:

* *Status* filters:
** *Up*. The target is currently up and being actively scraped for metrics.
** *Down*. The target is currently down and not being scraped for metrics.

* *Source* filters:
** *Platform*. Platform-level targets relate only to default {product-title} projects. These projects provide core {product-title} functionality.
** *User*. User targets relate to user-defined projects. These projects are user-created and can be customized. 

You can also use the search box to find a target by target name or label.
Select *Text* or *Label* from the search box menu to limit your search.
