= Installing the secured-cluster-services Helm chart

After you configure the `values-public.yaml` and `values-private.yaml` files, install the `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart to deploy the per-cluster and per-node components (Sensor, Admission controller, Collector, and Scanner-slim).

[CAUTION]
====
To install Collector on systems that have Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and that have Secure Boot enabled, you must use eBPF probes because kernel modules are unsigned, and the UEFI firmware cannot load unsigned packages. Collector identifies Secure Boot status at the start and switches to eBPF probes if required.
====

.Prerequisites
* You must have generated {product-title-short} init bundle for your cluster.
ifndef::cloud-svc[]
* You must have the address and the port number that you are exposing the Central service on.
endif::cloud-svc[]
ifdef::cloud-svc[]
* You must have the *Central API Endpoint*, including the address and the port number. You can view this information by choosing *Advanced Cluster Security* -> *ACS Instances* from the cloud console navigation menu, then clicking the ACS instance you created.
endif::[]

.Procedure

* Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ helm install -n stackrox --create-namespace \
  stackrox-secured-cluster-services rhacs/secured-cluster-services \
  -f <name_of_cluster_init_bundle.yaml> \
  -f <path_to_values_public.yaml> -f <path_to_values_private.yaml> <1>
----
<1> Use the `-f` option to specify the paths for your YAML configuration files.

[NOTE]
====
To deploy `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart by using a continuous integration (CI) system, pass the init bundle YAML file as an environment variable to the `helm install` command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ helm install ... -f <(echo "$INIT_BUNDLE_YAML_SECRET") <1>
----
<1> If you are using base64 encoded variables, use the `helm install ... -f <(echo "$INIT_BUNDLE_YAML_SECRET" | base64 --decode)` command instead.
