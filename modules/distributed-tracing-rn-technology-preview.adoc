When you install the Jaeger Operator you can select a Technology Preview version of Jaeger.  This gives you access to clients and infrastructure for exporting tracing data to Jaeger based on the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry framework].  Note that this version is not supported for production environments.

The OpenTelemetry collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and opening the door to a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
