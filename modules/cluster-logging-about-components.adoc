= Cluster logging components 

The cluster logging components are based upon Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana
(EFK). The collector, link:http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd], is
deployed to each node in the {product-title} cluster. It collects all node and
container logs and writes them to
link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] (ES).
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana] is
the centralized, web UI where users and administrators can create rich
visualizations and dashboards with the aggregated data.

There are currently 5 different types of cluster logging components:

* logStore - This is where the logs will be stored. The current implementation is Elasticsearch.
* collection - This is the component that collects logs from the node, formats them, and stores them in the logStore. The current implementation is Fluentd.
* visualization - This is the UI component used to view logs, graphs, charts, and so forth. The current implementation is Kibana.
* curation - This is the component that trims logs by age. The current implementation is Curator.
* event routing - This is the component forwards {product-title} events to cluster logging. The current implementation is Event Router.
