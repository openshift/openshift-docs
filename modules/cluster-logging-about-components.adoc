= About {logging} components

The {logging} components include a collector deployed to each node in the {product-title} cluster
that collects all node and container logs and writes them to a log store. You can use a centralized web UI to create rich visualizations and dashboards with the aggregated data.

The major components of the {logging} are:

* collection - This is the component that collects logs from the cluster, formats them, and forwards them to the log store. The current implementation is Fluentd.
* log store - This is where the logs are stored. The default implementation is Elasticsearch. You can use the default Elasticsearch log store or forward logs to external log stores. The default log store is optimized and tested for short-term storage.
* visualization - This is the UI component you can use to view logs, graphs, charts, and so forth. The current implementation is Kibana.
