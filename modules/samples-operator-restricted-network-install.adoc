= Restricted network installation

[role="_abstract"]
The Cluster Samples Operator boostrapping itself as `Removed` when unable to access `registry.redhat.io` facilitates restricted network installations when the network restriction is already in place.

As a cluster administrator, you have more time to decide if samples are needed when the Operator is boostrapped `Removed`. This is because the Cluster Samples Operator does not submit alerts that sample image stream imports are failing when the management state is `Removed`. When the Cluster Samples Operator management state is `Managed`, and the Operator attempts to install sample image streams, failing-import alerts start two hours after initial installation.
