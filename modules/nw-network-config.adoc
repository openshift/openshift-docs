= Network configuration phases

When specifying a cluster configuration prior to installation, there are several phases in the installation procedures when you can modify the network configuration:

Phase 1:: After entering the `openshift-install create install-config` command. In the `install-config.yaml` file, you can customize the following network-related fields:
+
* `networking.networkType`
* `networking.clusterNetwork`
* `networking.serviceNetwork`
* `networking.machineNetwork`
+
For more information on these fields, refer to "Installation configuration parameters".
+
[NOTE]
====
Set the `networking.machineNetwork` to match the CIDR that the preferred NIC resides in.
====

Phase 2:: After entering the `openshift-install create manifests` command. If you must specify advanced network configuration, during this phase you can define a customized Cluster Network Operator manifest with only the fields you want to modify.

You cannot override the values specified in phase 1 in the `install-config.yaml` file during phase 2. However, you can further customize the cluster network provider during phase 2.
