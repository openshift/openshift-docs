= Creating object count quotas

You can create an object count quota for all {product-title} standard namespaced
resource types, such as `BuildConfig`, and `DeploymentConfig`. An object quota
count places a defined quota on all standard namespaced resource types.

When using a resource quota, an object is charged against the quota if it exists
in server storage. These types of quotas are useful to protect against
exhaustion of storage resources.

.Procedure

To configure an object count quota for a resource:

. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create quota <name> \
    --hard=count/<resource>.<group>=<quota>,count/<resource>.<group>=<quota> <1>
----
<1> `<resource>` is the name of the resource, and `<group>` is the API group, if
applicable. Use the `oc api-resources` command for a list of resources and
their associated API groups.
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create quota test \
    --hard=count/deployments.extensions=2,count/replicasets.extensions=4,count/pods=3,count/secrets=4
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
resourcequota "test" created
----
+
This example limits the listed resources to the hard limit in each project in
the cluster.

. Verify that the quota was created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe quota test
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Name:                         test
Namespace:                    quota
Resource                      Used  Hard
--------                      ----  ----
count/deployments.extensions  0     2
count/pods                    0     3
count/replicasets.extensions  0     4
count/secrets                 0     4
----
