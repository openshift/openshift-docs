= Deploying Cluster API compute machines by using a Machine API compute machine set

You can configure a Machine API compute machine set to deploy Cluster API compute machines.
With this process, you can test the Cluster API compute machine creation workflow without creating and scaling a Cluster API compute machine set.

A Machine API compute machine set with this configuration creates nonauthoritative Machine API compute machines that use the Cluster API as authoritative.
The two-way synchronization controller then creates corresponding authoritative Cluster API machines that provision on the underlying infrastructure.

:FeatureName: Deploying Cluster API compute machines by using a Machine API compute machine set
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed an {product-title} cluster on a supported infrastructure type.

* You have enabled the use of the Cluster API.

* You have enabled the `MachineAPIMigration` feature gate in the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set.

* You have access to the cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. List the Machine API compute machine sets in your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get machineset.machine.openshift.io -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Edit the resource specification by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset.machine.openshift.io <machine_set_name> \
  -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
where `<machine_set_name>` is the name of the Machine API compute machine set that you want to configure to deploy Cluster API compute machines.

. In the resource specification, update the value of the `spec.template.spec.authoritativeAPI` field:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  [...]
  name: <machine_set_name>
  [...]
spec:
  authoritativeAPI: MachineAPI <1>
  [...]
  template:
    [...]
    spec:
      authoritativeAPI: ClusterAPI <2>
status:
  authoritativeAPI: MachineAPI <3>
  [...]
----
<1> The unconverted value for the Machine API compute machine set.
Do not change the value in this part of the specification.
<2> Specify `ClusterAPI` to configure the compute machine set to deploy Cluster API compute machines.
<3> The current value for the Machine API compute machine set.
Do not change the value in this part of the specification.

.Verification 

. List the machines that are managed by the updated compute machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machines.machine.openshift.io \
  -n openshift-machine-api \
  -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset=<machine_set_name>
----

. To verify that a machine created by the updated machine set has the correct configuration, examine the `status.authoritativeAPI` field in the CR for one of the new machines by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe machines.machine.openshift.io <machine_name> \
  -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
For a Cluster API compute machine, the value of the field is `ClusterAPI`.
