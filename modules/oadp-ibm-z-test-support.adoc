[id="oadp-ibm-z-test-support_{context}"]
= OADP testing and support for target backup locations using {ibm-z-title}

{ibm-z-name} running with {product-title} 4.11 and 4.12, and OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.1.2 was tested successfully against an AWS S3 backup location target. Although the test involved only an AWS S3 target, Red Hat supports running {ibm-z-name} with {product-title} 4.11 and 4.12, and OADP 1.1.2 against all non-AWS S3 backup location targets as well.
