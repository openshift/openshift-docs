= Exposing Elasticsearch as a route

By default, Elasticsearch deployed with cluster logging is not
accessible from outside the logging cluster. You can enable a route with re-encryption termination
for external access to Elasticsearch for those tools that access its data.

Externally, you can access Elasticsearch by creating a reencrypt route, your {product-title} token and the installed
Elasticsearch CA certificate. Then, access an Elasticsearch node with a cURL request that contains:

* The `Authorization: Bearer ${token}`
* The Elasticsearch reencrypt route and an link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/api-conventions.html[Elasticsearch API request].

Internally, you can access Elastiscearch using the Elasticsearch cluster IP:

You can get the Elasticsearch cluster IP using either of the following commands:

----
$ oc get service elasticsearch -o jsonpath={.spec.clusterIP} -n openshift-logging

172.30.183.229
----
----
oc get service elasticsearch

NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
elasticsearch   ClusterIP   172.30.183.229   <none>        9200/TCP   22h

$ oc exec elasticsearch-cdm-oplnhinv-1-5746475887-fj2f8 -- curl -tlsv1.2 --insecure -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" "https://172.30.183.229:9200/_cat/health"

.Prerequisites

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

* You must have access to the project in order to be able to access to the logs.

.Procedure

To expose Elasticsearch externally:

. Change to the `openshift-logging` project:
+
----
$ oc project openshift-logging
----

. Extract the CA certificate from Elasticsearch and write to the *_admin-ca_* file:
+
----
$ oc extract secret/elasticsearch --to=. --keys=admin-ca

admin-ca
----

. Create the route for the Elasticsearch service as a YAML file:
+
.. Create a YAML file with the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  host:
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: elasticsearch
  tls:
    termination: reencrypt
    destinationCACertificate: | <1>
----
<1> Add the Elasticsearch CA certifcate or use the command in the next step. You do not have to set the `spec.tls.key`, `spec.tls.certificate`, and `spec.tls.caCertificate` parameters required by some reencrypt routes.

.. Run the following command to add the Elasticsearch CA certificate to the route YAML you created:
+
----
cat ./admin-ca | sed -e "s/^/      /" >> <file-name>.yaml
----

.. Create the route:
+
----
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml

route.route.openshift.io/elasticsearch created
----
+
//For an example reencrypt route object, see Re-encryption Termination.
//+
//This line ^^ will be linked when the topic is available.

. Check that the Elasticsearch service is exposed:

.. Get the token of this ServiceAccount to be used in the request:
+
----
$ token=$(oc whoami -t)
----

.. Set the *elasticsearch* route you created as an environment variable.
+
----
$ routeES=`oc get route elasticsearch -o jsonpath={.spec.host}`
----

.. To verify the route was successfully created, run the following command that accesses Elasticsearch through the exposed route:
+
----
curl -tlsv1.2 --insecure -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" "https://${routeES}/.operations.*/_search?size=1" | jq
----
+
The response appears similar to the following:
