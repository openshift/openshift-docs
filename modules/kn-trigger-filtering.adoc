= Filtering events with triggers by using the Knative CLI
// should be a procedure module but out of scope for this PR

Using the Knative (`kn`) CLI to filter events by using triggers provides a streamlined and intuitive user interface. You can use the `kn trigger create` command, along with the appropriate flags, to filter events by using triggers.

In the following trigger example, only events with the attribute `type: dev.knative.samples.helloworld` are sent to the event sink:

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn trigger create <trigger_name> --broker <broker_name> --filter type=dev.knative.samples.helloworld --sink ksvc:<service_name>
----

You can also filter events by using multiple attributes. The following example shows how to filter events using the type, source, and extension attributes:

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn trigger create <trigger_name> --broker <broker_name> --sink ksvc:<service_name> \
--filter type=dev.knative.samples.helloworld \
--filter source=dev.knative.samples/helloworldsource \
--filter myextension=my-extension-value
----
