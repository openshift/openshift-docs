= About the KMS encryption provider

If you are using a third party key management service (KMS) it can be integrated into {product-title} so you can use it from the command line.

A KMS in this context allows {product-title} to use an external key management system to secure sensitive data by encrypting the encryption keys themselves, providing an additional layer of security. {product-short} uses KMS v2, KMS v1 is not supported.
