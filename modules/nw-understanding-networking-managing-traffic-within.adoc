[id="nw-understanding-networking-managing-traffic-within_{context}"]
= Managing traffic within the cluster

Your applications need to communicate with each other inside the cluster. {product-title} provides two primary mechanisms for internal traffic: direct pod-to-pod communication for simple exchanges and robust service discovery for reliable connections.

[id="pod-to-pod-communication_{context}"]
== Pod-to-pod communication

Pods communicate directly using the unique IP addresses assigned by the pod network. A pod on one node can send traffic directly to a pod on another node without any network address translation (NAT). This direct communication model is efficient for services that need to exchange data quickly. Applications can simply target another podâ€™s IP address to establish a connection.

[id="service-discovery-with-dns_{context}"]
== Service discovery with DNS

Pods need a reliable way to find each other because pod IP addresses are ephemeral. {product-title} uses `CoreDNS`, a built-in DNS server, to provide this service discovery.

Every service you create automatically receives a stable DNS name. A pod can use this DNS name to connect to the service. The DNS system resolves the name to the service's stable `ClusterIP` address. This process ensures reliable communication even when individual pod IPs change.
