= About dependency resolution

OLM manages the dependency resolution and upgrade lifecycle of running
Operators. In many ways, the problems OLM faces are similar to other operating
system package managers like `yum` and `rpm`.

However, there is one constraint that similar systems do not generally have that
OLM does: because Operators are always running, OLM attempts to ensure that you
are never left with a set of Operators that do not work with each other.

This means that OLM must never do the following:

- Install a set of Operators that require APIs that cannot be provided.
- Update an Operator in a way that breaks another that depends upon it.
