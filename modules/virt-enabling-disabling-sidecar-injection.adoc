= Enabling and disabling sidecar injection

When deploying an application into the {ProductName}, you may opt in or out of using sidecar injection by specifying the `sidecar.istio.io/inject` annotation. If the `sidecar.istio.io/inject` annotation is added to the configuration YAML with a value of `"true"`, sidecar injection is enabled. If the annotation is added to the configuration YAML file with a value of `"false"`, sidecar injection is disabled.

NOTE: Opting in ensures that the sidecar injection does not interfere with other OpenShift features such as builder pods used by numerous frameworks within the OpenShift ecosystem.

.Prerequisites

* Identify the deployments for which you want to enable automatic sidecar injection.
* Locate the application's YAML configuration file.

.Procedure

. Open the application's configuration YAML file in an editor.

. Add `sidecar.istio.io/inject` to the configuration YAML with a value of either `"true"` or `"false"` to enable or disable sidecar injection as illustrated here:
