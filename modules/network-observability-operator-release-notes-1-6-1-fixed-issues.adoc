= Network Observability Operator release notes 1.6.1 fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the fixed issues for the Network Observability Operator 1.6.1 release.

* Previously, information about packet drops, such as the cause and TCP state, was only available in the Loki datastore and not in Prometheus. For that reason, the drop statistics in the OpenShift web console plugin *Overview* was only available with Loki. With this fix, information about packet drops is also added to metrics, so you can view drops statistics when Loki is disabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1649[*NETOBSERV-1649*])
* When the eBPF agent `PacketDrop` feature was enabled, and sampling was configured to a value greater than `1`, reported dropped bytes and dropped packets ignored the sampling configuration. While this was done on purpose, so as not to miss any drops, a side effect was that the reported proportion of drops compared with non-drops became biased. For example, at a very high sampling rate, such as `1:1000`, it was likely that almost all the traffic appears to be dropped when observed from the console plugin. With this fix, the sampling configuration is honored with dropped bytes and packets. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1676[*NETOBSERV-1676*])
* Previously, the SR-IOV secondary interface was not detected if the interface was created first and then the eBPF agent was deployed. It was only detected if the agent was deployed first and then the SR-IOV interface was created. With this fix, the SR-IOV secondary interface is detected no matter the sequence of the deployments. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1697[*NETOBSERV-1697*])
* Previously, when Loki was disabled, the *Topology* view in the OpenShift web console displayed the *Cluster* and *Zone* aggregation options in the slider beside the network topology diagram, even when the related features were not enabled. With this fix, the slider now only displays options according to the enabled features. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1705[*NETOBSERV-1705*])
* Previously, when Loki was disabled, and the OpenShift web console was first loading, an error would occur: `Request failed with status code 400 Loki is disabled`. With this fix, the errors no longer occur. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1706[*NETOBSERV-1706*])
* Previously, in the *Topology* view of the OpenShift web console, when clicking on the *Step into* icon next to any graph node, the filters were not applied as required in order to set the focus to the selected graph node, resulting in showing a wide view of the *Topology* view in the OpenShift web console. With this fix, the filters are correctly set, effectively narrowing down the *Topology*. As part of this change, clicking the *Step into* icon on a *Node* now brings you to the *Resource* scope instead of the *Namespaces* scope. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1720[*NETOBSERV-1720*])
* Previously, when Loki was disabled, in the *Topology* view of the OpenShift web console with the *Scope* set to *Owner*, clicking on the *Step into* icon next to any graph node would bring the *Scope* to *Resource*, which is not available without Loki, so an error message was shown. With this fix, the *Step into* icon is hidden in the *Owner* scope when Loki is disabled, so this scenario no longer occurs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1721[*NETOBSERV-1721*])
* Previously, when Loki was disabled, an error was displayed in the *Topology* view of the OpenShift web console when a group was set, but then the scope was changed so that the group becomes invalid. With this fix, the invalid group is removed, preventing the error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1722[*NETOBSERV-1722*])
* When creating a `FlowCollector` resource from the OpenShift web console *Form view*, as opposed to the *YAML view*, the following settings were incorrectly managed by the web console: `agent.ebpf.metrics.enable` and `processor.subnetLabels.openShiftAutoDetect`. These settings can only be disabled in the *YAML view*, not in the *Form view*. To avoid any confusion, these settings have been removed from the *Form view*. They are still accessible in the *YAML view*. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1731[*NETOBSERV-1731*])
* Previously, the eBPF agent was unable to clean up traffic control flows installed before an ungraceful crash, for example a crash due to a SIGTERM signal. This led to the creation of multiple traffic control flow filters with the same name, since the older ones were not removed. With this fix, all previously installed traffic control flows are cleaned up when the agent starts, before installing new ones. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1732[*NETOBSERV-1732*])
* Previously, when configuring custom subnet labels and keeping the OpenShift subnets auto-detection enabled, OpenShift subnets would take precedence over the custom ones, preventing the definition of custom labels for in cluster subnets. With this fix, custom defined subnets take precedence, allowing the definition of custom labels for in cluster subnets. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1734[*NETOBSERV-1734*])
