== New features

Extended JSON logging support to additional Argo CD components::
With this update, the `logFormat: json` setting in the Argo CD custom resource (CR) is supported by the `ApplicationSet` controller and `Notifications` controller. Previously, JSON logging was limited to components such as the API server, repo server, and application controller.
+
[NOTE]
====
Redis and Dex do not support configurable JSON logging and are unaffected by this change.

Argo CD Agent (Technology Preview)::
With this update, a productized container image of the Argo CD Agent is available, along with a custom property in the Argo CD custom resource (CR) to enable the principal component in the hub cluster. For more information, see link:https://argocd-agent.readthedocs.io/latest/[Overview of the Argo CD Agent].
+
[WARNING]
==== 	
The {gitops-shortname} `argocd-agent` feature is a Technology Preview feature.

[id="fixed-issues-1-17-0_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

Fixed replica count for `redis-ha-haproxy` to ensure high availability::
Before this update, an error in configuration caused the `redis-ha-haproxy` deployment to use only one replica. This resulted in access issues with the Redis cache. With this update, the number of `redis-ha-haproxy` replicas matches the High Availability (HA) configuration. Three replicas are created by default, which improves Redis cache availability and resilience.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6806[GITOPS-6806]

Fixed invalid Route hostnames for Argo CD webhook server::
Before this update, enabling `applicationSet.webhookServer.route` caused an invalid route error due to the default hostname exceeding the Kubernetes label value limit. This issue resulted in application deployment failures. With this update, the default hostname is generated using the Argo CD instance name and namespace, ensuring it stays within the valid length limits. This fix resolves the error and allows successful creation of the webhook server route.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6707[GITOPS-6707]

Support added for repeated flags in `extraCommandArgs`::
Before this update, the `extraCommandArgs` field in the Argo CD custom resource did not support using the same flag multiple times with different values. With this update, repeated flags are correctly handled. Multiple instances of flags can be specified, and all values are included in the controller pod configuration.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6703[GITOPS-6703]

Fixed UI error when editing HTTP-based repository credentials::
Before this update, you could not edit HTTP repository credentials from the Argo CD web UI. This limited the ability to manage HTTP-based repository configurations through the web interface. With this update, URL validation logic is enhanced, and you can edit HTTP repository credentials in the web UI.

[id="deprecated-features-1-17-0_{context}"]
== Deprecated and removed features

Deprecation of Keycloak support in {gitops-title}::
In {gitops-title} 1.17, the support for Keycloak-based authentication is deprecated. When Keycloak is configured for single sign-on (SSO), deprecation warnings appear in the logs. Dex is the default and recommended authentication provider. It integrates with the OpenShift OAuth server and supports authentication based on OpenShift users and groups. You must migrate to Dex-based authentication for continued support. To continue using Keycloak, you must deploy and manage the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_keycloak/26.0/html/operator_guide/installation-[Red Hat Build of Keycloak (RHBK)] instance and manually configure the integration in the Argo CD custom resource. 
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-7070[GITOPS-7070]

Removed support for deprecated `initialRepositories` and `repositoryCredentials` fields::
In {gitops-title} 1.17, support for the deprecated `initialRepositories` and `repositoryCredentials` fields is removed. If these fields are used, Argo CD logs a warning indicating their removal. You can add repositories and repository credentials manually by using the Argo CD CLI or the Argo CD dashboard.

[id="breaking-changes-1-17-0_{context}"]
== Breaking changes

Upgrade to Argo CD 3.0::

This release introduces an upgrade to the Argo CD component, transitioning from v2.14 to v3.0. This is a minor upgrade that introduces a list of breaking changes in Argo CD v3.0, with solutions provided in the following section. For more information, see link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/[Upgrading Argo CD from v2.0 to v3.0].

RBAC behavior changes with Argo CD 3.0 and Dex SSO::
Argo CD 3.0 introduces a change in RBAC handling when using Dex for single sign-on (SSO). The RBAC system uses the `federated_claims.user_id` field instead of the previously encoded sub claim. This change affects how user identities are evaluated and matched in RBAC policies. You must review and update your RBAC policies to ensure compatibility with Argo CD 3.0. For more information, see link:https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrading/#rbac-with-dex-sso-authentication[Configuring RBAC with Dex SSO Authentication].
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6887[GITOPS-6887]

Added guidance for logs RBAC enforcement in Argo CD 3.0::
Before this update, users with access to applications could also view logs.  With this update, Argo CD 3.0 uses a separate RBAC resource to control log access, which requires explicit permissions. For more information, see link:https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrading/#logs-rbac-enforcement[Logs RBAC Enforcement].
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-6886[GITOPS-6886]

Fine-grained RBAC inheritance enabled by default::
Starting with Argo CD v3.0, fine-grained RBAC inheritance of applications is disabled, making `update` and `delete` actions apply only to the application resource. To perform these actions on managed resources, you must configure new policies. To maintain the Argo CD v2.0 behavior, the `server.rbac.disableApplicationFineGrainedRBACInheritance` parameter is set to `false` by default in the `argocd-cm` config map. You can enable the new fine-grained RBAC functionality by setting the following configuration in the Argo CD custom resource:
+
[source,YAML]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1beta1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  # ...
  extraConfig:
    server.rbac.disableApplicationFineGrainedRBACInheritance: true # <1>
  # ...
----
<1> Set `server.rbac.disableApplicationFineGrainedRBACInheritance` to `true` to maintain Argo CD v3.0 behavior.
