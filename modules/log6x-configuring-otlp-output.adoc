= Configuring OTLP output

Cluster administrators can use the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) output to collect and forward logs to OTLP receivers. The OTLP output uses the specification defined by the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/[OpenTelemetry Observability framework] to send data over HTTP with JSON encoding.

.Procedure

* Create or edit a `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR) to enable forwarding using OTLP by adding the following annotation:

<1> Use this annotation to enable the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) output, which is a Technology Preview feature.
<2> This URL must be absolute and is a placeholder for the OTLP endpoint where logs are sent.

[NOTE]
====
The OTLP output uses the OpenTelemetry data model, which is different from the ViaQ data model that is used by other output types. It adheres to the OTLP using https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/[OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions] defined by the OpenTelemetry Observability framework.
