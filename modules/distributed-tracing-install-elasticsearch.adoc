= Installing the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator

The default Jaeger deployment uses in-memory storage because it is designed to be installed quickly for those evaluating Jaeger, giving demonstrations, or using Jaeger in a test environment. If you plan to use Jaeger in production, you must install and configure a persistent storage option, in this case, Elasticsearch.

.Prerequisites
* Access to the {product-title} web console.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

[WARNING]
====
Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you have already installed the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator as part of OpenShift Logging, you do not need to install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator again. The Jaeger Operator will create the Elasticsearch instance using the installed OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type *Elasticsearch* into the filter box to locate the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.

. Click the *OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator* provided by Red Hat to display information about the Operator.

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page, under *Installation Mode* select *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.

. Under *Installed Namespaces* select *openshift-operators-redhat* from the menu.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Elasticsearch installation requires the *openshift-operators-redhat* namespace for the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. The other {ProductName} operators are installed in the `openshift-operators` namespace.
====
+
. Select *stable-5.x* as the *Update Channel*.

. Select the *Automatic* Approval Strategy.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Manual approval strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator install and subscription process.
====

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Installed Operators* page, select the `openshift-operators-redhat` project. Wait until you see that the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator shows a status of "InstallSucceeded" before continuing.
