= Querying metrics for user-defined projects as a developer

You can access metrics for a user-defined project as a developer or as a user with view permissions for the project.

In the *Developer* perspective, the Metrics UI includes some predefined CPU, memory, bandwidth, and network packet queries for the selected project. You can also run custom Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries for CPU, memory, bandwidth, network packet and application metrics for the project.

[NOTE]
====
Developers can only use the *Developer* perspective and not the *Administrator* perspective. As a developer, you can only query metrics for one project at a time.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a developer or as a user with view permissions for the project that you are viewing metrics for.
* You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have deployed a service in a user-defined project.

.Procedure

. From the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console, select *Observe* -> *Metrics*.

. Select the project that you want to view metrics for in the *Project:* list.

. Select a query from the *Select query* list, or create a custom PromQL query based on the selected query by selecting *Show PromQL*. The metrics from the queries are visualized on the plot.
