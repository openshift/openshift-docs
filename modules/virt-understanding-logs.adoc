= Understanding virtual machine logs

Logs are collected for {product-title} Builds, Deployments, and Pods.
In {VirtProductName}, virtual machine logs can be retrieved from the
virtual machine launcher Pod in either the web console or the CLI.

The `-f` option follows the log output in real time, which is useful for
monitoring progress and error checking.

If the launcher Pod is failing to start, use the
`--previous` option to see the logs of the last attempt.

[WARNING]
====
`ErrImagePull` and `ImagePullBackOff` errors can be caused by
an incorrect Deployment configuration or problems with the images that are
referenced.
