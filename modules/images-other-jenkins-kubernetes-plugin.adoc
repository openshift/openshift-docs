= Using the Jenkins Kubernetes plug-in

In the following example, the `openshift-jee-sample` BuildConfig causes a
Jenkins Maven agent Pod to be dynamically provisioned. The Pod clones some Java
source code, builds a WAR file, and causes a second BuildConfig,
`openshift-jee-sample-docker` to run. The second BuildConfig layers the new WAR
file into a container image.

The following example is a BuildConfig that uses the Jenkins Kubernetes plug-in.

It is also possible to override the specification of the dynamically created
Jenkins agent pod. The following is a modification to the previous example, which
overrides the container memory and specifies an environment variable:

The following example is a BuildConfig that the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in,
specifying memory limit and environment variable.

<1> A new Pod template called `mypod` is defined dynamically. The new Pod
template name is referenced in the node stanza.
<2> The `cloud` value must be set to `openshift`.
<3> The new Pod template can inherit its configuration from an existing Pod
template. In this case, inherited from the Maven Pod template that is
pre-defined by {product-title}.
<4> This example overrides values in the pre-existing Container, and must be
specified by name. All Jenkins agent images shipped with {product-title} use
the Container name `jnlp`.
<5> Specify the Container image name again. This is a known issue.
<6> A memory request of `512 Mi` is specified.
<7> A memory limit of `512 Mi` is specified.
<8> An environment variable `CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT`, with value `0.25`, is
specified.
<9> The node stanza references the name of the defined Pod template.

By default, the pod is deleted when the build completes. This behavior can be
modified with the plug-in or within a pipeline Jenkinsfile.
