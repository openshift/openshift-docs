= Example: Linux bridge interface node network configuration policy to inherit static IP address from the NIC attached to the bridge

Create a Linux bridge interface on nodes in the cluster and transfer the static IP configuration of the NIC to the bridge by applying a single `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest to the cluster.

The following YAML file is an example of a manifest for a Linux bridge interface. It includes sample values that you must replace with your own information.

apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1

  name: br1-eth1-copy-ipv4-policy <1>

            stp:
              enabled: false

     routes:
        config: "{{ capture.br1-routes.routes.running }}"
----
<1> The name of the policy.
<2> Optional: If you do not include the `nodeSelector` parameter, the policy applies to all nodes in the cluster. This example uses the `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""` node selector to select all worker nodes in the cluster.
<3> The reference to the node NIC to which the bridge attaches.
<4> The type of interface. This example creates a bridge.
<5> The IP address of the bridge interface. This value matches the IP address of the NIC which is referenced by the `spec.capture.eth1-nic` entry.
<6> The node NIC to which the bridge attaches.
