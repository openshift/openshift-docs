= Applying 3scale external ServiceEntry objects

To have the `threescale-wasm-auth` module authorize requests against 3scale, the module must have access to 3scale services. You can accomplish this within {ProductName} and Istio by applying an external `ServiceEntry` object.

The custom resources set up the service entries for access from within {ProductShortName} to 3scale Hosted (SaaS) for the backend and system components of the Service Management API and the Account Management API. The Service Management API receives queries for the authorization status of each request. The Account Management API provides API management configuration settings for your services.

.Procedure

* Apply the following external `ServiceEntry` custom resources to your cluster:
+
.Custom resource for 3scale Hosted backend
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: threescale-saas-backend
spec:
  hosts:
  - su1.3scale.net
  ports:
  - number: 443
    name: https
    protocol: HTTPS
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  resolution: DNS
----
+
.Custom resource for 3scale Hosted system
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: threescale-saas-system
spec:
  hosts:
  - multitenant.3scale.net
  ports:
  - number: 443
    name: https
    protocol: HTTPS
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  resolution: DNS
----
+
You can use the `oc apply` command with either of the following methods to apply the objects:

** Save the objects to one or more files, and then use the following syntax:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename.yml>
----

** To apply the objects without first saving them to a file, use the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo -n "<filename.yml>" | oc apply -f -
----

Alternatively, you can deploy an in-mesh 3scale service. To do this, change the location of these services in the custom resources.
