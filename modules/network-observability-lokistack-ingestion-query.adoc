= Configuring LokiStack ingestion
The LokiStack instance comes with default settings according to the configured size. It is possible to override some of these settings, such as the ingestion and query limits. You might want to update them if you get Loki errors showing up in the Console plugin, or in `flowlogs-pipeline` logs.

Here is an example of configured limits:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  limits:
    global:
      ingestion:
        ingestionBurstSize: 40
        ingestionRate: 20
        maxGlobalStreamsPerTenant: 25000
      queries:
        maxChunksPerQuery: 2000000
        maxEntriesLimitPerQuery: 10000
        maxQuerySeries: 3000
----
Refer to the LokiStack API reference for more information on these settings.

A good practice is to define an alert, to get notified when these limits are reached. In the example below, the alert uses a metric provided by the Loki operator, `loki_request_duration_seconds_count`:

[source,yaml]
----

apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: loki-alerts
  namespace: openshift-operators-redhat
spec:
  groups:
  - name: LokiRateLimitAlerts
    rules:
    - alert: LokiTenantRateLimit
      annotations:
        message: |-
          {{ $labels.job }} {{ $labels.route }} is experiencing 429 errors.
        summary: "At any number of requests are responded with the rate limit error code."
      expr: sum(irate(loki_request_duration_seconds_count{status_code="429"}[1m])) by (job, namespace, route) / sum(irate(loki_request_duration_seconds_count[1m])) by (job, namespace, route) * 100 > 0
      for: 10s
      labels:
        severity: warning
