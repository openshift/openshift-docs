= Checking creation of ANP

To check that your `AdminNetworkPolicy` (ANP) and `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` (BANP) are created correctly, check the status outputs of the following commands: `oc describe anp` or `oc describe banp`.

A good status indicates `OVN DB plumbing was successful` and the `SetupSucceeded`.
