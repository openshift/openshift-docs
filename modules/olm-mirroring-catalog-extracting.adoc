= Extracting and mirroring catalog contents

The `oc adm catalog mirror` command extracts the contents of an index image to generate the manifests required for mirroring. The default behavior of the command generates manifests, then automatically mirrors all of the image content from the index image, as well as the index image itself, to your mirror registry.

Alternatively, if your mirror registry is on a completely disconnected, or _airgapped_, host, you can first mirror the content to removable media, move the media to the disconnected environment, then mirror the content from the media to the registry.
