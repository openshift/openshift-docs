= Adding notification contacts to your cluster

Notification contacts receive emails when cluster notifications are sent to the cluster.
By default, only the cluster owner receives cluster notification emails. You can configure other cluster users as additional notification contacts in your cluster support settings.

.Prerequisites
* Your cluster is deployed and registered to the {hybrid-console}.
* You are logged in to the {hybrid-console-second} as the cluster owner or as a user with the cluster editor role.
* The intended notification recipient has a Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal account associated with the same organization as the cluster owner.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the Clusters page of the {hybrid-console-second}.
. Click the name of your cluster to go to the cluster details page.
. Click the **Support** tab.
. On the **Support** tab, find the **Notification contacts** section.
. Click **Add notification contact**.
. In the **Red{nbsp}Hat username or email** field, enter the email address or the user name of the new recipient.
//. In the type field, select the types of cluster notification to send to this recipient.
. Click **Add contact**.

.Verification steps
* The "Notification contact added successfully" message displays.

.Troubleshooting

The *Add notification contact* button is disabled::
This button is disabled for users who do not have permission to add a notification contact. Log in to an account with the cluster owner, cluster editor, or cluster administrator role and try again.

Error: `Could not find any account identified by <username>` or `<email-address>`::
This error occurs when the intended notification recipient is not part of the same Red{nbsp}Hat account organization as the cluster owner. Contact your organization administrator to add the intended recipient to the relevant organization and try again.
