= Configuring systemd-journald for OpenShift Logging

As you scale up your project, the default logging environment might need some
adjustments.

For example, if you are missing logs, you might have to increase the rate limits for journald.
You can adjust the number of messages to retain for a specified period of time to ensure that
OpenShift Logging does not use excessive resources without dropping logs.

You can also determine if you want the logs compressed, how long to retain logs, how or if the logs are stored,
and other settings.

.Procedure

. Create a Butane config file, `40-worker-custom-journald.bu`, that includes an `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file with the required settings.

<1> Set the permissions for the `journal.conf` file. It is recommended to set `0644` permissions.
<2> Specify whether you want logs compressed before they are written to the file system.
Specify `yes` to compress the message or `no` to not compress. The default is `yes`.
<3> Configure whether to forward log messages. Defaults to `no` for each. Specify:
* `ForwardToConsole` to forward logs to the system console.
* `ForwardToKsmg` to forward logs to the kernel log buffer.
* `ForwardToSyslog` to forward to a syslog daemon.
* `ForwardToWall` to forward messages as wall messages to all logged-in users.
<4> Specify the maximum time to store journal entries. Enter a number to specify seconds. Or
include a unit: "year", "month", "week", "day", "h" or "m". Enter `0` to disable. The default is `1month`.
<5> Configure rate limiting. If more logs are received than what is specified in `RateLimitBurst` during the time interval defined by `RateLimitIntervalSec`, all further messages within the interval are dropped until the interval is over. It is recommended to set `RateLimitIntervalSec=30s` and `RateLimitBurst=10000`, which are the defaults.
<6> Specify how logs are stored. The default is `persistent`:
* `volatile` to store logs in memory in `/var/log/journal/`.
* `persistent` to store logs to disk in `/var/log/journal/`. systemd creates the directory if it does not exist.
* `auto` to store logs in `/var/log/journal/` if the directory exists. If it does not exist, systemd temporarily stores logs in `/run/systemd/journal`.
* `none` to not store logs. systemd drops all logs.
<7> Specify the timeout before synchronizing journal files to disk for *ERR*, *WARNING*, *NOTICE*, *INFO*, and *DEBUG* logs.
systemd immediately syncs after receiving a *CRIT*, *ALERT*, or *EMERG* log. The default is `1s`.
<8> Specify the maximum size the journal can use. The default is `8g`.
<9> Specify how much disk space systemd must leave free. The default is `20%`.
<10> Specify the maximum size for individual journal files stored persistently in `/var/log/journal`. The default is `10M`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are removing the rate limit, you might see increased CPU utilization on the
system logging daemons as it processes any messages that would have previously
been throttled.

. Use Butane to generate a `MachineConfig` object file, `40-worker-custom-journald.yaml`, containing the configuration to be delivered to the nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ butane 40-worker-custom-journald.bu -o 40-worker-custom-journald.yaml
----

. Apply the machine config. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f 40-worker-custom-journald.yaml
----
+
The controller detects the new `MachineConfig` object and generates a new `rendered-worker-<hash>` version.

. Monitor the status of the rollout of the new rendered configuration to each node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe machineconfigpool/worker
