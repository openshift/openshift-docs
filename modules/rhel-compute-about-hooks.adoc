= About Ansible hooks for upgrades

When you update {product-title}, you can run custom tasks on your Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) nodes during specific operations by using _hooks_. Hooks
allow you to provide files that define tasks to run before or after specific
update tasks. You can use hooks to validate or modify custom
infrastructure when you update the RHEL compute nodes in you {product-title}
cluster.

Because when a hook fails, the operation fails, you must design hooks that are
idempotent, or can run multiple times and provide the same results.

Hooks have the following important limitations:
- Hooks do not have a defined or versioned interface. They can use internal
`openshift-ansible` variables, but it is possible that the variables will be
modified or removed in future {product-title} releases.
- Hooks do not have error handling, so an error in a hook halts the update
process. If you get an error, you must address the problem and then start the
upgrade again.
