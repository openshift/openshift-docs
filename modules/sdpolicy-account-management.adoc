[id="billing_{context}"]
== Billing
Each {product-title} cluster requires a minimum annual base cluster purchase and there are two billing options available for each cluster: Standard and Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS).

Standard {product-title} clusters are deployed in to their own cloud infrastructure accounts, each owned by Red Hat. Red Hat is responsible for this account, and cloud infrastructure costs are paid directly by Red Hat. The customer only pays the Red Hat subscription costs.

In the CCS model, the customer pays the cloud infrastructure provider directly for cloud costs and the cloud infrastructure account is part of a customer’s Organization, with specific access granted to Red Hat. In this model, the customer pays Red Hat for the CCS subscription and pays the cloud provider for the cloud costs. It is the customer's responsibility to pre-purchase or provide Reserved Instance (RI) compute instances to ensure lower cloud infrastructure costs.

Additional resources can be purchased for an OpenShift Dedicated Cluster, including:

* Additional nodes (can be different types and sizes through the use of machine pools)
* Middleware (JBoss EAP, JBoss Fuse, and so on) - additional pricing based on specific middleware component
* Additional storage in increments of 500 GB (standard only; 100 GB included)
* Additional 12 TiB Network I/O (standard only; 12 TB included)
* Load Balancers for Services are available in bundles of 4; enables non-HTTP/SNI traffic or non-standard ports (standard only)

[id="cluster-self-service_{context}"]
== Cluster self-service

Customers can create, scale, and delete their clusters from link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM)], provided that they have pre-purchased the necessary subscriptions.

Actions available in {OCM} must not be directly performed from within the cluster as this might cause adverse affects, including having all actions automatically reverted.

[id="cloud-providers_{context}"]
== Cloud providers

{product-title} offers OpenShift Container Platform clusters as a managed service on the following cloud providers:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

[id="compute_{context}"]
== Compute

Single availability zone clusters require a minimum of 2 worker nodes for Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) clusters deployed to a single availability zone. A minimum of 4 worker nodes is required for standard clusters. These 4 worker nodes are included in the base subscription.

Multiple availability zone clusters require a minimum of 3 worker nodes for Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) clusters, 1 deployed to each of 3 availability zones. A minimum of 9 worker nodes are required for standard clusters. These 9 worker nodes are included in the base subscription, and additional nodes must be purchased in multiples of 3 to maintain proper node distribution.

Worker nodes must all be the same type and size within a single {product-title} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The default machine pool node type and size cannot be changed after the cluster has been created.
====

Control and infrastructure nodes are also provided by Red Hat. There are at least 3 control planenodes that handle etcd and API-related workloads. There are at least 2 infrastructure nodes that handle metrics, routing, the web console, and other workloads. Control and infrastructure nodes are strictly for Red Hat workloads to operate the service, and customer workloads are not permitted to be deployed on these nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Approximately 1 vCPU core and 1 GiB of memory are reserved on each worker node and removed from allocatable resources. This is necessary to run link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#system-reserved[processes required by the underlying platform]. This includes system daemons such as udev, kubelet, container runtime, and so on, and also accounts for kernel reservations. {OCP} core systems such as audit log aggregation, metrics collection, DNS, image registry, SDN, and so on might consume additional allocatable resources to maintain the stability and maintainability of the cluster. The additional resources consumed might vary based on usage.

Multi-AZ clusters can only be deployed in regions with at least 3 availability zones (see link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/[AWS] and link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones[Google Cloud]).

Each new {product-title} cluster is installed within a dedicated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in a single Region, with the option to deploy into a single Availability Zone (Single-AZ) or across multiple Availability Zones (Multi-AZ). This provides cluster-level network and resource isolation, and enables cloud-provider VPC settings, such as VPN connections and VPC Peering. Persistent volumes are backed by cloud block storage and are specific to the availability zone in which they are provisioned. Persistent volumes do not bind to a volume until the associated pod resource is assigned into a specific availability zone in order to prevent unschedulable pods. Availability zone-specific resources are only usable by resources in the same availability zone.

[WARNING]
====
The region and the choice of single or multi availability zone cannot be changed once a cluster has been deployed.
