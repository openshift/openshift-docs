= Creating the HardwareEvent Kind CR

Details of the CR parameters are in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y5I0WwERkY_zItPVbYV8Y3AF-QLzRLH18tD4JU8Y0FY/edit
If everything configured correctly, users can see HW events and faults reported in the logs.

Implementation of the Operator:
Name: hw-event-proxy-operator
Type: Go Operator.
Should be able to deploy contents included in https://github.com/redhat-cne/hw-event-proxy/tree/main/manifests/base
Operator needs to be visible in the operator hub

WIP: https://github.com/redhat-cne/hw-event-proxy-operator

1. Have HardwareEvent Kind CRD, Also there can be only one CR which is ensured by validating webhook.
So if a customer tries to create another CR then it will fail. This is to satisfy the requirement that only one instance of HW event proxy can be running in the cluster
2. The HardwareEvent Kind will have following properties
       a. Size =1, default to 1, and the operator makes sure it always stays one # Validate in the controller
        c. REDFISH Host address
        c. amqURL
       d. LOG_LEVEL  ( Not sure  if we need to allow consumers to change timeout )
      e  Time_OUT  (Same not sure if we need to allow consumers to change timeout )
3. Controller  will be doing the following validations
            a.Validate is secret is created  for  Redfish Username and password
           b. REDFISH Host address present
           c. amqURL  address is present but won't check if operator itself is installed, which yo can add dependency in CSV while packaging
