= Required Azure roles

An {product-title} cluster requires an Azure identity to create and manage Azure resources. Before you create the identity, verify that your environment meets the following requirements:

* The Azure account that you use to create the identity is assigned the `User Access Administrator` and `Contributor` roles. These roles are required when:
** Creating a service principal or user-assigned managed identity.
** Enabling a system-assigned managed identity on a virtual machine.
* If you are going to use a service principal to complete the installation, verify that the Azure account that you use to create the identity is assigned the `microsoft.directory/servicePrincipals/createAsOwner` permission in Azure Active Directory.

To set roles on the Azure portal, see the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal[Manage access to Azure resources using RBAC and the Azure portal] in the Azure documentation.
