= Required {azure-short} roles

Before you create the identity, verify that your environment meets the following requirements based on the identity:

* The Azure account that you use to create the identity is assigned the `User Access Administrator` and `Contributor` roles. These roles are required when:

** Creating a service principal or user-assigned managed identity.

** Enabling a system-assigned managed identity on a virtual machine.

* If you are going to use a service principal to complete the installation, verify that the Azure account that you use to create the identity is assigned the `microsoft.directory/servicePrincipals/createAsOwner` permission in Microsoft Entra ID.
