= Verifying secret injection

[role="_abstract"]
Verify the secret injection to ensure that Vault contains the expected values.

.Procedure

. Check the Pod status.

.. After the Argo CD Application has synced and all the resources are deployed, verify that the application pod is running successfully in the `demo-app` namespace. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n demo-app
----

. Open the Shell session.

.. Use the name of the application pod to open a shell session. Replace `<your-app-pod-name>` with the actual pod name.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it <your-app-pod-name> -n demo-app -- sh
----

. Verify mounted secrets.

.. To verify that the secrets are mounted at the expected path, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls -l /mnt/secrets-store
  cat /mnt/secrets-store/demoAppUsername
  cat /mnt/secrets-store/demoAppPassword
----
+
Verify that the mounted secret files `demoAppUsername` and `demoAppPassword` contain the expected values from Vault.
