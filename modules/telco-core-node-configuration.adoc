* Container mount namespace encapsulation and kdump are now available in the {rds} RDS.

Description::
* Container mount namespace encapsulation creates a container mount namespace that reduces system mount scanning and is visible to kubelet and CRI-O.
* kdump is an optional configuration that is enabled by default that captures debug information when a kernel panic occurs.
The reference CRs which enable kdump include an increased memory reservation based on the set of drivers and kernel modules included in the reference configuration.

Limits and requirements::
* Use of kdump and container mount namespace encapsulation is made available through additional kernel modules.
You should analyze these modules to determine impact on CPU load, system performance, and ability to meet required KPIs.

Engineering considerations::
* Install the following kernel modules with `MachineConfig` CRs.
These modules provide extended kernel functionality to cloud-native functions (CNFs).
