= Deleting a buildrun resource

[role="_abstract"]
You can delete a `buildrun` resource created by the `Buildah`, `source-to-image` (S2I), and `Buildpacks` build processes if it is not required in your project. Deleting the resources helps you clean up build configurations that are no longer required in your project.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the `oc` CLI.
* Optional: You have installed the shp CLI.

.Procedure

* Delete a `buildrun` resource by using one of the following CLIs:

** Using `oc` CLI
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete buildrun <buildrun_resource_name> #<1>
----
<1> Replace <buildrun_resource_name> with the name of the `buildrun` resource.

** Using `shp` CLI
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp buildrun delete <buildrun_resource_name> # <1>
----
<1> Replace <buildrun_resource_name> with the name of the `buildrun` resource.

.Verification

* Verify that the `buildrun` resource is deleted by using one of the following CLIs:

** Using `oc` CLI
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get buildrun | grep <buildrun_resource_name> # <1>
----
<1> Replace <buildrun_resource_name> with the name of the `buildrun` resource.
+
If the `buildrun` resource has been successfully deleted, the command will not return any output.
+
** Using `shp` CLI
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp build list | grep <buildrun_resource_name> # <1>
----
<1> Replace <buildrun_resource_name> with the name of the `buildrun` resource.
+
If the `buildrun` resource has been successfully deleted, the command will not return any output.
