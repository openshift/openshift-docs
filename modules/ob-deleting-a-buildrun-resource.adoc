= Deleting a buildrun resource

[role="_abstract"]
Delete a `buildrun` resource created by the `buildah`, `source-to-image` (S2I), and `buildpacks` build processes if it is not required in your project. Deleting the resources helps you clean up build configurations that are no longer required in your project.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the `oc` CLI.
* Optional: You have installed the `shp` CLI.

.Procedure

* Delete a `build` resource by using the `oc` CLI or `shp` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete buildrun <buildrun_resource_name>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp build list | grep <buildrun_resource_name>
----
+
where:

`<buildrun_resource_name>`:: Specifies the name of the `buildrun` resource.
+
If the `buildrun` resource has been successfully deleted, the commands do not return any output.

.Verification

* Verify that the `buildrun` resource is deleted by using the `oc` CLI or `shp` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get buildrun | grep <buildrun_resource_name>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp buildrun list | grep <buildrun_resource_name>
----
+
where:

`<buildrun_resource_name>`:: Specifies the name of the `buildrun` resource.
+
If the `buildrun` resource is successfully deleted, the commands do not return any output.
