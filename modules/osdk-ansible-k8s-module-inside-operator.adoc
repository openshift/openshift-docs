= Testing the k8s Ansible module inside an Operator

After you are familiar with using the `k8s` Ansible module locally, you can trigger the same Ansible logic inside of an Operator when a custom resource (CR) changes. This example maps an Ansible role to a specific Kubernetes resource that the Operator watches. This mapping is done in the `watches.yaml` file.

== Testing an Ansible-based Operator locally

After getting comfortable testing Ansible workflows locally, you can test the logic inside of an Ansible-based Operator running locally.

To do so, use the `operator-sdk run --local` command from the top-level directory of your Operator project. This command reads from the `watches.yaml` file and uses the `~/.kube/config` file to communicate with a Kubernetes cluster just as the `k8s` Ansible module does.

.Procedure

. Because the `run --local` command reads from the `watches.yaml` file, there are options available to the Operator author. If `role` is left alone (by default, `/opt/ansible/roles/<name>`) you must copy the role over to the `/opt/ansible/roles/` directory from the Operator directly.
+
This is cumbersome because changes are not reflected from the current directory. Instead, change the `role` field to point to the current directory and comment out the existing line:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- version: v1alpha1
  group: test1.example.com
  kind: Test1
  #  role: /opt/ansible/roles/Test1
  role: /home/user/test1-operator/Test1
----

. Create a custom resource definition (CRD) and proper role-based access control
(RBAC) definitions for the custom resource (CR) `Test1`. The `operator-sdk`
command autogenerates these files inside of the `deploy/` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f deploy/crds/test1_v1alpha1_test1_crd.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f deploy/role.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
----

. Run the `run --local` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk run --local
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
[...]
INFO[0000] Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8888
INFO[0000] Watching test1.example.com/v1alpha1, Test1, default
----

. Now that the Operator is watching the resource `Test1` for events, the creation of a CR triggers your Ansible role to execute. View the `deploy/cr.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "test1.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Test1"
metadata:
  name: "example"
----
+
Because the `spec` field is not set, Ansible is invoked with no extra variables. The next section covers how extra variables are passed from a CR to Ansible. This is why it is important to set reasonable defaults for the Operator.

. Create a CR instance of `Test1` with the default variable `state` set to `present`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f deploy/cr.yaml
----

. Check that the namespace `test` was created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get namespace
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME          STATUS    AGE
default       Active    28d
kube-public   Active    28d
kube-system   Active    28d
test          Active    3s
----

. Modify the `deploy/cr.yaml` file to set the `state` field to `absent`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "test1.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Test1"
metadata:
  name: "example"
spec:
  state: "absent"
----

. Apply the changes and confirm that the namespace is deleted:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f deploy/cr.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get namespace
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME          STATUS    AGE
default       Active    28d
kube-public   Active    28d
kube-system   Active    28d

== Testing an Ansible-based Operator on a cluster

After getting familiar running Ansible logic inside of an Ansible-based Operator locally, you can test the Operator inside of a pod on a Kubernetes cluster, such as {product-title}. Running as a pod on a cluster is preferred for production use.

.Procedure

. Build the `test1-operator` image and push it to a registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk build quay.io/example/test1-operator:v0.0.1
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman push quay.io/example/test1-operator:v0.0.1
----

. Deployment manifests are generated in the `deploy/operator.yaml` file. The deployment image in this file must be modified from the placeholder `REPLACE_IMAGE` to the previously-built image. To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sed -i 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|quay.io/example/test1-operator:v0.0.1|g' deploy/operator.yaml
----
+
If you are performing these steps on macOS, use the following command instead:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sed -i "" 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|quay.io/example/test1-operator:v0.0.1|g' deploy/operator.yaml
----

. Deploy the `test1-operator`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f deploy/crds/test1_v1alpha1_test1_crd.yaml <1>
----
<1> Only required if the CRD does not exist already.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f deploy/role.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f deploy/operator.yaml
----

. Verify that the `test1-operator` is up and running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
test1-operator       1         1         1            1           1m
----

. You can now view the Ansible logs for the `test1-operator`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs deployment/test1-operator
----
