= Testing the k8s Ansible module inside an Operator

After you are familiar using the `k8s` Ansible module locally, you can trigger
the same Ansible logic inside of an Operator when a Custom Resource (CR)
changes. This example maps an Ansible role to a specific Kubernetes resource
that the Operator watches. This mapping is done in the Watches file.

== Testing an Ansible-based Operator locally

After getting comfortable testing Ansible workflows locally, you can test the
logic inside of an Ansible-based Operator running locally.

To do so, use the `operator-sdk run --local` command from the top-level directory
of your Operator project. This command reads from the `./watches.yaml` file and
uses the `~/.kube/config` file to communicate with a Kubernetes cluster just as
the `k8s` Ansible module does.

.Procedure

. Because the `run --local` command reads from the `./watches.yaml` file, there are
options available to the Operator author. If `role` is left alone (by default,
`/opt/ansible/roles/<name>`) you must copy the role over to the
`/opt/ansible/roles/` directory from the Operator directly.
+
This is cumbersome because changes are not reflected from the current directory.
Instead, change the `role` field to point to the current directory and comment
out the existing line:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- version: v1alpha1
  group: foo.example.com
  kind: Foo
  #  role: /opt/ansible/roles/Foo
  role: /home/user/foo-operator/Foo
----

. Create a Custom Resource Definiton (CRD) and proper role-based access control
(RBAC) definitions for the Custom Resource (CR) `Foo`. The `operator-sdk`
command autogenerates these files inside of the `deploy/` directory:
+
----
$ oc create -f deploy/crds/foo_v1alpha1_foo_crd.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/role.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
----

. Run the `run --local` command:
+
----
$ operator-sdk run --local
[...]
INFO[0000] Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8888
INFO[0000] Watching foo.example.com/v1alpha1, Foo, default
----

. Now that the Operator is watching the resource `Foo` for events, the creation
of a CR triggers your Ansible role to execute. View the `deploy/cr.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "foo.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Foo"
metadata:
  name: "example"
----
+
Because the `spec` field is not set, Ansible is invoked with no extra variables.
The next section covers how extra variables are passed from a CR to Ansible.
This is why it is important to set sane defaults for the Operator.

. Create a CR instance of `Foo` with the default variable `state` set to
`present`:
+
----
$ oc create -f deploy/cr.yaml
----

. Check that the namespace `test` was created:
+
----
$ oc get namespace
NAME          STATUS    AGE
default       Active    28d
kube-public   Active    28d
kube-system   Active    28d
test          Active    3s
----

. Modify the `deploy/cr.yaml` file to set the `state` field to `absent`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "foo.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Foo"
metadata:
  name: "example"
spec:
  state: "absent"
----

. Apply the changes and confirm that the namespace is deleted:
+
----
$ oc apply -f deploy/cr.yaml

$ oc get namespace
NAME          STATUS    AGE
default       Active    28d
kube-public   Active    28d
kube-system   Active    28d

== Testing an Ansible-based Operator on a cluster

After getting familiar running Ansible logic inside of an Ansible-based Operator
locally, you can test the Operator inside of a Pod on a Kubernetes cluster, such
as {product-title}. Running as a Pod on a cluster is preferred for production
use.

.Procedure

. Build the `foo-operator` image and push it to a registry:
+
----
$ operator-sdk build quay.io/example/foo-operator:v0.0.1
$ podman push quay.io/example/foo-operator:v0.0.1
----

. Deployment manifests are generated in the `deploy/operator.yaml` file. The
Deployment image in this file must be modified from the placeholder
`REPLACE_IMAGE` to the previously-built image. To do so, run the following
command:
+
----
$ sed -i 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|quay.io/example/foo-operator:v0.0.1|g' deploy/operator.yaml
----
+
If you are performing these steps on OSX, use the following command instead:
+
----
$ sed -i "" 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|quay.io/example/foo-operator:v0.0.1|g' deploy/operator.yaml
----

. Deploy the `foo-operator`:
+
----
$ oc create -f deploy/crds/foo_v1alpha1_foo_crd.yaml # if CRD doesn't exist already
$ oc create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/role.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/operator.yaml
----

. Verify that the `foo-operator` is up and running:
+
----
$ oc get deployment
NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
foo-operator       1         1         1            1           1m
----

. You can now view the Ansible logs for the `foo-operator`:
+
----
$ oc logs deployment/foo-operator
----
