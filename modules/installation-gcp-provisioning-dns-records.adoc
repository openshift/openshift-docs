= Provisioning your own DNS records

Before you use this feature, you must add the `userProvisionedDNS` parameter to the `install-config.yaml` file and enable the parameter. For more information, see "Enabling a user-managed DNS".

Use the IP address of the API server to provision your own DNS record with the `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` hostname by using your cluster name and base cluster domain. Use the IP address of the Ingress service to provision your own DNS record with the `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` hostname by using your cluster name and base cluster domain.


:FeatureName: User-provisioned DNS
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

.Prerequisites

* You installed the `gcloud` CLI tool.

.Procedure

. To find the IP address of the API server and then provision the corresponding DNS record, use the `gcloud` CLI to run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe --global "${infra_id}-apiserver" --format json | jq -r .IPAddress
----
. Use the IP address to provision your own DNS record with the `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` hostname by using your cluster name and base cluster domain.

. Use the `gcloud` CLI to find the IP address of the Ingress service and then provision the corresponding DNS record.
.. To find the forwarding rule for the Ingress service, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ingress_forwarding_rule=$(gcloud compute target-pools list --format=json --filter="instances[]~${infra_id}" | jq -r .[].name)
----
.. To use the forwarding rule value to find the IP address of the Ingress service, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ingress_ip_address=$(gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe --region "${region}" "${ingress_forwarding_rule}" --format json | jq -r .IPAddress)
----
. Use the IP address to provision your own DNS record with the `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` hostname by using your cluster name and base cluster domain.
