= Prerequisites and Limitations for {FusionSAN}

== Prerequisites

Installing and configuring {FusionSAN} require the following prerequisites:

* Bare-metal worker nodes with attached SAN storage.
* A working container registry enabled.
* All worker nodes must connect to the same LUNs.
+
A shared LUN is a shared disk that is accessed by all worker nodes simultaneously.
* A Kubernetes pull secret.

== Limitations

* Limitations for {FusionSAN} rely on the IBM Storage Scale container native limitations and can be found in the documentation for https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/scalecontainernative/5.2.3?topic=overview-limitations[IBM Storage Scale container native].
* Hosted control planes (HCP) clusters are not supported.
