<1> The OTLP gRPC endpoint. If omitted, the default `+0.0.0.0:4317+` is used.
<2> The server-side TLS configuration. Defines paths to TLS certificates. If omitted, the TLS is disabled.
<3> The path to the TLS certificate at which the server verifies a client certificate. This sets the value of `ClientCAs` and `ClientAuth` to `RequireAndVerifyClientCert` in the `TLSConfig`. For more information, see the link:https://godoc.org/crypto/tls#Config[`Config` of the Golang TLS package].
<4> Specifies the time interval at which the certificate is reloaded. If the value is not set, the certificate is never reloaded. The `reload_interval` field accepts a string containing valid units of time such as `ns`, `us`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.
<5> The OTLP HTTP endpoint. The default value is `+0.0.0.0:4318+`.
<6> The server-side TLS configuration. For more information, see the `grpc` protocol configuration section.
