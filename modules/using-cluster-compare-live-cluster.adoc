= Using the cluster-compare plugin with a live cluster

You can use the `cluster-compare` plugin to compare a reference configuration with configuration custom resources (CRs) from a live cluster. 

Validate live cluster configurations to ensure compliance with reference configurations during design, development, or testing scenarios.

[NOTE]
====
Use the `cluster-compare` plugin with live clusters in non-production environments only. For production environments, use the plugin with `must-gather` data.
====

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You downloaded the `cluster-compare` plugin and include it in your `PATH` environment variable.

* You have access to a reference configuration. 

.Procedure

* Run the `cluster-compare` plugin by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc cluster-compare -r <path_to_reference_config>/metadata.yaml
----
+
** `-r` specifies a path to the `metadata.yaml` file of the reference configuration. You can specify a local directory or a URI.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

<1> The CR under comparison. The plugin displays each CR with a difference from the corresponding template.
<2> The template matching with the CR for comparison.
<3> The output in Linux diff format shows the difference between the template and the cluster CR.
<4> After the plugin reports the line diffs for each CR, the summary of differences are reported.
<5> The number of CRs in the comparison with differences from the corresponding templates.
<6> The number of CRs represented in the reference configuration, but missing from the live cluster.
<7> The list of CRs represented in the reference configuration, but missing from the live cluster.
<8> The CRs that did not match to a corresponding template in the reference configuration.
<9> The metadata hash identifies the reference configuration.
<10> The list of patched CRs.

[NOTE]
====
Get the output in the `junit` format by adding `-o junit` to the command. For example:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc cluster-compare -r <path_to_reference_config>/metadata.yaml -o junit
----

The `junit` output includes the following result types:

* Passed results for each fully matched template.
* Failed results for differences found or missing required custom resources (CRs).
* Skipped results for differences patched using the user override mechanism.
