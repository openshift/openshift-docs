= Using the cluster-compare plugin with a live cluster

You can use the `cluster-compare` plugin to compare a reference configuration with configuration custom resources (CRs) from a live cluster. 

Validate live cluster configurations to ensure compliance with reference configurations during design, development, or testing scenarios.

[NOTE]
====
Use the `cluster-compare` plugin with live clusters in non-production environments only. For production environments, use the plugin with `must-gather` data.
====

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You downloaded the `cluster-compare` plugin and include it in your `PATH` environment variable.

* You have access to a reference configuration. 

.Procedure

* Run the `cluster-compare` plugin by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc cluster-compare -r <path_to_reference_config>/metadata.yaml
----
+
** `-r` specifies a path to the `metadata.yaml` file of the reference configuration. You can specify a local directory or a URI.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
