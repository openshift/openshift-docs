= Factors affecting update duration

The following factors can affect your cluster update duration:

* The reboot of compute nodes to the new machine configuration by Machine Config Operator (MCO)
** The value of `MaxUnavailable` in the machine config pool
+
[WARNING]
====
The default setting for `maxUnavailable` is `1` for all the machine config pools in {product-title}. It is recommended to not change this value and update one control plane node at a time. Do not change this value to `3` for the control plane pool.
====
** The minimum number or percentages of replicas set in pod disruption budget (PDB)
* The number of nodes in the cluster
* The health of the cluster nodes
