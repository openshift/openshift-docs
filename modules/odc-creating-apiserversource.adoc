====
You can switch between the *Form view* and *YAML view*. The data is persisted when switching between the views.
====
.. Enter `v1` as the *APIVERSION* and `Event` as the *KIND*.
// .. Select *Resource* as the *Mode*. *Mode* is the mode that the receive adapter controller runs in. `Ref` sends only the reference to the resource. `Resource` sends the full resource.
// TODO: clarify what this is used for. Out of scope for this PR since not required.
.. Select the *Service Account Name* for the service account that you created.
.. Select the *Sink* for the event source. A *Sink* can be either a *Resource*, such as a channel, broker, or service, or a *URI*.
. Click *Create*.

.Verification

* After you have created the API server source, you will see it connected to the service it is sinked to in the *Topology* view.
