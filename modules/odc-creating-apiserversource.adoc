= Creating an API server source event source using the Developer perspective

.Prerequisites

* You must have the {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Serving, and Knative Eventing installed in your {product-title} cluster. This can be installed by a cluster administrator.
* Event sources need a service to use as an event _sink_. The sink is the service or application that events are sent to from the event source.
* You must create or update a service account, role and role binding for the event source.
* You must have access to the {product-title} web console and have logged in.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the *Add* page and select *Event Source*.
. In the *Event Sources* page, select *ApiServerSource* in the *Type* section.
. Configure the *ApiServerSource* settings:
.. Enter `v1` as the *APIVERSION*, and `Event` as the *KIND*.
.. Select the *Service Account Name* for the service account that you created.
.. Select the *Sink* for the event source. A *Sink* can be either a *Resource*, such as a channel, broker, or service, or a *URI*.
. Click *Create*.

.Verification steps

* After you have created the `ApiServerSource` object, you will see it connected to the service it is sinked to in the *Topology* view.
