= Creating an API server source by using the web console

After Knative Eventing is installed on your cluster, you can create an API server source by using the web console. Using the {product-title} web console provides a streamlined and intuitive user interface to create an event source. 

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the {product-title} web console.
* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing are installed on the cluster.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

include::snippets/serverless-service-account-apiserversource.adoc[]

. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to *+Add* → *Event Source*. The  *Event Sources* page is displayed.
. Optional: If you have multiple providers for your event sources, select the required provider from the *Providers* list to filter the available event sources from the provider.
. Select *ApiServerSource* and then click *Create Event Source*. The  *Create Event Source* page is displayed.
. Configure the *ApiServerSource* settings by using the *Form view* or *YAML view*:
+
[NOTE]
====
You can switch between the *Form view* and *YAML view*. The data is persisted when switching between the views.
====
.. Enter `v1` as the *APIVERSION* and `Event` as the *KIND*.
// .. Select *Resource* as the *Mode*. *Mode* is the mode that the receive adapter controller runs in. `Ref` sends only the reference to the resource. `Resource` sends the full resource.
// TODO: clarify what this is used for. Out of scope for this PR since not required.
.. Select the *Service Account Name* for the service account that you created.
.. Select the *Sink* for the event source. A *Sink* can be either a *Resource*, such as a channel, broker, or service, or a *URI*.
. Click *Create*.

.Verification

* After you have created the API server source, you will see it connected to the service it is sinked to in the *Topology* view.
