= Creating an ApiServerSource event source using the Developer perspective

.Procedure

. Navigate to the **Add** page and select **Event Source**.
. In the **Event Sources** page, select **ApiServerSource** in the **Type** section.
. Configure the **ApiServerSource** settings:
.. Enter `v1` as the **APIVERSION**, and `Event` as the **KIND**.
// .. Select **Resource** as the **Mode**. **Mode** is the mode that the receive adapter controller runs in. `Ref` sends only the reference to the resource. `Resource` sends the full resource.
// TODO: clarify what this is used for. Out of scope for this PR since not required.
.. Select the **Service Account Name** for the service account that you created.
.. Select the **Sink** for the event source. A **Sink** can be either a **Resource**, such as a channel, broker, or service, or a **URI**.
. Click **Create**.

.Verification steps

* After you have created the ApiServerSource, you will see it connected to the service it is sinked to in the **Topology** view.
