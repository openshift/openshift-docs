// TODO: clarify what this is used for. Out of scope for this PR since not required.
.. Select the *Service Account Name* for the service account that you created.
.. Select the *Sink* for the event source. A *Sink* can be either a *Resource*, such as a channel, broker, or service, or a *URI*.
. Click *Create*.
