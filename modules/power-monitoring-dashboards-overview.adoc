= {PM-shortname-c} dashboards overview

There are two types of {PM-shortname} dashboards. Both provide different levels of details around power consumption metrics for a single cluster:

Power Monitoring / Overview dashboard:: 
With this dashboard you can observe the following information:
+
--
* An aggregated view of CPU architecture and its power source (`rapl-sysfs`, `rapl-msr`, or `estimator`) along with total nodes with this configuration.

* Total energy consumption by a cluster in the last 24 hours (measured in kilowatt-hour).

* The amount of power consumed by the top 10 namespaces in a cluster in the last 24 hours.

* Detailed node information, its CPU architecture and component power source.
--
+
These features allow you to effectively monitor the energy consumption of the cluster without needing to necessarily investigate every namespace separately.
+
[WARNING]
====
If {PM-kepler} is not able to obtain hardware power consumption metrics, the *Components Source* column will display `estimator` as the power source, which is not supported. The values from the nodes are therefore not accurate.

Power Monitoring / Namespace dashboard:: 
This dashboard provides the possibility to view metrics by namespace and pod. You can observe the following information:
+
--
* The power consumption metrics, such as consumption in DRAM and PKG.

* The energy consumption metrics in the last hour, such as consumption in DRAM and PKG for core and uncore components.
--
+
This feature allows you to investigate key peaks and easily identify the primary root causes of high consumption.
