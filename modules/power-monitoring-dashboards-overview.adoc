= {PM-shortname-c} dashboards overview

There are two types of {PM-shortname} dashboards. Both provide different levels of details around power consumption metrics for a single cluster:

[discrete]
== Power Monitoring / Overview dashboard

With this dashboard, you can observe the following information:

* An aggregated view of CPU architecture and its power source (`rapl-sysfs`, `rapl-msr`, or `estimator`) along with total nodes with this configuration

* Total energy consumption by a cluster in the last 24 hours (measured in kilowatt-hour)

* The amount of power consumed by the top 10 namespaces in a cluster in the last 24 hours

* Detailed node information, such as its CPU architecture and component power source

These features allow you to effectively monitor the energy consumption of the cluster without needing to investigate each namespace separately.

[WARNING]
====
Ensure that the *Components Source* column does not display `estimator` as the power source.

If {PM-kepler} is unable to obtain hardware power consumption metrics, the *Components Source* column displays `estimator` as the power source, which is not supported in Technology Preview. If that happens, then the values from the nodes are not accurate.

[discrete]
== Power Monitoring / Namespace dashboard

This dashboard allows you to view metrics by namespace and pod. You can observe the following information:

* The power consumption metrics, such as consumption in DRAM and PKG

* The energy consumption metrics in the last hour, such as consumption in DRAM and PKG for core and uncore components

This feature allows you to investigate key peaks and easily identify the primary root causes of high consumption.
