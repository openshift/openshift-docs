* **Egress zero is now generally available on {product-title} clusters.** You can create a fully operational cluster that does not require a public egress by configuring a virtual private cloud (VPC) and using the `--properties zero_egress:true` flag when creating your cluster. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html-single/install_clusters/index#rosa-hcp-egress-zero-install[Creating a {egress-zero-title}].
