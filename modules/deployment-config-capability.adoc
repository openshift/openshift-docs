= DeploymentConfig capability

[discrete]
== Purpose

The `DeploymentConfig` capability enables and manages the `DeploymentConfig` API.

[IMPORTANT]
====

If you disable the `DeploymentConfig` capability, the following resources will not be available in the cluster:

* `DeploymentConfig` resources
* The `deployer` service account

Disable the `DeploymentConfig` capability only if you do not require `DeploymentConfig` resources and the `deployer` service account in the cluster.
