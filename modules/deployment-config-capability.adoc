= DeploymentConfig capability

[discrete]
== Purpose

The `DeploymentConfig` capability enables and manages the `DeploymentConfig` API.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the `DeploymentConfig` capability is disabled, the cluster cannot use `DeploymentConfig` resources. Disable the capability only if `DeploymentConfig` resources are not required in the cluster.
