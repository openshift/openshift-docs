= Initiating live migration of a virtual machine instance in the CLI

Initiate a live migration of a running virtual machine instance by creating a `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` object in the cluster and referencing the name of the virtual machine instance.

.Procedure

. Create a `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` configuration file for the virtual machine instance to migrate. For example, `vmi-migrate.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachineInstanceMigration
metadata:
  name: migration-job
spec:
  vmiName: vmi-fedora
----

. Create the object in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f vmi-migrate.yaml
----

The `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` object triggers a live migration of the virtual machine instance.
This object exists in the cluster for as long as the virtual machine instance is running, unless manually deleted.
