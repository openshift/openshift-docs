Understand how you can use the {prodname} core policy APIs and observability features with your cloud applications and APIs.

== When to use {prodname} policy APIs

Secure your applications with `TLSPolicy`::

* `TLSPolicy` is a lightweight wrapper API to manage TLS for targeted gateways.
* Automatically provision TLS certificates based on the gateway listener hosts by using integration with `cert-manager` and ACME providers such as Let's Encrypt.
* Configure secrets so that the gateway automatically retrieves them.

Protect your applications with `AuthPolicy`::

* Use `AuthPolicy` objects to apply authentication and authorization across your selected listeners in a gateway or at the `HTTPRoute` or `HTTPRouteRule` level.
* Use the hierarchical and role-based concept of defaults and overrides to improve collaboration and ensure compliance.
* Use dedicated OIDC authentication providers such as Red Hat build of Keycloak.
* Apply fine-grained authorization requirements based on `request` and `metadata` attributes.

Protect your applications with `RateLimitPolicy`::

* Apply rate-limiting rules across all listeners in a gateway or at the `HTTPRoute` or `HTTPRouteRule` level.
* Use the role-based and hierarchical concept of defaults and overrides to improve collaboration and ensure compliance.
* Configure limits conditionally based on metadata and request data.
* Share counters by using a backend store in multicluster environments.

Connect your applications with `DNSPolicy`::

* `DNSPolicy` is a standard API that is not based on custom annotations.
* Automatically populate DNS records based on listener hosts and addresses expressed by Gateway API resources.
* Configure multicluster connectivity and routing options, for example, geographic and weighted responses.
* Use common cloud DNS providers: Amazon Route 53, Microsoft Azure DNS, Google Cloud DNS, or CoreDNS.
* Configure health checks to enable DNS failover.
