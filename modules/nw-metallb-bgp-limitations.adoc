= Limitations for BGP mode

[id="nw-metallb-bgp-limitations-break-connections_{context}"]
== Node failure can break all active connections

MetalLB shares a limitation that is common to BGP-based load balancing.
When a BGP session terminates, such as when a node fails or when a `speaker` pod restarts, the session termination might result in resetting all active connections.
End users can experience a `Connection reset by peer` message.

The consequence of a terminated BGP session is implementation-specific for each router manufacturer.
However, you can anticipate that a change in the number of `speaker` pods affects the number of BGP sessions and that active connections with BGP peers will break.

To avoid or reduce the likelihood of a service interruption, you can specify a node selector when you add a BGP peer.
By limiting the number of nodes that start BGP sessions, a fault on a node that does not have a BGP session has no affect on connections to the service.

[id="nw-metallb-bgp-limitations-communities-values_{context}"]
== Communities are specified as 16-bit values

Communities are specified as part of an address pool custom resource and are specified as 16-bit values separated by a colon.
For example, to specify that load balancer IP addresses are advertised with the well-known `NO_ADVERTISE` community attribute, use notation like the following:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: AddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-no-advertise
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  protocol: bgp
  addresses:
    - 192.168.1.100-192.168.1.255
  bgpAdvertisements:
  - communities:
    - 65535:65282
----

The limitation that communities are only specified as 16-bit values is a difference with the community-supported implementation of MetalLB that supports a `bgp-communities` field and readable names for BGP communities.

[id="nw-metallb-bgp-limitations-single-asn_{context}"]
== Support for a single ASN and a single router ID only

When you add a BGP peer custom resource, you specify the `spec.myASN` field to identify the Autonomous System Number (ASN) that MetalLB belongs to.
{product-title} uses an implementation of BGP with MetalLB that requires MetalLB to belong to a single ASN.
If you attempt to add a BGP peer and specify a different value for `spec.myASN` than an existing BGP peer custom resource, you receive an error.

Similarly, when you add a BGP peer custom resource, the `spec.routerID` field is optional.
If you specify a value for this field, you must specify the same value for BGP peer custom resources that you add.

The limitation to support a single ASN and single router ID is a difference with the community-supported implementation of MetalLB.
