= Configuring Elasticsearch CPU and memory limits

Each component specification allows for adjustments to both the CPU and memory limits. 
You should not need to manually adjust these values as the Elasticsearch
Operator sets values sufficient for your environment.

.Prerequisites

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

* Set cluster logging to the unmanaged state.

* If needed, get the name of the Cluster Logging Custom Resource in the `openshift-logging` project:
+
----
$ oc get ClusterLogging
NAME       AGE
instance   112m
----

.Procedure

Edit the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) in the `openshift-logging` project: 

[source,yaml]
----
$ oc edit ClusterLogging instance

apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "clusterlogging"
....
spec:
    logStore:
      type: "elasticsearch"
      elasticsearch:
        resources: <1>
          limits:
            cpu: "4000m"
            memory: "4Gi"
          requests:
            cpu: "100m"
            memory: "1Gi"
----

<1> Specify the CPU and memory limits as needed. If you leave these values blank,
the Elasticsearch Operator sets default values tuned for small to medium sized clusters.
