= Provisioning local volumes without the Local Storage Operator

Local volumes cannot be created by dynamic provisioning. Instead, persistent volumes can be created by defining the persistent volume (PV) in an object definition. The local volume provisioner looks for any file system or block volume devices at the paths specified in the defined resource.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Manual provisioning of PVs includes the risk of potential data leaks across PV reuse when PVCs are deleted.
The Local Storage Operator is recommended for automating the life cycle of devices when provisioning local PVs.
====

.Prerequisites

* Local disks are attached to the {product-title} nodes.

.Procedure

. Define the PV. Create a file, such as `example-pv-filesystem.yaml` or `example-pv-block.yaml`, with the `PersistentVolume` object definition. This resource must define the nodes and paths to the local volumes.
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not use different storage class names for the same device. Doing so will create multiple PVs.

<1> The volume mode, either `Filesystem` or `Block`, that defines the type of PVs.
<2> The name of the storage class to use when creating PV resources. Use a storage class that uniquely identifies this set of PVs.
<3> The path containing a list of local storage devices to choose from, or a directory. You can only specify a directory with `Filesystem` `volumeMode`.

[NOTE]
====
A raw block volume (`volumeMode: block`) is not formatted with a file system. Use this mode only if any application running on the pod can use raw block devices.

. Create the PV resource in your {product-title} cluster. Specify the file you just created:

$ oc create -f <example-pv>.yaml

. Verify that the local PV was created:

$ oc get pv
