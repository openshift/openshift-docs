= {oadp-short} recommended network settings

:context: oadp-recommended-network-settings

[role="_abstract"]
For a supported experience with {oadp-first}, you should have a stable and resilient network across {OCP-short} nodes, S3 storage, and in supported cloud environments that meet {OCP-short} network requirement recommendations.

To ensure successful backup and restore operations for deployments with remote S3 buckets located off-cluster with suboptimal data paths, it is recommended that your network settings meet the following minimum requirements in such less optimal conditions:

* Bandwidth (network upload speed to object storage): Greater than 2 Mbps for small backups and 10-100 Mbps depending on the data volume for larger backups.
* Packet loss: 1%
* Packet corruption: 1%
* Latency: 100ms

Ensure that your {product-title} network performs optimally and meets {product-title} network requirements.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although Red Hat provides supports for standard backup and restore failures, it does not provide support for failures caused by network settings that do not meet the recommended thresholds.
