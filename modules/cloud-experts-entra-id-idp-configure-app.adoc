= Configuring the application registration in Entra ID to include optional and group claims

[role="_abstract"]
To ensure that {product-title} has enough information to create the user's account, you must configure Entra ID to give two optional claims: `email` and `preferred_username`. For more information about optional claims in Entra ID, see link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/optional-claims[the Microsoft documentation].

In addition to individual user authentication, {product-title} provides group claim functionality. This functionality allows an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider, such as Entra ID, to offer a user's group membership for use within {product-title}.
