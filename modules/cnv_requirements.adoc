[[Requirements]]

{ProductName} requires an existing {product-title} cluster
with the following configuration considerations:

[[node-configuration]]
== Node configuration

See the xref:../install/index.adoc#environment-scenarios[OpenShift
Container Platform Installing Clusters Guide] for planning
considerations for different cluster configurations.

https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#download-from-github[Binary
builds] and
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/index.html[MiniShift] are
not supported with {ProductName}.

[[admission-controller-enable]]
== Admission control webhooks

{ProductName} implements an admission controller as a webhook so that
{ProductName}-specific creation requests are forwarded to the webhook for
validation. Registering webhooks must be enabled during installation of the
{product-title} cluster.

To register the admission controller webhook, add the following under the
`[OSEv3:vars]` section in your Ansible inventory file during {product-title} deployment:

----
openshift_master_admission_plugin_config={"ValidatingAdmissionWebhook":{"configuration":{"kind": "DefaultAdmissionConfig","apiVersion": "v1","disable": false}},"MutatingAdmissionWebhook":{"configuration":{"kind": "DefaultAdmissionConfig","apiVersion": "v1","disable": false}}}
----

[[cri-o-runtime]]
== CRI-O runtime

http://cri-o.io[CRI-O] is the required container runtime for use with {ProductName}.

See the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/cri-o_runtime/use-crio-engine[OpenShift
Container Platform 3.11 CRI-O Runtime Documentation] for more information on using
CRI-O.

[[storage]]
== Storage

{ProductName} supports local volumes, block volumes, and Red Hat OpenShift
Container Storage as storage backends.

=== Local volumes

Local volumes are PVs that represent locally-mounted file systems. See the xref:../install_config/configuring_local.adoc#install-config-configuring-local[OpenShift
Container Platform Configuring Clusters Guide] for more information.

=== Block volumes

{ProductName} supports the use of block volume PVCs. In order to use
block volumes, the {product-title} cluster must be configured with the *BlockVolume*
feature gate enabled. See the xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#block-volume-support[{product-title} Architecture Guide] for more information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Local and block volumes both have limited support in {product-title} 3.11
because they are currently Technology Preview. This may change in
a future release.

Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access
to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and
provide feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.
====
=== Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage

Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage uses Red Hat Gluster Storage to provide persistent storage and dynamic provisioning.
It can be used containerized within {product-title} (converged mode) and
non-containerized on its own nodes (independent mode).

See the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_container_storage/3.11/[OpenShift Container Storage Product Documentation] or the xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-glusterfs-persistent-storage[OpenShift
Container Platform Installing Clusters Guide] for more information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Requires Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage version 3.11.1 or later.
Earlier versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage do not support CRI-O, the required container
runtime for {ProductName}.
====

[[metrics]]
== Metrics

Metrics are not required, but are a recommended addition to your {product-title}
cluster because they provide additional information about {ProductName} resources.

See the xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-cluster-metrics[{product-title} Installing Clusters Guide] for comprehensive
information on deploying metrics in your cluster.
