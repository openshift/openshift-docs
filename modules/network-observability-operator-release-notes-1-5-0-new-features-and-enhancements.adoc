= Network Observability Operator 1.5.0 new features and enhancements

[role="_abstract"]
You can view the following new features and enhancements for the Network Observability Operator 1.5 release.

[id="network-observability-dns-enhancements-1.5_{context}"]
== DNS tracking enhancements
In 1.5, the TCP protocol is now supported in addition to UDP. New dashboards are also added to the *Overview* view of the Network Traffic page.

For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/observing-network-traffic.adoc#network-observability-dns-overview_nw-observe-network-traffic[Configuring DNS tracking]
* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/observing-network-traffic.adoc#network-observability-dns-tracking_nw-observe-network-traffic[Working with DNS tracking]


[id="network-observability-RTT-1.5_{context}"]
== Round-trip time (RTT)
You can use TCP handshake Round-Trip Time (RTT) captured from the `fentry/tcp_rcv_established` Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) hookpoint to read smoothed round-trip time (SRTT) and analyze network flows. In the *Overview*, *Network Traffic*, and *Topology* pages in web console, you can monitor network traffic and troubleshoot with RTT metrics, filtering, and edge labeling.


For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/observing-network-traffic.adoc#network-observability-RTT-overview_nw-observe-network-traffic[RTT Overview]
* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/observing-network-traffic.adoc#network-observability-RTT_nw-observe-network-traffic[Working with RTT]


[id="network-observability-metrics-dashboard-enhancements_{context}"]
== Metrics, dashboards, and alerts enhancements
The network observability metrics dashboards in *Observe* → *Dashboards* → *NetObserv* have new metrics types you can use to create Prometheus alerts. You can now define available metrics in the `includeList` specification. In previous releases, these metrics were defined in the `ignoreTags` specification.


For a complete list of these metrics, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/metrics-alerts-dashboards.adoc#network-observability-metrics_metrics-dashboards-alerts[Network observability metrics]


[id="network-observability-improved-lokistack-integration_{context}"]
== Improvements for network observability without Loki
You can create Prometheus alerts for the *Netobserv* dashboard using DNS, Packet drop, and RTT metrics, even if you don't use Loki. In the previous version of network observability, 1.4, these metrics were only available for querying and analysis in the *Network Traffic*, *Overview*, and *Topology* views, which are not available without Loki.


For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/metrics-alerts-dashboards.adoc#network-observability-metrics_metrics-dashboards-alerts[Network observability metrics]


[id="network-observability-zones_{context}"]
== Availability zones
You can configure the `FlowCollector` resource to collect information about the cluster availability zones. This configuration enriches the network flow data with the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#topologykubernetesiozone[`topology.kubernetes.io/zone`] label value applied to the nodes.


For more information, see:

* xref:../../../observability/network_observability/observing-network-traffic.adoc#network-observability-zones_nw-observe-network-traffic[Working with availability zones]


[id="network-observability-enhanced-configuration-and-ui-1.5_{context}"]
== Notable enhancements
The 1.5 release of the Network Observability Operator adds improvements and new capabilities to the {product-title} web console plugin and the Operator configuration.

[id="performance-enhancements-1.5_{context}"]
== Performance enhancements
* The `spec.agent.ebpf.kafkaBatchSize` default is changed from `10MB` to `1MB` to enhance eBPF performance when using Kafka.
+
[IMPORTANT]
=====
When upgrading from an existing installation, this new value is not set automatically in the configuration. If you monitor a performance regression with the eBPF Agent memory consumption after upgrading, you might consider reducing the `kafkaBatchSize` to the new value.
=====

[id="web-console-enhancements-1.5_{context}"]
== Web console enhancements:

* There are new panels added to the *Overview* view for DNS and RTT: Min, Max, P90, P99.
* There are new panel display options added:
** Focus on one panel while keeping others viewable but with smaller focus.
** Switch graph type.
** Show *Top* and *Overall*.
* A collection latency warning is shown in the *Custom time range* window.
* There is enhanced visibility for the contents of the *Manage panels* and *Manage columns* pop-up windows.
* The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field for egress QoS is available for filtering QoS DSCP in the web console *Network Traffic* page.

[id="configuration-enhancements-1.5_{context}"]
== Configuration enhancements:

* The `LokiStack` mode in the `spec.loki.mode` specification simplifies installation by automatically setting URLs, TLS, cluster roles and a cluster role binding, as well as the `authToken` value. The `Manual` mode allows more control over configuration of these settings.
* The API version changes from `flows.netobserv.io/v1beta1` to `flows.netobserv.io/v1beta2`.
