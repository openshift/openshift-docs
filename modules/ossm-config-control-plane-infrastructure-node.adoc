= Configuring all {SMProductShortName} control plane components to run on infrastructure nodes

This task should only be performed if all of the components deployed by the {SMProductShortName} control plane (including Istiod, Ingress Gateway, and Egress Gateway) along with optional elements (such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Distributed Tracing) are running on infrastructure nodes. 

If the control plane runs on a worker node, skip this task.

.Procedure

. Open the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource as a YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n istio-system edit smcp <name> <1>
----
<1> `<name>` represents the name of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

. To run all of the {SMProductShortName} components deployed by the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` on infrastructure nodes, add the `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` fields to the `spec.runtime.defaults.pod` spec in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  runtime:
    defaults:
      pod:
        nodeSelector: <1>
          node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
        tolerations: <2>
        - effect: NoSchedule
          key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
          value: reserved
        - effect: NoExecute
          key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
          value: reserved
----
<1> Ensures that the SMCP pods are only scheduled on an infrastructure node.
<2> Ensures that the pods are accepted by the infrastructure node.
