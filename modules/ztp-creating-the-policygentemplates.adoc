= Creating the PolicyGenTemplates

Use the following procedure to create the `PolicyGenTemplates` you will need for generating policies in your Git repository for the hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Create the `PolicyGenTemplates` and save them to the zero touch provisioning (ZTP) Git repository accessible from the hub cluster and defined as a source repository of the ArgoCD application.

. ArgoCD detects that the application is out of sync. Upon sync, either automatic or manual, ArgoCD applies the new `PolicyGenTemplate` to the hub cluster and launches the associated resource hooks. These hooks are responsible for generating the policy wrapped configuration CRs that apply to the spoke cluster and perform the following actions:
.. Create the {rh-rhacm-first} (ACM) policies according to the basic distributed unit (DU) profile and required customizations.
.. Apply the generated policies to the hub cluster.

The ZTP process creates policies that direct ACM to apply the desired configuration to the cluster nodes.
