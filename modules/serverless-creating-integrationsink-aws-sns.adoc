= Creating an IntegrationSink for AWS SNS

You can create an `IntegrationSink` API resource to publish CloudEvents from Knative Eventing to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic by applying a YAML manifest.

.Prerequisites

* You have created your AWS credentials and stored them in a Kubernetes Secret in the same namespace as the resource.
* You have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed and are logged in to the cluster.
* You know the namespace where the `IntegrationSink` resource will be created.
* A Knative broker or another event source exists to produce CloudEvents to be delivered to this sink.

.Procedure

. Save the following YAML manifest as `integration-sink-aws-sns.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sinks.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationSink
metadata:
  name: integration-sink-aws-sns
  namespace: knative-samples
spec:
  aws:
    sns:
      arn: "arn:aws:sns:<region>:<account>:my-topic"
      region: "eu-north-1"
    auth:
      secret:
        ref:
          name: "my-secret"
----

. Apply the manifest by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f integration-sink-aws-sns.yaml
----
+
This manifest configures the `IntegrationSink` API to publish CloudEvents to the SNS topic identified by its ARN in the `eu-north-1` region. The `auth.secret.ref.name` field references the Kubernetes Secret (`my-secret`) that stores your AWS credentials.
