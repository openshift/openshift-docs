= Configuring resources and scheduling for logging collectors

Administrators can modify the resources or scheduling of the collector by creating a `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) that is in the same namespace and has the same name as the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR that it supports.

The applicable stanzas for the `ClusterLogging` CR when using multiple log forwarders in a deployment are `managmentState` and `collection`. All other stanzas are ignored.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrator permissions.
* You have installed the {clo} version 5.8 or newer.
* You have created a `ClusterLogForwarder` CR.

.Procedure

. Create a `ClusterLogging` CR that supports your existing `ClusterLogForwarder` CR:
