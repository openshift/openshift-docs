= {ibm-power-title} infrastructure requirements

The Agent platform does not create any infrastructure, but requires the following resources for infrastructure:

* Agents: An _Agent_ represents a host that is booted with a discovery image and is ready to be provisioned as an {product-title} node.

* DNS: The API and Ingress endpoints must be routable.
