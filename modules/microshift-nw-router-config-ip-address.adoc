= Configuring router IP addresses

You can restrict the network traffic to the router by configuring specific IP addresses. For example:

* Use cases where the router is reachable only on internal networks, but not on northbound public networks
* Use cases where the router is reachable only by northbound public networks, but not on internal networks
* Use cases where the router is reachable by both internal networks and northbound public networks, but on separate IP addresses

.Prerequisites

* You installed {microshift-short}.
* You created a {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file.
* The {oc-first} is installed.

[TIP]
====
If you complete all the configurations that you need to make in the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file at the same time, you can minimize system restarts.
====

.Procedure

. Update the list in the `ingress.listenAddress` field in the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` according to your requirements and as shown in the following examples:
+
.Default router IP address list
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
ingress:
  listenAddress:
    - "<host_network>" # <1>
# ...
----
<1> The `ingress.listenAddress` value defaults to the entire network of the host. To continue to use the default list, remove the `listen.Address` field from the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file. To customize this parameter, use a list. The list can contain either a single IP address or NIC name or multiple IP addresses and NIC names.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must either remove the `listenAddress` parameter or add values to it in the form of a list when using the `config.yaml` file. Do not leave the field empty or {microshift-short} crashes on restart.
====
+
.Example router setting with a single host IP address
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
ingress:
  listenAddress:
    - 10.2.1.100
# ...
----
+
.Example router setting with a combination of IP addresses and NIC names
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
ingress:
  listenAddress:
    - 10.2.1.100
    - 10.2.2.10
    - ens3
# ...
----

. Restart the {microshift-short} service by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart microshift
----

.Verification

* To verify that your settings are applied, make sure that the `ingress.listenAddress` IP addresses are reachable, then you can `curl` the route with the destination to one of these load balancer IP address.
