= Generating a diagnostic bundle by using the roxctl CLI

You can generate a diagnostic bundle with the {rh-rhacscs-first} administrator password or API token and central address by using the `roxctl` CLI.

.Prerequisites
* To generate a diagnostic bundle, you need `read` permission for the `Administration` resource. This is required for versions of the `DebugLogs` resource older than version 3.73.0.

* You must have configured the {product-title-short} administrator password or API token and central address.

.Procedure

* To generate a diagnostic bundle by using the {product-title-short} administrator password, perform the following steps:

. Run the following command to configure the `ROX_PASSWORD` and `ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS` environment variables:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ export ROX_PASSWORD=_<rox_password>_ && export ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS=_<address>:<port_number>_ <1>
----
+
<1> For `<rox_password>`, specify the {product-title-short} administrator password.

. Run the following command to generate a diagnostic bundle by using the {product-title-short} administrator password:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" -p "$ROX_PASSWORD" central debug download-diagnostics
----

* To generate a diagnostic bundle by using the API token, perform the following steps:

. Run the following command to configure the `ROX_API_TOKEN` environment variable:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ export ROX_API_TOKEN=_<api_token>_
----

. Run the following command to generate a diagnostic bundle by using the API token:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" central debug download-diagnostics
