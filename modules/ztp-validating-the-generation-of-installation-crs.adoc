= Validating the generation of installation CRs

`SiteConfig` applies Installation custom resources (CR) to the hub cluster in a namespace with the name matching the site name. To check the status, enter the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get AgentClusterInstall -n <clusterName>
----

If no object is returned, use the following procedure to troubleshoot the ArgoCD pipeline flow from `SiteConfig` to the installation CRs.

.Procedure

. Check the synchronization of the `SiteConfig` to the hub cluster using either of the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get siteconfig -A
----
+
or
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get siteconfig -n clusters-sub
----
+
If the `SiteConfig` is missing, one of the following situations has occurred:

* The *clusters* application failed to synchronize the CR from the Git repository to the hub. Use the following command to verify this:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe -n openshift-gitops application clusters
----
+
Check for `Status: Synced` and that the `Revision:` is the SHA of the commit you pushed to the subscribed repository.
+
* The pre-sync hook failed, possibly due to a failure to pull the container image. Check the ArgoCD dashboard for the status of the pre-sync job in the *clusters* application.

. Verify the post hook job ran:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe job -n clusters-sub siteconfig-post
----
+
* If successful, the returned output indicates `succeeded: 1`.
* If the job fails, ArgoCD retries it. In some cases, the first pass will fail and the second pass will indicate that the job passed.

. Check for errors in the post hook job:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -n clusters-sub
----
+
Note the name of the `siteconfig-post-xxxxx` pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n clusters-sub siteconfig-post-xxxxx
----
+
If the logs indicate errors, correct the conditions and push the corrected `SiteConfig` or `PolicyGenTemplate` to the Git repository.
