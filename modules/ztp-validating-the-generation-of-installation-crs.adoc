= Validating the generation of ZTP installation CRs

The ZTP pipeline uses `SiteConfig` custom resources (CRs) to apply installation CRs to the hub cluster. To check the installation status of the spoke cluster, enter the following command specifying the cluster name as the namespace:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get AgentClusterInstall -n <cluster_name>
----

If no object is returned, use the following procedure to troubleshoot the ArgoCD pipeline flow from `SiteConfig` to the installation CRs.

.Procedure

. Check the synchronization of the `SiteConfig` CRs to the hub cluster using either of the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get siteconfig -A
----
+
or
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get siteconfig -n clusters-sub
----
+
If the `SiteConfig` CR is missing, one of the following situations has occurred:

* The *clusters* application failed to synchronize the CR from the Git repository to the hub. Use the following command to verify this:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe -n openshift-gitops application clusters
----
+
Check for `Status: Synced` and that the `Revision:` is the SHA of the commit you pushed to the subscribed repository.
+
* The pre-sync hook failed, possibly due to a failure to pull the container image. Check the ArgoCD dashboard for the status of the pre-sync job in the *clusters* application.

. Verify the post hook job ran:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe job -n clusters-sub siteconfig-post
----
+
* If successful, the returned output indicates `succeeded: 1`.
* If the job fails, ArgoCD retries it. In some cases, the first pass will fail and the second pass will indicate that the job passed.

. Check for errors in the post hook job:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -n clusters-sub
----
+
Note the name of the `siteconfig-post-xxxxx` pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n clusters-sub siteconfig-post-xxxxx
----
+
If the logs indicate errors, correct the conditions and push the corrected `SiteConfig` or `PolicyGenTemplate` to the Git repository.
