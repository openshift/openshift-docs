= Validating the generation of installation CRs

The GitOps zero touch provisioning (ZTP) infrastructure generates a set of installation CRs on the hub cluster in response to a `SiteConfig` CR pushed to your Git repository. You can check that the installation CRs were created by using the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get AgentClusterInstall -n <cluster_name>
----

If no object is returned, use the following procedure to troubleshoot the ArgoCD pipeline flow from `SiteConfig` files to the installation CRs.

.Procedure

. Verify that the `SiteConfig->ManagedCluster` was generated to the hub cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedcluster
----

. If the `SiteConfig` `ManagedCluster` is missing, see if the `clusters` application failed to synchronize the files from the Git repository to the hub:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe -n openshift-gitops application clusters
----

. Check for `Status: Conditions:` to view the error logs. For example, setting an invalid value for `extraManifestPath:` in the `siteConfig` file raises an error as shown below:
