= Troubleshooting telemetry data generation by the instrumentation libraries

You can troubleshoot telemetry data generation by the instrumentation libraries by checking the endpoint, looking for errors in your application logs, and verifying that the Collector is receiving the telemetry data.

.Procedure

. Verify that the instrumentation is transmitting data to the correct endpoint:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get instrumentation <instrumentation_name> -n <workload_project> -o jsonpath='{.spec.endpoint}'
----
+
The default endpoint `+http://localhost:4317+` for the `Instrumentation` object is only applicable to a Collector instance that is deployed as a sidecar in your application pod. If you are using an incorrect endpoint, correct it by editing the `Instrumentation` object and redeploying your application.

. Inspect your application logs for error messages that might indicate that the instrumentation is malfunctioning:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs <application_pod> -n <workload_project>
----

. If the application logs contain error messages that indicate that the instrumentation might be malfunctioning, install the OpenTelemetry SDK and libraries locally. Then run your application locally and troubleshoot for issues between the instrumentation libraries and your application without {product-title}.

. Use the Debug Exporter to verify that the telemetry data is reaching the destination OpenTelemetry Collector instance. For more information, see "Debug Exporter".
