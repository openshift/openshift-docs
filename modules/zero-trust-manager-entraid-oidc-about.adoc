= About the Entra ID OpenID Connect


Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service that centralizes user management and access control. Entra ID serves as the identify provider, verifying user identities and issuing and ID token to the application. This token has essential user information, allowing the application to confirm who the user is without managing their credentials.

Integrating Entra ID OpenID Connect (OIDC) with SPIRE provides workloads with automatic, short-lived cryptographic identities. The SPIRE-issued identities are sent to Entra ID to securely authenticate the service without any static secrets.
