= Overview of CSI volume resizing

To resize a volume, you do not have to manually interact with the storage back end or delete and recreate persistent volumes (PVs) and persistent volume claims (PVCs). 

Shrinking persistent volumes is not supported.

Although resizing is enabled by default, cluster administrators must opt-in to allow users to resize their volumes by setting the `allowVolumeExpansion` field to true in the applicable storage class. Only PVCs created from such storage classes can trigger volume expansion.
