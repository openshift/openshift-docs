= Cluster API architecture

The {product-title} integration of the upstream Cluster API is implemented and managed by the Cluster CAPI Operator. The Cluster CAPI Operator and its operands are provisioned in the `openshift-cluster-api` namespace, in contrast to the Machine API, which uses the `openshift-machine-api` namespace.

== The Cluster CAPI Operator

The Cluster CAPI Operator is an {product-title} Operator that maintains the lifecycle of Cluster API resources. This Operator is responsible for all administrative tasks related to deploying the Cluster API project within an {product-title} cluster.

If a cluster is configured correctly to allow the use of the Cluster API, the Cluster CAPI Operator installs the Cluster API Operator on the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The Cluster CAPI Operator is distinct from the upstream Cluster API Operator.

For more information, see the entry for the Cluster CAPI Operator in the _Cluster Operators reference_ content.

[id="capi-arch-resources"]
== Primary resources

The Cluster API is comprised of the following primary resources. For the Technology Preview of this feature, you must create these resources manually in the `openshift-cluster-api` namespace.

Cluster:: A fundamental unit that represents a cluster that is managed by the Cluster API. 

Infrastructure:: A provider-specific resource that defines properties that are shared by all the compute machine sets in the cluster, such as the region and subnets.

Machine template:: A provider-specific template that defines the properties of the machines that a compute machine set creates.

Machine set:: A group of machines. 
+
Compute machine sets are to machines as replica sets are to pods. If you need more machines or must scale them down, you change the `replicas` field on the compute machine set to meet your compute needs. 
+
With the Cluster API, a compute machine set references a `Cluster` object and a provider-specific machine template.

Machine:: A fundamental unit that describes the host for a node. 
+
The Cluster API creates machines based on the configuration in the machine template.
