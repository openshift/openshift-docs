= Service Account authentication overview

The Service Account authentication type uses a private key for authentication purposes. Service accounts use RSA key pairs, which consist of a public and private key, with the private key being the service account key. The public portion of the key pair is stored on {gcp-full}, while the private key is kept by the user. The private key allows users to authenticate as a service account and gain access to assets and resources associated with that service account.

Service account keys are a security risk if not managed carefully. Users should routinely rotate their service account keys to reduce the risk of leaked or stolen keys.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Because of the potential security risk when using the Service Account authentication type, Red Hat recommends using {gcp-short} Workload Identity Federation (WIF) as the authentication type for installing and interacting with the OpenShift Dedicated cluster deployed on {gcp-first} because it provides enhanced security. For more information, see _Creating a cluster on {gcp-short} with Workload Identity Federation authentication_ in the _Additional resources_ section.
