= Using a Kafka sink

You can create an event sink called a Kafka sink that sends events to a Kafka topic. Creating Knative resources by using YAML files uses a declarative API, which enables you to describe applications declaratively and in a reproducible manner. By default, a Kafka sink uses the binary content mode, which is more efficient than the structured mode. To create a Kafka sink by using YAML, you must create a YAML file that defines a `KafkaSink` object, then apply it by using the `oc apply` command.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Eventing, and the `KnativeKafka` custom resource (CR) are installed on your cluster.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* You have access to a Red Hat AMQ Streams (Kafka) cluster that produces the Kafka messages you want to import.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a `KafkaSink` object definition as a YAML file:
+
.Kafka sink YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaSink
metadata:
  name: <sink-name>
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  topic: <topic-name>
  bootstrapServers:
   - <bootstrap-server>
----

. To create the Kafka sink, apply the `KafkaSink` YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

. Configure an event source so that the sink is specified in its spec:
