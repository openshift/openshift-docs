= Mesh-wide deployment

Your service mesh can include all of the namespaces in your mesh. A mesh-scoped deployment can promote reusability and help you manage resources across the mesh. While the most typical deployment is a multitennant deployment, where a {ProductShortName} control plane manages multiple projects, a mesh-wide model can satisfy security, policy or performance requirements instead of dividing the mesh into projects.

Start by enabling the default peer authentication by configuring the data plane mTLS. 

== Mesh-wide resources

A `RequestAuthentication` or `PeerAuthentication` resource define who can access a service or workflow. See Configuring Role Based Access Control (RBAC) in Security for more information about how to create and deploy the `RequestAuthentication` or `PeerAuthentication` resources. In a multitennant deployment, you would deploy those resources in the data plane project. In a mesh-wide deployment, you can deploy those resources in the control plane project to grant permissions on specific workflows or namespaces.
