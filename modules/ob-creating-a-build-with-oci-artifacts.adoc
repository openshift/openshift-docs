= Creating a build with OCI artifacts

[role="_abstract"]
You can create a build using an Open Container Initiative(OCI) artifact as your source code. An OCI artifact, also known as a scratch image, contains only the source code and is not intended to run as a container. You can pull the OCI artifact from a container registry and extract its contents to use as source code to run the build.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {builds-operator} on the {ocp-product-title} cluster.
* You have installed the `oc` command-line interface (CLI).
* You have installed the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads[`shp` CLI].

.Procedure

. Create a `Build` resource and apply it to the {ocp-product-title} cluster. See the following example configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: my-oci-build #<1>
spec:
  source:
    type: OCI
    ociArtifact:
      image: <quay.io/org/image:tag> #<2>
  strategy:
    name: <strategy-name> # <3>
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
  output: 
    image: <target-image-registry/repository/image:tag> #<4>
    pushSecret: <secret-name-for-credentials> #<5>
EOF
----
<1> Defines the name of the `Build` resource.
<2> Replace `<quay.io/org/image:tag>` with the location of the OCI artifact source image.
<3> Replace `<strategy-name>` with the name of the build strategy to build the container (`buildah` or `source-to-image`).
<4> Replace `<target-image-registry/repository/image:tag>` with the location where you want to push the built image.
<5> Optional: Replace `<secret-name-for-credentials>` with the secret name that stores the credentials for pushing container images. To generate a secret for a private registry for authentication, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.5/html-single/authentication/index#ob-authentication-to-container-registries_understanding-authentication-at-runtime[Authentication to container registries]

. Choose one of the following methods to upload your source code to the required registry and run the build:
.. Use the shp CLI
.. Manually upload the OCI artifact
