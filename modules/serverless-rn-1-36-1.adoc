= Red{nbsp}Hat {ServerlessProductName} 1.36.1

{ServerlessProductName} 1.36.1 is now available. This release of {ServerlessProductName} addresses identified Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) to enhance security and reliability. Fixed issues and known issues that pertain to {ServerlessProductName} on {ocp-product-title} are included in the following notes:

[id="fixed-issues-1-36-1_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the {ServerlessProductName} Functions client failed to build remotely with {pipelines-title} version 1.19, causing pipeline runs to remain in the `Pending` state on the `fetch-sources` task and report admission webhook errors. With this release, the issue is resolved, and remote builds complete successfully.

[id="known-issues-1-36-1_{context}"]
== Known issues

* The `kn func build --remote` command on an {ocp-product-title} s390x cluster triggers a known issue that causes the build task to hang. As a consequence, the build process does not complete.
