= Disaster recovery


{product-title} (ROSA) provides disaster recovery for failures that occur at the pod, worker node, infrastructure node, control plane node, and availability zone levels.

All disaster recovery requires that the customer use best practices for deploying highly available applications, storage, and cluster architecture, such as single-zone deployment or multi-zone deployment, to account for the level of desired availability.

One single-zone cluster will not provide disaster avoidance or recovery in the event of an availability zone or region outage. Multiple single-zone clusters with customer-maintained failover can account for outages at the zone or at the regional level.

One multi-zone cluster will not provide disaster avoidance or recovery in the event of a full region outage. Multiple multi-zone clusters with customer-maintained failover can account for outages at the regional level.
