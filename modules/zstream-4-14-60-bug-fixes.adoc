The following bug is fixed with this release:

* Before this update, an unsafe process file system in a container prevented a process from starting, and caused network issues. With this release, the unsafe issue in a container is fixed,  and the pods start. As a result, the pods do not stay in the initial startup state, and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) operation continues. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-58892[OCPBUGS-58892])
