[id="installation-requirements-user-infra_{context}"]
= Machine requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all
of the required machines.

One or more KVM host machines based on {op-system-base} 8.6 or later. Each {op-system-base} KVM host machine must have libvirt installed and running. The virtual machines are provisioned under each {op-system-base} KVM host machine.


[id="machine-requirements_{context}"]
== Required machines

The smallest {product-title} clusters require the following hosts:

.Minimum required hosts
[options="header"]
|===
|Hosts |Description

|One temporary bootstrap machine
|The cluster requires the bootstrap machine to deploy the {product-title} cluster
on the three control plane machines. You can remove the bootstrap machine after
you install the cluster.
|Three control plane machines
|The control plane machines run the Kubernetes and {product-title} services that form the control plane.

|At least two compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.
|The workloads requested by {product-title} users run on the compute machines.

|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
To improve high availability of your cluster, distribute the control plane machines over different {op-system-base} instances on at least two physical machines.
====

The bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines must use {op-system-first} as the operating system.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits[Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits].

[id="network-connectivity_{context}"]
== Network connectivity requirements

The {product-title} installer creates the Ignition files, which are necessary for all the {op-system-first} virtual machines. The automated installation of {product-title} is performed by the bootstrap machine. It starts the installation of {product-title} on each node, starts the Kubernetes cluster, and then finishes. During this bootstrap, the virtual machine must have an established network connection either through a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server or static IP address.

[id="ibm-z-network-connectivity_{context}"]
== {ibm-z-title} network connectivity requirements

To install on {ibm-z-name} under {op-system-base} KVM, you need:

*   A {op-system-base} KVM host configured with an OSA or RoCE network adapter.
*   Either a {op-system-base} KVM host that is configured to use bridged networking in libvirt or MacVTap to connect the network to the guests.

[id="host-machine-resource-requirements_{context}"]
== Host machine resource requirements
The {op-system-base} KVM host in your environment must meet the following requirements to host the virtual machines that you plan for the {product-title} environment. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_and_managing_virtualization/getting-started-with-virtualization-in-rhel-8_configuring-and-managing-virtualization[Getting started with virtualization].

You can install {product-title} version {product-version} on the following {ibm-name} hardware:

* {ibm-name} z16 (all models), {ibm-name} z15 (all models), {ibm-name} z14 (all models)
* {ibm-linuxone-name} 4 (all models), {ibm-linuxone-name} III (all models), {ibm-linuxone-name} Emperor II, {ibm-linuxone-name} Rockhopper II

[id="minimum-ibm-z-system-requirements_{context}"]
== Minimum {ibm-z-title} system environment

[discrete]
=== Hardware requirements

* The equivalent of six Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFL), which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* At least one network connection to both connect to the `LoadBalancer` service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You can use dedicated or shared IFLs to assign sufficient compute resources. Resource sharing is one of the key strengths of {ibm-z-name}. However, you must adjust capacity correctly on each hypervisor layer and ensure sufficient resources for every {product-title} cluster.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since the overall performance of the cluster can be impacted, the LPARs that are used to set up the {product-title} clusters must provide sufficient compute capacity. In this context, LPAR weight management, entitlements, and CPU shares on the hypervisor level play an important role.
====

[discrete]
=== Operating system requirements
* One LPAR running on {op-system-base} 8.6 or later with KVM, which is managed by libvirt

On your {op-system-base} KVM host, set up:

* Three guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines
* Two guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines
* One guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine

[id="minimum-resource-requirements_{context}"]

Each cluster virtual machine must meet the following minimum requirements:

== Preferred {ibm-z-title} system environment

[discrete]
=== Hardware requirements

* Three LPARS that each have the equivalent of six IFLs, which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* Two network connections to both connect to the `LoadBalancer` service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.

[discrete]
=== Operating system requirements

* For high availability, two or three LPARs running on {op-system-base} 8.6 or later with KVM, which are managed by libvirt.

On your {op-system-base} KVM host, set up:

* Three guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines, distributed across the {op-system-base} KVM host machines.
* At least six guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines, distributed across the {op-system-base} KVM host machines.
* One guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine.
* To ensure the availability of integral components in an overcommitted environment, increase the priority of the control plane by using `cpu_shares`. Do the same for infrastructure nodes, if they exist. See link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=domain-schedinfo[schedinfo] in {ibm-name} Documentation.
