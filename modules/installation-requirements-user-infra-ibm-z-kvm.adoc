[id="installation-requirements-user-infra_{context}"]
= Machine requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all
of the required machines.

One or more KVM host machines based on {op-system-base} 8.3 or later. Each {op-system-base} KVM host machine must have libvirt installed and running. The virtual machines are provisioned under each {op-system-base} KVM host machine.


[id="machine-requirements_{context}"]
== Required machines

The smallest {product-title} clusters require the following hosts:

.Minimum required hosts
[options="header"]
|===
|Hosts |Description

|One temporary bootstrap machine
|The cluster requires the bootstrap machine to deploy the {product-title} cluster
on the three control plane machines. You can remove the bootstrap machine after
you install the cluster.
|Three control plane machines
|The control plane machines run the Kubernetes and {product-title} services that form the control plane.

|At least two compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.
|The workloads requested by {product-title} users run on the compute machines.

|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
To improve high availability of your cluster, distribute the control plane machines over different {op-system-base} instances on at least two physical machines.
====

The bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines must use {op-system-first} as the operating system.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits[Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits].

[id="network-connectivity_{context}"]
== Network connectivity requirements

The {product-title} installer creates the Ignition files, which are necessary for all the {op-system-first} virtual machines. The automated installation of {product-title} is performed by the bootstrap machine. It starts the installation of {product-title} on each node, starts the Kubernetes cluster, and then finishes. During this bootstrap, the virtual machine must have an established network connection either through a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server or static IP address.

[id="ibm-z-network-connectivity_{context}"]
== IBM Z network connectivity requirements

To install on IBM Z under {op-system-base} KVM, you need:

*   A {op-system-base} KVM host configured with an OSA or RoCE network adapter.
*   Either a {op-system-base} KVM host that is configured to use bridged networking in libvirt or MacVTap to connect the network to the guests.

[id="host-machine-resource-requirements_{context}"]
== Host machine resource requirements
The {op-system-base} KVM host in your environment must meet the following requirements to host the virtual machines that you plan for the {product-title} environment. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_and_managing_virtualization/getting-started-with-virtualization-in-rhel-8_configuring-and-managing-virtualization[Getting started with virtualization].

You can install {product-title} version {product-version} on the following IBM hardware:

* IBM z15 (all models), IBM z14 (all models), IBM z13, and IBM z13s
* LinuxONE, any version

[id="minimum-ibm-z-system-requirements_{context}"]
== Minimum IBM Z system environment

[discrete]
=== Hardware requirements

* The equivalent of 6 IFLs, which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* At least one network connection to both connect to the `LoadBalancer` service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You can use dedicated or shared IFLs to assign sufficient compute resources. Resource sharing is one of the key strengths of IBM Z. However, you must adjust capacity correctly on each hypervisor layer and ensure sufficient resources for every {product-title} cluster.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since the overall performance of the cluster can be impacted, the LPARs that are used to setup the {product-title} clusters must provide sufficient compute capacity. In this context, LPAR weight management, entitlements, and CPU shares on the hypervisor level play an important role.
====

[discrete]
=== Operating system requirements
* One LPAR running {op-system-base} 8.3 or later with KVM, which is managed via libvirt

On your {op-system-base} KVM host, set up:

* 3 guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines
* 2 guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines
* 1 guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine

[id="minimum-resource-requirements_{context}"]

== Preferred IBM Z system environment

[discrete]
=== Hardware requirements

* 3 LPARS that each have the equivalent of 6 IFLs, which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* Two network connections to connect to both connect to the `LoadBalancer` service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.

[discrete]
=== Operating system requirements

* For high availability, 2 or 3 LPARs running {op-system-base} 8.3 or later with KVM, which are managed via libvirt.

On your {op-system-base} KVM host, set up:

* 3 guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines, distributed across the {op-system-base} KVM host machines.
* At least 6 guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines, distributed across the {op-system-base} KVM host machines.
* 1 guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine.
* To ensure the availability of integral components in an overcommitted environment, increase the priority of the control plane by using `cpu_shares`. Do the same for infrastructure nodes, if they exist. See link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=domain-schedinfo[schedinfo] in IBM Documentation.
