= Network flow table enhancements

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability flow table provides a granular, real-time view of network traffic within the cluster.

The flow table aggregates data collected by the eBPF agent and displays it within the {product-title} web console. These enhancements allow network administrators to isolate specific traffic patterns across both containerized and virtualized workloads.

== Key features of the enhanced flow table
* SDN-integrated IP management: For clusters using OVN-Kubernetes, the table now tracks and displays IP addresses assigned to OpenShift Virtual Machines. This allows you to manage IP address management (IPAM) directly within the SDN rather than relying on external DHCP solutions.
* Dynamic column configuration: You can customize the table layout by selecting specific metadata columns, such as source and destination namespaces, ports, and protocols.
* Advanced querying: The table supports a query expression language that enables complex filtering, such as excluding specific IP ranges or isolating traffic between nested workloads.

By leveraging these table enhancements, you can more efficiently identify network bottlenecks and security anomalies across your cluster infrastructure.

//Rel notes: In Network Observability Operator 1.11, the NetFlows table includes enhancements that improve data visibility and simplify the management of large datasets.
