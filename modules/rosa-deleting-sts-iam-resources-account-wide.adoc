= Deleting the account-wide IAM resources

After you have deleted all {product-title} (ROSA) with AWS Security Token Services (STS) clusters that depend on the account-wide AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources, you can delete the account-wide resources.

If you no longer need to install a ROSA with STS cluster by using {cluster-manager-first}, you can also delete the {cluster-manager} and user IAM roles.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The account-wide IAM roles and policies might be used by other ROSA clusters in the same AWS account. You must only remove the resources if they are not required by other clusters.

The {cluster-manager} and user IAM roles are required if you want to install, manage, and delete other ROSA clusters in the same AWS account by using {cluster-manager}. You must only remove the roles if you no longer need to install ROSA clusters in your account by using {cluster-manager}. See the "Additional resources" section for information on repairing your cluster if these roles are removed prior to deletion.
