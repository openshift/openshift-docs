= Creating bare metal hosts for the hosted cluster

A _bare metal host_ is an `openshift-machine-api` object that encompasses physical and logical details so that it can be identified by a Metal3 Operator. Those details are associated with other Assisted Service objects, known as _agents_.

.Prerequisites

Before you create the bare metal host and destination nodes, you must have the destination machines ready.

.Procedure

To create a bare metal host, complete the following steps:

. Create a YAML file with the following information:
+
Because you have at least one secret that holds the bare metal host credentials, you need to create at least two objects for each worker node.

<1> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with your hosted cluster.
<2> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with your hosted cluster. Replace `<hosted_cluster_namespace>` with the name of your hosted cluster namespace.
<3> Specify the password of the baseboard management controller (BMC) in Base64 format.
<4> Specify the user name of the BMC in Base64 format.
<5> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with your hosted cluster. The `infraenvs.agent-install.openshift.io` field serves as the link between the Assisted Installer and the `BareMetalHost` objects.
<6> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with your hosted cluster. The `bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/hostname` field represents the node name that is adopted during deployment.
<7> The `automatedCleaningMode` field prevents the node from being erased by the Metal3 Operator.
<8> The `disableCertificateVerification` field is set to `true` to bypass certificate validation from the client.
<9> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with your hosted cluster. The `address` field denotes the BMC address of the worker node.
<10> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with your hosted cluster. The `credentialsName` field points to the secret where the user and password credentials are stored.
<11> The `bootMACAddress` field indicates the interface MAC address that the node starts from.
<12> The `online` field defines the state of the node after the `BareMetalHost` object is created.

. Deploy the `BareMetalHost` object by entering the following command:

[source,terminal]

$ oc apply -f 04-bmh.yaml

During the process, you can view the following output:

The agents represent nodes that are available for installation. To assign the nodes to a hosted cluster, scale up the node pool.
