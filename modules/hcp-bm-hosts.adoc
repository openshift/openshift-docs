= Creating bare metal hosts for the hosted cluster

A _bare metal host_ is an `openshift-machine-api` object that encompasses physical and logical details so that it can be identified by a Metal3 Operator. Those details are associated with other Assisted Service objects, known as _agents_.

.Prerequisites

* Before you create the bare metal host and destination nodes, you must have the destination machines ready.

* You have installed a {op-system-first} compute machine on bare-metal infrastructure for use in the cluster.

.Procedure

To create a bare metal host, complete the following steps:

. Create a YAML file with the following information. For more information about what details to enter for the bare metal host, see "Provisioning new hosts in a user-provisioned cluster by using the BMO".
+
Because you have at least one secret that holds the bare metal host credentials, you need to create at least two objects for each worker node.

where:

<hosted_cluster_name>:: Specifies the name of your hosted cluster.

<hosted_cluster_namespace>:: Specifies the name of your hosted cluster namespace.

password:: Specifies the password of the baseboard management controller (BMC) in Base64 format.

username:: Specifies the user name of the BMC in Base64 format.

infraenvs.agent-install.openshift.io:: Serves as the link between the Assisted Installer and the `BareMetalHost` objects.

bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/hostname:: Represents the node name that is adopted during deployment.

automatedCleaningMode:: Prevents the node from being erased by the Metal3 Operator.

disableCertificateVerification:: Is set to `true` to bypass certificate validation from the client.

address:: Denotes the BMC address of the worker node.

credentialsName:: Points to the secret where the user and password credentials are stored.

bootMACAddress:: Indicates the interface MAC address that the node starts from.

online:: Defines the state of the node after the `BareMetalHost` object is created.

. Deploy the `BareMetalHost` object by entering the following command:

The agents represent nodes that are available for installation. To assign the nodes to a hosted cluster, scale up the node pool.
