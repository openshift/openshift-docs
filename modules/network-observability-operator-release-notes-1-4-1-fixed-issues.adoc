= Network Observability Operator release notes 1.4.1 fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the following fixed issues in the Network Observability Operator 1.4.1 release.

* In 1.4, there was a known issue when sending network flow data to Kafka. The Kafka message key was ignored, causing an error with connection tracking. Now the key is used for partitioning, so each flow from the same connection is sent to the same processor. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-926[*NETOBSERV-926*])

* In 1.4, the `Inner` flow direction was introduced to account for flows between pods running on the same node. Flows with the `Inner` direction were not taken into account in the generated Prometheus metrics derived from flows, resulting in under-evaluated bytes and packets rates.
Now, derived metrics are including flows with the `Inner` direction, providing correct bytes and packets rates. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1344[*NETOBSERV-1344*])
