= About offline mode

Normally, when you execute `kn service` commands, the changes immediately propagate to the cluster. However, as an alternative, you can execute `kn service` commands in offline mode:

. When you create a service in offline mode, no changes happen on the cluster. Instead, the only thing that happens is the creation of the service descriptor file on your local machine.
. After the descriptor file is created, you can manually modify it and track it in a version control system.
// Once `update` works, add it here and make it into a list
. Finally, you can propagate changes to the cluster by using the `kn service create -f`, `kn service apply -f`, or `oc apply -f` commands on the descriptor files.

The offline mode has several uses:

* You can manually modify the descriptor file before using it to make changes on the cluster.
* You can locally track the descriptor file of a service in a version control system. This enables you to reuse the descriptor file in places other than the target cluster, for example in continuous integration (CI) pipelines, development environments, or demos.
* You can examine the created descriptor files to learn about Knative services. In particular, you can see how the resulting service is influenced by the different arguments passed to the `kn` command.

The offline mode has its advantages: it is fast, and does not require a connection to the cluster. However, offline mode lacks server-side validation. Consequently, you cannot, for example, verify that the service name is unique or that the specified image can be pulled.
