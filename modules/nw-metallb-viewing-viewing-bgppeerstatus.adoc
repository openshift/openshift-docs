= Viewing ServiceBGPStatus

The ServiceBGPStatus CR provides insights into which BGP peers a specific service is being advertised to from a given node. This is a crucial tool for network administrators in Telco environments to verify BGP advertisement and debug connectivity.

.Prerequisites

* You have an {product-title} cluster with the MetalLB Operator installed.
* You have at least one MetalLB Custom Resource (CR) instance created.

.Procedure

. View the status of the ServiceBGPStatus CR by running the following command: 
+ 
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ServiceBGPStatus -n metallb-system
----
.Example output:

<1> This label indicates the node that is advertising the service via BGP.
<2> This label identifies the service being advertised.
<3> This field lists the names of the BGP peers to which the service is being advertised. This is useful for confirming that the advertisement is reaching the intended peers.
