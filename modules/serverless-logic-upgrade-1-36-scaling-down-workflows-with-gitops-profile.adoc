= Scaling down workflows with the gitops profile

Before upgrading the Operator, you must scale down workflows running with the `gitops` profile, and scale them up again after the upgrade is complete.

.Procedure

. Modify the `my-workflow.yaml` custom resources (CR) and scale down each workflow to `0` before upgrading as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  podTemplate:
    replicas: 0
  # ...
----

. Apply the updated `my-workflow.yaml` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f my-workflow.yaml -n <target_namespace>
----

. Optional: Scale the workflow to `0` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch workflow <workflow_name> -n <target_namespace> --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"podTemplate": {"replicas": 0}}}'
