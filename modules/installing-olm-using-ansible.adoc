To install the Technology Preview Operator Framework, you can use the included
playbook with the {product-title} `openshift-ansible` installer after installing
your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, the Technology Preview Operator Framework can be installed during
initial cluster installation. See
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-the-operator-lifecycle-manager[Configuring Your Inventory File]
for separate instructions.

.Prerequisites

- An existing {product-title} 3.11 cluster
- Access to the cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions
- Ansible playbooks provided by the latest `openshift-ansible` installer

.Procedure
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. In the inventory file used to install and manage your {product-title} cluster,
add the `openshift_additional_registry_credentials` variable in the
`[OSEv3:vars]` section, setting credentials required to pull the Operator
containers:
+
----
openshift_additional_registry_credentials=[{'host':'registry.connect.redhat.com','user':'<your_user_name>','password':'<your_password>','test_image':'mongodb/enterprise-operator:0.3.2'}]
----
+
Set `user` and `password` to the credentials that you use to log in to the Red
Hat Customer Portal at link:https://access.redhat.com[].
+
The `test_image` represents an image that will be used to test the credentials
you provided.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

. Change to the playbook directory and run the registry authorization playbook using your inventory file to authorize
your nodes using your credentials from the previous step:
+
[subs=attributes+]
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
   playbooks/updates/registry_auth.yml
----

. Change to the playbook directory and run the OLM installation playbook using your inventory file:
+
[subs=attributes+]
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
   playbooks/olm/config.yml
----

. Navigate to the cluster's web console using a browser. A new section should now be available in the navigation on the left side of the page:

.New Operators navigation section

+
This is where you can install Operators, grant projects access to them, and then
launch instances for all of your environments.
