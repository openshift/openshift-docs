= Adding a Pod to an additional network

You can add a Pod to an additional network. The Pod continues to send normal
cluster related network traffic over the default network.

ifdef::sriov[]
[NOTE]
=====
The Network Resources Injector will inject the `resource` parameter into the Pod CR automatically if a NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR associated with the SR-IOV CNI plug-in is specified.
=====
endif::sriov[]

.Prerequisites

* The Pod must be in the same namespace as the additional network.
* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* You must log in to the cluster.
ifdef::sriov[]
* You must have the SR-IOV Operator installed and a SriovNetwork CR defined.
endif::sriov[]

.Procedure

To add a Pod with additional networks, complete the following steps:

. Create the Pod resource definition and add the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks`
parameter to the Pod `metadata` mapping. The `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks`
accepts a comma separated string of one or more NetworkAttachmentDefinition Custom Resource (CR) names:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: <network>[,<network>,...] <1>
----
<1> Replace `<network>` with the name of the additional network to associate
with the Pod. To specify more than one additional network, separate each network
with a comma. Do not include whitespace between the comma. If you specify
the same additional network multiple times, that Pod will have multiple network
interfaces attached to that network.
+
In the following example, two additional networks are attached to the Pod:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: net1,net2
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-pod
    command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep 2000000000000"]
    image: centos/tools
----

. Create the Pod by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc create -f pod.yaml
----

. Optional: Confirm that the annotation exists in the Pod CR by running the
following command. Replace `<name>` with the name of the Pod.
+
----
$ oc get pod <name> -o yaml
----
+
In the following example, the `example-pod` Pod is attached to the `net1`
additional network:
+
----
$ oc get pod example-pod -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-bridge
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status: |- <1>
      [{
          "name": "openshift-sdn",
          "interface": "eth0",
          "ips": [
              "10.128.2.14"
          ],
          "default": true,
          "dns": {}
      },{
          "name": "macvlan-bridge",
          "interface": "net1",
          "ips": [
              "20.2.2.100"
          ],
          "mac": "22:2f:60:a5:f8:00",
          "dns": {}
      }]
  name: example-pod
  namespace: default
spec:
  ...
status:
  ...
----
<1> The `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status` parameter is a JSON array of
objects. Each object describes the status of an additional network attached
to the Pod. The annotation value is stored as a plain text value.
