= Adding a pod to an additional network

You can add a pod to an additional network. The pod continues to send normal cluster-related network traffic over the default network.

When a pod is created additional networks are attached to it. However, if a pod already exists, you cannot attach additional networks to it.

The pod must be in the same namespace as the additional network.

[NOTE]
=====
The SR-IOV Network Resource Injector adds the `resource` field to the first container in a pod automatically.

If you are using an Intel network interface controller (NIC) in Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) mode, only the first container in your pod is configured to access the NIC. Your SR-IOV additional network is configured for DPDK mode if the `deviceType` is set to `vfio-pci` in the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` object.

You can work around this issue by either ensuring that the container that needs access to the NIC is the first container defined in the `Pod` object or by disabling the Network Resource Injector. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990953[BZ#1990953].

[IMPORTANT]
====
When specifying an SR-IOV hardware network for a `Deployment` object or a `ReplicationController` object, you must specify the namespace of the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object. For more information, see the following bugs: link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1846333[BZ#1846333] and link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1840962[BZ#1840962].

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in to the cluster.
ifdef::sriov[]
* Install the SR-IOV Operator.
* Create either an `SriovNetwork` object or an `SriovIBNetwork` object to attach the pod to.

.Procedure

. Add an annotation to the `Pod` object. Only one of the following annotation formats can be used:

.. To attach an additional network without any customization, add an annotation with the following format. Replace `<network>` with the name of the additional network to associate with the pod:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: <network>[,<network>,...] <1>
----
<1> To specify more than one additional network, separate each network
with a comma. Do not include whitespace between the comma. If you specify
the same additional network multiple times, that pod will have multiple network
interfaces attached to that network.

.. To attach an additional network with customizations, add an annotation with the following format:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: |-
      [
        {
          "name": "<network>", <1>
          "namespace": "<namespace>", <2>
          "default-route": ["<default-route>"] <3>
        }
      ]
----
<1> Specify the name of the additional network defined by a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object.
<2> Specify the namespace where the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object is defined.
<3> Optional: Specify an override for the default route, such as `192.168.17.1`.

. To create the pod, enter the following command. Replace `<name>` with the name of the pod.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <name>.yaml
----

. Optional: To Confirm that the annotation exists in the `Pod` CR, enter the following command, replacing `<name>` with the name of the pod.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod <name> -o yaml
----
+
In the following example, the `example-pod` pod is attached to the `net1`
additional network:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod example-pod -o yaml

    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-bridge
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status: |- <1>

          "mac": "22:2f:60:a5:f8:00",
          "dns": {}
      }]
  name: example-pod
  namespace: default
spec:
  ...
status:
  ...
----
<1> The `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status` parameter is a JSON array of
objects. Each object describes the status of an additional network attached
to the pod. The annotation value is stored as a plain text value.
