= Removing manifests for RPM systems

Use the following procedure in the data removal scenario for RPM systems to completely delete the resource defined in the Kustomize manifests.

.Procedure

. Identify the manifest that needs to be placed in the `delete` subdirectories.
. Create the `delete` subdirectory in which the manifest will be placed by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mkdir -p _<path_of_delete_directory>_ <1>
----
<1> Replace `_<path_of_delete_directory>_` with the path of the delete subdirectory, for example, `/etc/microshift/manifests.d/delete`, `/etc/microshift/manifests/delete/`, `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/delete` or `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests/delete`.
. Move the manifest file into one of the `delete` subdirectories under the configured manifests directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ [sudo] mv _<path_of_manifests>_ _<path_of_delete_directory>_ <1>
----
<1> Replace `_<path_of_manifests>_` with the path of the manifest to be deleted, for example, `/etc/microshift/manifests.d/010-SOME-MANIFEST`. Replace `_<path_of_delete_directory>_` with the path of the delete subdirectory, for example, `/etc/microshift/manifests.d/delete`, `/etc/microshift/manifests/delete`, `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/delete` or `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests/delete`.
. Restart {microshift-short} by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart microshift
----
. {microshift-short} detects and removes the resource after the manifest file is placed in the `delete` subdirectories.
