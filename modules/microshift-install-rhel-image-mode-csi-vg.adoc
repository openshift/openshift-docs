[id="microshift-rhel-image-mode-csi-vg_{context}"]
= Checking the host configuration for the {microshift-short} CSI

If the host is already configured to have a volume group (VG) with free space, that configuration is inherited by the container. The VG can be used by the {microshift-short} Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Container Storage Interface (CSI) to allocate storage.

.Prerequisites

* A {op-system-base-full} {op-system-version} host with an active Red Hat subscription for building {microshift-short} bootc images and running containers.
* You are logged into the {op-system-base} {op-system-version} host using the user credentials that have `sudo` permissions.

.Procedure

. Determine if the volume group exists and it has the necessary free space by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo vgs
----
+
.Example output for existing volume group
[source,terminal]
----
  VG   #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize   VFree # <1>
  rhel   1   1   0 wz--n- <91.02g <2.02g
----
<1> If no free volume group is present, the output is either empty or the `VFree` value is 0.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the host has a volume group with the available needed storage, you can run your container now. You do not need to configure the {microshift-short} CSI further.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not have a volume group, you must set one up for the LVM CSI to allocate storage in bootc {microshift-short} containers. See the additional resources for more information.
