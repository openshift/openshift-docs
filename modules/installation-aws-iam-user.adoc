= Creating an IAM user

Each Amazon Web Services (AWS) account contains a root user account that is
based on the email address you used to create the account. This is a
highly-privileged account, and it is recommended to use it for only initial
account and billing configuration, creating an initial set of users, and
securing the account.

Before you install {product-title}, create a secondary IAM
administrative user. As you complete the
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html[Creating an IAM User in Your AWS Account]
procedure in the AWS documentation, set the following options:

.Procedure

. Specify the IAM user name and select `Programmatic access`.

. Attach the `AdministratorAccess` policy to ensure that the account has
sufficient permission to create the cluster. This policy provides the cluster
with the ability to grant credentials to each {product-title} component. The
cluster grants the components only the credentials that they require.
+
[NOTE]
====
While it is possible to create a policy that grants the all of the required
AWS permissions and attach it to the user, this is not the preferred option.
The cluster will not have the ability to grant additional credentials to
individual components, so the same credentials are used by all components.
====

. Optional: Add metadata to the user by attaching tags.

. Confirm that the user name that you specified is granted the
`AdministratorAccess` policy.

. Record the access key ID and secret access key values. You must use these
values when you configure your local machine to run the installation program.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot use a temporary session token that you generated while using a
multi-factor authentication device to authenticate to AWS when you deploy a
cluster. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to
create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must
use key-based, long-term credentials.
