= Creating an IAM user

Each Amazon Web Services (AWS) account contains a root user account that is
based on the email address you used to create the account. This is a
highly-privileged account, and it is recommended to use it for only initial
account and billing configuration, creating an initial set of users, and
securing the account.

Before you install {product-title}, create a secondary IAM
administrative user. As you complete the
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html[Creating an IAM User in Your AWS Account]
procedure in the AWS documentation, set the following options:

.Procedure

. Specify the IAM user name and select `Programmatic access`.

. Attach the `AdministratorAccess` policy to ensure that the account has
sufficient permission to create the cluster.

. Optionally, add metadata to the user by attaching tags.

. Confirm that the user name that you specified is granted the
`AdministratorAccess` policy.

. Record the access key ID and secret access key values. You must use these
values when you configure your local machine to run the installation program, and this is
the only time that you can obtain them.
