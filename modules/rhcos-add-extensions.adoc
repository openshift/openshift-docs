= Adding extensions to {op-system}
{op-system} is a minimal container-oriented RHEL operating system, designed to provide a common set of capabilities to {product-title} clusters across all platforms. While adding software packages to {op-system} systems is generally discouraged, the MCO provides an `extensions` feature you can use to add a minimal set of features to {op-system} nodes.

Currently, the following extension is available:

* **usbguard**: Adding the `usbguard` extension protects {op-system} systems from attacks from intrusive USB devices. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/security_hardening/index#usbguard_protecting-systems-against-intrusive-usb-devices[USBGuard] for details.

The following procedure describes how to use a machine config to add one or more extensions to your {op-system} nodes.

.Prerequisites
* Have a running {product-title} cluster (version 4.6 or later).
* Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a machine config for extensions: Create a YAML file (for example, `80-extensions.yaml`) that contains a `MachineConfig` `extensions` object. This example tells the cluster to add the `usbguard` extension.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF > 80-extensions.yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: 80-worker-extensions
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
  extensions:
    - usbguard
EOF
----

. Add the machine config to the cluster. Type the following to add the machine config to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f 80-extensions.yaml
----
+
This sets all worker nodes to have rpm packages for `usbguard` installed.

. Check that the extensions were applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfig 80-worker-extensions
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----

80-worker-extensions                       3.2.0           57s
----

. Check that the new machine config is now applied and that the nodes are not in a degraded state. It may take a few minutes. The worker pool will show the updates in progress, as each machine successfully has the new machine config applied:

$ oc get machineconfigpool

$ oc get node | grep worker
