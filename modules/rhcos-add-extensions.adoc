= Adding extensions to {op-system}
{op-system} is a minimal container-oriented RHEL operating system, designed to provide a common set
of capabilities to {product-title} clusters across all platforms.
While adding software packages to {op-system} systems is generally
discouraged, the MCO provides an `extensions` feature you can use to add
a minimal set of features to {op-system} nodes.

Currently, the following extension is available:

* **usbguard**: Adding the `usbguard` extension protects {op-system} systems
from attacks from intrusive USB devices.
See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/security_hardening/index#usbguard_protecting-systems-against-intrusive-usb-devices[USBGuard]
for details.

The following procedure describes how to use a MachineConfig to add
one or more extensions to your {op-system} nodes.

.Prerequisites
* Have a running {product-title} cluster (version 4.6 or later).
* Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a MachineConfig for extensions: Create a YAML file (for example,
`80-extensions.yaml`) that contains a MachineConfig `extensions` object.
This example tells the cluster to add the `usbguard` extension.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF > 80-extensions.yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: 80-worker-extensions
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.1.0
  extensions:
    - usbguard
EOF
----

. Add the MachineConfig to the cluster. Type the following to add the MachineConfig
to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f 80-extensions.yaml
----
+
This sets all worker nodes to have rpm packages for `usbguard`
installed.

. Check that the extensions were applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfig 80-worker-extensions
NAME                 GENERATEDBYCONTROLLER IGNITIONVERSION AGE
80-worker-extensions                       3.1.0           57s
----

. Check that the new MachineConfig has been applied and that the nodes
are not in a degraded state. It may take a few minutes.
The worker pool will show the updates in progress, as each machine successfully
has the new MachineConfig applied:
+
[source,terminal]

$ oc get machineconfigpool

----


. Check the extensions. To check that the extension was applied, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get node | grep worker
