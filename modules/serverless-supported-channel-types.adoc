= Supported channel types

Currently, {ServerlessProductName} only supports `InMemoryChannel` type channels for development use, as part of the Knative Eventing Technology Preview.

The following are limitations of InMemoryChannel type channels:

* No event persistence is available. If a pod goes down, events on that pod are lost.
* InMemoryChannel type channels do not implement event ordering, so two events that are received in the channel at the same time can be delivered to a subscriber in any order.
* If a subscriber rejects an event, there are no re-delivery attempts. Instead, the rejected event is sent to a `deadLetterSink` if this sink exists, or is dropped.
