= Setting the VM interface link state by using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can set the link state of a primary or secondary virtual machine (VM) network interface by using the CLI.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).


.Procedure
. Edit the VM configuration to set the interface link state, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: my-vm
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          interfaces:
            - name: default # <1>
              state: down # <2>
              masquerade: { }
      networks:
        - name: default
          pod: { }
# ...
----
<1> The name of the interface.
<2> The state of the interface. The possible values are:
+
* `up`: Represents an active network connection. This is the default if no value is specified.
* `down`: Represents a network interface link that is switched off.
* `absent`: Represents a network interface that is hot unplugged.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have defined readiness or liveness probes to run VM health checks, setting the primary interface's link state to `down` causes the probes to fail. If a liveness probe fails, the VM is deleted and a new VM is created to restore responsiveness.
====

. Apply the `VirtualMachine` manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----

.Verification
* Verify that the desired link state is set by checking the `status.interfaces.linkState` field of the `VirtualMachineInstance` manifest.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vmi <vmi-name>
----
+
Example output:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
metadata:
  name: my-vm
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:
      - name: default
        state: down
        masquerade: { }
  networks:
  - name: default
    pod: { }
status:
  interfaces:
    - name: default
      linkState: down
# ...
