= Creating a trigger by using the Knative CLI

Using the Knative (`kn`) CLI to create triggers provides a more streamlined and intuitive user interface over modifying YAML files directly. You can use the `kn trigger create` command to create a trigger.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* You have installed the Knative (`kn`) CLI.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

.Procedure

* Create a trigger:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn trigger create <trigger_name> --broker <broker_name> --filter <key=value> --sink <sink_name>
----
+
Alternatively, you can create a trigger and simultaneously create the `default` broker using broker injection:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn trigger create <trigger_name> --inject-broker --filter <key=value> --sink <sink_name>
----
+
By default, triggers forward all events sent to a broker to sinks that are subscribed to that broker.
Using the `--filter` attribute for triggers allows you to filter events from a broker, so that subscribers will only receive a subset of events based on your defined criteria.
