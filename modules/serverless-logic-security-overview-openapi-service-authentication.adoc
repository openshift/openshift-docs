= Overview of OpenAPI service authentication

In {ServerlessLogicProductName}, you can secure OpenAPI service operations using the `Security Schemes` defined in the OpenAPI specification file. These schemes help define the authentication requirements for operations invoked within a workflow.

The `Security Schemes` are declared in the `securitySchemes` section of the OpenAPI document. Each scheme specifies the type of authentication to apply, such as HTTP Basic, API key, and so on.

When a workflow calls a secured operation, it references these defined schemes to determine the required authentication configuration.

.Example security scheme definitions
[source,json]
----
"securitySchemes": {
  "http-basic-example": {
    "type": "http",
    "scheme": "basic"
  },
  "api-key-example": {
    "type": "apiKey",
    "name": "my-example-key",
    "in": "header"
  }
}
----

If the OpenAPI file defines `Security Schemes` but does not include  `Security Requirements` for operations, the generator can be configured to create them by default. These defaults apply to operations without explicitly defined requirements.

To configure that scheme, you must use the `quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.default-security-scheme` property. The `default-security-scheme` property is used only at code generation time and not during the runtime. The value must match any of the available schemes in `securitySchemes` section, such as `http-basic-example` or `api-key-example`:

.For Example
[source,terminal]
----
$ quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.default-security-scheme=http-basic-example
