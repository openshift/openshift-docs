= VMware vSphere CSI Driver Operator requirements

To install the vSphere CSI Driver Operator, the following requirements must be met:

* VMware vSphere version 7.0 Update 2 or later
* vCenter 7.0 Update 2 or later
* Virtual machines of hardware version 15 or later
* No third-party vSphere CSI driver already installed in the cluster

If a third-party vSphere CSI driver is present in the cluster, {product-title} does not overwrite it. The presence of a third-party vSphere CSI driver prevents {product-title} from updating to {product-title} 4.13 or later.

[NOTE]
====
The VMware vSphere CSI Driver Operator is supported only on clusters deployed with `platform: vsphere` in the installation manifest.
