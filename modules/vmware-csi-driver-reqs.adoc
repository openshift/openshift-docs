= VMware vSphere CSI Driver Operator requirements

To install the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator, the following requirements must be met:

* VMware vSphere version: 7.0 Update 2 or later, or VMware Cloud Foundation 4.3 or later; 8.0 Update 1 or later, or VMware Cloud Foundation 5.0 or later
* vCenter version: 7.0 Update 2 or later, or VMware Cloud Foundation 4.3 or later; 8.0 Update 1 or later, or VMware Cloud Foundation 5.0 or later
* Virtual machines of hardware version 15 or later
* No third-party vSphere CSI driver already installed in the cluster

If a third-party vSphere CSI driver is present in the cluster, {product-title} does not overwrite it. The presence of a third-party vSphere CSI driver prevents {product-title} from updating to {product-title} 4.13 or later.

[NOTE]
====
The VMware vSphere CSI Driver Operator is supported only on clusters deployed with `platform: vsphere` in the installation manifest.
====

You can create a custom role for the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver, the vSphere CSI Driver Operator, and the vSphere Problem Detector Operator. The custom role can include privilege sets that assign a minimum set of permissions to each vSphere object. This means that the CSI driver, the vSphere CSI Driver Operator, and the vSphere Problem Detector Operator can establish a basic interaction with these objects.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Installing an {product-title} cluster in a vCenter is tested against a full list of privileges as described in the "Required vCenter account privileges" section. By adhering to the full list of privileges, you can reduce the possibility of unexpected and unsupported behaviors that might occur when creating a custom role with a set of restricted privileges.
