= Using the Curator Action file

The *Curator* ConfigMap in the `openshift-logging` project includes a link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/5.2/actionfile.html[Curator *action* file] where you configure any Curator action to be run periodically.

However, when you use the *action* file, {product-title} ignores the `config.yaml` section of the *curator* ConfigMap, which is configured to ensure important internal indices do not get deleted by mistake.  In order to use the *action* file, you should add an exclude rule to your configuration to retain these indices. You also must manually add all the other patterns following the steps in this topic.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `actions` and `config.yaml` are mutually-exclusive configuration files.  Once the `actions` file exist, {product-title} ignores the `config.yaml` file.
Using the *action* file is recommended only for advanced users as using this file can be destructive to the cluster and can cause removal of required indices/settings from Elasticsearch.
====

.Prerequisite

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

* Set cluster logging to the unmanaged state. Operators in an unmanaged state are unsupported and the cluster administrator assumes full control of the individual component configurations and upgrades.

.Procedure

To configure Curator to delete indices:

. Edit the Curator ConfigMap:
+
----
oc edit cm/curator -n openshift-logging
----

. Make the following changes to the `action` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
actions:
1:
      action: delete_indices <1>
      description: >-
        Delete .operations indices older than 30 days.
        Ignore the error if the filter does not
        result in an actionable list of indices (ignore_empty_list).
        See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/5.2/ex_delete_indices.html
      options:
        # Swallow curator.exception.NoIndices exception
        ignore_empty_list: True
        # In seconds, default is 300
        timeout_override: ${CURATOR_TIMEOUT}
        # Don't swallow any other exceptions
        continue_if_exception: False
        # Optionally disable action, useful for debugging
        disable_action: False
      # All filters are bound by logical AND
      filters:            <2>
      - filtertype: pattern
        kind: regex
        value: '^\.operations\..*$'
        exclude: False    <3>
      - filtertype: age
        # Parse timestamp from index name
        source: name
        direction: older
        timestring: '%Y.%m.%d'
        unit: days
        unit_count: 30
        exclude: False
----
<1> Specify `delete_indices` to delete the specified index.
<2> Use the `filers` parameters to specify the index to be deleted. See the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/5.2/filters.html[Elastic Search curator documentation] for information on these parameters.
<3> Specify `false` to allow the index to be deleted.
