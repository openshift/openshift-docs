= Managing user-defined labels and tags for GCP

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides labels and tags that help to identify and organize the resources created for a specific {product-title} cluster, making them easier to manage.

You can define labels and tags for each GCP resource only during {product-title} cluster installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
User-defined labels and tags are not supported for {product-title} clusters upgraded to {product-title} {product-version}.
====

[NOTE]
====
You cannot update the tags that are already added. Also, a new tag-supported resource creation fails if the configured tag keys or tag values are deleted.
====

.User-defined labels

User-defined labels and {product-title} specific labels are applied only to resources created by {product-title} installation program and its core components such as:

* GCP filestore CSI Driver Operator
* GCP PD CSI Driver Operator
* Image Registry Operator
* Machine API provider for GCP

User-defined labels are not attached to the resources created by any other Operators or the Kubernetes in-tree components.

User-defined labels and {product-title} labels are available on the following GCP resources:

* Compute disk
* Compute forwarding rule
* Compute image
* Compute instance
* DNS managed zone
* Filestore backup 
* Filestore instance
* Storage bucket

.Limitations to user-defined labels

* Labels for `ComputeAddress` are supported in the GCP beta version. {product-title} does not add labels to the resource.

.User-defined tags

User-defined tags are applied only to resources created by {product-title} installation program and its core components, such as the following resources:

* GCP FileStore CSI Driver Operator
* GCP PD CSI Driver Operator
* Image Registry Operator
* Machine API provider for GCP

User-defined tags are not attached to the resources created by any other Operators or the Kubernetes in-tree components.

User-defined tags are available on the following GCP resources:

* Compute disk
* Compute instance
* Filestore backup
* Filestore instance
* Storage bucket

.Limitations to the user-defined tags

* Tags must not be restricted to particular service accounts, because Operators create and use service accounts with minimal roles.
* {product-title} does not create any key and value resources of the tag.
* {product-title} specific tags are not added to any resource.
