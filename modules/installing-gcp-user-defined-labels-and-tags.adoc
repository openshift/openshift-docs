= Managing user-defined labels and tags for GCP

:FeatureName: Support for user-defined labels and tags for GCP
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides labels and tags that help to identify and organize the resources created for a specific {product-title} cluster, making them easier to manage.

You can define labels and tags for each GCP resource only during {product-title} cluster installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
User-defined labels and tags are not supported for {product-title} clusters upgraded to {product-title} 4.14 version.
====

.User-defined labels

User-defined labels and {product-title} specific labels are applied only to resources created by {product-title} installation program and its core components such as:

* GCP filestore CSI Driver Operator
* GCP PD CSI Driver Operator
* Image Registry Operator
* Machine API provider for GCP

User-defined labels and {product-title} specific labels are not applied on the resources created by any other operators or the Kubernetes in-tree components that create resources, for example, the Ingress load balancers.

User-defined labels and {product-title} labels are available on the following GCP resources:

* Compute disk
* Compute instance
* Compute image
* Compute forwarding rule
* DNS managed zone
* Filestore instance
* Storage bucket

.Limitations to user-defined labels

* Labels for `ComputeAddress` are supported in the GCP beta version. {product-title} does not add labels to the resource.

.User-defined tags

User-defined tags are attached to resources created by the {product-title} Image Registry Operator and not on the resources created by any other Operators or the Kubernetes in-tree components.

User-defined tags are available on the following GCP resources:
* Storage bucket

.Limitations to the user-defined tags

* Tags will not be attached to the following items:
** Control plane instances and storage buckets created by the installation program
** Compute instances created by the Machine API provider for GCP
** Filestore instance resources created by the GCP filestore CSI driver Operator
** Compute disk and compute image resources created by the GCP PD CSI driver Operator
* Tags are not supported for buckets located in the following regions:
** `us-east2`
** `us-east3`
* Image Registry Operator does not throw any error but skips processing tags when the buckets are created in the tags unsupported region.
* Tags must not be restricted to particular service accounts, because Operators create and use service accounts with minimal roles.
* {product-title} does not create any key and value resources of the tag.
* {product-title} specific tags are not added to any resource.
