* *Policy*: The name of the violated policy.
* *Entity*: The entity where the violation occurred.
* *Type*: The type of entity, such as a deployment, namespace, or cluster.
* *Enforced*: Indicates if the policy was enforced when the violation occurred.
* *Severity*: Indicates the severity as `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, or `Critical`.
* *Categories*: The policy categories. Policy categories are listed in *Platform Configuration* -> *Policy Management* in the *Policy categories* tab.

* *Lifecycle*: The lifecycle stages to which the policy applies, `Build`, `Deploy`, or `Runtime`.
* *Time*: The date and time when the violation occurred.
