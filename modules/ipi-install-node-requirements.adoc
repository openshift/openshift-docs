= Node requirements

Installer-provisioned installation involves a number of hardware node requirements:

- **CPU architecture:** All nodes must use `x86_64` CPU architecture.

- **Similar nodes:** Red Hat recommends nodes have an identical configuration per role. That is, Red Hat recommends nodes be the same brand and model with the same CPU, memory, and storage configuration.

ifeval::[{release} < 4.5]
- **Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI):** Installer-provisioned installation requires IPMI enabled on each node.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{release} > 4.4]
- **Baseboard Management Controller:** The `provisioner` node must be able to access the baseboard management controller (BMC) of each {product-title} cluster node. You may use IPMI, RedFish, or a proprietary protocol.
endif::[]

- **Latest generation:** Nodes must be of the most recent generation. Because the installer-provisioned installation relies on BMC protocols, the hardware must support IPMI cipher suite 17. Additionally, {op-system-base} 8 ships with the most recent drivers for RAID controllers. Ensure that the nodes are recent enough to support {op-system-base} 8 for the `provisioner` node and {op-system} 8 for the control plane and worker nodes.

- **Latest generation:** Nodes must be of the most recent generation. Because the installer-provisioned installation relies on BMC protocols, the hardware must support IPMI cipher suite 17. Additionally, {op-system-first} ships with the most recent drivers for RAID controllers. Ensure that the nodes are recent enough to support {op-system} for the `provisioner` node and {op-system} for the control plane and worker nodes.
endif::[]

- **Registry node:** Optional: If setting up a disconnected mirrored registry, it is recommended the registry reside in its own node.

- **Provisioner node:** Installer-provisioned installation requires one `provisioner` node.

- **Control plane:** Installer-provisioned installation requires three control plane nodes for high availability.

- **Worker nodes:** While not required, a typical production cluster has one or more worker nodes. Smaller clusters are more resource efficient for administrators and developers during development and testing.

- **Network interfaces:** Each node must have at least one 10GB network interface for the routable `baremetal` network. Each node must have one 10GB network interface for a `provisioning` network *when using the `provisioning` network* for deployment. Using the `provisioning` network is the default configuration. Network interface names must follow the same naming convention across all nodes. For example, the first NIC name on a node, such as `eth0` or `eno1`, must be the same name on all of the other nodes. The same principle applies to the remaining NICs on each node.

ifeval::[{release} > 4.3]
- **Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI):** Installer-provisioned installation requires UEFI boot on all {product-title} nodes when using IPv6 addressing on the `provisioning` network. In addition, UEFI Device PXE Settings must be set to use the IPv6 protocol on the `provisioning` network NIC, but *omitting the `provisioning` network removes this requirement.*
