= Node requirements

IPI installation involves a number of hardware node requirements:

- **CPU architecture:** All nodes *must* use `x86_64` CPU architecture.

- **Similar nodes:** Nodes *should* have an identical configuration per role. That is, control plane nodes *should* be the same brand and model with the same CPU, RAM and storage configuration. Worker nodes should be *identical*.

//<IS CPU PINNING/NUMA AN ISSUE???>

- **Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI):** IPI installation requires IPMI enabled on each node.

- **Latest generation:** Nodes should be of the most recent generation. IPI installation relies on IPMI, which should be compatible across nodes. Additionally, RHEL 8 ships with the most recent drivers for RAID controllers. Ensure that the nodes are recent enough to support RHEL 8 for the provisioning node and RHCOS 8 for the worker nodes.

- **Network interfaces:** Each node *must* have at least two 10 GB network interfaces (NICs)- one for the `provisioning` network and one for the public `baremetal` network.
Network interface names *must* follow the same naming convention across all nodes.
For example, the first NIC name on a node, such as `eth0` or `eno1`, should be the same name on all of the other nodes.
The same principle applies to the remaining NICs on each node.

- **Provisioning node:** IPI installation requires one provisioning node.

- **Control plane:** IPI installation requires three control plane (master) nodes for high availability.

- **Worker nodes:** A typical production cluster will have many worker nodes. IPI installation in a high availability environment requires at least two worker nodes in an initial cluster.
