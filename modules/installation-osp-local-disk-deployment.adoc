= Deploying {rh-openstack} on local disk

If you have an existing {rh-openstack} cloud, you can move etcd from that cloud to a dedicated ephemeral local disk.


.Prerequisites

* You have an OpenStack cloud with a working Cinder.

* Your OpenStack cloud has at least 75 GB of available storage to accommodate 3 root volumes for the OpenShift control plane.

* The OpenStack cloud is deployed with Nova ephemeral storage that uses a local storage backend and not `rbd`.


.Procedure

. Create a Nova flavor for the control plane with at least 10 GB of ephemeral disk by running the following command, replacing the values for `--ram`, `--disk`, and <flavor_name> based on your environment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack flavor create --<ram 16384> --<disk 0> --ephemeral 10 --vcpus 4 <flavor_name>
----

. Deploy a cluster with root volumes for the control plane; for example:
+
.Example YAML file
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
controlPlane:
  name: master
  platform:
    openstack:
      type: ${CONTROL_PLANE_FLAVOR}
      rootVolume:
        size: 25
        types:
        - ${CINDER_TYPE}
  replicas: 3
# ...
----

. Deploy the cluster you created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> <1>
----
+
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the location of the customized `./install-config.yaml file` that you previously created.
+

. Verify that the cluster you deployed is healthy before proceeding to the next step by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait clusteroperators --all --for=condition=Progressing=false <1>
----
+
<1> Ensures that the cluster operators are finished progressing and that the cluster is not deploying or updating.

. Create a file named `98-var-lib-etcd.yaml` by using the following YAML file:
+

<1> The etcd database must be mounted by the device, not a label, to ensure that `systemd` generates the device dependency used in this config to trigger filesystem creation.
<2> Do not run if the file system `dev/disk/by-label/local-etcd` already exists.
<3> Fails with an alert message if `/dev/disk/by-label/ephemeral0` does not exist.
<4> Migrates existing data to local etcd database. This config does so after `/var/lib/etcd` is mounted, but before CRI-O starts so etcd is not running yet.
<5> Requires that etcd is mounted and does not contain a member directory, but the ostree does.
<6> Cleans up any previous migration state.
<7> Copies and moves in separate steps to ensure atomic creation of a complete member directory.
<8> Performs a quick check of the mount point directory before performing a full recursive relabel. If restorecon in the file path `/var/lib/etcd` cannot rename the directory, the recursive rename is not performed.

[WARNING]
====
After you apply the `98-var-lib-etcd.yaml` file to the system, do not remove it. Removing this file will break etcd members and lead to system instability.

If a rollback is necessary, modify the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` object to use a flavor that does not include ephemeral disks. This change regenerates the control plane nodes without using ephemeral disks for the etcd partition, which avoids issues related to the `98-var-lib-etcd.yaml` file. It is safe to remove the `98-var-lib-etcd.yaml` file only after the update to the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` object is complete and no control plane nodes are using ephemeral disks.
====

. Create the new `MachineConfig` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f 98-var-lib-etcd.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Moving the etcd database onto the local disk of each control plane machine takes time.
====

. Verify that the etcd databases has been transferred to the local disk of each control plane by running the following commands:
+
.. Verify that the cluster is still updating by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait --timeout=45m --for=condition=Updating=false machineconfigpool/master
----
.. Verify that the cluster is ready by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait node --selector='node-role.kubernetes.io/master' --for condition=Ready --timeout=30s
----
.. Verify that the cluster Operators are running in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait clusteroperators --timeout=30m --all --for=condition=Progressing=false
