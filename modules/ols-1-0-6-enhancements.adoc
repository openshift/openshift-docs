= OpenShift Lightspeed 1.0.6 new features and enhancements

{ols-official} 1.0.6 provides the following enhancements:

* This release makes {ols-official} 1.0.6 generally available, and is supported on {ocp-product-title} 4.16 and later.

* When viewing the cluster overview page in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes web console, you can attach the `ManagedCluster` YAML and `ManagedClusterInfo` YAML using the attach menu.

* This release introduces a check for the total size of all uploaded attachments, in addition to the existing check for individual attachment sizes. This check helps to prevent exceeding the context window size of the large language model (LLM) so that the model does not receive more text than it can process in a single response.
