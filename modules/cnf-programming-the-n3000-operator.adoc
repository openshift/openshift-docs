= Programming the OpenNESS Operator for Intel® FPGA PAC N3000

This section describes how to program the Intel® FPGA PAC N3000 with a vRAN 5G bitstream. This bitstream exposes the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) virtual function (VF) devices which can be used to accelerate the FEC in the vRAN workload.

As a cluster administrator, you can install the OpenNESS Operator for Intel® FPGA PAC N3000 using the {product-title} CLI or the web console.

== Programming the N3000 with a vRAN bitstream

As a cluster administrator, you can program the Intel® FPGA PAC N3000 with a vRAN 5G bitstream. This bitstream exposes the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) virtual function (VF) devices which can be used to accelerate the Forward Error Correction (FEC) in the vRAN workload.

[NOTE]
====
The role of the FEC is to correct transmission errors, where certain bits in a message can be lost or garbled – usually by noise in the transmission media, interference, or low signal strength – rendering the message unreadable by the receiving router.
Without FEC, a garbled message would have to be resent, adding to the network load and impacting both throughput and latency.

.Prerequisites

* Intel FPGA PAC N3000 card

* Node or nodes installed with n3000-operator

.Procedure

[NOTE]

The N3000 Daemon updates the FPGA user bitstream using the Open Programmable Acceleration Engine (OPAE) tools and resets the PCI device.
The update of the FPGA user bitstream may take up to 40 minutes per card. For programming cards on multiple nodes, the programming happens one node at a time.

* The node is drained and no workload is able to run during this time.
* Flashing is started
** The bitstream is flashed into the card.
** The bitstream is applied.
* After flashing is complete. The PCI device or devices on the node or nodes are reloaded. The Intel wireless operator is now able to find the new flashed device or devices.
