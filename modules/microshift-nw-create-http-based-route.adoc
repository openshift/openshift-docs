= Creating an HTTP-based route

[role="_abstract"]
To host your application at a public URL by using the basic HTTP routing protocol, create an HTTP-based route. This configuration exposes a service on an unsecured application port, allowing external access without TLS encryption.

A route can either be secure or unsecured, depending on the network security configuration of your application.

The following procedure describes how to create a simple HTTP-based route to a web application, using the `hello-microshift` application as an example.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {oc-first}.
* You have access to your {microshift-short} node.
* You have a web application that exposes a port and a TCP endpoint listening for traffic on the port.

.Procedure

. Create a service called `hello-microshift` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose pod hello-microshift -n $namespace
----

. Create an unsecured route to the `hello-microshift` application by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose svc/hello-microshift --hostname=microshift.com $namespace
----

.Verification

* Verify that the `route` resource was created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get routes -o yaml <name of resource> -n $namespace
----
* `namespace`: Specifies the route that is named `hello-microshift` and the namespace is named `hello-microshift`.
+
.Sample YAML definition for the created unsecured route
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: hello-microshift
  namespace: hello-microshift
spec:
  host: microshift.com
  port:
    targetPort: 8080
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: hello-microshift
----
+
where:
+
`spec.host`:: Specifies the hostname.
`port.targetPort`:: Specifies the target port for the router to map the endpoint port in the service.
+
[NOTE]
====
{microshift-short} does not use an API that creates a default ingress domain, but instead provides a wildcard for automatically generated domains. Each route can also define a separate hostname.
