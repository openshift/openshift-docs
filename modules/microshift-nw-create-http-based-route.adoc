= Creating an HTTP-based route

A route allows you to host your application at a public URL. It can either be secure or unsecured, depending on the network security configuration of your application. An HTTP-based route is an unsecured route that uses the basic HTTP routing protocol and exposes a service on an unsecured application port.

The following procedure describes how to create a simple HTTP-based route to a web application, using the `hello-microshift` application as an example.

.Prerequisites
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to your {microshift-short} cluster.
* You have a web application that exposes a port and a TCP endpoint listening for traffic on the port.

.Procedure

. Create a service called `hello-microshift` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose pod hello-microshift -n $namespace
----

. Create an unsecured route to the `hello-microshift` application by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose svc/hello-microshift --hostname=microshift.com $namespace
----

.Verification

* Verify that the `route` resource was created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get routes -o yaml <name of resource> -n $namespace <1>
----
<1> In this example, the route is named `hello-microshift` and the namespace is named `hello-microshift`.

.Sample YAML definition of the created unsecured route:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: hello-microshift
  namespace: hello-microshift
spec:
  host: microshift.com <1>
  port:
    targetPort: 8080 <2>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: hello-microshift
----
<1> Example hostname.
<2> `targetPort` is required for the router to map the endpoint port in the service.
+
[NOTE]
====
{microshift-short} does not a use an API that creates a default ingress domain, but instead provides a wildcard for automatically generated domains. Each route can also define a separate hostname.
