[id="fixed-issues-1-6_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

The following list highlights fixed issues in {builds-shortname} 1.6.

Fixed duplicate installation of {pipelines-shortname} Operator::
Before this update, the {builds-operator} automatically installed the {pipelines-operator}. However, if an older version of the {pipelines-shortname} Operator was already present, it caused a conflict because the {builds-shortname} Operator attempted to install another instance of the {pipelines-shortname} Operator. With this update, the {builds-shortname} Operator no longer installs the {pipelines-shortname} Operator automatically. You must now install the {pipelines-shortname} Operator before installing the {builds-shortname} Operator.

Fixed file ownership permission changes during source code upload::
Before this update, while uploading the source code file using the command-line interface(CLI) from the local machine, the file ownership permissions were changed. This caused builds to fail. With this update, the file ownership permissions remain unchanged while uploading the source code, improving the build success rate.
