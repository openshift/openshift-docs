== Fixed issues

The following list highlights fixed issues in {builds-shortname} 1.6.

Fixed duplicate installation of {pipelines-shortname} Operator::
Before this update, the {builds-operator} automatically installed the {pipelines-operator}. However, if an older version of the {pipelines-shortname} Operator was already present, it caused a conflict because the {builds-shortname} Operator attempted to install another instance of the {pipelines-shortname} Operator. With this update, the {builds-shortname} Operator no longer installs the {pipelines-shortname} Operator automatically. You must now install the {pipelines-shortname} Operator before installing the {builds-shortname} Operator.
