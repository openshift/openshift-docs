= Advanced {op-system-first} installation configuration

A key reason for doing a bare metal installation of {op-system-first}
nodes for {product-title} is to be able to do configuration that is not
available through default {product-title} installation methods.
This section describes some of the configurations you can do using
techniques that include:

* Passing kernel arguments to the live installer
* Running the coreos-installer during a live installation
* Embedding Ignition configs in an ISO

The most useful advanced configuration topics for bare metal {op-system-first}
installations relate to disk partitioning, networking, and using Ignition configs in different ways.

[id="installation-user-infra-machines-advanced_network_{context}"]
== Networking
Networking for {product-title} nodes uses DHCP by default to gather all
necessary configuration settings. If you want to set up static IP addresses
or configure special settings, such as bonding, you can do that by either:

* Passing special kernel parameters when you boot the live installer,
* Using MachineConfigs to copy networking files to the installed system, or
* Configuring networking from a live installer shell prompt, then copying
those settings to the installed system so they take effect when the
installed system first boots.

For a PXE or iPXE installation, see the `Configure advanced networking` table for network-related kernel arguments to APPEND to the kernel or use MachineConfigs to copy networking files to the installed system.

For an ISO installation, do the following:

.Procedure

. Boot the ISO installer.
. From the live system shell prompt, configure networking for the live
system using available RHEL tools, such as `nmcli` or `nmtui`.
. Include the  `--copy-network option` with the options when you run the
`coreos-installer` command. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ coreos-installer install --copy-network \
     --ignition-url=http://host/worker.ign /dev/sda
----

. Once the installer is done, boot up to the system you installed to disk, which will include the new network settings.

[id="installation-user-infra-machines-advanced_disk_{context}"]
== Disk partitioning
In most cases, the {product-title} installer should be allowed to configure
your disk partitions. However, here are two cases where you might want to
intervene to override the default partitioning when installing an
{product-title} node:

* Creating separate partitions: For greenfield installations on an empty
disk, you may want to add separate storage to a partition. This is only
officially supported for making `/var` or a subdirectory of `/var` a separate
partition (not both). If you create more than one partition, Kubernetes
will not be able to monitor them both.

* Retaining existing partitions: For a brownfield installation, where you
are reinstalling on an existing {product-title} node, or a greenfield
installation where you just want to partition a disk manually before
starting the installation, there are both boot arguments and options to
`coreos-installer` that let you retain existing data partitions.

[id="installation-user-infra-machines-advanced_vardisk_{context}"]
=== Creating a separate `/var` partition
In general, disk partitioning for {product-title} should be left to the
installer. However, there are cases where you might want to create a
separate partition in a part of the filesystem that you expect to grow.

{product-title} supports the addition of a single partition to attach
storage to either the `/var` partition or a subdirectory of `/var`.
For example:

* `/var/lib/containers`: Holds container-related content that can grow
as more images and containers are added to a system.
* `/var`: Holds data that you might want to keep separate for purposes such as
auditing.

Storing the contents of a `/var` directory separately allows you to more easily
grow storage to those areas as needed, and to reinstall {product-title}
at a later date and keep that data intact. In other words, you would not have
to pull all your containers again or copy off massive log files when you
update your systems.

Because `/var` must be in place before a fresh installation of
{op-system-first}, this procedure sets up the separate `/var` partition
by creating a MachineConfig that is inserted during the `openshift-install`
preparation phases of an {product-title} installation.

.Procedure

. Create a directory to hold the {product-title} installation files:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir $HOME/clusterconfig
----

. Run `openshift-install` to create a set of files in the `manifest` and
`openshift` subdirectories. Answer questions as prompted:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir $HOME/clusterconfig
? SSH Public Key ...
$ ls $HOME/clusterconfig/openshift/
99_kubeadmin-password-secret.yaml
99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-0.yaml
99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-1.yaml
99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-2.yaml
...
----

. Create a MachineConfig and add it to a file in the `openshift` directory.
For example, name the file `98-var-partition.yaml`,
change the device name to the name of the storage device on the `worker` systems,
and set the storage size as appropriate. This attaches storage to a separate `/var`
directory.

+
[source,terminal]
----

            Before=local-fs.target
            [Mount]
            Where=/var
            What=/dev/disk/by-partlabel/var
            [Install]
            WantedBy=local-fs.target
----
+
<1> The storage device name of the disk that you want to partition.
<2> When adding a data partition to the boot disk, a minimum value of 25000 mebibytes is recommended. The root filesystem is automatically resized to fill all available space up to the specified offset. If no value is specified, or if the specified value is smaller than the recommended minimum, the resulting root filesystem will be too small, and future reinstalls of {op-system} might overwrite the beginning of the data partition.

. Run `openshift-install` again to create Ignition configs from a set of files in the `manifest` and
`openshift` subdirectories:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir $HOME/clusterconfig
$ ls $HOME/clusterconfig/
auth  bootstrap.ign  master.ign  metadata.json  worker.ign
----

Now you can use the Ignition config files as input to the ISO or PXE bare
metal installation procedures to install {op-system-first} systems.

[id="installation-user-infra-machines-advanced_retaindisk_{context}"]
=== Retaining existing partitions
For an ISO installation, you can add options to the `coreos-installer`
that causes the installer to maintain one or more existing partitions.
For a PXE installation, you can APPEND `coreos.inst` options to preserve partitions.

Saved partitions might be partitions from an existing {product-title}
system that has data partitions that you want to keep, or partitions
that you just manually created. Here are a few tips:

* Make sure you assign at least the recommended amount of disk space to the
OpenShift partitions at the beginning of the disk.

* Identify the disk partitions you want to keep either by partition
number or label.

For an ISO installation:

The following example illustrates running `coreos-installer` in a way that preserves
the sixth (6) partition on the disk:

[source,terminal]
----
# coreos-installer install --ignition-url http://10.0.2.2:8080/user.ign \
        --save-partindex 6 /dev/sda
----

This example preserves partitions 5 and higher:

[source,terminal]
----
# coreos-installer install --ignition-url http://10.0.2.2:8080/user.ign
        --save-partindex 5- /dev/sda
----

This example preserves any partition in which the partition label begins with `data` (`data*`):

[source,terminal]
----
# coreos-installer install --ignition-url http://10.0.2.2:8080/user.ign
        --save-partlabel ‘data*’ /dev/sda
----

In all of those examples, after the install completes, on the first boot of
the new system, Ignition will recreate the partition at the same place it
was before (the same offset), and the filesystem will be intact.

For a PXE installation:

This APPEND option preserves the sixth partition:

[source,terminal]
----
coreos.inst.save_part=6
----

This APPEND option preserves the all partitions from 5 and higher:

[source,terminal]
----
coreos.inst.save_part=5-
----

This APPEND option preserves any partition in which the partition label begins with `data` (`data*`):

[source,terminal]
----
coreos.inst.save_partindex=’data*’
----

[id="installation-user-infra-machines-advanced_ignition_{context}"]
== Identifying Ignition configs
There are different ways to manage Ignition config files when you do
bare metal installations. To begin with, there are two different types
of Ignition configs you can provide during {op-system-first} installation and two
different reasons for providing them:

* **Live install Ignition config**: This Ignition config should be rarely
used and is one you create manually from scratch. It is passed to the live
install medium and it is run immediately upon booting that live medium to do setup
tasks BEFORE the process that actually installs the {op-system-first} system to disk.
This should only be used for performing tasks that need to be done once and
not applied again later, such as some advanced partitioning that cannot be done using MachineConfigs. There are currently no officially supported procedures for using Ignition configs in this way.
+
For PXE or ISO boots, you can create the Ignition config
and APPEND the `ignition.config.url=` option to identify the location of
the Ignition config. You also need to append `ignition.firstboot ignition.platform.id=metal`
or the `ignition.config.url` option will be ignored.

* **Permanent install Ignition config**: Every bare metal {op-system-first} installation
needs to pass one of the Ignition config files generated by `openshift-installer`,
including `bootstrap.ign`, `master.ign` and `worker.ign`, to the carry out the
installation. It is not recommended to modify these files.
+
For PXE installs, you pass the Ignition configs on the APPEND line using the
`coreos.inst.ignition_url=` option. For ISO installs, after the ISO boots to
the shell prompt, you identify the Ignition config on the `coreos-installer`
command line with the `--ignition-url=` option.
+
Instead of passing the location of an Ignition config via a kernel or
command-line option, you can embed an Ignition config into the ISO
installer image. This allows you to do bare metal installs with the ISO,
without requiring access to an HTTP server. See “Embedding an Ignition
config in the {op-system-first} ISO” for details.

[id="installation-user-infra-machines-advanced_embedignition_{context}"]
=== Embedding an Ignition config in the {op-system-first} ISO
The following procedures describe how to embed an Ignition config into
the ISO so it is applied when the new installation first boots from disk.

To embed an Ignition config named `worker.ign` into an ISO image
(for example rhcos-<version>-live.x86_64.iso), copy the image to
a local directory, then run the coreos-installer container with
that directory mounted, as follows:

.Procedure

. Get the {op-system-first} ISO and Ignition config file and copy them into an accessible directory, such as `/mnt`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# cp rhcos-<version>-live.x86_64.iso bootstrap.ign /mnt/
# chmod 644 /mnt/rhcos-<version>-live.x86_64.iso
----

. Run the following command to run `coreos-installer` from a container to embed the
Ignition config into the ISO:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# podman run -it -v /mnt:/mnt:z quay.io/coreos/coreos-installer:release \
     iso ignition embed --force -i /mnt/bootstrap.ign /mnt/rhcos.test.iso
----

You can now use that ISO to install {op-system-first} with the included Ignition config
without needing to pull the Ignition config from an HTTP server.

To show the contents of the embedded Ignition config and direct it into a file, run:

[source,terminal]
----
# podman run -it -v /mnt:/mnt:z quay.io/coreos/coreos-installer:release \
    iso ignition show /mnt/rhcos.test.iso > mybootstrap.ign
# diff -s bootstrap.ign mybootstrap.ign
Files bootstrap.ign and mybootstrap.ign are identical
----

To remove the Ignition config and return the ISO to its pristine state (so
you can reuse it), run:

[source,terminal]
----
# podman run -it -v /mnt:/mnt:z quay.io/coreos/coreos-installer:release \
    iso ignition remove /mnt/rhcos.test.iso
----

You can now embed another Ignition config into the ISO or use the ISO in its
pristine state.
