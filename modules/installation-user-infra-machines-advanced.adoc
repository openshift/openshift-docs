= Advanced {op-system} installation configuration

A key benefit for manually provisioning the {op-system-first}
nodes for {product-title} is to be able to do configuration that is not
available through default {product-title} installation methods.
This section describes some of the configurations that you can do using
techniques that include:

* Passing kernel arguments to the live installer
* Running `coreos-installer` manually from the live system
* Embedding Ignition configs in an ISO

The advanced configuration topics for manual {op-system-first}
installations detailed in this section relate to disk partitioning, networking, and using Ignition configs in different ways.

[id="installation-user-infra-machines-advanced_network_{context}"]
== Using advanced networking options for PXE and ISO installations
Networking for {product-title} nodes uses DHCP by default to gather all
necessary configuration settings. To set up static IP addresses or configure special settings, such as bonding, you can do one of the following:

* Pass special kernel parameters when you boot the live installer.

* Use a machine config to copy networking files to the installed system.

* Configure networking from a live installer shell prompt, then copy those settings to the installed system so that they take effect when the installed system first boots.

To configure a PXE or iPXE installation, use one of the following options:

* See the "Advanced RHCOS installation reference" tables.
* Use a machine config to copy networking files to the installed system.

To configure an ISO installation, use the following procedure.

.Procedure

. Boot the ISO installer.
. From the live system shell prompt, configure networking for the live
system using available RHEL tools, such as `nmcli` or `nmtui`.
. Run the `coreos-installer` command to install the system, adding the `--copy-network` option to copy networking configuration. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ coreos-installer install --copy-network \
     --ignition-url=http://host/worker.ign /dev/sda
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `--copy-network` option only copies networking configuration found under `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`. In particular, it does not copy the system hostname.
====

. Reboot into the installed system.

[id="installation-user-infra-machines-advanced_disk_{context}"]
== Disk partitioning

// This content is not modularized, so any updates to this "Disk partitioning" section should be checked against the module created for vSphere UPI parity in the module file named `installation-disk-partitioning.adoc` for consistency until such time as this large assembly can be modularized.

The disk partitions are created on {product-title} cluster nodes during the {op-system-first} installation. Each {op-system} node of a particular architecture uses the same partition layout, unless the default partitioning configuration is overridden. During the {op-system} installation, the size of the root file system is increased to use the remaining available space on the target device.

There are two cases where you might want to override the default partitioning when installing {op-system} on an {product-title} cluster node:

* Creating separate partitions: For greenfield installations on an empty
disk, you might want to add separate storage to a partition. This is
officially supported for mounting `/var` or a subdirectory of `/var`, such as `/var/lib/etcd`, on a separate partition, but not both.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Kubernetes supports only two file system partitions. If you add more than one partition to the original configuration, Kubernetes cannot monitor all of them.
====

* Retaining existing partitions: For a brownfield installation where you are reinstalling {product-title} on an existing node and want to retain data partitions installed from your previous operating system, there are both boot arguments and options to `coreos-installer` that allow you to retain existing data partitions.

[WARNING]
====
The use of custom partitions could result in those partitions not being monitored by {product-title} or alerted on. If you are overriding the default partitioning, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4766521[Understanding OpenShift File System Monitoring (eviction conditions)] for more information about how {product-title} monitors your host file systems.

[id="installation-user-infra-machines-advanced_vardisk_{context}"]
=== Creating a separate `/var` partition
In general, you should use the default disk partitioning that is created during the {op-system} installation. However, there are cases where you might want to create a separate partition for a directory that you expect to grow.

{product-title} supports the addition of a single partition to attach
storage to either the `/var` directory or a subdirectory of `/var`.
For example:

* `/var/lib/containers`: Holds container-related content that can grow
as more images and containers are added to a system.
* `/var/lib/etcd`: Holds data that you might want to keep separate for purposes such as performance optimization of etcd storage.
* `/var`: Holds data that you might want to keep separate for purposes such as auditing.

Storing the contents of a `/var` directory separately makes it easier to grow storage for those areas as needed and reinstall {product-title} at a later date and keep that data intact. With this method, you will not have to pull all your containers again, nor will you have to copy massive log files when you update systems.

The use of a separate partition for the `/var` directory or a subdirectory of `/var` also prevents data growth in the partitioned directory from filling up the root file system.

The following procedure sets up a separate `/var` partition by adding a machine config manifest that is wrapped into the Ignition config file for a node type during the preparation phase of an installation.

.Procedure

. On your installation host, change to the directory that contains the {product-title} installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
----

. Create a Butane config that configures the additional partition. For example, name the file `$HOME/clusterconfig/98-var-partition.bu`, change the disk device name to the name of the storage device on the `worker` systems, and set the storage size as appropriate. This example places the `/var` directory on a separate partition:
+
[source,yaml]
----
variant: openshift
version: 4.9.0
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: 98-var-partition
storage:
  disks:
  - device: /dev/<device_name> <1>
    partitions:
    - label: var
      start_mib: <partition_start_offset> <2>
      size_mib: <partition_size> <3>
  filesystems:
    - device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/var
      path: /var
      format: xfs
      mount_options: [defaults, prjquota] <4>
      with_mount_unit: true
----
+
<1> The storage device name of the disk that you want to partition.
<2> When adding a data partition to the boot disk, a minimum offset value of 25000 mebibytes is recommended. The root file system is automatically resized to fill all available space up to the specified offset. If no offset value is specified, or if the specified value is smaller than the recommended minimum, the resulting root file system will be too small, and future reinstalls of {op-system} might overwrite the beginning of the data partition.
<3> The size of the data partition in mebibytes.
<4> The `prjquota` mount option must be enabled for filesystems used for container storage.
+
[NOTE]
====
When creating a separate `/var` partition, you cannot use different instance types for compute nodes, if the different instance types do not have the same device name.
====

. Create a manifest from the Butane config and save it to the `clusterconfig/openshift` directory. For example, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ butane $HOME/clusterconfig/98-var-partition.bu -o $HOME/clusterconfig/openshift/98-var-partition.yaml
----

. Create the Ignition config files:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir <installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the same installation directory.
+
Ignition config files are created for the bootstrap, control plane, and compute nodes in the installation directory:
+
----
.
├── auth
│   ├── kubeadmin-password
│   └── kubeconfig
├── bootstrap.ign
├── master.ign
├── metadata.json
└── worker.ign
----
+
The files in the `<installation_directory>/manifest` and `<installation_directory>/openshift` directories are wrapped into the Ignition config files, including the file that contains the `98-var-partition` custom `MachineConfig` object.

.Next steps

* You can apply the custom disk partitioning by referencing the Ignition config files during the {op-system} installations.

[id="installation-user-infra-machines-advanced_retaindisk_{context}"]
=== Retaining existing partitions

For an ISO installation, you can add options to the `coreos-installer` command
that cause the installer to maintain one or more existing partitions.
For a PXE installation, you can add `coreos.inst.*` options to the `APPEND` parameter to preserve partitions.

Saved partitions might be data partitions from an existing {product-title} system. You can identify the disk partitions you want to keep either by partition label or by number.

[NOTE]
====
If you save existing partitions, and those partitions do not leave enough space for {op-system}, the installation will fail without damaging the saved partitions.
====

.Retaining existing partitions during an ISO installation

This example preserves any partition in which the partition label begins with `data` (`data*`):

[source,terminal]
----
# coreos-installer install --ignition-url http://10.0.2.2:8080/user.ign \
        --save-partlabel 'data*' /dev/sda
----

The following example illustrates running the `coreos-installer` in a way that preserves
the sixth (6) partition on the disk:

[source,terminal]
----
# coreos-installer install --ignition-url http://10.0.2.2:8080/user.ign \
        --save-partindex 6 /dev/sda
----

This example preserves partitions 5 and higher:

[source,terminal]
----
# coreos-installer install --ignition-url http://10.0.2.2:8080/user.ign
        --save-partindex 5- /dev/sda
----

In the previous examples where partition saving is used, `coreos-installer` recreates the partition immediately.

.Retaining existing partitions during a PXE installation

This `APPEND` option preserves any partition in which the partition label begins with 'data' ('data*'):

[source,terminal]
----
coreos.inst.save_partlabel=data*
----

This `APPEND` option preserves partitions 5 and higher:

[source,terminal]
----
coreos.inst.save_partindex=5-
----

This `APPEND` option preserves partition 6:

[source,terminal]
----
coreos.inst.save_partindex=6
----

[id="installation-user-infra-machines-advanced_ignition_{context}"]
== Identifying Ignition configs
When doing an {op-system} manual installation, there are two types of Ignition configs that you can provide, with different reasons for providing each one:

* **Permanent install Ignition config**: Every manual {op-system} installation
needs to pass one of the Ignition config files generated by `openshift-installer`,
such as `bootstrap.ign`, `master.ign` and `worker.ign`, to carry out the
installation.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not recommended to modify these Ignition config files directly. You can update the manifest files that are wrapped into the Ignition config files, as outlined in examples in the preceding sections.
====
+
For PXE installations, you pass the Ignition configs on the `APPEND` line using the
`coreos.inst.ignition_url=` option. For ISO installations, after the ISO boots to
the shell prompt, you identify the Ignition config on the `coreos-installer`
command line with the `--ignition-url=` option. In both cases, only HTTP and HTTPS
protocols are supported.
+

* **Live install Ignition config**: This type must be created manually and should be avoided if possible, as it is not supported by Red Hat. With this method, the Ignition config passes to the live install medium, runs immediately upon booting, and performs setup tasks before and/or after the {op-system} system installs to disk. This method should only be used for performing tasks that must be done once and not applied again later, such as with advanced partitioning that cannot be done using a machine config.
+
For PXE or ISO boots, you can create the Ignition config
and `APPEND` the `ignition.config.url=` option to identify the location of
the Ignition config. You also need to append `ignition.firstboot ignition.platform.id=metal`
or the `ignition.config.url` option will be ignored.

[id="installation-user-infra-machines-advanced_embed_ignition_{context}"]
=== Embedding a live install Ignition config in the {op-system} ISO

You can embed a live install Ignition config directly in an {op-system} ISO image. When
the ISO image is booted, the embedded config will be applied automatically.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This type of configuration must be created manually and should be avoided if possible, as it is not supported by Red Hat.
====

.Procedure

. Download the `coreos-installer` binary from the following image mirror page: https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/coreos-installer/latest/.

. Retrieve the {op-system} ISO image and the Ignition config file, and copy them into an accessible directory, such as `/mnt`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# cp rhcos-<version>-live.x86_64.iso live.ign /mnt/
# chmod 644 /mnt/rhcos-<version>-live.x86_64.iso
----

. Run the following command to embed the Ignition config into the ISO:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# ./coreos-installer iso ignition embed -i /mnt/live.ign \
     /mnt/rhcos-<version>-live.x86_64.iso
----
+
You can now use that ISO to install {op-system} using the specified live install
Ignition config.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Using `coreos-installer iso ignition embed` to embed a file generated by `openshift-installer`, such as `bootstrap.ign`, `master.ign` and `worker.ign`, is unsupported and not recommended.
====
+
. To show the contents of the embedded Ignition config and direct it into a file, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# ./coreos-installer iso ignition show /mnt/rhcos-<version>-live.x86_64.iso > mylive.ign
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
# diff -s live.ign mylive.ign
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Files live.ign and mylive.ign are identical
----

. To remove the Ignition config and return the ISO to its pristine state so
you can reuse it, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# ./coreos-installer iso ignition remove /mnt/rhcos-<version>-live.x86_64.iso
----
+
You can now embed another Ignition config into the ISO or use the ISO in its
pristine state.
