= Configuring your ServiceMeshControlPlane resource for production

If you have installed a basic `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to test {ProductShortName}, you must configure it to production specification before you use {ProductName} in production.

You cannot change the `metadata.name` field of an existing `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. For production deployments, you must customize the default template. 

.Procedure

. Configure Jaeger for production. 
+
.. Edit the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to use the `production` deployment strategy, by setting `spec.addons.jaeger.install.storage.type` to `Elasticsearch` and specify additional configuration options under `install`. You can create and configure your Jaeger instance and set `spec.addons.jaeger.name` to the name of the Jaeger instance, for example,  `jaeger-production`.

.. Configure the sampling rate for production. For more information, see the Performance and scalability section.

. Ensure your security certificates are production ready by installing security certificates from an external certificate authority. For more information, see the Security section.

. Verify the results. Enter the following command to verify that the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource updated properly. In this example, `basic` is the name of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.
