= Ways to create an LVMCluster custom resource

You can create an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) or the {product-title} web console. If you have installed {lvms} by using {rh-rhacm-first}, you can also create an `LVMCluster` CR by using {rh-rhacm}. 

Upon creating the `LVMCluster` CR, {lvms} creates the following system-managed CRs:

* A `storageClass` and `volumeSnapshotClass` for each device class.
+
[NOTE]
====
{lvms} configures the name of the storage class and volume snapshot class in the format `lvms-<device_class_name>`, where, `<device_class_name>` is the value of the `deviceClasses.name` field in the `LVMCluster` CR. For example, if the `deviceClasses.name` field is set to vg1, the name of the storage class and volume snapshot class is `lvms-vg1`.
====

* `LVMVolumeGroup`: This CR is a specific type of persistent volume (PV) that is backed by an LVM volume group. It tracks the individual volume groups across multiple nodes.
* `LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus`: This CR tracks the status of the volume groups on a node.
