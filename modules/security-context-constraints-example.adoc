= Example security context constraints

The following examples show the security context constraints (SCC) format and
annotations:

.Annotated `priviledged` SCC

      features and the ability to run as any user, any group, any fsGroup, and with
      any SELinux context.  WARNING: this is the most relaxed SCC and should be used
      only for cluster administration. Grant with caution.'

----

<1> A list of capabilities that a pod can request. An empty list means
that none of capabilities can be requested while the special symbol `***`
allows any capabilities.
<2> A list of additional capabilities that are added to any pod.
<3> The `FSGroup` strategy, which dictates the allowable values for the
security context.
<4> The groups that can access this SCC.
<5> A list of capabilities to drop from a pod. Or, specify `ALL` 
<6> The `runAsUser` strategy type, which dictates the allowable values for the
Security Context.
//could use the available strategies
<7> The `seLinuxContext` strategy type, which dictates the allowable values for
the Security Context.
<8> The `supplementalGroups` strategy, which dictates the allowable supplemental
groups for the Security Context.
<9> The users who can access this SCC.

The `users` and `groups` fields on the SCC control which users can access the
SCC.
By default, cluster administrators, nodes, and the build controller are granted
access to the privileged SCC. All authenticated users are granted access to the
restricted SCC.

.Without explicit `runAsUser` setting
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-context-demo
spec:
  securityContext: <1>
  containers:
  - name: sec-ctx-demo
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
----
<1> When a container or pod does not request a user ID under which it should be run,
the effective UID depends on the SCC that emits this pod. Because restricted SCC
is granted to all authenticated users by default, it will be available to all
users and service accounts and used in most cases. The restricted SCC uses
`MustRunAsRange` strategy for constraining and defaulting the possible values of
the `securityContext.runAsUser` field. The admission plug-in will look for the
`openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range` annotation on the current project to populate
range fields, as it does not provide this range. In the end, a container will
have `runAsUser` equal to the first value of the range that is
hard to predict because every project has different ranges.


.With explicit `runAsUser` setting
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-context-demo
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000 <1>
  containers:
    - name: sec-ctx-demo
      image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
----
<1> A container or pod that requests a specific user ID will be accepted by
{product-title} only when a service account or a user is granted access to a SCC
that allows such a user ID. The SCC can allow arbitrary IDs, an ID that falls
into a range, or the exact user ID specific to the request.

This configuration is valid for SELinux, fsGroup, and Supplemental Groups.
