== Upgrading to {prodname} {operator-version}

You can upgrade from {prodname} {version}.x to {prodname} {operator-version} by using the OperatorHub in the OpenShift web console.


[id="auth-to-registry-redhat-io"]
=== Authenticating to registry.redhat.io for Wasm plug-in access

For RateLimitPolicy or AuthPolicy only, you must authenticate to `registry.redhat.io` to access the Wasm plug-in image used with {service-mesh} as the Gateway API provider.

.Prerequisites

* You have credentials to access `registry.redhat.io`. If you do not have access, see https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#creating-registry-service-accounts-6[Creating Registry Service Accounts].

.Procedure

. Create the following secret in your Gateway namespace, if it does not already exist:
+
[,bash]
----
oc create secret docker-registry wasm-plugin-pull-secret -n ${GATEWAY_NAMESPACE} \ --docker-server=registry.redhat.io \ --docker-username=your-registry-service-account-username \ --docker-password=your-registry-service-account-password
----

. Repeat this step in each Gateway namespace in which a RateLimitPolicy or AuthPolicy is deployed.


=== Upgrading to {prodname} {operator-version} in the web console

.Prerequisites
* You already have {prodname} {version}.x installed on OpenShift 4.16 or later.
* For RateLimitPolicy or AuthPolicy only, you have performed the steps in xref:auth-to-registry-redhat-io[].

.Procedure
. Click *Operators > Installed Operators* > *{companyname} {prodname}*.
. Ensure that *Update channel* is set to `stable`. 
. If *Update approval* is set to *Automatic*, the upgrade will be approved and installed immediately when the *Update channel* is set to `stable`.
. If *Update approval* is set to *Manual*, click *Install*.
. Wait until the {prodname} Operator is deployed.
. Verify that {prodname} {operator-version} is installed and that your deployment is up and running.

.After upgrade
* For RateLimitPolicy or AuthPolicy only, if you patched your subscription as a workaround for https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CONNLINK-299[CONNLINK-299], enter the following command to ensure that your environment is set correctly: 	
+
[,bash]
----
oc patch subscription rhcl-operator -n openshift-operators --type=merge --patch '{"spec": {"config": {"env": null}}}'
----

.Additional resources
* For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.html[Updating installed Operators].

|Issue|Description

| https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CONNLINK-414[CONNLINK-414] 
| {prodname} 1.0.1 cannot be installed on a newly created OpenShift cluster.

Previously, Authorino 1.2.1 made one of the {prodname} 1.0.1 dependencies unavailable, and the {prodname} 1.0.1 constraints were not met. This issue did not affect existing {prodname} 1.0.1 installations.  
Now, the {prodname} 1.0.2 dependencies are available and the constraints are met.

| https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CONNLINK-301[CONNLINK-301] 
| {prodname} is not available for Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift. 

Previously, {prodname} was not available for Azure Red Hat OpenShift due to the lack of support for OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 or 4.17 in Azure. Now, OpenShift 4.16 support is available in Azure and {prodname} support for Azure Red Hat OpenShift has been added.

| Support protected container registry when loading wasm-shim image.

Previously, for AuthPolicy and RateLimitPolicy, {prodname} did not support a protected container registry when the loading wasm-shim image. 
Now, {prodname} supports protected registries, and the steps to authenticate to `registry.redhat.io` are documented in {LinkRHCLInstall}[{NameRHCLInstall}].

| https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CONNLINK-309[CONNLINK-309]
| Certificates not managed by {prodname} are deleted.

Previously, certificates not managed by {prodname} were deleted, even when a TLSPolicy was not configured. 
Now, these certificates are no longer deleted. 

| https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CONNLINK-313[CONNLINK-313]
| Fix example commands for configuring DNS provider credentials.

Previously, {LinkRHCLInstall}[{NameRHCLInstall}] included incorrect example commands for configuring DNS provider credentials. 
Now, these examples have been fixed. 

| https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CONNLINK-325[CONNLINK-325]
| Duplication of configuring DNS provider secret.

Previously, {LinkRHCLInstall}[{NameRHCLInstall}] and {LinkRHCLDeploy}[{NameRHCLDeploy}] both described how to configure the DNS provider secret. 
Now, the documentation has been updated to avoid duplication. 

| https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CONNLINK-360[CONNLINK-360]
| Topology: ConfigMap location lookup using wrong URI.

Previously, in the OpenShift web console plug-in, the topology location lookup used the wrong URI.
Now, the OpenShift console plug-in uses the correct URI.
