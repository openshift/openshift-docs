= Logging architecture

The {logging} consists of these logical components:

* `Collector` - Reads container log data from each node and forwards log data to configured outputs.

* `Store` - Stores log data for analysis; the default output for the forwarder.

* `Visualization` - Graphical interface for searching, querying, and viewing stored logs.

These components are managed by Operators and Custom Resource (CR) YAML files.

The {logging-title} collects container logs and node logs. These are categorized into types:

* `application` - Container logs generated by user applications running in the cluster, except infrastructure container applications.

* `infrastructure` - Logs generated by infrastructure components running in the cluster and {product-title} nodes, such as journal logs. Infrastructure components are pods that run in the `openshift*`, `kube*`, or `default` projects.

* `audit` - Logs generated by auditd, the node audit system, which are stored in the */var/log/audit/audit.log* file, and logs from the `auditd`, `kube-apiserver`, `openshift-apiserver` projects, as well as the `ovn` project if enabled.

The logging collector is a daemonset that deploys pods to each {product-title} node. System and infrastructure logs are generated by journald log messages from the operating system, the container runtime, and {product-title}.

Container logs are generated by containers running in pods running on the cluster. Each container generates a separate log stream. The collector collects the logs from these sources and forwards them internally or externally as configured in the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource.
