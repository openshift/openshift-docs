= Logging architecture

The {logging} consists of these logical components:

* `Collector` - Reads container log data from each node and forwards log data to configured outputs.

* `Store` - Stores log data for analysis; the default output for the forwarder.

* `Visualization` - Graphical interface for searching, querying, and viewing stored logs.

These components are managed by Operators and Custom Resource (CR) YAML files.

The logging collector is a daemonset that deploys pods to each {product-title} node. System and infrastructure logs are generated by journald log messages from the operating system, the container runtime, and {product-title}.

Container logs are generated by containers running in pods running on the cluster. Each container generates a separate log stream. The collector collects the logs from these sources and forwards them internally or externally as configured in the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource.
