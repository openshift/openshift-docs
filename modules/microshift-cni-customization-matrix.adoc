1. If unset, the default value is set to the next immediate subnet after the service network. For example, when the service network is `10.43.0.0/16`, the `advertiseAddress` is set to `10.44.0.0/32`.
2. You can use the multicast DNS protocol (mDNS) to allow name resolution and service discovery within a Local Area Network (LAN) using multicast exposed on the `5353/UDP` port.
3. There is no built-in transparent proxying of egress traffic in {microshift-short}. Egress must be manually configured.
4. Setting up the firewalld service is supported by {op-system-ostree}.
5. IPv6 is not supported. IPv6 can only be used by connecting to other networks with the {microshift-short} Multus CNI plugin.
6. Configure by using the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file.
