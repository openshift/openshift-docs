Additional details about networking capabilities::

* `Advertise address`: If unset, the default value is set to the next immediate subnet after the service network. For example, when the service network is `10.43.0.0/16`, the `advertiseAddress` is set to `10.44.0.0/32`.

* `Multicast DNS`: You can use the multicast DNS protocol (mDNS) to allow name resolution and service discovery within a Local Area Network (LAN) using multicast exposed on the `5353/UDP` port.

* `Network proxies`: There is no built-in transparent proxying of egress traffic in {microshift-short}. Egress must be manually configured.

* `Firewall`: Setting up the firewalld service is supported by {op-system-ostree}.

* `IPv6`: Is supported in both single-stack and dual-stack networks with the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin. You can also use IPv6 by connecting to other networks with the {microshift-short} Multus CNI plugin.

* `Ingress router`: Configure by using the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file.
