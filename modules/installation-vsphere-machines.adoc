= Installing {op-system} and starting the {product-title} bootstrap process

To install {product-title} on user-provisioned infrastructure on VMware vSphere, you must install {op-system-first} on vSphere hosts. When you install {op-system}, you must provide the Ignition config file that was generated by the {product-title} installation program for the type of machine you are installing. If you have configured suitable networking, DNS, and load balancing infrastructure, the {product-title} bootstrap process begins automatically after the {op-system} machines have rebooted.

.Prerequisites

* You have obtained the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* You have access to an HTTP server that you can access from your computer and that the machines that you create can access.
* You have created a link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-B1018F28-3F14-4DFE-9B4B-F48BBDB72C10.html[vSphere cluster].

.Procedure

. Upload the bootstrap Ignition config file, which is named `<installation_directory>/bootstrap.ign`, that the installation program created to your HTTP server. Note the URL of this file.
+
. Save the following secondary Ignition config file for your bootstrap node to your computer as `<installation_directory>/merge-bootstrap.ign`:
+
[source,text]
----
{
  "ignition": {
    "config": {
      "merge": [
        {
          "source": "<bootstrap_ignition_config_url>", <1>
          "verification": {}
        }
      ]
    },
    "timeouts": {},
    "version": "3.2.0"
  },
  "networkd": {},
  "passwd": {},
  "storage": {},
  "systemd": {}
}
----
+
<1> Specify the URL of the bootstrap Ignition config file that you hosted.
+
When you create the virtual machine (VM) for the bootstrap machine, you use this Ignition config file.
+
. Locate the following Ignition config files that the installation program created:
+
* `<installation_directory>/master.ign`
* `<installation_directory>/worker.ign`
* `<installation_directory>/merge-bootstrap.ign`
+
. Convert the Ignition config files to Base64 encoding. Later in this procedure, you must add these files to the extra configuration parameter `guestinfo.ignition.config.data` in your VM.
+
For example, if you use a Linux operating system, you can use the `base64` command to encode the files.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ base64 -w0 <installation_directory>/master.ign > <installation_directory>/master.64
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ base64 -w0 <installation_directory>/worker.ign > <installation_directory>/worker.64
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ base64 -w0 <installation_directory>/merge-bootstrap.ign > <installation_directory>/merge-bootstrap.64
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you plan to add more compute machines to your cluster after you finish installation, do not delete these files.

. Obtain the {op-system} OVA image. Images are available from the link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.14/[{op-system} image mirror] page.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The {op-system} images might not change with every release of {product-title}. You must download an image with the highest version that is less than or equal to the {product-title} version that you install. Use the image version that matches your {product-title} version if it is available.
====
+
The filename contains the {product-title} version number in the format `rhcos-vmware.<architecture>.ova`.

. In the vSphere Client, create a folder in your datacenter to store your VMs.
.. Click the *VMs and Templates* view.
.. Right-click the name of your datacenter.
.. Click *New Folder* -> *New VM and Template Folder*.
.. In the window that is displayed, enter the folder name. If you did not specify an existing folder in the `install-config.yaml` file, then create a folder with the same name as the infrastructure ID. You use this folder name so vCenter dynamically provisions storage in the appropriate location for its Workspace configuration.

. In the vSphere Client, create a template for the OVA image and then clone the template as needed.
+
[NOTE]
====
In the following steps, you create a template and then clone the template for all of your cluster machines. You then provide the location for the Ignition config file for that cloned machine type when you provision the VMs.
====
.. From the *Hosts and Clusters* tab, right-click your cluster name and select *Deploy OVF Template*.
.. On the *Select an OVF* tab, specify the name of the {op-system} OVA file that you downloaded.
.. On the *Select a name and folder* tab, set a *Virtual machine name* for your template, such as `Template-{op-system}`. Click the name of your vSphere cluster and select the folder you created in the previous step.
.. On the *Select a compute resource* tab, click the name of your vSphere cluster.
.. On the *Select storage* tab, configure the storage options for your VM.
*** Select *Thin Provision* or *Thick Provision*, based on your storage preferences.
*** Select the datastore that you specified in your `install-config.yaml` file.
*** If you want to encrypt your virtual machines, select *Encrypt this virtual machine*. See the section titled "Requirements for encrypting virtual machines" for more information.
.. On the *Select network* tab, specify the network that you configured for the cluster, if available.
.. When creating the OVF template, do not specify values on the *Customize template* tab or configure the template any further.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not start the original VM template. The VM template must remain off and must be cloned for new {op-system} machines. Starting the VM template configures the VM template as a VM on the platform, which prevents it from being used as a template that compute machine sets can apply configurations to.
//This admonition note also appears in `modules/installation-vsphere-machines.adoc` and `modules/windows-machineset-vsphere.adoc`.
====

. Optional: Update the configured virtual hardware version in the VM template, if necessary. Follow link:https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1010675[Upgrading a virtual machine to the latest hardware version] in the VMware documentation for more information.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended that you update the hardware version of the VM template to version 15 before creating VMs from it, if necessary. Using hardware version 13 for your cluster nodes running on vSphere is now deprecated. If your imported template defaults to hardware version 13, you must ensure that your ESXi host is on 6.7U3 or later before upgrading the VM template to hardware version 15. If your vSphere version is less than 6.7U3, you can skip this upgrade step; however, a future version of {product-title} is scheduled to remove support for hardware version 13 and vSphere versions less than 6.7U3.
====

. After the template deploys, deploy a VM for a machine in the cluster.
.. Right-click the template name and click *Clone* -> *Clone to Virtual Machine*.

.. On the *Select a name and folder* tab, specify a name for the VM. You might include the machine type in the name, such as `control-plane-0` or `compute-1`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that all virtual machine names across a vSphere installation are unique.
====
.. On the *Select a name and folder* tab, select the name of the folder that you created for the cluster.

.. On the *Select a compute resource* tab, select the name of a host in your datacenter.
+
.. On the *Select clone options* tab, select *Customize this virtual machine's hardware*.

.. On the *Customize hardware* tab, click *Advanced Parameters*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The following configuration suggestions are for example purposes only. As a cluster administrator, you must configure resources according to the resource demands placed on your cluster. To best manage cluster resources, consider creating a resource pool from the cluster's root resource pool.
====
+
*** Optional: Override default DHCP networking in vSphere. To enable static IP networking:
+
**** Set your static IP configuration:
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ export IPCFG="ip=<ip>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname>:<iface>:none nameserver=srv1 [nameserver=srv2 [nameserver=srv3 [...]]]"
----
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ export IPCFG="ip=192.168.100.101::192.168.100.254:255.255.255.0:::none nameserver=8.8.8.8"
----
+
**** Set the `guestinfo.afterburn.initrd.network-kargs` property before you boot a VM from an OVA in vSphere:
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ govc vm.change -vm "<vm_name>" -e "guestinfo.afterburn.initrd.network-kargs=${IPCFG}"
----
+
*** Add the following configuration parameter names and values by specifying data in the *Attribute* and *Values* fields. Ensure that you select the *Add* button for each parameter that you create.
**** `guestinfo.ignition.config.data`: Locate the base-64 encoded files that you created previously in this procedure, and paste the contents of the base64-encoded Ignition config file for this machine type.
**** `guestinfo.ignition.config.data.encoding`: Specify `base64`.
**** `disk.EnableUUID`: Specify `TRUE`.
**** `stealclock.enable`: If this parameter was not defined, add it and specify `TRUE`.
**** Create a child resource pool from the cluster's root resource pool. Perform resource allocation in this child resource pool.

.. In the *Virtual Hardware* panel of the *Customize hardware* tab, modify the specified values as required. Ensure that the amount of RAM, CPU, and disk storage meets the minimum requirements for the
machine type.

.. Complete the remaining configuration steps. On clicking the *Finish* button, you have completed the cloning operation.
.. From the *Virtual Machines* tab, right-click on your VM and then select *Power* -> *Power On*.

.. Check the console output to verify that Ignition ran.
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
Ignition: ran on 2022/03/14 14:48:33 UTC (this boot)
Ignition: user-provided config was applied
----

.Next steps

* Create the rest of the machines for your cluster by following the preceding steps for each machine.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create the bootstrap and control plane machines at this time. Because some pods are deployed on compute machines by default, also create at least two compute machines before you install the cluster.
