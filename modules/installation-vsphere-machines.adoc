= Creating {op-system-first} machines in vSphere

Before you install a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure on
VMware vSphere, you must create {op-system} machines on vSphere hosts for it to
use.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* Have access to an HTTP server that you can access from your computer and that
the machines that you create can access.
* Create a link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-B1018F28-3F14-4DFE-9B4B-F48BBDB72C10.html[vSphere cluster].

.Procedure

. Upload the bootstrap Ignition config file, which is named
`<installation_directory>/bootstrap.ign`, that the installation program created
to your HTTP server. Note the URL of this file.
+
You must host the bootstrap Ignition config file because it is too large to
fit in a vApp property.

. Save the following secondary Ignition config file for your bootstrap node to
your computer as `<installation_directory>/append-bootstrap.ign`.
+
----
{
  "ignition": {
    "config": {
      "append": [
        {
          "source": "<bootstrap_ignition_config_url>", <1>
          "verification": {}
        }
      ]
    },
    "timeouts": {},
    "version": "2.1.0"
  },
  "networkd": {},
  "passwd": {},
  "storage": {},
  "systemd": {}
}
----
<1> Specify the URL of the bootstrap Ignition config file that you hosted.
+
When you create the Virtual Machine (VM) for the bootstrap machine, you use
this Ignition config file.

. Convert the master, worker, and secondary bootstrap Ignition config files to Base64
encoding.
+
For example, if you use a Linux operating system, you can use the `base64`
command to encode the files.
+
----
$ base64 -w0 <installation_directory>/master.ign > <installation_directory>/master.64
$ base64 -w0 <installation_directory>/worker.ign > <installation_directory>/worker.64
$ base64 -w0 <installation_directory>/append-bootstrap.ign > <installation_directory>/append-bootstrap.64
----

. Obtain the {op-system} OVA image from the
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[Product Downloads] page on the Red
Hat customer portal or the
link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.2/[{op-system} image mirror]
page.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The {op-system} images might not change with every release of {product-title}.
You must download an image with the highest version that is
less than or equal to the {product-title} version that you install. Use the image version
that matches your {product-title} version if it is available.
====
+
The file name contains the {product-title} version number in the format
`rhcos-<version>-<architecture>-vmware.ova`.

. In the vSphere Client, create a folder in your datacenter to store your VMs.
.. Click the *VMs and Templates* view.
.. Right-click the name of your datacenter.
.. Click *New Folder* -> *New VM and Template Folder*.
.. In the window that is displayed, enter the folder name. The folder name must
match the cluster name that you specified in the `install-config.yaml` file.

. In the vSphere Client, create a template for the OVA image.
+
[NOTE]
====
In the following steps, you use the same template for all of your cluster
machines and provide the location for the Ignition config file for that machine
type when you provision the VMs.
====
.. From the *Hosts and Clusters* tab, right-click your cluster's name and
click *Deploy OVF Template*.
.. On the *Select an OVF* tab, specify the name of the {op-system} OVA file
that you downloaded.
.. On the *Select a name and folder* tab, set a *Virtual machine name*, such
as {op-system}, click the name of your vSphere cluster, and select the folder you created in the previous step.
.. On the *Select a compute resource* tab, click the name of your vSphere
cluster.
.. On the *Select storage* tab, configure the storage options for your VM.
*** Select *Thin Provision*.
*** Select the datastore that you specified in your `install-config.yaml` file.
.. On the *Select network* tab, specify the network that you configured
for the cluster, if available.
.. If you plan to use the same template for all cluster machine types, do not
specify values on the *Customize template* tab.

. After the template deploys, deploy a VM for a machine in the cluster.
.. Right-click the template's name and click *Clone* -> *Clone to Virtual Machine*.
.. On the *Select a name and folder* tab, specify a name for the VM. You might
include the machine type in the name, such as `control-plane-0` or `compute-1`.
.. On the *Select a name and folder* tab, select the name of the folder that
you created for the cluster.
.. On the *Select a compute resource* tab, select the name of a host in your
datacenter.
.. Optional: On the *Select storage* tab, customize the storage options.
.. On the *Select clone options*, select
*Customize this virtual machine's hardware*.
.. On the *Customize hardware* tab, click *VM Options* -> *Advanced*.
*** Optional: In the event of cluster performance issues, from the *Latency Sensitivity* list, select *High*.
*** Click *Edit Configuration*, and on the *Configuration Parameters* window,
click *Add Configuration Params*. Define the following parameter names and values:
**** `guestinfo.ignition.config.data`: Paste the contents of the base64-encoded
Ignition config file for this machine type.
**** `guestinfo.ignition.config.data.encoding`: Specify `base64`.
**** `disk.EnableUUID`: Specify `TRUE`.
*** Alternatively, prior to powering on the virtual machine add via vApp properties:
**** Navigate to a virtual machine from the vCenter Server inventory.
**** On the *Configure* tab, expand *Settings* and select *vApp options.*
**** Scroll down and under *Properties* apply the configurations from above.
.. In the *Virtual Hardware* panel of the
*Customize hardware* tab, modify the specified values as required. Ensure that
the amount of RAM, CPU, and disk storage meets the minimum requirements for the
machine type.
.. Complete the configuration and power on the VM.

. Create the rest of the machines for your cluster by following the preceding
steps for each machine.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create the bootstrap and control plane machines at this time. Because
some pods are deployed on compute machines by default, also create at least two
compute machine before you install the cluster.
