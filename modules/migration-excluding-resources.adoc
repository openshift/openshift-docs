= Excluding resources from a migration plan

You can exclude resources, for example, ImageStreams, persistent volumes (PVs), or subscriptions, from a migration plan in order to reduce the load or to migrate images or PVs with a different tool.

.Procedure

. Edit the Migration Controller CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit migrationcontroller -n openshift-migration
----

. Update the `spec` section by adding a parameter to exclude specific resources or by adding a resource to the `excluded_resources` parameter if it does not have its own exclusion parameter:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: migration.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: MigrationController
metadata:
  name: migration-controller
  namespace: openshift-migration
spec:
  disable_image_migration: true <1>
  disable_pv_migration: true <2>
  ...
  excluded_resources: <3>
  - imagetags
  - templateinstances
  - clusterserviceversions
  - packagemanifests
  - subscriptions
  - servicebrokers
  - servicebindings
  - serviceclasses
  - serviceinstances
  - serviceplans
----
<1> Add `disable_image_migration: true` to exclude imagestreams from the migration. Do not edit the `excluded_resources` parameter. `imagestreams` is added to `excluded_resources` when the Migration Controller Pod restarts.
<2> Add `disable_pv_migration: true` to exclude PVs from the migration plan. Do not edit the `excluded_resources` parameter. `persistentvolumes` and `persistentvolumeclaims` are added to `excluded_resources` when the Migration Controller Pod restarts. Disabling PV migration also disables PV discovery when you create the migration plan.
<3> You can add {product-title} resources to the `excluded_resources` list. Do not delete any of the default excluded resources. These resources are known to be problematic for migration.

. Wait two minutes for the Migration Controller Pod to restart so that the changes are applied.

. Verify that the resource is excluded:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment -n openshift-migration migration-controller -o yaml | grep EXCLUDED_RESOURCES -A1
----
+
The output contains the excluded resources, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    - name: EXCLUDED_RESOURCES
      value:
      imagetags,templateinstances,clusterserviceversions,packagemanifests,subscriptions,servicebrokers,servicebindings,serviceclasses,serviceinstances,serviceplans,imagestreams,persistentvolumes,persistentvolumeclaims
