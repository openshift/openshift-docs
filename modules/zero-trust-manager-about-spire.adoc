A SPIRE server is responsible for managing and issuing SPIFFE identities within a trust domain. It stores registration entries (selectors that determine under what conditions a SPIFFE ID should be issued) and signing keys. The SPIRE server works in conjunction with the SPIRE agent to perform node attestion via node plugins. For more information, see link:https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about/spire-concepts/#all-about-the-server[About the SPIRE server].
