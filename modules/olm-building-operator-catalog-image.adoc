= Building a Package Manifest Format catalog image

Cluster administrators can build a custom Operator catalog image based on the
Package Manifest Format to be used by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). The
catalog image can be pushed to a container image registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]. For a
cluster on a restricted network, this registry can be a registry that the
cluster has network access to, such as a mirror registry created during a
restricted network cluster installation.

For this example, the procedure assumes use of a mirror registry that has access
to both your network and the Internet.

.Prerequisites

* Workstation with unrestricted network access
* `oc` version 4.3.5+
* `podman` version 1.4.4+
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]
* If you are working with private registries, set the `REG_CREDS` environment
variable to the file path of your registry credentials for use in later steps.
For example, for the `podman` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REG_CREDS=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json
----
* If you are working with private namespaces that your
link:https://quay.io[quay.io] account has access to, you must set a Quay
authentication token. Set the `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable for use with the
`--auth-token` flag by making a request against the login API using your
link:https://quay.io[quay.io] credentials:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ AUTH_TOKEN=$(curl -sH "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -XPOST https://quay.io/cnr/api/v1/users/login -d '
    {
        "user": {
            "username": "'"<quay_username>"'",
            "password": "'"<quay_password>"'"
        }
    }' | jq -r '.token')
----

.Procedure

. On the workstation with unrestricted network access, authenticate with the
target mirror registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login <registry_host_name>
----

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
. Authenticate with `registry.redhat.io` so that the base image can be pulled
during the build:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----
endif::[]

. Build a catalog image based on the `redhat-operators` catalog from Quay.io,
tagging and pushing it to your mirror registry:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm catalog build \
    --appregistry-org redhat-operators \//<1>
    --from={registry-image} \//<2>
    --filter-by-os="linux/amd64" \//<3>
    --to=<registry_host_name>:<port>/olm/redhat-operators:v1 \//<4>
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \//<5>
    [--insecure] \//<6>
    [--auth-token "${AUTH_TOKEN}"] <7>
----
<1> Organization (namespace) to pull from an App Registry instance.
<2> Set `--from` to the Operator Registry base image using the tag that
matches the target {product-title} cluster major and minor version.
<3> Set `--filter-by-os` to the operating system and architecture to use for the
base image, which must match the target {product-title} cluster. Valid values
are `linux/amd64`, `linux/ppc64le`, and `linux/s390x`.
<4> Name your catalog image and include a tag, for example, `v1`.
<5> Optional: If required, specify the location of your registry credentials file.
<6> Optional: If you do not want to configure trust for the target registry, add the
`--insecure` flag.
<7> Optional: If other application registry catalogs are used that are not public, specify a Quay authentication token.

These errors are usually non-fatal, and if the Operator package mentioned does
not contain an Operator you plan to install or a dependency of one, then they
can be ignored.
