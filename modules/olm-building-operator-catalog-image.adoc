= Building an Operator catalog image

Cluster administrators can build a custom Operator catalog image to be used by
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and push the image to a container image
registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]. For a
cluster on a restricted network, this registry can be a registry that the cluster
has network access to, such as the mirror registry created during the restricted
network installation or an on-premise Quay Enterprise registry.

[NOTE]
====
The cluster's internal registry cannot be used as the target registry because it
does not support pushing without a tag, which is required during the mirroring
process.
====

For this example, the procedure assumes use of the mirror registry created on
the bastion host during a restricted network cluster installation.

.Prerequisites


* A Linux workstation with unrestricted network access
ifeval::["{context}" == "olm-restricted-networks"]
footnoteref:[BZ1771329, The
`oc adm catalog` command is currently only supported on Linux.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1771329[*BZ#1771329*])]
endif::[]
* `oc` version 4.3+
* `podman` version 1.5.1+
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2], which
must be exposed with a certificate that is trusted by the workstation

.Procedure

. On the workstation with unrestricted network access, authenticate with the
target image registry:
+
----
$ podman login <registry_host_name>
----

. Build a catalog image based on the `redhat-operators` catalog from
link:https://quay.io/[quay.io], tagging and pushing it to your mirror registry:
+
----
$ oc adm catalog build \
    --appregistry-endpoint https://quay.io/cnr \
    --appregistry-org redhat-operators \ <1>
    --to=<registry_host_name>:<port>/<namespace>/redhat-operators:v1 <2>

These errors are usually non-fatal, and if the Operator package mentioned does
not contain an Operator you plan to install or a dependency of one, then they
can be ignored.
