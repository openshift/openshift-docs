= About creating alerting rules for user-defined projects

If you create alerting rules for a user-defined project, consider the following key behaviors and important limitations when you define the new rules:

* A user-defined alerting rule can include metrics exposed by its own project in addition to the default metrics from core platform monitoring. 
You cannot include metrics from another user-defined project.
+
For example, an alerting rule for the `ns1` user-defined project can use metrics exposed by the `ns1` project in addition to core platform metrics, such as CPU and memory metrics.
However, the rule cannot include metrics from a different `ns2` user-defined project.

* To reduce latency and to minimize the load on core platform monitoring components, you can add the `openshift.io/prometheus-rule-evaluation-scope: leaf-prometheus` label to a rule.
This label forces only the Prometheus instance deployed in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project to evaluate the alerting rule and prevents the Thanos Ruler instance from doing so.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If an alerting rule has this label, your alerting rule can use only those metrics exposed by your user-defined project.
Alerting rules you create based on default platform metrics might not trigger alerts.
