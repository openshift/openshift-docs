= Purpose of the Machine Config Operator

The Machine Config Operator (MCO) manages and applies configuration and updates of {op-system-first} and container runtime, including everything between the kernel and kubelet.
Managing {op-system} is important since most telecommunications companies run on bare-metal hardware and use some sort of hardware accelerator or kernel modification.
Applying machine configuration to {op-system} manually can cause problems because the MCO monitors each node and what is applied to it.

You must consider these minor components and how the MCO can help you manage your clusters effectively.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must use the MCO to perform all changes on worker or control plane nodes.
Do not manually make changes to {op-system} or node files.
