= Example: Network interface with a VRF instance node network configuration policy

[role="_abstract"]
You can associate a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance with a network interface by applying a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` custom resource (CR).

By associating a VRF instance with a network interface, you can support traffic isolation, independent routing decisions, and the logical separation of network resources.

[WARNING]
====
When configuring Virtual Route Forwarding (VRF), you must change the VRF value to a table ID lower than `1000` because a value higher than `1000` is reserved for {product-title}.
====

In a bare-metal environment, you can announce load balancer services through interfaces belonging to a VRF instance by using MetalLB. For more information, see the _Additional resources_ section.

The following YAML file is an example of associating a VRF instance to a network interface.
It includes samples values that you must replace with your own information.
