[id="rosa-faq-verify-SCP_{context}"]
== Verify your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account does not have an SCP

Run the following command to verify your AWS account has the correct permissions:

[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify permissions
----

If you receive any errors, double check to ensure than an link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_type-auth.html#orgs_manage_policies_scp[SCP] is not applied to your AWS account. If you are required to use an SCP, see link:https://www.openshift.com/dedicated/ccs#scp[Red Hat Requirements for Customer Cloud Subscriptions] for details on the minimum required SCP.

[id="rosa-faq-verify-aws-quota_{context}"]
== Verify your AWS account and quota

Run the following command to verify you have the available quota on your AWS account:

[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify quota
----

AWS quotas change based on region. Be sure you are verifying your quota for the correct AWS region. If you need to increase your quota, navigate to your link:https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS console], and request a quota increase for the service that failed.

[id="rosa-faq-deployment-failures_{context}"]
== Deployment failures

Failures in deployment are shown by putting the cluster state in “error”.

Run the following command to get more information:

[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe cluster -c <my_cluster_name> --debug
----
[id="rosa-faq-aws-notification-emails_{context}"]
== AWS notification emails

When creating a cluster, the {product-title} service creates small instances in all supported regions. This check ensures the AWS account being used can deploy to each supported region.

For AWS accounts that are not using all supported regions, AWS may send one or more emails confirming that "Your Request For Accessing AWS Resources Has Been Validated". Typically the sender of this email is aws-verification@amazon.com.

This is expected behavior as the {product-title} service is validating your AWS account configuration.
