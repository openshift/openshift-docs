= Configuring SR-IOV additional network

You can configure an additional network that uses SR-IOV hardware by creating a SriovNetwork Custom Resource (CR).
When you create a SriovNetwork CR, the SR-IOV Operator automatically creates a NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR.

[NOTE]
=====
Do not modify or delete a SriovNetwork Custom Resource (CR) if it is attached to any Pods in the `running` state.
=====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create the following SriovNetwork CR, and then save the YAML in the `<name>-sriov-network.yaml` file. Replace `<name>` with a name for this additional network.

//To get the notes nexted in the annotations following this code block
//I've removed the item from the procedure and started the next step of
//the procedure mid-list.

----
<1> Replace `<name>` with a name for the CR. The Operator will create a NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR with same name.
<2> Specify the namespace where the SR-IOV Operator is installed.
<3> Optional. Replace `<target_namespace>` with the namespace where the NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR will be created. The default value is `openshift-sriov-network-operator`.
<4> Optional. Replace `<ipam>` a configuration object for the ipam CNI plug-in as a YAML block scalar. The plug-in manages IP address assignment for the attachment definition.
<5> Optional. Replace `<vlan>` with a Virtual LAN (VLAN) ID for the additional network. The integer value must be from `0` to `4095`. The default value is `0`.
<6> Replace `<sriov_resource_name>` with the value for the `.spec.resourceName` parameter from the SriovNetworkNodePolicy CR that defines the SR-IOV hardware for this additional network.
<7> Optional. Replace `<link_state>` with the link state of Virtual Function (VF). Allowed value are `enable`, `disable` and `auto`.
<8> Optional. Replace `<max_tx_rate>` with a maximum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF.
<9> Optional. Replace `<min_tx_rate>` with a minimum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF. This value should always be less than or equal to Maximum transmission rate.
+
[NOTE]
====
Intel NICs do not support the `minTxRate` parameter. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1772847[BZ#1772847].
====
<10> Optional. Replace `<vlan_qos>` with an IEEE 802.1p priority level for the VF. The default value is `0`.
<11> Optional. Replace `<spoof_check>` with the spoof check mode of the VF. The allowed values are the strings `"on"` and `"off"`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must enclose the value you specify in quotes or the CR will be rejected by the SR-IOV Network Operator.
====
<12> Optional. Replace `<trust_vf>` with the trust mode of the VF. The allowed values are the strings `"on"` and `"off"`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must enclose the value you specify in quotes or the CR will be rejected by the SR-IOV Network Operator.
====
<13> Optional. Replace `<capabilities>` with the capabilities to configure for this network. You can specify `"{ "ips": true }"` to enable IP address support or `"{ "mac": true }"` to enable MAC address support.

[start=2]
. Create the CR by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc create -f <filename> <1>
----
<1>  Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you created in the previous step.

. Optional: Confirm that the NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR associated with the SriovNetwork CR that you created in the previous step exists by running the following command. Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace you specified in the SriovNetwork CR.
+
----
oc get net-attach-def -n <namespace>
