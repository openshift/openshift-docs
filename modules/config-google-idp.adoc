= Configuring a Google identity provider


Configure a Google identity provider to allow users to authenticate with their Google credentials.

Using Google as an identity provider allows any Google user to authenticate to your server.
You can limit authentication to members of a specific hosted domain with the
`hostedDomain` configuration attribute.
