If you operate your cluster behind a proxy, you must verify that the {builds-title} use the {ocp-product-title}'s cluster-wide proxy settings. This ensures that all the {builds-shortname} traffic, including cloning Git repositories for application source code and pulling container base images, is correctly routed through your existing, monitored corporate egress gateway.
