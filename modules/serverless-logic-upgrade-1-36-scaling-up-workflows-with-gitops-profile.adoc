= Scaling up workflows with the gitops profile

To continue operation, you must scale up workflows that you previously scaled down with the `gitops` profile.

.Procedure

. Modify the `my-workflow.yaml` custom resources (CR) and scale up each workflow to `1` as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  podTemplate:
    replicas: 1
  # ...
----

. Apply the updated CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f my-workflow.yaml -n <target_namespace>
----

. Optional: Scale the workflow back to `1` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch workflow <workflow_name> -n <target_namespace> --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"podTemplate": {"replicas": 1}}}'
