= Token lifecycle management

[role="_abstract"]
The Argo CD Operator manages the lifecycle of local user tokens. Depending on the configuration, tokens can be renewed automatically or rotated manually.

Automatic renewal::

You can configure the Operator to automatically renew tokens before they expire. This ensures that automation and integrations that depend on the token continue to work without interruption.

Manual token rotation::

If you need to replace a token immediately, you can manually rotate it by deleting the user secret, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
---
$ oc delete secret api-user-local-user -n argocd
---
+
The Argo CD Operator then generates a new token and updates the configuration.

Disable API keys::

You can disable API key generation for a local user to remove their access through tokens. Disabling API keys also cleans up the associated secrets and stops renewal timers. To disable API key generation, you can set `apikey` field to `false`.
