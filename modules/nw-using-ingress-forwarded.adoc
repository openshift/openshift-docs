= Using X-Forwarded headers

You configure the HAProxy Ingress Controller to specify a policy for how to handle HTTP headers including `Forwarded` and `X-Forwarded-For`. The Ingress Operator uses the `HTTPHeaders` field to configure the `ROUTER_SET_FORWARDED_HEADERS` environment variable of the Ingress Controller.

.Procedure

. Configure the `HTTPHeaders` field for the Ingress Controller.
.. Use the following command to edit the `IngressController` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit IngressController
----
+
.. Under `spec`, set the `HTTPHeaders` policy field to `Append`, `Replace`, `IfNone`, or `Never`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  httpHeaders:
    forwarded:
      policy: append

== Example use cases

*As a cluster administrator, you can:*

* Configure an external proxy that injects the `X-Forwarded-For` header into each request before forwarding it to an Ingress Controller.
+
To configure the Ingress Controller to pass the header through unmodified, you specify the `never` policy. The Ingress Controller then never sets the headers, and applications receive only the headers that the external proxy provides.


* Configure the Ingress Controller to pass the `X-Forwarded-For` header that your external proxy sets on external cluster requests through unmodified.
+
To configure the Ingress Controller to set the `X-Forwarded-For` header on internal cluster requests, which do not go through the external proxy, specify the `if-none` policy. If an HTTP request already has the header set through the external proxy, then the Ingress Controller preserves it. If the header is absent because the request did not come through the proxy, then the Ingress Controller adds the header.

*As an application developer, you can:*

* Configure an application-specific external proxy that injects the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
+
To configure an Ingress Controller to pass the header through unmodified for an application's Route, without affecting the policy for other Routes, add an annotation `haproxy.router.openshift.io/set-forwarded-headers: if-none` or `haproxy.router.openshift.io/set-forwarded-headers: never` on the Route for the application.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can set the `haproxy.router.openshift.io/set-forwarded-headers` annotation on a per route basis, independent from the globally set value for the Ingress Controller.
