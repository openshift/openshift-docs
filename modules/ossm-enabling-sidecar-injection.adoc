[id="ossm-enabling-sidecar-injection_{context}"]
= Enabling sidecar injection

To demonstrate different approaches for configuring sidecar injection, the following procedures use the Bookinfo application.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator, created an `{istio}` resource, and the Operator has deployed {istio}.
* You have created the `IstioCNI` resource, and the Operator has deployed the necessary `IstioCNI` pods.
* You have created the namespaces that are to be part of the mesh, and they are discoverable by the Istio control plane.
* Optional: You have deployed the workloads to be included in the mesh. In the following examples, the Bookinfo has been deployed to the `bookinfo` namespace, but sidecar injection (step 5) has not been configured.

[id="ossm-enabling-sidecar-injection-namespace-labels_{context}"]
== Enabling sidecar injection with namespace labels
In this example, all workloads within a namespace receive a sidecar proxy injection, making it the best approach when the majority of workloads in the namespace should be included in the mesh.

.Procedure

. Verify the revision name of the {istio} control plane using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get istiorevisions
----
+
You should see output similar to the following example:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      TYPE    READY   STATUS    IN USE   VERSION   AGE
default   Local   True    Healthy   False    v1.23.0   4m57s
----
+
Since the revision name is default, you can use the default injection labels without referencing the exact revision name.

. Verify that workloads already running in the desired namespace show `1/1` containers as `READY` by using the following command. This confirms that the pods are running without sidecars.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n bookinfo
----
+
You should see output similar to the following example:
+

reviews-v3-6f5b775685-mg5n6      1/1     Running   0          4m54s
----

. To apply the injection label to the `bookinfo` namespace, run the following command at the CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label namespace bookinfo istio-injection=enabled
namespace/bookinfo labeled
----

. To ensure sidecar injection is applied, redeploy the existing workloads in the `bookinfo` namespace. Use the following command to perform a rolling update of all workloads:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n bookinfo rollout restart deployments
----

.Verification

. Verify the rollout by checking that the new pods display `2/2` containers as `READY`, confirming successful sidecar injection by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n bookinfo
----
+
You should see output similar to the following example:
+

[id="ossm-enabling-sidecar-injection-exclude-workload-from-mesh_{context}"]
== Exclude a workload from the mesh

You can exclude specific workloads from sidecar injection within a namespace where injection is enabled for all workloads.

[NOTE]
====
This example is for demonstration purposes only. The bookinfo application requires all workloads to be part of the mesh for proper functionality.
====

.Procedure

. Open the application's `Deployment` resource in an editor. In this case, exclude the `ratings-v1` service.

. Modify the `spec.template.metadata.labels` section of your `Deployment` resource to include the label `sidecar.istio.io/inject: false` to disable sidecar injection.
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
name: ratings-v1
namespace: bookinfo
labels:
  app: ratings
  version: v1
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: 'false'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Adding the label to the top-level `labels` section of the `Deployment` does not affect sidecar injection.
====
+
Updating the deployment triggers a rollout, creating a new ReplicaSet with updated pod(s).

.Verification

. Verify that the updated pod(s) do not contain a sidecar container and show `1/1` containers as `Running` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n bookinfo
----
+
You should see output similar to the following example:

[id="ossm-enabling-sidecar-injection-pod-labels_{context}"]
== Enabling sidecar injection with pod labels

This approach allows you to include individual workloads for sidecar injection instead of applying it to all workloads within a namespace, making it ideal for scenarios where only a few workloads need to be part of a service mesh. This example also demonstrates the use of a revision label for sidecar injection, where the `{istio}` resource is created with the name `my-mesh`. A unique `{istio}` resource name is required when multiple {istio} control planes are present in the same cluster or during a revision-based control plane upgrade.

.Procedure

. Verify the revision name of the {istio} control plane by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get istiorevisions
----
+
You should see output similar to the following example:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      TYPE    READY   STATUS    IN USE   VERSION   AGE
my-mesh   Local   True    Healthy   False    v1.23.0   47s
----
+
Since the revision name is `my-mesh`, use the revision label `istio.io/rev=my-mesh` to enable sidecar injection.


. Verify that workloads already running show `1/1` containers as `READY`, indicating that the pods are running without sidecars by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n bookinfo
----
+
You should see output similar to the following example:
+
.Example output

reviews-v3-6f5b775685-mg5n6      1/1     Running   0          4m54s
----

. Open the application’s `Deployment` resource in an editor. In this case, update the `ratings-v1` service.

. Update the `spec.template.metadata.labels` section of your `Deployment` to include the appropriate pod injection or revision label. In this case, `istio.io/rev: my-mesh`:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
name: ratings-v1
namespace: bookinfo
labels:
  app: ratings
  version: v1
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        istio.io/rev: my-mesh
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Adding the label to the `Deployment`'s top-level `labels` section does not impact sidecar injection.
====
+
Updating the deployment triggers a rollout, creating a new ReplicaSet with the updated pod(s).

.Verification

. Verify that only the ratings-v1 pod now shows `2/2` containers `READY`, indicating that the sidecar has been successfully injected by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n bookinfo
----
+
You should see output similar to the following example:
+

reviews-v3-84b55b667c-x5t8s       1/1     Running   0          42m
----

. Repeat for other workloads that you wish to include in the mesh.
