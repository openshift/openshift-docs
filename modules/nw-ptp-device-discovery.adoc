= Automated discovery of PTP network devices

The PTP Operator adds the `NodePtpDevice.ptp.openshift.io` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to {product-title}. 
The PTP Operator will search your cluster for PTP capable network devices on each node. The Operator creates and updates a `NodePtpDevice` Custom Resource (CR) for each node that provides a compatible PTP device.

One CR is created for each node, and shares the same name as the node.
The `.status.devices` list provides information about the PTP devices on a node.

The following is an example of a NodePtpDevice CR created by the PTP Operator:

<1> The value for the `name` parameter is the same as the name of the node.
<2> The CR is created in `openshift-ptp` namespace by PTP Operator.
<3> The `devices` collection includes a list of all of the PTP capable devices discovered by the Operator on the node.
