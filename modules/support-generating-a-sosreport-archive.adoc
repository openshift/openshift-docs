= Generating a sosreport archive for an {product-title} cluster node

The recommended way to generate a `sosreport` for an {product-title} {product-version} cluster node is through a debug pod.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have SSH access to your hosts.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have a Red Hat standard or premium Subscription.
* You have a Red Hat Customer Portal account.
* You have an existing Red Hat Support case ID.

.Procedure

. Obtain a list of cluster nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----

. Enter into a debug session on the target node. This step instantiates a debug pod called `<node_name>-debug`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/my-cluster-node
----
+
To enter into a debug session on the target node that is tainted with the `NoExecute` effect, add a toleration to a dummy namespace, and start the debug pod in the dummy namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project dummy
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch namespace dummy --type=merge -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": { "scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultTolerations": "[{\"operator\": \"Exists\"}]"}}}'
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/my-cluster-node
----
+
. Set `/host` as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host's root file system in `/host` within the pod. By changing the root directory to `/host`, you can run binaries contained in the host's executable paths:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# chroot /host
----
+
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} {product-version} cluster nodes running {op-system-first} are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Accessing cluster nodes using SSH is not recommended and nodes will be tainted as _accessed_. However, if the {product-title} API is not available, or the kubelet is not properly functioning on the target node, `oc` operations will be impacted. In such situations, it is possible to access nodes using `ssh core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` instead.
====

. Start a `toolbox` container, which includes the required binaries and plug-ins to run `sosreport`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# toolbox
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If an existing `toolbox` pod is already running, the `toolbox` command outputs `'toolbox-' already exists. Trying to start...`. Remove the running toolbox container with `podman rm toolbox-` and spawn a new toolbox container, to avoid issues with `sosreport` plug-ins.
====
+
. Collect a `sosreport` archive.
.. Run the `sosreport` command and enable the `crio.all` and `crio.logs` CRI-O container engine `sosreport` plug-ins:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# sosreport -k crio.all=on -k crio.logs=on <1>
----
<1> `-k` enables you to define `sosreport` plug-in parameters outside of the defaults.
+
.. Press *Enter* when prompted, to continue.
+
.. Provide the Red Hat Support case ID. `sosreport` adds the ID to the archive's file name.
+
.. The `sosreport` output provides the archive's location and checksum. The following sample output references support case ID `01234567`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
Your sosreport has been generated and saved in:
  /host/var/tmp/sosreport-my-cluster-node-01234567-2020-05-28-eyjknxt.tar.xz <1>

The checksum is: 382ffc167510fd71b4f12a4f40b97a4e
----
<1> The `sosreport` archive's file path is outside of the `chroot` environment because the toolbox container mounts the host's root directory at `/host`.

. Provide the `sosreport` archive to Red Hat Support for analysis, using one of the following methods.
+
* Upload the file to an existing Red Hat support case directly from an {product-title} cluster.
.. From within the toolbox container, run `redhat-support-tool` to attach the archive directly to an existing Red Hat support case. This example uses support case ID `01234567`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# redhat-support-tool addattachment -c 01234567 /host/var/tmp/my-sosreport.tar.xz <1>
----
<1> The toolbox container mounts the host's root directory at `/host`. Reference the absolute path from the toolbox container's root directory, including `/host/`, when specifying files to upload through the `redhat-support-tool` command.
+
* Upload the file to an existing Red Hat support case.
.. Concatenate the `sosreport` archive by running the `oc debug node/<node_name>` command and redirect the output to a file. This command assumes you have exited the previous `oc debug` session:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/my-cluster-node -- bash -c 'cat /host/var/tmp/sosreport-my-cluster-node-01234567-2020-05-28-eyjknxt.tar.xz' > /tmp/sosreport-my-cluster-node-01234567-2020-05-28-eyjknxt.tar.xz <1>
----
<1> The debug container mounts the host's root directory at `/host`. Reference the absolute path from the debug container's root directory, including `/host`, when specifying target files for concatenation.
+
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} {product-version} cluster nodes running {op-system-first} are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Transferring a `sosreport` archive from a cluster node by using `scp` is not recommended and nodes will be tainted as _accessed_. However, if the {product-title} API is not available, or the kubelet is not properly functioning on the target node, `oc` operations will be impacted. In such situations, it is possible to copy a `sosreport` archive from a node by running `scp core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>:<file_path> <local_path>`.
====
+
.. Navigate to an existing support case within link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/[https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/].
+
.. Select *Attach files* and follow the prompts to upload the file.
