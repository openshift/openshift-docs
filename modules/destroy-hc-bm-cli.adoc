= Destroying a hosted cluster on bare metal by using the CLI

If you created a hosted cluster by using the command-line interface (CLI), you can destroy that hosted cluster and its back-end resources by running a command.

.Procedure

* Delete the hosted cluster and its back-end resources by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f <hosted_cluster_config>.yaml <1>
----
+
<1> Specify the name of the configuration YAML file that was rendered when you created the hosted cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you created the hosted cluster without specifying the `--render` and `--render-sensitive` flags in its configuration file, you must remove its back-end resources manually.
