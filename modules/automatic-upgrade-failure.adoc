= Automatic upgrade failure for manifest-installed secured clusters

Sometimes, {product-title-short} automatic upgrades might fail to install.
When an upgrade fails, the status message for the secured cluster changes to `Upgrade failed. Retry upgrade`.
To view more information about the failure and understand why the upgrade failed, you can check the secured cluster row in the *Clusters* view. For more information, see "Troubleshooting the cluster upgrader".

Some common reasons for the failure are:

* The sensor-upgrader deployment might not have run because of a missing or a non-schedulable image.
* The pre-flight checks may have failed, either because of insufficient RBAC permissions or because the cluster state is not recognizable.
This can happen if you have edited {product-title} service configurations or the `auto-upgrade.stackrox.io/component` label is missing.
* There might be errors in executing the upgrade. If this happens, the upgrade installer automatically attempts to roll back the upgrade.

[NOTE]
====
Sometimes, the rollback can also fail. For these cases, view the cluster logs to identify the issue or contact support. For more information, see "Troubleshooting the cluster upgrader".

After you identify and fix the root cause for the upgrade failure, you can use the *Retry Upgrade* option to upgrade your secured cluster.
