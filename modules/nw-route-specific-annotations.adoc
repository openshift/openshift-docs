= Route-specific annotations

The Ingress Controller can set the default options for all the routes it exposes. An individual route can override some of these defaults by providing specific configurations in its annotations.


//For all the variables outlined in this section, you can set annotations on the
//*route definition* for the route to alter its configuration.

|Variable | Description | Environment variable used as default
|`haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance`| Sets the load-balancing algorithm. Available options are `source`, `roundrobin`, and `leastconn`. | `ROUTER_TCP_BALANCE_SCHEME` for passthrough routes. Otherwise, use `ROUTER_LOAD_BALANCE_ALGORITHM`.
|`haproxy.router.openshift.io/disable_cookies`| Disables the use of cookies to track related connections. If set to `true` or `TRUE`, the balance algorithm is used to choose which back-end serves connections for each incoming HTTP request. |
|`router.openshift.io/cookie_name`| Specifies an optional cookie to use for
this route. The name must consist of any combination of upper and lower case letters, digits, "_",
and "-". The default is the hashed internal key name for the route. |
|`haproxy.router.openshift.io/pod-concurrent-connections`| Sets the maximum number of connections that are allowed to a backing pod from a router.  Note: if there are multiple pods, each can have this many connections.  But if you have multiple routers, there is no coordination among them, each may connect this many times. If not set, or set to 0, there is no limit. |
|`haproxy.router.openshift.io/rate-limit-connections`| Setting `true` or `TRUE` to enables rate limiting functionality. |
|`haproxy.router.openshift.io/rate-limit-connections.concurrent-tcp`| Limits the number of concurrent TCP connections shared by an IP address. |
|`haproxy.router.openshift.io/rate-limit-connections.rate-http`| Limits the rate at which an IP address can make HTTP requests. |
|`haproxy.router.openshift.io/rate-limit-connections.rate-tcp`| Limits the rate at which an IP address can make TCP connections. |
|`haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout` | Sets a server-side timeout for the route. (TimeUnits) | `ROUTER_DEFAULT_SERVER_TIMEOUT`
|`router.openshift.io/haproxy.health.check.interval`| Sets the interval for the back-end health checks. (TimeUnits) | `ROUTER_BACKEND_CHECK_INTERVAL`
|`haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist` | Sets a whitelist for the route. |
|`haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header` | Sets a Strict-Transport-Security header for the edge terminated or re-encrypt route. |

.A route setting custom timeout
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout: 5500ms <1>
...
----
<1> Specifies the new timeout with HAProxy supported units (`us`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`). If the unit is not provided, `ms` is the default.

[NOTE]
====
Setting a server-side timeout value for passthrough routes too low can cause
WebSocket connections to timeout frequently on that route.
