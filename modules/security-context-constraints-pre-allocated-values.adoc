= About pre-allocated security context constraints values 

The admission controller is aware of certain conditions in the Security Context
Constraints (SCCs) that trigger it to look up pre-allocated values from a namespace and
populate the SCC before processing the pod. Each SCC
strategy is evaluated independently of other strategies, with the pre-allocated
values, where allowed, for each policy aggregated with pod specification values
to make the final values for the various IDs defined in the running pod.

The following SCCs cause the admission controller to look for pre-allocated
values when no ranges are defined in the pod specification:

. A `RunAsUser` strategy of `MustRunAsRange` with no minimum or maximum set.
Admission looks for the `openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range` annotation to populate
range fields.
. An `SELinuxContext` strategy of `MustRunAs` with no level set. Admission
looks for the `openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs` annotation to populate the level.
. A `FSGroup` strategy of `MustRunAs`. Admission looks for the
`openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups` annotation.
. A `SupplementalGroups` strategy of `MustRunAs`. Admission looks for the
`openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups` annotation.

During the generation phase, the security context provider uses default values
for any parameter values that are not specifically set in the pod. Default values
are based on the selected strategy:

. `RunAsAny` and `MustRunAsNonRoot` strategies do not provide default
values. If the pod needs a parameter value, such as a group ID, you
must define the value in the pod specification.
. `MustRunAs` (single value) strategies provide a default value that is
always used. For example, for group IDs, even if the pod specification defines
its own ID value, the namespace's default parameter value also appears in the pod's
groups.
. `MustRunAsRange` and `MustRunAs` (range-based) strategies provide the
minimum value of the range. As with a single value `MustRunAs` strategy, the
namespace's default parameter value appears in the running pod. If a range-based
strategy is configurable with multiple ranges, it provides the minimum value
of the first configured range.

[NOTE]
====
`FSGroup` and `SupplementalGroups` strategies fall back to the
`openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range` annotation if the
`openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups` annotation does not exist on the
namespace. If neither exists, the SCC is not created.
====

[NOTE]
====
By default, the annotation-based `FSGroup` strategy configures itself with a
single range based on the minimum value for the annotation. For example, if your
annotation reads `1/3`, the `FSGroup` strategy configures itself with a
minimum and maximum value of `1`. If you want to allow more groups to be accepted for
the `FSGroup` field, you can configure a custom SCC that does not use the
annotation.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups` annotation accepts a comma-delimited
list of blocks in the format of `<start>/<length` or `<start>-<end>`.
The `openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range` annotation accepts only a single block.
