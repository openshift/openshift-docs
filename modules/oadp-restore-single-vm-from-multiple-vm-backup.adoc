= Restoring a single VM from a backup of multiple VMs

[role="_abstract"]
If you have a backup containing multiple virtual machines (VMs), and you want to restore only one VM, you can use the `LabelSelectors` section in the `Restore` CR to select the VM to restore. To ensure that the persistent volume claim (PVC) attached to the VM is correctly restored, and the restored VM is not stuck in a `Provisioning` status, use both the `app: <vm_name>` and the `kubevirt.io/created-by` labels. To match the `kubevirt.io/created-by` label, use the UID of `DataVolume` of the VM.


.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* You have labeled the VMs that need to be backed up.
* You have a backup of multiple VMs.

.Procedure

. Before you take a backup of many VMs, ensure that the VMs are labeled by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc label vm <vm_name> app=<vm_name> -n openshift-adp 
----

. Configure the label selectors in the `Restore` CR as shown in the following example:
+
.Example `Restore` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: singlevmrestore
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupName: multiplevmbackup
  restorePVs: true
  LabelSelectors:
    - matchLabels:
        kubevirt.io/created-by: <datavolume_uid>
    - matchLabels:
        app: <vm_name>
----
+
where:
+
`datavolume_uid`:: Specifies the UID of `DataVolume` of the VM that you want to restore. For example, `b6...53a-ddd7-4d9d-9407-a0c...e5`.
`vm_name`:: Specifies the name of the VM that you want to restore. For example, `test-vm`.

. To restore a VM, run the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <restore_cr_file_name>
----
+
where:
+
`restore_cr_file_name`:: Specifies the name of the `Restore` CR file.
