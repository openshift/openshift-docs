= Monitoring ephemeral storage

You can use `/bin/df` as a tool to monitor ephemeral storage usage on the volume where ephemeral container data is located, which is `/var/lib/kubelet` and `/var/lib/containers`. The available space for only `/var/lib/kubelet` is shown when you use the `df` command if `/var/lib/containers` is placed on a separate disk by the cluster administrator.

To show the human-readable values of used and available space in `/var/lib`, enter the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ df -h /var/lib
----

The output shows the ephemeral storage usage in `/var/lib`:
