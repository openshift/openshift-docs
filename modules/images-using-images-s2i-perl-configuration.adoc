[id="images-using-images-s2i-perl-configuration_{context}"]
= Configuring source-to-image for Perl

The Perl image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to control the configuration and behavior of the Perl runtime.

To set these environment variables as part of your image, you can place them into
a `.s2i/environment` file inside your source code repository, or define them in
the environment section of the build configuration's `sourceStrategy` definition.

You can also set environment variables to be used with an existing image when creating new applications, or by updating environment variables for existing objects such as deployment configurations.

[NOTE]
====
Environment variables that control build behavior must be set as part of the source-to-image (S2I) build configuration or in the `.s2i/environment` file to make them available to the build steps.
