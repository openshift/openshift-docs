= Differences between multi-network policy and network policy

[role="_abstract"]
Although the `MultiNetworkPolicy` API implements the `NetworkPolicy` API, ensure that you understand the following key differences between the two policies:

* You must use the `MultiNetworkPolicy` API, as demonstrated in the following example configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiNetworkPolicy
# ...
----

* You must use the `multi-networkpolicy` resource name when using the CLI to interact with multi-network policies. For example, you can view a multi-network policy object with the `oc get multi-networkpolicy <name>` command where `<name>` is the name of a multi-network policy.

* You can use the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/policy-for` annotation on a `MultiNetworkPolicy` object to point to a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) custom resource (CR). The NAD CR defines the network to which the policy applies. The following example multi-network policy includes the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/policy-for` annotation:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/policy-for:<namespace_name>/<network_name>
# ...
----
+
where:
+
`<namespace_name>`:: Specifies the namespace name.
`<network_name>`:: Specifies the name of a network attachment definition.
