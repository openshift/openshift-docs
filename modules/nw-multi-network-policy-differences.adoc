= Differences between multi-network policy and network policy

Although the `MultiNetworkPolicy` API implements the `NetworkPolicy` API, there are several important differences:

* You must use the `MultiNetworkPolicy` API:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiNetworkPolicy
----

* You must use the `multi-networkpolicy` resource name when using the CLI to interact with multi-network policies. For example, you can view a multi-network policy object with the `oc get multi-networkpolicy <name>` command where `<name>` is the name of a multi-network policy.

* You must specify an annotation with the name of the network attachment definition that defines the macvlan or SR-IOV additional network:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/policy-for: <network_name>
----
+
--
where:

`<network_name>`:: Specifies the name of a network attachment definition.
