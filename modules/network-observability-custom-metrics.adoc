= Custom metrics
You can create custom metrics out of the flowlogs data using the `FlowMetrics` API. In every flowlogs data that is collected, there are a number of fields labeled per log, such as source name and destination name. These fields can be leveraged as Prometheus labels to enable the customization of cluster information on your dashboard.
