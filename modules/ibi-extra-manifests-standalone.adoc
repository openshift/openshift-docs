= Configuring resources for extra manifests

You can optionally define additional resources in an image-based deployment for {sno} clusters. 

Create the additional resources in an `extra-manifests` folder in the same working directory that has the `install-config.yaml` and `image-based-config.yaml` manifests.

== Creating a resource in the extra-manifests folder

You can create a resource in the `extra-manifests` folder of your working directory to add extra manifests to the image-based deployment for {sno} clusters. 

The following example adds an single-root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) network to the deployment.

.Prerequisites

* You created a working directory with the `install-config.yaml` and `image-based-config.yaml` manifests

.Procedure

. Go to your working directory and create the `extra-manifests` folder by running the follow command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir extra-manifests
----

. Create the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` and `SriovNetwork` resources in the `extra-manifests` folder:

.. Create a YAML file that defines the resources:
+
.Example `sriov-extra-manifest.yaml` file
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: "example-sriov-node-policy"
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  deviceType: vfio-pci

apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetwork

  name: "example-sriov-network"

  ipam: |-
    {
    }
  linkState: auto
  networkNamespace: sriov-namespace
  resourceName: example-sriov-node-policy
  spoofChk: "on"
  trust: "off"
----

.Verification

* When you create the configuration ISO, you can view the reference to the extra manifests in the `.openshift_install_state.json` file in your working directory:
+
[source,json]
----
 "*configimage.ExtraManifests": {
        "FileList": [
            {
                "Filename": "extra-manifests/sriov-extra-manifest.yaml",
                "Data": "YXBFDFFD..."
            }
        ]
    }
