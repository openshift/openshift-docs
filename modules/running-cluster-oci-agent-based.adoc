= Running a cluster on OCI

To run a cluster on {oci-first}, you must upload the generated Agent ISO image to the default Object Storage bucket on {oci}. Additionally, you must create a compute instance from the supplied base image, so that your {product-title} and {oci} can communicate with each other for the purposes of running the cluster on {oci}.

.Prerequisites

* You generated an Agent ISO image. See the "Creating configuration files for installing a cluster on OCI" section.

.Procedure

. Upload the Agent ISO image to Oracle’s default Object Storage bucket and then import the Agent ISO image as a custom image to this bucket. You must then configure the custom image to boot in Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) mode. See link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/secure-desktops/create-custom-image.htm[Creating a custom image] and link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/configuringimagecapabilities.htm#ariaid-title5[Using the Console] in Oracle’s documentation.
+
For example, from **Compute > Custom images**, import the Agent ISO image to the bucket, and enter values in the following fields:
+
* Name: *oci-cluster*
* Bucket: Select the bucket where you uploaded the discovery ISO image
* Object name: Select the name of the discovery ISO
* Image type: *QCOW2*
+
After the image imports, go to the **Edit image capabilities** setting and ensure  that `UEFI_64` is selected for the **Firmware** field. 

. Create a compute instance from the supplied base image for your preferred cluster topology, such as a single-node OpenShift (SNO) cluster, a highly-availability cluster that contains a minimum of 3 control plane instances and two compute instances, or a compact three-node cluster that contains a minimum of three control plane instances. See link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#top[Creating an instance] (Oracle documentation).
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you create the compute instance, check that you have enough memory and disk resources for your cluster. See xref:../../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.html#recommended-resources-for-topologies[Recommended resources for topologies].  Additionally, ensure that at least one compute instance has the same IP address as the address stated under `rendezvousIP` in the `agent-config.yaml` file.
====
+
The following example lists important settings for an instance named *oci-cluster-master*. 
+
* Go to **Image and shape section >  Image >  My images** and then select your custom image.  
* Go to  **Image and shape section > Shape menu** and then select at least 4 CPUs and 16 GB of memory.
* From the **Boot volume** section, select the **Specify a custom boot volume size** checkbox. Enter a value that is at least `100` GB for the boot volume size. Allocate the number of VPUs for your organization needs, such as a value in the range of `20` to `30` VPUs.
