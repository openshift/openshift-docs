= Running a cluster on OCI

To run a cluster on {oci-first}, you must upload the generated agent ISO image to the default Object Storage bucket on {oci}. Additionally, you must create a compute instance from the supplied base image, so that your {product-title} and {oci} can communicate with each other for the purposes of running the cluster on {oci}.

.Prerequisites

* You generated an agent ISO image. See the "Creating configuration files for installing a cluster on OCI" section.

.Procedure

. Upload the agent ISO image to Oracle’s default Object Storage bucket and then import the agent ISO image as a custom image to this bucket. You must then configure the custom image to boot in Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) mode. See link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/secure-desktops/create-custom-image.htm[Creating a custom image] and link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/configuringimagecapabilities.htm#ariaid-title5[Using the Console] in Oracle’s documentation.
+
For example, from *Compute* -> *Custom images*, import the agent ISO image to the bucket, and enter values in the following fields:
+
* Name: *oci-cluster*
* Bucket: Select the bucket that contains the agent ISO image
* Object name: Select the name of the agent ISO
* Image type: *QCOW2*

. After the image imports, go to the *Edit image capabilities* setting and ensure that only `UEFI_64` is selected for the *Firmware* field.

. For instructions on creating a compute instance from the supplied base image for your cluster topology, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/launchinginstance.htm#top[Creating an instance] in the Oracle documentation. The following {product-title} cluster topologies are supported on {oci}:
* Installing an {product-title} cluster on a single node.
* A highly-availabile cluster that has a minimum of three control plane instances and two compute instances.
* A compact three-node cluster that has a minimum of three control plane instances.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you create the compute instance, check that you have enough memory and disk resources for your cluster. Additionally, ensure that at least one compute instance has the same IP address as the address stated under `rendezvousIP` in the `agent-config.yaml` file.
====
+
The following example lists important settings for an instance named *oci-cluster-master*.
+
* Go to *Image and shape section* ->  *Image* ->  *My images* and then select your custom image.
* Go to  *Image and shape section* -> *Shape menu* and then select at least 4 CPUs and 16 GB of memory.
* From the *Boot volume* section, select the *Specify a custom boot volume size* checkbox. Enter a value that is at least `100` GB for the boot volume size. Assign the number of volume performance units (VPUs) for your organization needs, such as a value in the range of 20 to 30 VPUs.
