= Deploying user-defined firmware to cluster hosts with {ztp}

You can deploy user-defined firmware settings to cluster hosts by configuring the `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) to include a hardware profile that you want to apply during cluster host provisioning.
You can configure hardware profiles to apply to hosts in the following scenarios:

* All hosts site-wide
* Only cluster hosts that meet certain criteria
* Individual cluster hosts

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can configure host hardware profiles to be applied in a hierarchy.
Cluster-level settings override site-wide settings.
Node level profiles override cluster and site-wide settings.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have installed {rh-rhacm-first} and logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have provisioned a cluster that is managed by {rh-rhacm}.

* You created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the Argo CD application.

.Procedure

. Create the host firmware profile that contain the firmware settings you want to apply.
For example, create the following YAML file:
+
.host-firmware.profile
[source,yaml]
----
BootMode: Uefi
LogicalProc: Enabled
ProcVirtualization: Enabled
----

. Save the hardware profile YAML file relative to the `kustomization.yaml` file that you use to define how to provision the cluster, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
example-ztp/install
    └── site-install
          ├── siteconfig-example.yaml
          ├── kustomization.yaml
          └── host-firmware.profile
----

. Edit the `SiteConfig` CR to include the firmware profile that you want to apply in the cluster.
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1
kind: SiteConfig
metadata:
  name: "site-plan-cluster"
  namespace: "example-cluster-namespace"
spec:
  baseDomain: "example.com"
  # ...
  biosConfigRef:
    filePath: "./host-firmware.profile" <1>
----
<1> Applies the hardware profile to all cluster hosts site-wide

+
[NOTE]
====
Where possible, use a single `SiteConfig` CR per cluster.
====

. Optional. To apply a hardware profile to hosts in a specific cluster, update `clusters.biosConfigRef.filePath` with the hardware profile that you want to apply.
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
clusters:
  - clusterName: "cluster-1"
    # ...
    biosConfigRef:
      filePath: "./host-firmware.profile" <1>
----
<1> Applies to all hosts in the `cluster-1` cluster

. Optional. To apply a hardware profile to a specific host in the cluster, update `clusters.nodes.biosConfigRef.filePath` with the hardware profile that you want to apply.
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
clusters:
  - clusterName: "cluster-1"
    # ...
    nodes:
      - hostName: "compute-1.example.com"
        # ...
        bootMode: "UEFI"
        biosConfigRef:
          filePath: "./host-firmware.profile" <1>
----
<1> Applies the firmware profile to the `compute-1.example.com` host in the cluster

. Commit the `SiteConfig` CR and associated `kustomization.yaml` changes in your Git repository and push the changes.
+
The ArgoCD pipeline detects the changes and begins the managed cluster deployment.
+
[NOTE]
====
Cluster deployment proceeds even if an invalid firmware setting is detected.
To apply a correction using {ztp}, re-deploy the cluster with the corrected hardware profile.
====

.Verification

* Check that the firmware settings have been applied in the managed cluster host.
For example, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get hfs -n <managed_cluster_namespace> <managed_cluster_name> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Valid")].status}'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
True
