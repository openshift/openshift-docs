= Granting view permissions

[role="_abstract"]
Configure the necessary permissions for the application to access the required cluster resources.

{product-title} automatically creates several service accounts in every project. The `default` service account takes responsibility for running the pods. {product-title} uses and injects this service account into every pod that launches.

By default, the `default` service account has limited permissions to interact with the OpenShift API.

As a requirement of the application, you must assign the `view` role to the `default` service account to allow it to communicate with the OpenShift API to learn about pods, services, and resources within the project.
