= About the OpenShift Logging dashboard

The *OpenShift Logging* dashboard contains charts that show details about your Elasticsearch instance at a cluster-level for further diagnostics.

The dashboard also indicates the Elasticsearch instance status:

* 0 - green
* 1 - yellow
* 2 - red

The cluster health status is: green, yellow or red:  

* A red status indicates that the specific shard is not allocated in the cluster.
* A yellow status indicates that the primary shard is allocated but replicas are not.
* A green status indicates that all shards are allocated.

|Metric|Description

|Elastic Nodes
|The total number of Elasticsearch nodes in the Elasticsearch instance.

|Elastic Shards
|The total number of Elasticsearch shards in the Elasticsearch instance.

|Elastic Documents
|The total number of Elasticsearch documents in the cluster.

|Total Index Size on Disk
|The total disk space that is being used by the Elasticsearch indices.

|Elastic Pending Tasks
|The total number of any cluster-level changes that have not been executed, such as creating an index, updating an index mapping, allocating shards, or failing shards.

|Elastic JVM GC time
|The amount of time that the JVM spent executing Elasticsearch garbage collection operations in the cluster.

|Elastic JVM GC Rate
|The total number of times that JVM executed garbage activities per second.

|Elastic Query/Fetch Latency Sum
a|* Query latency: The average time each query takes to execute.
* Fetch latency: The average time each query spends fetching data. Fetch latency should take less time than the query latency phase. If this metric is consistently increasing, it could be an indication of slow disks, enriching of documents, or large requests with too many results.

|Elastic Query Rate
|The total queries executed against the Elasticsearch instance per second for each Elasticsearch node.

|CPU
|The total amount of CPU used by Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana. 

|Elastic JVM Heap Used
|The amount of JVM memory used. In a healthy cluster, you should see a pattern in the graph that shows regular drops as memory is freed by JVM garbage collection.

|Elasticsearch Disk Usage
|The total disk space used by the Elasticsearch instance for each Elasticsearch node.

|File Descriptors In Use
|The total number of file descriptors used by Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana.

|FluentD emit count
|The total number of Fluentd messages per second for `default` and `retry_default` emit counts.

|FluentD Buffer Availability
|The percent of the Fluentd buffer that is available for chunks. If the buffer is full, it could indicate that Fluentd is not capable of handling the amount of logs being sent read.

|Elastic rx bytes
|The total number of bytes that Elasticsearch has received, from FluentD, peer Elasticsearch nodes, and other sources.

|Elastic Index Failure Rate
|The total number of times per second that an Elasticsearch index fails. A high rate could indicate an issue with indexing.

|FluentD Output Error Rate
|The total number of times per second that FluentD is not able to output logs.
