= About the OpenShift Logging dashboard

The *OpenShift Logging* dashboard contains charts that show details about your Elasticsearch instance at a cluster-level that you can use to diagnose and anticipate problems.

|Metric|Description

|Elastic Cluster Status
a|The current Elasticsearch status:

* ONLINE - Indicates that the Elasticsearch instance is online.
* OFFLINE - Indicates that the Elasticsearch instance is offline.

|Elastic Nodes
|The total number of Elasticsearch nodes in the Elasticsearch instance.

|Elastic Shards
|The total number of Elasticsearch shards in the Elasticsearch instance.

|Elastic Documents
|The total number of Elasticsearch documents in the Elasticsearch instance.

|Total Index Size on Disk
|The total disk space that is being used for the Elasticsearch indices.

|Elastic Pending Tasks
|The total number of Elasticsearch changes that have not been completed, such as index creation, index mapping, shard allocation, or shard failure.

|Elastic JVM GC time
|The amount of time that the JVM spent executing Elasticsearch garbage collection operations in the cluster.

|Elastic JVM GC Rate
|The total number of times that JVM executed garbage activities per second.

|Elastic Query/Fetch Latency Sum
a|* Query latency: The average time each Elasticsearch search query takes to execute.
* Fetch latency: The average time each Elasticsearch search query spends fetching data.

Fetch latency typically takes less time than query latency. If fetch latency is consistently increasing, it might indicate slow disks, data enrichment, or large requests with too many results.

|Elastic Query Rate
|The total queries executed against the Elasticsearch instance per second for each Elasticsearch node.

|CPU
|The amount of CPU used by Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana, shown for each component.

|Elastic JVM Heap Used
|The amount of JVM memory used. In a healthy cluster, the graph shows regular drops as memory is freed by JVM garbage collection.

|Elasticsearch Disk Usage
|The total disk space used by the Elasticsearch instance for each Elasticsearch node.

|File Descriptors In Use
|The total number of file descriptors used by Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana.

|FluentD emit count
|The total number of Fluentd messages per second for the Fluentd default output, and the retry count for the default output.

|FluentD Buffer Usage
|The percent of the Fluentd buffer that is being used for chunks. A full buffer might indicate that Fluentd is not able to process the number of logs received.

|Elastic rx bytes
|The total number of bytes that Elasticsearch has received from FluentD, the Elasticsearch nodes, and other sources.

|Elastic Index Failure Rate
|The total number of times per second that an Elasticsearch index fails. A high rate might indicate an issue with indexing.

|FluentD Output Error Rate
|The total number of times per second that FluentD is not able to output logs.
