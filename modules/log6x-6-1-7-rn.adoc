== Bug fixes

* Before this update, merging data from the `message` field into the root of a Syslog log event caused the log event to be inconsistent with the ViaQ data model. The inconsistency could lead to overwritten system information, data duplication, or event corruption. This update revises Syslog parsing and merging for the Syslog output to align with other output types, resolving this inconsistency. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7184[LOG-7184])


* Before this update, log forwarding failed if you configured a cluster-wide proxy with a URL containing a username with an encoded "@" symbol; for example "user%40name". This update resolves the issue by adding correct support for URL-encoded values in proxy configurations. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7187[LOG-7187])
