[id="virt-configuring-vm-disk-sharing{context}"]
= Configuring disk sharing by using virtual machine disks

You can configure block volumes so that multiple virtual machines (VMs) can share storage.

The application running on the guest operating system determines the storage option you must configure for the VM. A disk of type `disk` exposes the volume as an ordinary disk to the VM.

You can set an error policy for each disk. The error policy controls how the hypervisor behaves when an input/output error occurs while a disk is being written to or read. The default behavior stops the VM and generates a Kubernetes event.

You can accept the default behavior, or you can set the error policy to one of the following options:

* `report`, which reports the error in the guest.
* `ignore`, which ignores the error. The Read or Write failure is undetected.
* `enospace`, which produces an error indicating that there is not enough disk space.

.Prerequisites

* The volume access mode must be `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) if the VMs that are sharing disks are running on different nodes.
+
If the VMs that are sharing disks are running on the same node, `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO) volume access mode is sufficient.

* The storage provider must support the required Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver.

.Procedure

. Create the `VirtualMachine` manifest for your VM to set the required values, as shown in the following example:
