= Installing the Cluster Logging and Elasticsearch Operators

You can use the {product-title} console to install cluster logging by deploying instances of
the Cluster Logging and Elasticsearch Operators.  The Cluster Logging Operator
creates and manages the components of the logging stack.  The Elasticsearch Operator
creates and manages the Elasticsearch cluster used by cluster logging.

[NOTE]
====
The {product-title} cluster logging solution requires that you install both the
Cluster Logging Operator and Elasticsearch Operator. When you deploy an instance
of the Cluster Logging Operator, it also deploys an instance of the Elasticsearch
Operator.
====

Your OpenShift Dedicated cluster includes 600 GiB of persistent storage that is
exclusively available for deploying Elasticsearch for cluster logging.

Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. Each Elasticsearch node needs
8G of memory for both memory requests and limits. Each Elasticsearch node can
operate with a lower memory setting, though this is not recommended for
production deployments.

.Procedure

. Install the Elasticsearch Operator from the OperatorHub:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose *Elasticsearch* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.

.. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page, under *A specific namespace on the cluster* select *openshift-logging*.
Then, click *Subscribe*.

. Install the Cluster Logging Operator from the OperatorHub:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose  *Cluster Logging* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.

.. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page, under *A specific namespace on the cluster* select *openshift-logging*.
Then, click *Subscribe*.

. Verify the operator installations:

.. Switch to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *Cluster Logging* and *Elasticsearch* Operators are listed in the
*openshift-logging* project with a *Status* of *InstallSucceeded*.
+
[NOTE]
====
During installation an operator might display a *Failed* status. If the operator then installs with an *InstallSucceeded* message,
you can safely ignore the *Failed* message.
====
+
If either operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:
+
* Switch to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page and inspect
the *Status* column for any errors or failures.
* Switch to the *Workloads* → *Pods* page and check the logs in each Pod in the
`openshift-logging` project that is reporting issues.

. Create and deploy a cluster logging instance:

.. Switch to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

.. Click the installed *Cluster Logging* Operator.

.. Under the *Overview* tab, click *Create Instance* . Paste the following YAML
definition into the window that displays.

.. Click *Create* to deploy the logging instance, which creates the Cluster
Logging and Elasticsearch Custom Resources.

. Verify that the Pods for the Cluster Logging instance deployed:

.. Switch to the *Workloads* → *Pods* page.

.. Select the *openshift-logging* project.

You should see several pods for cluster logging, Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana similar to the following list:
+
* cluster-logging-operator-cb795f8dc-xkckc
* elasticsearch-cdm-b3nqzchd-1-5c6797-67kfz
* elasticsearch-cdm-b3nqzchd-2-6657f4-wtprv

* fluentd-br7r2
* fluentd-fn2sb
* fluentd-pb2f8
* fluentd-zqgqx
* kibana-7fb4fd4cc9-bvt4p

. Access the Cluster Logging interface, *Kibana*, from the *Monitoring* →
*Logging* page of the {product-title} web console.
