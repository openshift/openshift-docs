= Installing OpenShift Logging and OpenShift Elasticsearch Operators

You can use the {product-title} console to install OpenShift Logging by deploying instances of
the OpenShift Logging and OpenShift Elasticsearch Operators. The Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator
creates and manages the components of the logging stack. The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator
creates and manages the Elasticsearch cluster used by OpenShift Logging.

[NOTE]
====
The OpenShift Logging solution requires that you install both the
Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator and OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. When you deploy an instance
of the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator, it also deploys an instance of the OpenShift Elasticsearch
Operator.
====

Your OpenShift Dedicated cluster includes 600 GiB of persistent storage that is
exclusively available for deploying Elasticsearch for OpenShift Logging.

Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. Each Elasticsearch node needs
16Gi of memory for both memory requests and limits. Each Elasticsearch node can
operate with a lower memory setting, though this is not recommended for
production deployments.

.Procedure

. Install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator from the OperatorHub:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose *OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.

.. On the *Install Operator* page, under *A specific namespace on the cluster* select *openshift-logging*.
Then, click *Install*.

. Install the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator from the OperatorHub:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose  *Red Hat OpenShift Logging* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.

.. On the *Install Operator* page, under *A specific namespace on the cluster* select *openshift-logging*.
Then, click *Install*.

. Verify the operator installations:

.. Switch to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *Red Hat OpenShift Logging* and *OpenShift Elasticsearch* Operators are listed in the
*openshift-logging* project with a *Status* of *InstallSucceeded*.
+
[NOTE]
====
During installation an operator might display a *Failed* status. If the operator then installs with an *InstallSucceeded* message,
you can safely ignore the *Failed* message.
====
+
If either operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:
+
* Switch to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page and inspect
the *Status* column for any errors or failures.
* Switch to the *Workloads* → *Pods* page and check the logs in each pod in the
`openshift-logging` project that is reporting issues.

. Create and deploy an OpenShift Logging instance:

.. Switch to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

.. Click the installed *Red Hat OpenShift Logging* Operator.

.. Under the *Details* tab, in the *Provided APIs* section, in the
*Cluster Logging* box, click *Create Instance* . Select *YAML View* and paste the following YAML definition into the window
that displays.

.. Click *Create* to deploy the logging instance, which creates the Cluster
Logging and Elasticsearch custom resources.

. Verify that the pods for the OpenShift Logging instance deployed:

.. Switch to the *Workloads* → *Pods* page.

.. Select the *openshift-logging* project.
+
You should see several pods for OpenShift Logging, Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana similar to the following list:
+
* cluster-logging-operator-cb795f8dc-xkckc
* elasticsearch-cdm-b3nqzchd-1-5c6797-67kfz
* elasticsearch-cdm-b3nqzchd-2-6657f4-wtprv

* fluentd-br7r2
* fluentd-fn2sb
* fluentd-pb2f8
* fluentd-zqgqx
* kibana-7fb4fd4cc9-bvt4p

. Access the OpenShift Logging interface, *Kibana*, from the *Observe* →
*Logging* page of the {product-title} web console.
