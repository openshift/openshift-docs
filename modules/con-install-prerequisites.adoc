Before you install {prodname}, you must ensure that you have access to the required platforms in your environment with the correct user permissions.

[id="rhcl-required-platforms-components_{context}"]
== Required platforms and components

{rh} account::
You have a {rh} account with subscriptions for {prodname} and {ocp}.

{ocp}::
* {ocp} 4.17 or later is installed, or you have access to a supported {ocp} cloud service. See https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/installation_overview/index[OpenShift Container Platform installation documentation].
* You are logged into an {ocp} cluster with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have the `kubectl` or `oc` command installed.
//add openshift cli first attribute

[IMPORTANT]
====
On {ocp} 4.19 or later, the Gateway API CRDs are provided, and you are no longer required to separately install {service-mesh} as your Gateway API provider.

However, you must create a `GatewayClass` named `openshift-default` and specify a `controllerName` of `openshift.io/gateway-controller/v1`. For more details, see the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/latest/html/ingress_and_load_balancing/configuring-ingress-cluster-traffic#ingress-gateway-api[OpenShift documentation on using Gateway API].
====

{service-mesh}::

On {ocp} 4.18 or earlier, ensure the following:

* You have {rh} {service-mesh} {service-mesh-version} separately installed as your Gateway API provider and have created an Istio deployment. See the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_mesh/latest/html/installing/ossm-installing-service-mesh[OpenShift Service Mesh installation documentation].
* You have enabled the Gateway API CRDs in {service-mesh} {service-mesh-version}. See the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_mesh/latest/html/installing/ossm-installing-service-mesh#ossm-accessing-bookinfo-application-using-gateway-api[OpenShift Service Mesh documentation on enabling Gateway API].

{cert-manager}::

* {cert-manager} {cert-manager-version} is installed to manage the TLS certificates for your gateways. See the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/security_and_compliance/cert-manager-operator-for-red-hat-openshift[cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift documentation].
+
NOTE: Before using a {prodname} TLSPolicy, you must set up a certificate issuer for your cloud provider platform. See the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html-single/security_and_compliance/index#cert-manager-operator-issuer-acme[OpenShift documentation on configuring an ACME issuer].

== Optional platforms and components

DNSPolicy::

For DNSPolicy, you have an account for one of the supported cloud DNS providers and have set up a hosted zone for {prodname}. For more details, see your cloud DNS provider documentation:
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/?icmpid=docs_homepage_networking[Amazon Route 53 documentation].
* https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs[Google Cloud DNS documentation].
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/[Microsoft Azure DNS documentation].

RateLimitPolicy::

For rate limiting policies, you have a shared accessible Redis-based datastore for rate limit counters in a multicluster environment. For details on how to install and configure a secure and highly available datastore, see the documentation for your Redis-compatible datastore:
* https://redis.io/docs/latest/[Redis documentation]
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/WhatIs.html[AWS ElastiCache (Redis OSS) User Guide]
* https://www.dragonflydb.io/docs[Dragonfly documentation]

AuthPolicy::

For AuthPolicy, you can install {keycloak} if this is required in your environment. For more details, see the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_keycloak[{keycloak} documentation].

Observability::

For Observability, {ocp} user workload monitoring must be configured to remote write to a central storage system such as Thanos. For more details, see the {LinkRHCLObserve}[{NameRHCLObserve}].
