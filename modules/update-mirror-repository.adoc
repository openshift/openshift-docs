= Mirroring the {product-title} image repository

Before you upgrade a cluster on infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network, you must mirror the required container images into that environment. You can also use this procedure in unrestricted networks to ensure your clusters only use container images that have satisfied your organizational controls on external content.

.Procedure



. Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocpupgradegraph/update_channel[Red Hat {product-title} Upgrade Graph visualizer and update planner] to plan an upgrade from one version to another. The OpenShift Upgrade Graph provides channel graphs and a way to confirm that there is an update path between your current and intended cluster versions.

. Set the required environment variables:
.. Export the image repository from the image release advisory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
----

.. Export the release digest from the image release advisory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST=<release_digest>
----
+
For `<release_digest>`, specify the digest from the release image advisory, such as
`sha256:4d048ae1274d11c49f9b7e70713a072315431598b2ddbb512aee4027c422fe3e`.
+
If you want to inspect a particular release image, use `oc adm release info "${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST}`.

.. Export the local registry name and host port:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_REGISTRY='<local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>'
----
+
For `<local_registry_host_name>`, specify the registry domain name for your mirror
repository, and for `<local_registry_host_port>`, specify the port that it
serves content on.

.. Export the local repository name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_REPOSITORY='<local_repository_name>'
----
+
For `<local_repository_name>`, specify the name of the repository to create in your
registry, such as `ocp4/openshift4`.

.. Export a tag name for the mirrored release image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_TAG=<local_tag>
----
+
For `<local_tag>`, you may specify any tag name compatible with your local registry.
To avoid conflicts, a safe pattern includes both the version of {product-title} to
install, and the architecture for the release image, such as `x86_64`.

.. Export the path to your registry pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_SECRET_JSON='<path_to_pull_secret>'
----
+
For `<path_to_pull_secret>`, specify the absolute path to and file name of the pull secret for your mirror registry that you created.
+
[NOTE]
====
If your cluster uses an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object to configure repository mirroring, you can use only global pull secrets for mirrored registries. You cannot add a pull secret to a project.
====

.. Export the path to the directory to host the mirrored images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH=<path> <1>
----
<1> Specify the full path, including the initial forward slash (/) character.

. Mirror the version images to the internal container registry:
** If your mirror host does not have internet access, take the following actions:
... Connect the removable media to a system that is connected to the internet.
... Review the images and configuration manifests to mirror:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} release mirror \
     --from=${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${LOCAL_TAG} --dry-run
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --to-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} --dry-run
----

... Record the entire `ImageContentSourcePolicy` section from the output of the previous
command. The information about your mirrors is unique to your mirrored repository, and you must ensure your in-cluster `ImageContentSourcePolicy` includes the entries needed for the mirrored release.
... Mirror the images to a directory on the removable media:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --to-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror ${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST}
----
... Take the media to the restricted network environment and upload the images to the local container registry.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --from-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror "file://openshift/release:4.*" ${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}
----
+
<1> For `REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH`, you must use the same path that you specified when you mirrored the images.

** If the local container registry and the cluster are connected to the mirror host, directly push the release images to the local registry and apply the config map  to the cluster by using following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} release mirror \
     --from=${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --apply-release-image-signature
----
+
... Record the entire `ImageContentSourcePolicy` section from the output of the previous
command. The information about your mirrors is unique to your mirrored repository, and you must ensure your in-cluster `ImageContentSourcePolicy` includes the entries needed for the mirrored release.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you include the `--apply-release-image-signature` option, do not create the config map for image signature verification.
====

[NOTE]
====
Optionally, you can use image tag name instead of image digest in the following commands.
