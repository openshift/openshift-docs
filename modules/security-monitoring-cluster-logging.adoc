= Cluster logging

In {product-title}, you deploy, manage, and upgrade cluster logging
through the Elasticsearch Operator and Cluster Logging Operator.
To configure logging, you can modify the ClusterLogging Custom Resource.
Users who have access to a project will be able to see the logs for that
project by default.

From a security standpoint, a cluster administrator can configure access
to system logs and logs for individual projects. To protect your logging
data, the ClusterLogging CR lets you choose a policy for replicating the
logging content. Using the CR, you can also limit memory, CPU and logging
storage space available.
