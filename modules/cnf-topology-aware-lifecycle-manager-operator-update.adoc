= Performing an Operator update with {policy-gen-cr} CRs

You can perform an Operator update with the {cgu-operator}.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {cgu-operator-first}.
* Update {ztp-first} to the latest version.
* Provision one or more managed clusters with {ztp}.
* Mirror the desired index image, bundle images, and all Operator images referenced in the bundle images.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Create {rh-rhacm} policies in the hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Update the `{policy-gen-cr}` CR for the Operator update.
.. Update the `du-upgrade` `{policy-gen-cr}` CR with the following additional contents in the `du-upgrade.yaml` file:
+
ifeval::["{policy-gen-cr}" == "PolicyGenTemplate"]
include::snippets/pgt-cnf-topology-aware-lifecycle-manager-operator-update.adoc[]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{policy-gen-cr}" == "PolicyGenerator"]
include::snippets/pg-cnf-topology-aware-lifecycle-manager-operator-update.adoc[]
endif::[]

.. This update generates one policy, `du-upgrade-operator-catsrc-policy`, to update the `redhat-operators-disconnected` catalog source with the new index images that contain the desired Operators images.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to use the image pre-caching for Operators and there are Operators from a different catalog source other than `redhat-operators-disconnected`,  you must perform the following tasks:

* Prepare a separate catalog source policy with the new index image or registry poll interval update for the different catalog source.
* Prepare a separate subscription policy for the desired Operators that are from the different catalog source.
====
+
For example, the desired SRIOV-FEC Operator is available in the `certified-operators` catalog source. To update the catalog source and the Operator subscription, add the following contents to generate two policies, `du-upgrade-fec-catsrc-policy` and `du-upgrade-subscriptions-fec-policy`:
+
ifeval::["{policy-gen-cr}" == "PolicyGenTemplate"]
include::snippets/pgt-sriov-fec-cnf-topology-aware-lifecycle-manager-operator-update.adoc[]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{policy-gen-cr}" == "PolicyGenerator"]
include::snippets/pg-sriov-fec-cnf-topology-aware-lifecycle-manager-operator-update.adoc[]
endif::[]

.. Remove the specified subscriptions channels in the common `{policy-gen-cr}` CR, if they exist. The default subscriptions channels from the {ztp} image are used for the update.
+
[NOTE]
====
The default channel for the Operators applied through {ztp} {product-version} is `stable`, except for the `performance-addon-operator`. As of {product-title} 4.11, the `performance-addon-operator` functionality was moved to the `node-tuning-operator`. For the 4.10 release, the default channel for PAO is `v4.10`. You can also specify the default channels in the common `{policy-gen-cr}` CR.
====

.. Push the `{policy-gen-cr}` CRs updates to the {ztp} Git repository.
+
ArgoCD pulls the changes from the Git repository and generates the policies on the hub cluster.

.. Check the created policies by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies -A | grep -E "catsrc-policy|subscription"
----

. Apply the required catalog source updates before starting the Operator update.

.. Save the content of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR named `operator-upgrade-prep` with the catalog source policies and the target managed clusters to the `cgu-operator-upgrade-prep.yml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: cgu-operator-upgrade-prep
  namespace: default
spec:
  clusters:
  - spoke1
  enable: true
  managedPolicies:
  - du-upgrade-operator-catsrc-policy
  remediationStrategy:
    maxConcurrency: 1
----

.. Apply the policy to the hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cgu-operator-upgrade-prep.yml
----

.. Monitor the update process. Upon completion, ensure that the policy is compliant by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies -A | grep -E "catsrc-policy"
----

. Create the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR for the Operator update with the `spec.enable` field set to `false`.
.. Save the content of the Operator update `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `du-upgrade-operator-catsrc-policy` policy and the subscription policies created from the common `{policy-gen-cr}` and the target clusters to the `cgu-operator-upgrade.yml` file, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: cgu-operator-upgrade
  namespace: default
spec:
  managedPolicies:
  - du-upgrade-operator-catsrc-policy <1>
  - common-subscriptions-policy <2>
  preCaching: false
  clusters:
  - spoke1
  remediationStrategy:
    maxConcurrency: 1
  enable: false
----
<1> The policy is needed by the image pre-caching feature to retrieve the operator images from the catalog source.
<2> The policy contains Operator subscriptions. If you have followed the structure and content of the reference `PolicyGenTemplates`, all Operator subscriptions are grouped into the `common-subscriptions-policy` policy.
+
[NOTE]
====
One `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR can only pre-cache the images of the desired Operators defined in the subscription policy from one catalog source included in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. If the desired Operators are from different catalog sources, such as in the example of the SRIOV-FEC Operator, another `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR must be created with `du-upgrade-fec-catsrc-policy` and `du-upgrade-subscriptions-fec-policy` policies for the SRIOV-FEC Operator images pre-caching and update.
====

.. Apply the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR to the hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cgu-operator-upgrade.yml
----

. Optional: Pre-cache the images for the Operator update.

.. Before starting image pre-caching, verify the subscription policy is `NonCompliant` at this point by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policy common-subscriptions-policy -n <policy_namespace>
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                          REMEDIATION ACTION   COMPLIANCE STATE     AGE
common-subscriptions-policy   inform               NonCompliant         27d
----

.. Enable pre-caching in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --namespace=default patch clustergroupupgrade.ran.openshift.io/cgu-operator-upgrade \
--patch '{"spec":{"preCaching": true}}' --type=merge
----

.. Monitor the process and wait for the pre-caching to complete. Check the status of pre-caching by running the following command on the managed cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu cgu-operator-upgrade -o jsonpath='{.status.precaching.status}'
----

.. Check if the pre-caching is completed before starting the update by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu -n default cgu-operator-upgrade -ojsonpath='{.status.conditions}' | jq
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,json]
----

      "type": "PrecachingDone"
    }
]
----

. Start the Operator update.

.. Enable the `cgu-operator-upgrade` `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR and disable pre-caching to start the Operator update by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --namespace=default patch clustergroupupgrade.ran.openshift.io/cgu-operator-upgrade \
--patch '{"spec":{"enable":true, "preCaching": false}}' --type=merge
----

.. Monitor the process. Upon completion, ensure that the policy is compliant by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies --all-namespaces
