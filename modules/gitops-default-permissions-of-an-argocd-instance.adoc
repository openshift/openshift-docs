= Default permissions of an Argocd instance

By default Argo CD instance has the following permissions:

* Argo CD instance has the `admin` privileges to manage resources only in the namespace where it is deployed. For instance, an Argo CD instance deployed in the **foo** namespace has the `admin` privileges to manage resources only for that namespace.

* Argo CD has the following cluster-scoped permissions because Argo CD requires cluster-wide `read` privileges on resources to function appropriately:

* You can edit the cluster roles used by the `argocd-server` and `argocd-application-controller` components where Argo CD is running such that the `write` privileges are limited to only the namespaces and resources that you wish Argo CD to manage.
