= Configuring a control plane for federation

Before a mesh can be federated, you must configure the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` for mesh federation. Because all meshes that are members of the federation are equal, and each mesh is managed independently, you must configure the SMCP for _each_ mesh that will participate in the federation.

In the following example, the administrator for the `red-mesh` is configuring the SMCP for federation with both the `green-mesh` and the `blue-mesh`.

== Understanding federation gateways

You use a *gateway* to manage inbound and outbound traffic for your mesh, letting you specify which traffic you want to enter or leave the mesh.

You use ingress and egress gateways to manage traffic entering and leaving the service mesh (North-South traffic). When you create a federated mesh, you create additional ingress/egress gateways, to facilitate service discovery between federated meshes, communication between federated meshes, and to manage traffic flow between service meshes (East-West traffic).

To avoid naming conflicts between meshes, you must create separate egress and ingress gateways for each mesh. For example, 'red-mesh' would have separate egress gateways for traffic going to 'green-mesh' and `blue-mesh`.

== Understanding federation trust domain parameters

Each mesh in the federation must have its own unique trust domain. This value is used when configuring mesh federation in the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource.

.Procedure from the Console

Follow this procedure to edit the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` with the {product-title} web console. This example uses the `red-mesh` as an example.

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the *Project* menu and select the project where you installed the control plane. For example, `red-mesh-system`.

. Click the {ProductName} Operator.

. On the *Istio Service Mesh Control Plane* tab, click the name of your `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, for example `red-mesh-install`.

. On the *Create ServiceMeshControlPlane Details* page, click `YAML` to modify your configuration.

. Modify your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` to add federation ingress and egress gateways and to specify the trust domain.

. Click *Save*.


.Procedure from the CLI

Follow this procedure to create or edit the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` with the command line. This example uses the `red-mesh` as an example.

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. Enter the following command. Then, enter your username and password when prompted.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --username=NAMEOFUSER https://{HOSTNAME}:6443
----
+
. Change to the project where you installed the control plane, for example red-mesh-system.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project red-mesh-system
----
+
. Edit the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` file to add federation ingress and egress gateways and to specify the trust domain.

. Run the following command to edit the control plane where `red-mesh-system` is the system namespace and `red-mesh-install.yaml` includes a full path to the file you edited:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit -n red-mesh-system -f red-mesh-install.yaml
----
+
. Enter the following command, where `red-mesh-system` is the system namespace, to see the status of the control plane installation.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get smcp -n red-mesh-system
----
+
The installation has finished successfully when the READY column is true.
+
