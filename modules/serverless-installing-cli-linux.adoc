= Installing the Knative CLI for Linux

If you are using a Linux distribution that does not have RPM or another package manager installed, you can install the Knative (`kn`) CLI as a binary file. To do this, you must download and unpack a `tar.gz` archive and add the binary to a directory on your `PATH`.

.Prerequisites

* If you are not using RHEL or Fedora, ensure that *libc* is installed in a directory on your library path.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If *libc* is not available, you might see the following error when you run CLI commands:

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn: No such file or directory
----
====

.Procedure

. Download the relevant Knative (`kn`) CLI `tar.gz` archive:

$ tar -xf <filename>

. Move the `kn` binary to a directory on your `PATH`.

$ echo $PATH
