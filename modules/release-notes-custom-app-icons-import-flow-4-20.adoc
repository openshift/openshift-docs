= Support for custom application icons in the Import flow

Before this update, the **Container image** form flow provided only a limited set of predefined icons for applications.  

With this update, you can add custom icons when you import applications through the **Container image** form. For existing applications, apply the `app.openshift.io/custom-icon` annotation to add a custom icon to the corresponding Topology node.  

As a result, you can better identify applications in the **Topology** view and organize your projects more clearly.
