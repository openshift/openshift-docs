= Overriding KServe configuration

If you want to override KServe settings to customize your model-serving environment, you can follow the general steps for your operating system.

Option 1::

. Make a copy of the existing `ConfigMap` file, `inferenceservice-config`, in the `redhat-ods-applications` namespace.

. Edit the settings you want to change.

. Overwrite the existing `ConfigMap` object.

. Restart KServe by either by deleting the pod or scaling the `Deployment` pod parameter down to `0` and then back up to `1`.

Option 2::

. Copy the `ConfigMap` file, `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/010-microshift-ai-model-serving-kserve/inferenceservice-config-microshift-patch.yaml`.

. Edit the settings you want to change.

. Apply the `ConfigMap` object.

. Restart KServe by either by deleting the pod or scaling the `Deployment` pod parameter down to `0` and then back up to `1`.

For {op-system-ostree} and {op-system-image} systems::

. Create a new manifest with the `ConfigMap` file, based on either of the `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/010-microshift-ai-model-serving-kserve/inferenceservice-config-microshift-patch.yaml` or `inferenceservice-config` files, in the `redhat-ods-applications` namespace.

. Ensure that the new manifest is placed in the `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/` directory. Staring with prefix `011` is recommended so that your manifest is applied after the `/usr/lib/microshift/manifests.d/010-microshift-ai-model-serving-kserve/` directory contents.
