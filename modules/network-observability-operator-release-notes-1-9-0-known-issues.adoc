= Network Observability Operator 1.9.0 known issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the known issues for the Network Observability Operator 1.9.0 release.

* The user-defined network (UDN) feature displays a configuration issue and a warning when used with {product-title} 4.18, even though it is supported. This warning can be ignored.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-2305[NETOBSERV-2305])

* In some rare cases, the eBPF agent is unable to appropriately correlate flows with the involved interfaces when running in `privileged` modes with several network namespaces. A large part of these issues have been identified and resolved in this release, but some inconsistencies remain, especially with the `ens5` interface. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-2287[NETOBSERV-2287])
