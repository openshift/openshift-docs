= About data volumes

`DataVolume` objects are custom resources that are provided by the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) project. Data volumes orchestrate import, clone, and upload operations that are associated with an underlying persistent volume claim (PVC). You can create a data volume as either a standalone resource or by using the `dataVolumeTemplate` field in the virtual machine (VM) specification.

[NOTE]
====
* VM disk PVCs that are prepared by using standalone data volumes maintain an independent lifecycle from the VM. If you use the `dataVolumeTemplate` field in the VM specification to prepare the PVC, the PVC shares the same lifecycle as the VM.
