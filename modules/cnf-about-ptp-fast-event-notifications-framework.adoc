= About the PTP fast event notifications framework

Use the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) fast event notifications framework to subscribe cluster applications to PTP events that the bare-metal cluster node generates.

[NOTE]
====
The fast events notifications framework uses a REST API for communication. The REST API is based on the _O-RAN O-Cloud Notification API Specification for Event Consumers 3.0_ that is available from link:https://orandownloadsweb.azurewebsites.net/specifications[O-RAN ALLIANCE Specifications].
====

The framework consists of a publisher, subscriber, and an AMQ or HTTP messaging protocol to handle communications between the publisher and subscriber applications.
Applications run the `cloud-event-proxy` container in a sidecar pattern to subscribe to PTP events.
The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar container can access the same resources as the primary application container without using any of the resources of the primary application and with no significant latency.

.Overview of PTP fast events
image::319_OpenShift_PTP_bare-metal_OCP_nodes_0323_4.13.png[Overview of PTP fast events]

image:darkcircle-1.png[20,20] Event is generated on the cluster host::
`linuxptp-daemon` in the PTP Operator-managed pod runs as a Kubernetes `DaemonSet` and manages the various `linuxptp` processes (`ptp4l`, `phc2sys`, and optionally for grandmaster clocks, `ts2phc`).
The `linuxptp-daemon` passes the event to the UNIX domain socket.

image:darkcircle-2.png[20,20] Event is passed to the cloud-event-proxy sidecar::
The PTP plugin reads the event from the UNIX domain socket and passes it to the `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar in the PTP Operator-managed pod.
`cloud-event-proxy` delivers the event from the Kubernetes infrastructure to Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNFs) with low latency.

image:darkcircle-3.png[20,20] Event is persisted::
The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar in the PTP Operator-managed pod processes the event and publishes the cloud-native event by using a REST API.

image:darkcircle-4.png[20,20] Message is transported::
The message transporter transports the event to the `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar in the application pod over HTTP or AMQP 1.0 QPID.

image:darkcircle-5.png[20,20] Event is available from the REST API::
The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar in the Application pod processes the event and makes it available by using the REST API.

image:darkcircle-6.png[20,20] Consumer application requests a subscription and receives the subscribed event::
The consumer application sends an API request to the `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar in the application pod to create a PTP events subscription.
The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar creates an AMQ or HTTP messaging listener protocol for the resource specified in the subscription.

The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar in the application pod receives the event from the PTP Operator-managed pod, unwraps the cloud events object to retrieve the data, and posts the event to the consumer application.
The consumer application listens to the address specified in the resource qualifier and receives and processes the PTP event.
