= About the PTP fast event notifications framework

Use the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) fast event REST API v2 to subscribe cluster applications to PTP events that the bare-metal cluster node generates.

[NOTE]
====
The fast events notifications framework uses a REST API for communication. The PTP events REST API v1 and v2 are based on the _O-RAN O-Cloud Notification API Specification for Event Consumers 3.0_ that is available from link:https://orandownloadsweb.azurewebsites.net/specifications[O-RAN ALLIANCE Specifications].

Only the PTP events REST API v2 is O-RAN v3 compliant.
