= About the PTP fast event notifications framework

Red{nbsp}Hat

You can subscribe cluster applications to Precision Time Protocol (PTP) fast events notifications generated by the host where you have deployed {product-title}.
PTP fast events use an HTTP Transport bus or AMQP event notification bus to transport the messages from the underlying host to the application.
You configure fast events by using the PTP Operator and `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar container. To enable fast events, set the `enableEventPublisher` field to `true` in the `ptpOperatorConfig` custom resource (CR) and specify a `transportHost`.
Use HTTP Transport or Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) for the `transportHost` field.

The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar container can access the same resources as the primary application pod without using any of the primary application pod's allocated resources and with no significant latency.

The fast events notifications framework uses a O-RAN REST API specification. The framework consists of a publisher, subscriber, and an messaging bus to handle communications between the publisher and subscriber applications.
The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar is a utility container that runs in a pod that is loosely coupled to the primary application container running on the cluster node.
It provides an event publishing framework that allows you to subscribe other applications to published PTP events.

Applications run the `cloud-event-proxy` container in a sidecar pattern to subscribe to PTP events. The following workflow describes how an application uses PTP fast events:

. *Application requests an events subscription*: The application sends an API request to the `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar to create a PTP events subscription. The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar creates a subscription resource.

. *cloud-event-proxy sidecar creates the subscription*: The event resource is persisted by the `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar. The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar container sends an acknowledgment with an ID and URL location to access the stored subscription resource.

. *Application receives the PTP event notification*: The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar container listens to the address specified in the resource qualifier. The events consumer processes the message and passes it to the return URL specified in the subscription.

. *cloud-event-proxy sidecar validates the PTP event and posts it to the application*: The `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar receives the event, unwraps the cloud events object to retrieve the data, and fetches the return URL to post the event back to the consumer application.

. *Application uses the PTP event*: The events consumer receives and processes the PTP event.
