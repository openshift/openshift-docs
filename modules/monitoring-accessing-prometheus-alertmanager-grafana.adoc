= Accessing Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana

You can get the addresses for accessing Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana web UIs.

.Procedure

* Run:
+
[subs=quotes]
  $ oc -n openshift-monitoring get routes
  NAME                HOST/PORT                                                     ...
  alertmanager-main   alertmanager-main-openshift-monitoring.apps._url_.openshift.com ...
  grafana             grafana-openshift-monitoring.apps._url_.openshift.com           ...
  prometheus-k8s      prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.apps._url_.openshift.com    ...
+
Prepend `https://` to these addresses. You cannot access web UIs using unencrypted connection.
+
Authentication is performed against the {product-title} identity and uses the same credentials or means of authentication as is used elsewhere in {product-title}. You need to use a role that has read access to all namespaces, such as the `cluster-monitoring-view` cluster role.
