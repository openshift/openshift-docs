= Cluster network card replacement

When you replace a network card, the MAC address changes.
The MAC address can be part of the DHCP or SR-IOV Operator configuration, router configuration, firewall rules, or application Cloud-native Network Function (CNF) configuration.
Before you bring back a node online after replacing a network card, you must verify that these configurations are up-to-date.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not have specific procedures for MAC address changes within the network, contact your network administrator or network hardware vendor.
