= Uninstalling the EFS Operator

.Procedure

To remove the Operator from your cluster:

. Delete all of the workloads using the persistent volume claims that were generated by the Operator.
. Delete all of the shared volumes from all of the namespaces. The Operator automatically removes the associated persistent volumes and persistent volume claims.
. Uninstall the Operator:
.. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
.. Find the entry for AWS EFS Operator, and click the menu button on the right-hand side of the Operator.
.. Click *Uninstall* and confirm the deletion.

. Delete the shared volume CRD. This action triggers the deletion of the remaining Operator-owned resources.
