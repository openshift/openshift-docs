= Installing the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator by using the web console

The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator creates and manages the Elasticsearch cluster used by OpenShift Logging.

.Prerequisites

* Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. Each Elasticsearch node needs at least 16GB of memory for both memory requests and limits, unless you specify otherwise in the `ClusterLogging` custom resource.
+
The initial set of {product-title} nodes might not be large enough to support the Elasticsearch cluster. You must add additional nodes to the {product-title} cluster to run with the recommended or higher memory, up to a maximum of 64GB for each Elasticsearch node.
+
Elasticsearch nodes can operate with a lower memory setting, though this is not recommended for production environments.

* Ensure that you have the necessary persistent storage for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch node
requires its own storage volume.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use a local volume for persistent storage, do not use a raw block volume, which is described with `volumeMode: block` in the `LocalVolume` object. Elasticsearch cannot use raw block volumes.
====

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.
. Click *OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.
. Ensure that the *All namespaces on the cluster* is selected under *Installation mode*.
. Ensure that *openshift-operators-redhat* is selected under *Installed Namespace*.
+
You must specify the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace. The `openshift-operators` namespace might contain Community Operators, which are untrusted and could publish a metric with the same name as {product-title} metric, which would cause conflicts.

. Select *Enable operator recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace*.
+
This option sets the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label in the `Namespace` object. You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace.

. Select *stable-5.x* as the *Update channel*.
. Select an *Update approval* strategy:
+
* The *Automatic* strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
+
* The *Manual* strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.

. Click *Install*.

.Verification

. Verify that the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator installed by switching to the *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators* page.
. Ensure that *OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator* is listed in all projects with a *Status* of *Succeeded*.
