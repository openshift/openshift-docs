= About RevisionBased strategy

The `RevisionBased` strategy runs two revisions of the control plane during an upgrade. This approach supports gradual workload migration from the old control plane to the new one, enabling canary upgrades. It also supports upgrades across more than one minor version.

The `RevisionBased` strategy creates a new {istio} control plane instance for each change to the `spec.version` field. The existing control plane remains active until all workloads transition to the new instance. You can move the workloads to the new control plane by updating the `istio.io/rev` labels or using the `IstioRevisionTag` resource, followed by a restart.

Although the `RevisionBased` strategy involves additional steps and requires multiple control plane instances to run concurrently during the upgrade, it allows for gradual migration of workloads. This approach enables validation of the updated control plane with a subset of workloads before migrating the rest, making it useful for large meshes with mission-critical workloads.
