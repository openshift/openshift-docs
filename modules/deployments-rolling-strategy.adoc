= Rolling strategy

A rolling deployment slowly replaces instances of the previous version of an application with instances of the new version of the application. The rolling strategy is the default deployment strategy used if no strategy is specified on a `DeploymentConfig` object.

A rolling deployment typically waits for new pods to become `ready` via a readiness check before scaling down the old components. If a significant issue occurs, the rolling deployment can be aborted.

*When to use a rolling deployment:*

- When you want to take no downtime during an application update.
- When your application supports having old code and new code running at the same time.

A rolling deployment means you have both old and new versions of your code running at the same time. This typically requires that your application handle N-1 compatibility.

----
<1> The time to wait between individual pod updates. If unspecified, this value defaults to `1`.
<2> The time to wait between polling the deployment status after update. If unspecified, this value defaults to `1`.
<3> The time to wait for a scaling event before giving up. Optional; the default is `600`. Here, _giving up_ means automatically rolling back to the previous complete deployment.
<4> `maxSurge` is optional and defaults to `25%` if not specified. See the information below the following procedure.
<5> `maxUnavailable` is optional and defaults to `25%` if not specified. See the information below the following procedure.
<6> `pre` and `post` are both lifecycle hooks.

The rolling strategy:

. Executes any `pre` lifecycle hook.
. Scales up the new replication controller based on the surge count.
. Scales down the old replication controller based on the max unavailable count.
. Repeats this scaling until the new replication controller has reached the desired replica count and the old replication controller has been scaled to zero.
. Executes any `post` lifecycle hook.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When scaling down, the rolling strategy waits for pods to become ready so it can decide whether further scaling would affect availability. If scaled up pods never become ready, the deployment process will eventually time out and result in a deployment failure.
====

The `maxUnavailable` parameter is the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update. The `maxSurge` parameter is the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled above the original number of pods. Both parameters can be set to either a percentage (e.g., `10%`) or an absolute value (e.g., `2`). The default value for both is `25%`.

These parameters allow the deployment to be tuned for availability and speed. For example:

- `maxUnavailable*=0` and `maxSurge*=20%` ensures full capacity is maintained during the update and rapid scale up.
- `maxUnavailable*=10%` and `maxSurge*=0` performs an update using no extra capacity (an in-place update).
- `maxUnavailable*=10%` and `maxSurge*=10%` scales up and down quickly with some potential for capacity loss.

Generally, if you want fast rollouts, use `maxSurge`. If you have to take into account resource quota and can accept partial unavailability, use
`maxUnavailable`.

[WARNING]
====
The default setting for `maxUnavailable` is `1` for all the machine config pools in {product-title}. It is recommended to not change this value and update one control plane node at a time. Do not change this value to `3` for the control plane pool.
