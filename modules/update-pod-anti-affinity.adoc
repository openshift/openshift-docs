= Ensuring that pods do not run on the same cluster node

[role="_abstract"]
High availability in Kubernetes requires duplicate processes to be running on separate nodes in the cluster.
This ensures that the application continues to run even if one node becomes unavailable.
In {product-title}, processes can be automatically duplicated in separate pods in a deployment.
You configure anti-affinity in the `Pod` resource to ensure that the pods in a deployment do not run on the same cluster node.

During an update, setting pod anti-affinity ensures that pods are distributed evenly across nodes in the cluster. This means that node reboots are easier during an update.
For example, if there are 4 pods from a single deployment on a node, and the pod disruption budget is set to only allow 1 pod to be deleted at a time, then it will take 4 times as long for that node to reboot.
Setting pod anti-affinity spreads pods across the cluster to prevent such occurrences.
