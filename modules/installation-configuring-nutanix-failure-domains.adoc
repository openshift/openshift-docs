= Configuring failure domains

Failure domains improve the fault tolerance of an {product-title} cluster by distributing control plane and compute machines across multiple Nutanix Prism Elements (clusters).

[TIP]
====
It is recommended that you configure three failure domains to ensure high-availability.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have an installation configuration file (`install-config.yaml`).

.Procedure

. Edit the `install-config.yaml` file and add the following stanza to configure the first failure domain:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute:
# ...
platform:
  nutanix:
    failureDomains:
    - name: <failure_domain_name>
      prismElement:
        name: <prism_element_name>
        uuid: <prism_element_uuid>
      subnetUUIDs:
      - <network_uuid>
# ...
----
+
where:

`<failure_domain_name>`:: Specifies a unique name for the failure domain. The name is limited to 64 or fewer characters, which can include lower-case letters, digits, and a dash (`-`). The dash cannot be in the leading or ending position of the name.
`<prism_element_name>`:: Optional. Specifies the name of the Prism Element.
`<prism_element_uuid`>:: Specifies the UUID of the Prism Element.
`<network_uuid`>:: Specifies the one or more UUIDs of the Prism Element subnet objects. Among them, one of the subnet's IP address prefixes (CIDRs) must contain the virtual IP addresses that the {product-title} cluster uses. A maximum of 32 subnets for each failure domain (Prism Element) in an {product-title} cluster is supported. All `subnetUUID` values must be unique.

. As required, configure additional failure domains.
. To distribute control plane and compute machines across the failure domains, do one of the following:

** If compute and control plane machines can share the same set of failure domains, add the failure domain names under the cluster's default machine configuration.

        - failure-domain-2
        - failure-domain-3
# ...
----
** If compute and control plane machines must use different failure domains, add the failure domain names under the respective machine pools.
