The Cluster Baremetal Operator is an optional cluster capability that can be disabled by cluster administrators during installation. For more information about optional cluster capabilities, see "Cluster capabilities" in _Installing_.

== Purpose

ifdef::cluster-caps[]

The Cluster Baremetal Operator provides the features for the `baremetal` capability.

endif::cluster-caps[]

The Cluster Baremetal Operator (CBO) deploys all the components necessary to take a bare-metal server to a fully functioning worker node ready to run {product-title} compute nodes. The CBO ensures that the metal3 deployment, which consists of the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) and Ironic containers, runs on one of the control plane nodes within the {product-title} cluster. The CBO also listens for {product-title} updates to resources that it watches and takes appropriate action.

ifdef::cluster-caps[]
The bare-metal capability is required for deployments using installer-provisioned infrastructure. Disabling the bare-metal capability can result in unexpected problems with these deployments.

It is recommended that cluster administrators only disable the bare-metal capability during installations with user-provisioned infrastructure that do not have any `BareMetalHost` resources in the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the bare-metal capability is disabled, the cluster cannot provision or manage bare-metal nodes. Only disable the capability if there are no `BareMetalHost` resources in your deployment. The `baremetal` capability depends on the `MachineAPI` capability. If you enable the `baremetal` capability, you must also enable `MachineAPI`.
