= Jaeger features

Jaeger tracing provides the following capabilities:

* Integration with Kiali – When properly configured, you can view Jaeger data from the Kiali console.

* High scalability – The Jaeger backend is designed to have no single points of failure and to scale with the business needs.

* Distributed Context Propagation – Lets you connect data from different components together to create a complete end-to-end trace.

* Backwards compatibility with Zipkin – Jaeger provides backwards compatibility with Zipkin by accepting spans in Zipkin formats (Thrift or JSON v1/v2) over HTTP.
