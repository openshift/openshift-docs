= Data backup failure

[role="_abstract"]
Data backups are automatic on `rpm-ostree` systems. If you are not using an `rpm-ostree` system and attempted to create a manual backup, the following reasons can cause the backup to fail:

* Not waiting several minutes after a system start to successfully stop {microshift-short}. The system must complete health checks and any other background processes before a back up can succeed.
* If {microshift-short} stopped running because of an error, you cannot perform a backup of the data.
** Make sure the system is healthy.
** Stop it in a healthy state before attempting a backup.
* If you do not have enough storage for the data, the backup fails. Ensure that you have enough storage for {microshift-short} data.
* If you do not have the required user permissions, a backup can fail. Ensure that you have the correct user permissions to create a backup and perform the required configurations.
