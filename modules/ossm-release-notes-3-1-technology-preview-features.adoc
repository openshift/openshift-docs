= {SMProductName} version 3.1 Technology Preview features

This release includes some features that are currently in Technology Preview. These experimental features are not intended for production use. For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

[id="istio-ambient-mode-rn_{context}"]
== Istio ambient mode

This release updates the status of {istio} ambient mode to Technology Preview. {istio} ambient mode provides a sidecar-less alternative data plane to the traditional sidecar-based data plane. By default, ambient mode splits the data plane into node-level L4 ZTunnels and namespace-scoped L7 Waypoint proxies.

{istio} ambient mode requires {k8s} Gateway API custom resource definitions (CRDs). Use OpenShift Service Mesh 4.19 or later, which includes the CRDs by default.

To avoid potential conflicts, you must install {istio} ambient mode only on clusters that do not have an existing {SMProductName} installation. {istio} ambient mode is not compatible with clusters that use {SMProductName} 2.6 or earlier.

When you use {istio} ambient mode, pods that rely on `liveness` or `readiness` probes require you to set the OVN-Kubernetes gateway mode to `local` instead of the default `shared` mode. In local mode, traffic routes through the host and the host processes it using the routing table, ensuring that probes function correctly. For more information, see the "Configuring gateway mode" section in the OVN-Kubernetes documentation.

To start using {istio} ambient mode, see the "Istio ambient mode" section in the {SMProduct} 3 installation documentation.

[id="kubernetes-gateway-api-inference-extensions_{context}"]
== Kubernetes Gateway API Inference Extensions

This release provides technology preview support for {k8s} Gateway API Inference Extensions. These extensions build on Kubernetes Gateway API to provide inference-specific routing capabilities that optimize for self-hosted generative-AI workloads. This implementation was backported to {SMProduct} 3.1 from {istio} 1.27.
