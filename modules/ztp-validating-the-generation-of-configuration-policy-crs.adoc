= Validating the generation of configuration policy CRs

`Policy` custom resources (CRs) are generated in the same namespace as the `{policy-gen-cr}` from which they are created. The same troubleshooting flow applies to all policy CRs generated from a `{policy-gen-cr}` regardless of whether they are `ztp-common`, `ztp-group`, or `ztp-site` based, as shown using the following commands:

[source,terminal]
----
$ export NS=<namespace>
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policy -n $NS
----

The expected set of policy-wrapped CRs should be displayed.

If the policies failed synchronization, use the following troubleshooting steps.

.Procedure

. To display detailed information about the policies, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe -n openshift-gitops application policies
----

. Check for `Status: Conditions:` to show the error logs. For example, setting an invalid `sourceFile` entry to `fileName:` generates the error shown below:
+
[source,text]
----

  Conditions:

    Type:  ComparisonError
----

. Check for `Status: Sync:`. If there are log errors at `Status: Conditions:`, the `Status: Sync:` shows `Unknown` or `Error`:
+
[source,text]

. When {rh-rhacm-first} recognizes that policies apply to a `ManagedCluster` object, the policy CR objects are applied to the cluster namespace. Check to see if the policies were copied to the cluster namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policy -n $CLUSTER
----
+
.Example output:
+
[source,terminal]

{rh-rhacm} copies all applicable policies into the cluster namespace. The copied policy names have the format: `<{policy-gen-cr}.Namespace>.<{policy-gen-cr}.Name>-<policyName>`.

. Check the placement rule for any policies not copied to the cluster namespace. The `matchSelector` in the `{placement-rule-cr}` for those policies should match labels on the `ManagedCluster` object:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get {placement-rule-cr} -n $NS
----

. Note the `{placement-rule-cr}` name appropriate for the missing policy, common, group, or site, using the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get {placement-rule-cr} -n $NS <placement_rule_name> -o yaml
----
+
* The status-decisions should include your cluster name.
* The key-value pair of the `matchSelector` in the spec must match the labels on your managed cluster.

. Check the labels on the `ManagedCluster` object by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ManagedCluster $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' | jq
----

. Check to see what policies are compliant by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policy -n $CLUSTER
----
+
If the `Namespace`, `OperatorGroup`, and `Subscription` policies are compliant but the Operator configuration policies are not, it is likely that the Operators did not install on the managed cluster. This causes the Operator configuration policies to fail to apply because the CRD is not yet applied to the spoke.
