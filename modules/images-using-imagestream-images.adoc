= Imagestream images

An imagestream image points from within an imagestream
to a particular image ID.

Imagestream images allow you to retrieve metadata about an image from a
particular imagestream where it is tagged.

Imagestream image objects are automatically created in {product-title} whenever
you import or tag an image into the imagestream. You should never have to
explicitly define an imagestream image object in any imagestream definition
that you use to create imagestreams.

The imagestream image consists of the imagestream name and image ID from the
repository, delimited by an `@` sign:

----
<image-stream-name>@<image-id>
----

To refer to the image in the `ImageStream` object example, the imagestream image
looks like:

----
origin-ruby-sample@sha256:47463d94eb5c049b2d23b03a9530bf944f8f967a0fe79147dd6b9135bf7dd13d
