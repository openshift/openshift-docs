= Recovering from expired control plane certificates

As of 4.5.0, {product-title} can now automatically recover control plane certificates, replacing the previous manual steps.

The only exception is kubelet. For recovering kubelet certificates, you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs).

. Get the list of current CSRs.
+
----
$ oc get csr
----

. Review the details of a CSR to verify it is valid.
+
----
$ oc describe csr <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

. Approve each valid CSR.
+
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
----
+
Be sure to approve all pending `node-bootstrapper` CSRs.
