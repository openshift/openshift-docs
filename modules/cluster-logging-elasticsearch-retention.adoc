= Configuring log retention time

You can configure a _retention policy_ that specifies how long the default Elasticsearch log store keeps indices for each of the three log sources: infrastructure logs, application logs, and audit logs.

To configure the retention policy, you set a `maxAge` parameter for each log source in the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR). The CR applies these values to the Elasticsearch rollover schedule, which determines when Elasticsearch deletes the rolled-over indices.

Elasticsearch rolls over an index, moving the current index and creating a new index, when an index matches any of the following conditions:

* The index is older than the `rollover.maxAge` value in the `Elasticsearch` CR.
* The index size is greater than 40 GB × the number of primary shards.
* The index doc count is greater than 40960 KB × the number of primary shards.

Elasticsearch deletes the rolled-over indices based on the retention policy you configure. If you do not create a retention policy for any log sources, logs are deleted after seven days by default.

.Prerequisites
//SME Feedback Req: There are a few instances of these for prereqs. Should OpenShift Logging here be the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator or the logging product name?
* The {logging-title} and the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator must be installed.

.Procedure

To configure the log retention time:

. Edit the `ClusterLogging` CR to add or modify the `retentionPolicy` parameter:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
...
spec:
  managementState: "Managed"
  logStore:
    type: "elasticsearch"
    retentionPolicy: <1>
      application:
        maxAge: 1d
      infra:
        maxAge: 7d
      audit:
        maxAge: 7d
    elasticsearch:
      nodeCount: 3
...
----
<1> Specify the time that Elasticsearch should retain each log source. Enter an integer and a time designation: weeks(w), hours(h/H), minutes(m) and seconds(s). For example, `1d` for one day. Logs older than the `maxAge` are deleted. By default, logs are retained for seven days.

. You can verify the settings in the `Elasticsearch` custom resource (CR).
+
For example, the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator updated the following `Elasticsearch` CR to configure a retention policy that includes settings to roll over active indices for the infrastructure logs every eight hours and the rolled-over indices are deleted seven days after rollover. {product-title} checks every 15 minutes to determine if the indices need to be rolled over.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "Elasticsearch"
metadata:
  name: "elasticsearch"
spec:
...
  indexManagement:
    policies: <1>
      - name: infra-policy
        phases:
          delete:
            minAge: 7d <2>
          hot:
            actions:
              rollover:
                maxAge: 8h <3>
        pollInterval: 15m <4>
...
----
<1> For each log source, the retention policy indicates when to delete and roll over logs for that source.
<2> When {product-title} deletes the rolled-over indices. This setting is the `maxAge` you set in the `ClusterLogging` CR.
<3> The index age for {product-title} to consider when rolling over the indices. This value is determined from the `maxAge` you set in the `ClusterLogging` CR.
<4> When {product-title} checks if the indices should be rolled over. This setting is the default and cannot be changed.
+
[NOTE]
====
Modifying the `Elasticsearch` CR is not supported. All changes to the retention policies must be made in the `ClusterLogging` CR.
====
+
The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator deploys a cron job to roll over indices for each mapping using the defined policy, scheduled using the `pollInterval`.
