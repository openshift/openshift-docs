= Configuring log retention time

You can specify how long the default Elasticsearch log store keeps indices 
using a separate _retention policy_ for each of the three log sources: 
infrastructure logs, application logs, and audit logs. The retention policy, 
which you configure using the `maxAge` parameter in the Cluster Logging Custom 
Resource (CR), is considered for the Elasticsearch roll over schedule and 
determines when Elasticsearch deletes the rolled-over indices. 

Elasticsearch rolls over an index, moving the current index and creating a new 
index, when an index matches any of the following conditions:

* The index is older than the `rollover.maxAge` value in the Elasticsearch CR.
* The index size is greater than 40 GB × the number of primary shards.
* The index doc count is greater than 40960 KB × the number of primary shards.

Elasticsearch deletes the rolled-over indices are deleted based on the 
retention policy you configure.

If you do not create a retention policy for any of the log sources, logs 
are deleted after seven days by default. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not specify a retention policy  for all three log sources, only logs 
from the sources with a retention policy are stored. For example, if you 
set a retention policy for the infrastructure and applicaiton logs, but do not 
set a retention policy for audit logs, the audit logs will not be retained 
and there will be no *audit-* index in Elasticsearch or Kibana. 
====

.Prerequisites

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

.Procedure

To configure the log retention time:

. Edit the Cluster Logging CR to add or modify the `retentionPolicy` parameter:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
...
spec:
  managementState: "Managed"
  logStore:
    type: "elasticsearch"
    retentionPolicy: <1>
      application:
        maxAge: 1d
      infra:
        maxAge: 7d
      audit:
        maxAge: 7d
    elasticsearch:
      nodeCount: 3
...
----
<1> Specify the time that Elasticsearch should retain each log source. Enter an 
integer and a time designation: weeks(w), hours(h/H), minutes(m) and seconds(s). 
For example, `1d` for one day. Logs older than the `maxAge` are deleted. 
By default, logs are retained for seven days. 

. You can verify the settings in the Elasticsearch Custom Resource (CR).
+
For example, the Cluster Logging Operator updated the following
Elasticsearch CR to configure a retention policy that includes settings 
to roll over active indices for the infrastructure logs every eight hours and 
the rolled-ver indices are deleted seven days after rollover. {product-title} checks 
every 15 minutes to determine if the indices need to be rolled over.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "Elasticsearch"
metadata:
  name: "elasticsearch"
spec:
...
  indexManagement:
    policies: <1>
      - name: infra-policy
        phases:
          delete:
            minAge: 7d <2>
          hot:
            actions:
              rollover:
                maxAge: 8h <3>
        pollInterval: 15m <4>
...
----
<1> For each log source, the retention policy indicates when to delete and 
rollover logs for that source. 
<2> When {product-title} deletes the rolled-over indices. This setting 
is the `maxAge` you set in the Cluster Logging CR.
<3> The index age for {product-title} to consider when rolling over the indices. 
This value is determined from the `maxAge` you set in the Cluster Logging CR.  
<4> When {product-title} checks if the indices should be rolled over. 
This setting is the default and cannot be changed.
+
[NOTE]
====
Modifying the Elasticsearch CR is not supported. All changes to the retention 
policies must be made in the Cluster Logging CR.
==== 
+
The Elasticsearch Operator deploys a CronJob to roll over indices for each 
mapping using the defined policy, scheduled using the `pollInterval`.
