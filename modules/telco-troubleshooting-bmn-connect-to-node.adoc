= Connecting to a bare-metal node in your cluster

You can connect to bare-metal cluster nodes for general maintenance tasks.

[NOTE]
====
Configuring the cluster node from the host operating system is not recommended or supported.
====

To troubleshoot your nodes, you can do the following tasks:

* Retrieve logs from node
* Use debugging
* Use SSH to connect to the node

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use SSH only if you cannot connect to the node with the `oc debug` command.
====

.Procedure

. Retrieve the logs from a node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm node-logs <node_name> -u crio
----

. Use debugging by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----

. Set `/host` as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host’s root file system in `/host` within the pod. By changing the root directory to `/host`, you can run binaries contained in the host’s executable paths:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
# chroot /host
----

.Output
[source,terminal]
----
You are now logged in as root on the node
----
--

. Optional: Use SSH to connect to the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh core@<node_name>
----
