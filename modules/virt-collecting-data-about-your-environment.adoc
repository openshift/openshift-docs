Collecting data about your environment minimizes the time required to analyze and determine the root cause.

.Prerequisites

* Set the retention time for Prometheus metrics data to a minimum of seven days.
* Configure the Alertmanager to capture relevant alerts and to send them to a dedicated mailbox so that they can be viewed and persisted outside the cluster.
* Record the exact number of affected nodes and virtual machines.

.Procedure

. Collect `must-gather` data for the cluster by using the default `must-gather` image.
. Collect `must-gather` data for {rh-storage-first}, if necessary.
. Collect `must-gather` data for {VirtProductName} by using the {VirtProductName} `must-gather` image.
. Collect Prometheus metrics for the cluster.
