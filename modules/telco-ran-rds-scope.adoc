This document captures the set of released features and supported configurations that have been engineered and telco QE validated for the described use models.
The configurations provide a baseline {product-name} platform which meets the feature and KPI targets for the use-models.
Expected variations are noted in the configurations and further detailed in this specification.
The validation of this reference configuration includes many long duration and at-scale tests.

These configurations are updated on each major ("y-stream") release of {product-name}.
Patch ("z-stream") releases are periodically re-tested against this lineup, including many long duration validations.
