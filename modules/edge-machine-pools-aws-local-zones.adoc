= Edge compute pools and AWS Local Zones

Edge worker nodes are tainted worker nodes that run in AWS Local Zones locations.

When deploying a cluster that uses Local Zones:

* Amazon EC2 instances in the Local Zones are more expensive than Amazon EC2 instances in the Availability Zones
* Latency between applications and end users are lower in Local Zones, and it may vary by location. There is a latency impact for some workloads if, for example, routers are mixed between Local Zones and Availability Zones.
* The cluster-network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is adjusted automatically to the lower restricted by AWS when Local Zone subnets are detected on the `install-config.yaml`, according to the network plugin. For example, the adjusted values are 1200 for OVN-Kubernetes and 1250 for OpenShift SDN. If additional features are enabled, manual MTU adjustment can be necessary.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Generally, the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) between an Amazon EC2 instance in a Local Zone and an Amazon EC2 instance in the Region is 1300. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/local-zones/latest/ug/how-local-zones-work.html[How Local Zones work] in the AWS documentation. 
The cluster network MTU must be always less than the EC2 MTU to account for the overhead. The specific overhead is determined by the network plugin, for example:

- OVN-Kubernetes: `100 bytes`
- OpenShift SDN: `50 bytes`

The network plugin could provide additional features, like IPsec, that also must be decreased the MTU. Check the documentation for additional information.
