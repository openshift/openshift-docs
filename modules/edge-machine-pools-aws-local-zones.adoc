= Edge compute pools and {aws-service-name-full}

Edge worker nodes are tainted worker nodes that run in {aws-service-name-full} locations.

When deploying a cluster that uses {aws-service-name-short}, consider the following points:

* Amazon EC2 instances in the {aws-service-name-full} are more expensive than Amazon EC2 instances in the Availability Zones.
* Latency between applications and end users is lower in {aws-service-name-full}, and latency might vary by location.
  A latency impact exists for some workloads if, for example, ingress traffic is mixed between {aws-service-name-short}
  and Availability Zones.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Generally, the maximum transmission unit (MTU) between an Amazon EC2 instance in a {aws-service-name-short} and an Amazon EC2
instance in the Region is 1300. For more information,

in the AWS documentation. The cluster network MTU must be always less than the EC2 MTU to account for the overhead.
The specific overhead is determined by the network plugin, for example:

- OVN-Kubernetes: `100 bytes`
- OpenShift SDN: `50 bytes`

The network plugin can provide additional features, like IPsec, that also must be decreased the MTU.
For additional information, see the documentation.

{product-title} 4.12 introduced a new compute pool, _edge_, that is designed for use in remote zones. The edge compute pool
configuration is common between {aws-service-name-full} locations. Because of the type and size limitations of resources like EC2 and EBS
on {aws-service-name-single} resources, the default instance type can vary from the traditional worker pool.

The default Elastic Block Store (EBS) for {aws-service-name-single} locations is `gp2`, which differs from the regular worker pool. The instance
type used for each {aws-service-name-single} on edge compute pool also might differ from worker pools, depending on the instance offerings on the zone.

The edge compute pool creates new labels that developers can use to deploy applications onto {aws-service-name-full} nodes. The new labels are:

* `node-role.kubernetes.io/edge=''`
* `machine.openshift.io/zone-type=local-zone`
* `machine.openshift.io/zone-group=$ZONE_GROUP_NAME`

By default, the machine sets for the edge compute pool defines the taint of `NoSchedule` to prevent regular workloads from
spreading on {aws-service-name-single} instances. Users can only run user workloads if they define tolerations in the pod specification.
