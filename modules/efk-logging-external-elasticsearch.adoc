= Configuring the log collector to send logs to an external Elasticsearch instance

The log collector sends logs to the value of the `ES_HOST`, `ES_PORT`, `OPS_HOST`,
and `OPS_PORT` environment variables of the Elasticsearch deployment
configuration. The application logs are directed to the `ES_HOST` destination,
and operations logs to `OPS_HOST`. 

[NOTE]
====
Sending logs directly to an AWS Elasticsearch instance is not supported. Use
Fluentd Secure Forward to direct logs to
an instance of Fluentd that you control and that is configured with the
`fluent-plugin-aws-elasticsearch-service` plug-in.
====

.Prerequisite

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

* Set cluster logging to the unmanaged state.

.Procedure

To direct logs to a specific Elasticsearch instance: 

. Edit the `fluentd` or `rsyslog` DaemonSet in the *openshift-logging* project:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ oc edit ds/fluentd

spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
          env:
          - name: ES_HOST
            value: elasticsearch
          - name: ES_PORT
            value: '9200'
          - name: ES_CLIENT_CERT
            value: /etc/fluent/keys/app-cert
          - name: ES_CLIENT_KEY
            value: /etc/fluent/keys/app-key
          - name: ES_CA
            value: /etc/fluent/keys/app-ca
          - name: OPS_HOST
            value: elasticsearch
          - name: OPS_PORT
            value: '9200'
          - name: OPS_CLIENT_CERT
            value: /etc/fluent/keys/infra-cert
          - name: OPS_CLIENT_KEY
            value: /etc/fluent/keys/infra-key
          - name: OPS_CA
            value: /etc/fluent/keys/infra-ca
----

. Set `ES_HOST` and `OPS_HOST` to the same destination,
while ensuring that `ES_PORT` and `OPS_PORT` also have the same value 
for an external Elasticsearch instance to contain both application and
operations logs. 

. Configure your externally-hosted Elasticsearch instance for TLS. Only externally-hosted Elasticsearch instances that use Mutual TLS are allowed.

====
If you are not using the provided Kibana and Elasticsearch images, you will not
have the same multi-tenant capabilities and your data will not be restricted by
user access to a particular project.
