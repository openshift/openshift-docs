[id="rosa-sdpolicy-platform_{context}"]
= Platform

This section provides information about the service definition for the {product-title} (ROSA) platform.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-backup-policy_{context}"]
== Cluster backup policy

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is critical that customers have a backup plan for their applications and application data.
====

Application and application data backups are not a part of the {product-title} service.
All Kubernetes objects and persistent volumes (PVs) in each {product-title} cluster are backed up to facilitate a prompt recovery in the unlikely event that a cluster becomes irreparably inoperable.

The backups are stored in a secure object storage, or multiple availability zone, bucket in the same account as the cluster.
Node root volumes are not backed up, as Red Hat CoreOS is fully managed by the {product-title} cluster and no stateful data should be stored on a node's root volume.

The following table shows the frequency of backups:
[cols="4",options="header"]
|===

|Component
|Snapshot frequency
|Retention
|Notes

|Full object store backup, all cluster PVs
|Daily at 0100 UTC
|7 days
|This is a full backup of all Kubernetes objects, as well as all mounted PVs in the cluster.

|Full object store backup, all cluster PVs
|Weekly on Mondays at 0200 UTC
|30 days
|This is a full backup of all Kubernetes objects, as well as all mounted PVs in the cluster.

|Full object store backup
|Hourly at 17 minutes past the hour
|24 hours
|This is a full backup of all Kubernetes objects. No PVs are backed up in this backup schedule.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-autoscaling_{context}"]
== Autoscaling
Node autoscaling is available on {product-title}.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-daemonsets_{context}"]
== Daemonsets
Customers can create and run daemonsets on {product-title}. To restrict daemonsets to only running on worker nodes, use the following `nodeSelector`:
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    role: worker
...
----

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-multiple-availability-zone_{context}"]
== Multiple availability zone
In a multiple availability zone cluster, control plane nodes are distributed across availability zones and at least one worker node is required in each availability zone.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-node-labels_{context}"]
== Node labels
Custom node labels are created by Red Hat during node creation and cannot be changed on {product-title} clusters at this time. However, custom labels are supported when creating new machine pools.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-openshift-version_{context}"]
== OpenShift version
{product-title} is run as a service and is kept up to date with the latest OpenShift Container Platform version. Upgrade scheduling to the latest version is available.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-upgrades_{context}"]
== Upgrades
Upgrades can be scheduled using the `rosa` CLI utility or through OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM).

See the link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_policy/rosa-life-cycle.html[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information on the upgrade policy and procedures.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-window-containers_{context}"]
== Windows Containers
Windows Containers are not available on {product-title} at this time.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-container-engine_{context}"]
== Container engine
{product-title} runs on OpenShift 4 and uses link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-openshift-container-platform-4-now-defaults-cri-o-underlying-container-engine[CRI-O] as the only available container engine.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-operating-system_{context}"]
== Operating system
{product-title} runs on OpenShift 4 and uses Red Hat CoreOS as the operating system for all control plane and worker nodes.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-kubernetes-operator_{context}"]
== Kubernetes Operator support
All Operators listed in the Operator Hub marketplace should be available for installation. These operators are considered customer workloads, and are not monitored by Red Hat SRE.
