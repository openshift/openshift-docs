== Cluster backup policy

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is critical that customers have a backup plan for their applications and application data.
ifndef::rosa-with-hcp[]
The table below only applies to clusters created with IAM user credentials.
endif::rosa-with-hcp[]
====

Application and application data backups are not a part of the
ifdef::rosa-with-hcp[]
{hcp-title-first} service.
endif::rosa-with-hcp[]
ifndef::rosa-with-hcp[]
{product-title} service.
The following table outlines the cluster backup policy.

//Verify if the corresponding tables in policy-incident.adoc and rosa-policy-incident.adoc also need to be updated.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-autoscaling_{context}"]
== Autoscaling
Node autoscaling is available on
ifdef::rosa-with-hcp[]
{hcp-title-first}.
endif::rosa-with-hcp[]
ifndef::rosa-with-hcp[]
{product-title}.
endif::rosa-with-hcp[]
You can configure the autoscaler option to automatically scale the number of machines in a cluster.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-daemonsets_{context}"]
== Daemonsets
Customers can create and run daemonsets on
ifdef::rosa-with-hcp[]
{hcp-title-first}.
endif::rosa-with-hcp[]
ifndef::rosa-with-hcp[]
{product-title}. To restrict daemonsets to only running on worker nodes, use the following `nodeSelector`:

----
...
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    role: worker
...

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-multiple-availability-zone_{context}"]
== Multiple availability zone

ifdef::rosa-with-hcp[]
Control plane components are always deployed across multiple availability zones, regardless of a customer's worker node configuration.
endif::rosa-with-hcp[]
ifndef::rosa-with-hcp[]
In a multiple availability zone cluster, control plane nodes are distributed across availability zones and at least one worker node is required in each availability zone.
endif::rosa-with-hcp[]

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-node-labels_{context}"]
== Node labels
Custom node labels are created by Red Hat during node creation and cannot be changed on
ifdef::rosa-with-hcp[]
{hcp-title-first}
endif::rosa-with-hcp[]
ifndef::rosa-with-hcp[]
{product-title}
endif::rosa-with-hcp[]

endif::rosa-with-hcp[]
is run as a service and is kept up to date with the latest OpenShift Container Platform version. Upgrade scheduling to the latest version is available.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-upgrades_{context}"]
== Upgrades
Upgrades can be scheduled using the ROSA CLI, `rosa`, or through {cluster-manager}.

See the link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_policy/rosa-life-cycle.html[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information on the upgrade policy and procedures.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-window-containers_{context}"]

ifdef::rosa-with-hcp[]
{hcp-title-first}

runs on OpenShift 4 and uses link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-openshift-container-platform-4-now-defaults-cri-o-underlying-container-engine[CRI-O] as the only available container engine.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-operating-system_{context}"]
== Operating system
ifdef::rosa-with-hcp[]
{hcp-title-first}
endif::rosa-with-hcp[]
ifndef::rosa-with-hcp[]
{product-title}
endif::rosa-with-hcp[]
runs on OpenShift 4 and uses Red Hat CoreOS as the operating system for all control plane and worker nodes.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-red-hat-operator_{context}"]
== Red Hat Operator support
Red Hat workloads typically refer to Red Hat-provided Operators made available through Operator Hub. Red Hat workloads are not managed by the Red Hat SRE team, and must be deployed on worker nodes. These Operators may require additional Red Hat subscriptions, and may incur additional cloud infrastructure costs. Examples of these Red Hat-provided Operators are:

* {rhq-short}
* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management
* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security
* {SMProductName}
* {ServerlessProductName}
* {logging-sd}
* {pipelines-title}

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-kubernetes-operator_{context}"]
== Kubernetes Operator support
All Operators listed in the OperatorHub marketplace should be available for installation. These Operators are considered customer workloads, and are not monitored by Red Hat SRE.
