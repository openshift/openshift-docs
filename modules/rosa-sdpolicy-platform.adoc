[id="rosa-sdpolicy-platform_{context}"]
= Platform
:productwinc: Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift support for Windows Containers

This section provides information about the service definition for the
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{hcp-title-first} platform.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{product-title} (ROSA) platform.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-autoscaling_{context}"]
== Autoscaling
Node autoscaling is available on
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{hcp-title}.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{product-title}.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
You can configure the autoscaler option to automatically scale the number of machines in a cluster.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-daemonsets_{context}"]
== Daemonsets

Customers can create and run daemonsets on
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{hcp-title}.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{product-title}.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
To restrict daemonsets to only running on worker nodes, use the following `nodeSelector`:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    role: worker
----

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-multiple-availability-zone_{context}"]
== Multiple availability zone

ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
Control plane components are always deployed across multiple availability zones, regardless of a customer's worker node configuration.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
In a multiple availability zone cluster, control plane nodes are distributed across availability zones and at least one worker node is required in each availability zone.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-node-labels_{context}"]
== Node labels
Custom node labels are created by Red{nbsp}Hat during node creation and cannot be changed on
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{hcp-title}
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{product-title}
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
clusters at this time. However, custom labels are supported when creating new machine pools.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-backup-policy_{context}"]
== Cluster backup policy

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat does not provide a backup method for
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ROSA clusters that use STS.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{hcp-title} clusters.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
It is critical that customers have a backup plan for their applications and application data.
====

Application and application data backups are not a part of the
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{hcp-title} service.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{product-title} service.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-openshift-version_{context}"]
== OpenShift version

{hcp-title}

ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{product-title}
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
is run as a service and is kept up to date with the latest OpenShift Container Platform version. Upgrade scheduling to the latest version is available.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-upgrades_{context}"]
== Upgrades
Upgrades can be scheduled using the ROSA CLI, `rosa`, or through {cluster-manager}.

See the link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_policy/rosa-life-cycle.html[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information on the upgrade policy and procedures.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-window-containers_{context}"]
== Windows Containers
{productwinc} is not available on {product-title} at this time.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-container-engine_{context}"]
== Container engine
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{hcp-title}
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{product-title}
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
runs on OpenShift 4 and uses link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-openshift-container-platform-4-now-defaults-cri-o-underlying-container-engine[CRI-O] as the only available container engine.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-operating-system_{context}"]
== Operating system
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{hcp-title}
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{product-title}
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
runs on OpenShift 4 and uses Red{nbsp}Hat CoreOS as the operating system for all control plane and worker nodes.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-red-hat-operator_{context}"]
== Red{nbsp}Hat Operator support
Red{nbsp}Hat workloads typically refer to Red{nbsp}Hat-provided Operators made available through Operator Hub. Red{nbsp}Hat workloads are not managed by the Red{nbsp}Hat SRE team, and must be deployed on worker nodes. These Operators may require additional Red{nbsp}Hat subscriptions, and may incur additional cloud infrastructure costs. Examples of these Red{nbsp}Hat-provided Operators are:

* {rhq-short}
* Red{nbsp}Hat Advanced Cluster Management
* Red{nbsp}Hat Advanced Cluster Security
* {SMProductName}
* {ServerlessProductName}
* {logging-sd}
* {pipelines-title}

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-kubernetes-operator_{context}"]
== Kubernetes Operator support
All Operators listed in the OperatorHub marketplace should be available for installation. These Operators are considered customer workloads, and are not monitored by Red{nbsp}Hat SRE.
