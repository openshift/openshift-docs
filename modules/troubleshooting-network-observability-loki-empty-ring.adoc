= Loki empty ring error

The Loki "empty ring" error results in flows not being stored in Loki and not showing up in the web console. This error might happen in various situations. A single workaround to address them all does not exist. There are some actions you can take to investigate the logs in your Loki pods, and verify that the `LokiStack` is healthy and ready. 

Some of the situations where this error is observed are as follows:

* After a `LokiStack` is uninstalled and reinstalled in the same namespace, old PVCs are not removed, which can cause this error. 
** *Action*: You can try removing the `LokiStack` again, removing the PVC, then reinstalling the `LokiStack`.
* After a certificate rotation, this error can prevent communication with the `flowlogs-pipeline` and `console-plugin` pods. 
** *Action*: You can restart the pods to restore the connectivity.
