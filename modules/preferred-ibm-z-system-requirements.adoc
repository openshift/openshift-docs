== Hardware requirements

* Three LPARS that each have the equivalent of six IFLs, which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* Two network connections to both connect to the `LoadBalancer` service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.
ifdef::ibm-z[]
* HiperSockets that are attached to a node either directly as a device or by bridging with one z/VM VSWITCH to be transparent to the z/VM guest. To directly connect HiperSockets to a node, you must set up a gateway to the external network via a {op-system-base} 8 guest to bridge to the HiperSockets network.

== Operating system requirements

ifdef::ibm-z[]
* Two or three instances of z/VM 7.2 or later for high availability

On your z/VM instances, set up:

* Three guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines, one per z/VM instance.
* At least six guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines, distributed across the z/VM instances.
* One guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine.
* To ensure the availability of integral components in an overcommitted environment, increase the priority of the control plane by using the CP command `SET SHARE`. Do the same for infrastructure nodes, if they exist. See link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zvm/latest?topic=commands-set-share[SET SHARE] in {ibm-name} Documentation.
endif::ibm-z[]
ifdef::ibm-z-lpar[]
* Three LPARs for {product-title} control plane machines.
* At least six LPARs for {product-title} compute machines.
* One machine or LPAR for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine.
endif::ibm-z-lpar[]

== {ibm-z-title} network connectivity requirements

ifdef::ibm-z[]
To install on {ibm-z-name} under z/VM, you require a single z/VM virtual NIC in layer 2 mode. You also need:

* A direct-attached OSA or RoCE network adapter
* A z/VM VSwitch set up. For a preferred setup, use OSA link aggregation.
endif::ibm-z[]
ifdef::ibm-z-lpar[]
To install on {ibm-z-name} in an LPAR, you need:

* A direct-attached OSA or RoCE network adapter
* For a preferred setup, use OSA link aggregation.

=== Disk storage
// We might need two headings:
// === Disk storage for the z/VM guest virtual machines
// === Disk storage for the LPARs

ifdef::ibm-z[]
* FICON attached disk storage (DASDs). These can be z/VM minidisks, fullpack minidisks, or dedicated DASDs, all of which must be formatted as CDL, which is the default. To reach the minimum required DASD size for {op-system-first} installations, you need extended address volumes (EAV). If available, use HyperPAV to ensure optimal performance.
* FCP attached disk storage
endif::ibm-z[]

=== Storage / Main Memory

* 16 GB for {product-title} control plane machines
* 8 GB for {product-title} compute machines
* 16 GB for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine
