= Configuring metrics collection for SPIRE Agent by using a Service Monitor

The SPIRE Agent operand exposes metrics by default on port `9402` at the `/metrics` endpoint. You can configure metrics collection for the SPIRE Agent by creating a `ServiceMonitor` custom resource (CR), which enables the Prometheus Operator to collect custom metrics.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.

* You have installed the {zero-trust-full}.

* You have deployed the SPIRE Agent operand in the cluster.

* You have enabled the user workload monitoring.

.Procedure

. Create the `ServiceMonitor` CR:

.. Create the YAML file that defines the `ServiceMonitor` CR:
+
.Example `servicemonitor-spire-agent.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: agent
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: spire
  name: spire-agent-metrics
  namespace: zero-trust-workload-identity-manager
spec:
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    interval: 30s
    path: /metrics
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: agent
      app.kubernetes.io/instance: spire
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
    - zero-trust-workload-identity-manager
----

.. Create the `ServiceMonitor` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f servicemonitor-spire-agent.yaml
----
+
After the `ServiceMonitor` CR is created, the user workload Prometheus instance begins metrics collection from the SPIRE Agent. The collected metrics are labeled with `job="spire-agent"`.

.Verification

. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Observe* → *Targets*.


. In the *Label* filter field, enter the following label to filter the metrics targets:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ service=spire-agent
----

. Confirm that the *Status* column shows `Up` for the `spire-agent-metrics` entry.
