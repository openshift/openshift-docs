= Analyze images and deployments without observed CVEs

When you select *Images without vulnerabilities*, the *Workload CVEs* page shows the images that meet at least one of the following conditions:

** Images that do not have CVEs
** Images that report a scanner error that may result in a false negative of no CVEs

[NOTE]
====
An image that actually contains vulnerabilities can appear in this list inadvertently. For example, if Scanner was able to scan the image and it is known to {rh-rhacs-first}, but the scan was not successfully completed, {product-title-short} cannot detect vulnerabilities. 

This scenario occurs if an image has an operating system that {product-title-short} Scanner does not support. {product-title-short} displays scan errors when you hover over an image in the image list or click the image name for more information.
