= Analyze images and deployments without observed CVEs

When you view the list of images without vulnerabilities, {product-title-short} shows the images that meet at least one of the following conditions:

** Images that do not have CVEs
** Images that report a scanner error that may result in a false negative of no CVEs

[NOTE]
====
An image that actually contains vulnerabilities can appear in this list inadvertently. For example, if Scanner was able to scan the image and it is known to {rh-rhacs-first}, but the scan was not successfully completed, {product-title-short} cannot detect vulnerabilities.

This scenario occurs if an image has an operating system that {product-title-short} Scanner does not support. {product-title-short} displays scan errors when you hover over an image in the image list or click the image name for more information.
====

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Vulnerability Management* -> *Results*.
. Click *More Views* and select *Images without CVEs*.
. To filter the list of results by entity, for example, to search for a specific image, select the appropriate filters and attributes.
+
To select multiple entities and attributes, click the right arrow icon to add another criteria. Depending on your choices, enter the appropriate information such as text, or select a date or object.
+
The filter entities and attributes are listed in the following table.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Filtered view* icon indicates that the displayed results were filtered based on the criteria that you selected. You can click *Clear filters* to remove all filters, or remove individual filters by clicking on them.
