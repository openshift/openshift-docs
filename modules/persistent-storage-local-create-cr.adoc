= Provisioning local volumes by using the Local Storage Operator

Local volumes cannot be created by dynamic provisioning. Instead, persistent volumes can be created by the Local Storage Operator. The local volume provisioner looks for any file system or block volume devices at the paths specified in the defined resource.

.Prerequisites

* The Local Storage Operator is installed.
* Local disks are attached to the {product-title} nodes.

.Procedure

. Create the local volume resource. This must define the nodes
and paths to the local volumes.

[NOTE]
====
Do not use different storage class names for the same device. Doing so will create multiple persistent volumes (PV)s.

<1> The namespace where the Local Storage Operator is installed.
<2> Optional: A node selector containing a list of nodes where the local storage volumes are attached. This
example uses the node host names, obtained from `oc get node`. If a value is not
defined, then the Local Storage Operator will attempt to find matching disks
on all available nodes.
<3> The volume mode, either `Filesystem` or `Block`, defining the type of the
local volumes.
<4> The file system that is created when the local volume is mounted for the
first time.
<5> The path containing a list of local storage devices to choose from.
<6> Replace this value with your actual local disks filepath to the LocalVolume resource, such as `/dev/xvdg`. PVs are created for these local disks when the provisioner is deployed successfully.

[NOTE]
====
A raw block volume (`volumeMode: block`) is not formatted with a file system. You should use this mode only if any application running on the pod can use raw block devices.

. Create the local volume resource in your {product-title} cluster, specifying
the file you just created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <local-volume>.yaml
----

. Verify that the provisioner was created, and that the corresponding daemon sets were created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get all -n openshift-local-storage

count is `0`, it indicates that the label selectors were invalid.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Editing the `LocalVolume` object does not change the `fsType` or `volumeMode` of existing persistent volumes because doing so might result in a destructive operation.
