= Provision the local volumes

Local volumes cannot be created by dynamic provisioning. Instead,
PersistentVolumes must be created by the Local Storage Operator. This
provisioner will look for any devices, both filesystem and block volumes,
at the paths specified in defined resource.

.Prerequisites

* The Local Storage Operator is installed.
* Local disks are attached to the {product-title} nodes.

.Procedure

. Create the local volume resource. This must define the nodes
and paths to the local volumes.

[NOTE]
====
Do not use different StorageClass names for the same device. Doing so will create multiple PVs.

. Create the local volume resource in your {product-title} cluster, specifying
the file you just created:

----
$ oc create -f <local-volume>.yaml

. Verify the provisioner was created, and the corresponding DaemonSets were
created:

$ oc get all -n local-storage

Note the desired and current number of DaemonSet processes. If the desired
count is `0`, it indicates the label selectors were invalid.

. Verify that the PersistentVolumes were created:
