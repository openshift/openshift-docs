= Ingress network flow analysis with the `commatrix` plugin

The `commatrix` plugin for the `oc` command generates ingress network flow data from your cluster. You can also use the plugin to identify any differences between open ports on the host and expected ingress flows for your environment.

The plugin generates ingress flows to {product-title} services for the following environments:

* {product-title} on bare metal
* {sno-caps} with other platforms
* {product-title} on {aws-first}
* {sno-caps} on {aws-short}

The plugin outputs the network flow data in various formats, such as CSV or JSON.
