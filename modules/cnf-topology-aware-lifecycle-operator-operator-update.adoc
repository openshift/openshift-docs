[id="talo-operator-update_{context}"]
= Performing an Operator update

.Prerequisites

* Install the Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator.
* Provision one or more managed clusters.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Create {rh-rhacm} policies in the Hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Create or update a Policy which updates a Subscription channel to the desired release version. This can be done by manually creating the Policy CR or using automated flows such as generation from `PolicyGenTemplate` CRD.
//Sample CR needed

. Save the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the desired Operator update policies to the `cgu-operator-update.yaml` file.
// Disabled sample CR is needed with image precacing that updates Operators only

. Start the update process by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --namespace=default patch clustergroupupgrade.ran.openshift.io/<name> \
--type merge -p '{"spec":{"enable":true}}'
----

. Check the status of the policies by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies --all-namespaces
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
After a cluster update performed by TALO is complete, the cluster will not be updated again under the control of the same `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. You need to create a new `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR in the following cases:

* You want to update the cluster again
* The cluster changes to non-compliant with the `inform` policy after being updated
