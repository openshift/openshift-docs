= Failing to see network flows from both `br-int` and `br-ex` interfaces

br-ex` and `br-int` are virtual bridge devices operated at OSI layer 2. The eBPF agent works at the IP and TCP levels, layers 3 and 4 respectively. You can expect that the eBPF agent captures the network traffic passing through `br-ex` and `br-int`, when the network traffic is processed by other interfaces such as physical host or virtual pod interfaces. If you restrict the eBPF agent network interfaces to attach only to `br-ex` and `br-int`, you do not see any network flow.

Manually remove the part in the `interfaces` or `excludeInterfaces` that restricts the network interfaces to `br-int` and `br-ex`.

.Procedure

. Remove the `interfaces: [ 'br-int', 'br-ex' ]` field. This allows the agent to fetch information from all the interfaces. Alternatively, you can specify the Layer-3 interface for example, `eth0`. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]

$ oc edit -n netobserv flowcollector.yaml -o yaml
