= Buildpacks

The `buildpacks` cluster build strategy uses Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNB) to build and push a container image from source code, without requiring a `Dockerfile`. The configuration details are provided through parameters in the `Build` resource.

The `buildpacks-extender` cluster build strategy supports the image extension feature of CNB, in addition to all the capabilities offered by the `buildpacks` strategy. The `buildpacks-extender` allows you to modify the builder or run image using a `Dockerfile`. This is useful for installing system dependencies or applying security configurations that standard Buildpacks cannot handle. The `Dockerfile` is provided by a Buildpack that supports extensions. To use the extender, set the `cnb-extender-kind` parameter in the `Build` resource.

[NOTE]
====
The `buildpacks` cluster build strategy supports Quarkus and Go-based applications, while the `buildpacks-extender` cluster build strategy supports Node.js and Python-based applications.
