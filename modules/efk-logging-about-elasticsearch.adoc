= About Elasticsearch in {product-title} 

{product-title} uses link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch (ES)] to organize the log data from Fleutnd into datastores, or _indices_. 

Elasticsearch subdivides each index into multiple pieces called _shards_, which it spreads across a set of Elasticsearch nodes in your cluster.
You can configure Elasticsearch to make copies of the shards, called _replicas_. Elasticsearch also spreads these replicas across
the Elactisearch nodes.  The combination of shards and replicas is intended to
provide redundancy and resilience to failure. For example, if you configure three shards for an index with one replica,
Elasticsearch generates a total of six shards for that index: three primary shards and three replicas as a backup.

The {product-title} logging installer ensures each Elasticsearch node is deployed using a unique deployment configuration that includes its own storage volume.
During installation, you can use the `openshift_logging_es_cluster_size` Ansible variable to specify the number of Elasticsearch nodes.
You can scale Elasticsearch by creating an additional deployment configuration for each Elasticsearch node you add to the logging system.
Or, you can scale up your existing cluster by modifying the
`openshift_logging_es_cluster_size` in the inventory file and re-running the
logging playbook. Additional clustering parameters can be modified and are
described in *Specifying Logging Ansible Variables*.

documentation] for considerations involved in choosing storage and
network location as directed below.

[NOTE]
====
A highly-available Elasticsearch environment requires at least three Elasticsearch nodes,
each on a different host, and setting the `openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas` Ansible variable
to a value of `1` or higher to create replicas.
