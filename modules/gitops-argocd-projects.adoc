= Argo CD projects

[role="_abstract"]
Argo CD projects, not to be confused with {OCP} projects, provide a way to group applications together. With Argo CD projects, you can specify restrictions on Applications concerning what resources can be deployed and where they can be deployed. Additionally, you can enable Argo CD role-based access control (RBAC) rules and permissions by defining them more granularly at the project level versus the global level in the Argo CD custom resource (CR).

While you can define tenant RBAC globally in the Operator’s Argo CD CR, you should define tenant RBAC along with restrictions in the `AppProject` CR.

If you have a large number of tenants, attempting to manage all tenants with global RBAC might lead to a lot of repetition. 

If you have many instances of tenants, some of the project configurations might be common across tenant projects. To reduce duplication and minimize maintenance, use global projects for common configuration and inherit them in tenant projects.

[NOTE]
====
Always define your projects and never use the default project created with an Argo CD installation by the Operator.
