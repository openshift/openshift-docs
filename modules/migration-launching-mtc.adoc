= Launching the {mtc-short} web console

You can launch the {mtc-short} web console that is installed on the target cluster.

.Procedure

. Log in to the target cluster.
. Obtain the {mtc-short} web console URL:
+
----
$ oc get -n openshift-migration route/migration -o go-template='(?i}//{{ .spec.host }}(:|\z){{ println }}' | sed 's,\.,\\.,g'
----

. Launch a browser and navigate to the {mtc-short} web console.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you try to access the {mtc-short} web console immediately after installing the {mtc-operator}, the console may not load because the Operator is still configuring the cluster. Wait a few minutes and retry.
====

. If you are using self-signed CA certificates, you will be prompted to accept the CA certificate of the source cluster's API server. The web page will guide you through the process of accepting the remaining certificates.

. Log in with your {product-title} *username* and *password*.
