= Creating a project using the Developer perspective in the web console

You can use the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console to create a project in your namespace.

[NOTE]
====
Projects starting with `openshift-` and `kube` host cluster components that run as Pods and other infrastructure components. As such, {product-title} does not allow you to create Projects starting with `openshift-` or `kube-` using the CLI. Cluster administrators can create these Projects using the `oc adm new-project` command.
