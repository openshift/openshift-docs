= Creating a project using the Developer perspective in the web console

You can use the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console to create a project in your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Projects starting with `openshift-` and `kube-` are considered critical by {product-title}. As such, {product-title} does not allow you to create projects starting with `openshift-` or `kube-` using the *Developer* perspective.
ifndef::openshift-dedicated[]
Cluster administrators can create these projects using the `oc adm new-project` command.
endif::openshift-dedicated[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
For {product-title} clusters that use the Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model, users with `cluster-admin` privileges can create these projects using the `oc adm new-project` command.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot assign an SCC to pods created in one of the default namespaces: `default`, `kube-system`, `kube-public`, `openshift-node`, `openshift-infra`, and `openshift`. You cannot use these namespaces for running pods or services.

In {product-title} clusters that use the Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model, you cannot assign an SCC to pods created in one of the default namespaces: `default`, `kube-system`, `kube-public`, `openshift-node`, `openshift-infra`, and `openshift`. You cannot use these namespaces for running pods or services. You cannot create any SCCs for {product-title} clusters that use a Red Hat cloud account, because SCC resource creation requires `cluster-admin` privileges.
