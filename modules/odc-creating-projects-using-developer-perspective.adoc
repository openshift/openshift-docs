= Creating a project using the Developer perspective in the web console

You can use the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console to create a project in your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Projects starting with `openshift-` and `kube-` are considered critical by {product-title}. As such, {product-title} does not allow you to create projects starting with `openshift-` or `kube-` using the *Developer* perspective. Cluster administrators can create these projects using the `oc adm new-project` command.
====
