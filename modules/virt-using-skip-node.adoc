= Using skip-node annotation

[role="_abstract"]
If you want the `node-labeller` to skip a node, annotate that node by using the {oc-first}.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

* Annotate the node that you want to skip by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate node <node_name> node-labeller.kubevirt.io/skip-node=true
----
+
Replace `<node_name>` with the name of the relevant node to skip.
+
Reconciliation resumes on the next cycle after the node annotation is removed or set to false.
