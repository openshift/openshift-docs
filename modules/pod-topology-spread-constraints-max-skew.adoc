= Understanding skew and maxSkew

Skew refers to the difference in the number of pods that match a specified label selector across different topology domains, such as zones or nodes.

The skew is calculated for each domain by taking the absolute difference between the number of pods in that domain and the number of pods in the domain with the lowest amount of pods scheduled. Setting a `maxSkew` value guides the scheduler to maintain a balanced pod distribution.

== Example skew calculation

You have three zones (A, B, and C), and you want to distribute your pods evenly across these zones. If zone A has 5 pods, zone B has 3 pods, and zone C has 2 pods, to find the skew, you can subtract the number of pods in the domain with the lowest amount of pods scheduled from the number of pods currently in each zone. This means that the skew for zone A is 3, the skew for zone B is 1, and the skew for zone C is 0.

== The maxSkew parameter

The `maxSkew` parameter defines the maximum allowable difference, or skew, in the number of pods between any two topology domains. If `maxSkew` is set to `1`, the number of pods in any topology domain should not differ by more than 1 from any other domain. If the skew exceeds `maxSkew`, the scheduler attempts to place new pods in a way that reduces the skew, adhering to the constraints.

Using the previous example skew calculation, the skew values exceed the default `maxSkew` value of `1`. The scheduler places new pods in zone B and zone C to reduce the skew and achieve a more balanced distribution, ensuring that no topology domain exceeds the skew of 1.
