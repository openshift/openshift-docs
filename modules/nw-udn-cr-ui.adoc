= Creating a UserDefinedNetwork CR by using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
To implement isolated network segments with layer 2 connectivity in {product-title}, create a `UserDefinedNetwork` custom resource (CR) by using the web console. Defining this resource ensures that your cluster workloads can communicate directly at the data link layer.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, creation of a `UserDefinedNetwork` CR with a `Layer3` topology or a `Secondary` role are not supported when using the {product-title} web console.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have created a namespace and applied the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label.

.Procedure

. From the *Administrator* perspective, click *Networking* -> *UserDefinedNetworks*.

. Click *Create UserDefinedNetwork*.

. From the *Project name* list, select the namespace that you previously created.

. Specify a value in the *Subnet* field.

. Click *Create*. The user-defined network serves as the default primary network for pods that you create in this namespace.
