.Prerequisites

* You have created a namespace and applied the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label.

.Procedure

. From the *Administrator* perspective, click *Networking* -> *UserDefinedNetworks*.

. Click *Create UserDefinedNetwork*.

. From the *Project name* list, select the namespace that you previously created.

. Specify a value in the *Subnet* field.
