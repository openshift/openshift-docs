= Before installing {microshift-short} from an RPM package

Preparation of the host machine is recommended prior to installing {microshift-short} for memory configuration and FIPS compliance.

[id="microshift-configuring-volume-groups_{context}"]
== Configuring volume groups

{microshift-short} uses the logical volume manager storage (LVMS) Container Storage Interface (CSI) plugin for providing storage to persistent volumes (PVs). LVMS relies on the Linux logical volume manager (LVM) to dynamically manage the backing logical volumes (LVs) for PVs. For this reason, your machine must have an LVM volume group (VG) with unused space in which LVMS can create the LVs for your workload's PVs.

To configure a volume group (VG) that allows LVMS to create the LVs for your workload's PVs, lower the *Desired Size* of your root volume during the installation of {op-system}. Lowering the size of your root volume allows unallocated space on the disk for additional LVs created by LVMS at runtime.

[id="microshift-running-containers-fips-mode_{context}"]
== Running {microshift-short} in FIPS-compliant mode

If your use case requires running {microshift-short} containers in FIPS mode, you must install {op-system-base} with FIPS enabled. After the worker machine is configured to run in FIPS mode, your {microshift-short} containers are automatically configured to also run in FIPS mode. See "Running {microshift-short} containers in FIPS mode" in the "Additional resources" of this section.
