= Before installing {product-title} from an RPM package

{product-title} uses the logical volume manager storage (LVMS) Container Storage Interface (CSI) plugin for providing storage to persistent volumes (PVs). LVMS relies on the Linux logical volume manager (LVM) to dynamically manage the backing logical volumes (LVs) for PVs. For this reason, your machine must have an LVM volume group (VG) with unused space in which LVMS can create the LVs for your workload's PVs.

To configure a volume group (VG) that allows LVMS to create the LVs for your workload's PVs, lower the *Desired Size* of your root volume during the installation of {op-system}. Lowering the size of your root volume allows unallocated space on the disk for additional LVs created by LVMS at runtime.
