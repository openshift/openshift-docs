= Triggers

Use Triggers in conjunction with Pipelines to create a full-fledged CI/CD system where the Kubernetes resources define the entire CI/CD execution. Pipeline Triggers capture the external events and process them to extract key pieces of information. Mapping this event data to a set of predefined parameters triggers a series of tasks that can then create and deploy Kubernetes resources.

For example, you define a CI/CD workflow using {pipelines-title} for your application. The PipelineRun must start for any new changes to take effect in the application repository. Triggers automate this process by capturing and processing any change events and by triggering a PipelineRun that deploys the new image with the latest changes.

Triggers consist of the following main components that work together to form a reusable, decoupled, and self-sustaining CI/CD system:

* _EventListeners_ provide endpoints, or an event sink, that listen for incoming HTTP-based events with a JSON payload. The EventListener performs lightweight event processing on the payload using Event Interceptors, which identify the type of payload and optionally modify it. Currently, Pipeline Triggers support four types of Interceptors: Webhook Interceptors, GitHub Interceptors, GitLab Interceptors, and Common Expression Language (CEL) Interceptors.
* _TriggerBindings_ extract the fields from an event payload and store them as parameters.
* _TriggerTemplates_ specify how to use the parameterized data from the TriggerBindings. A TriggerTemplate defines a resource template that receives input from the TriggerBindings, and then performs a series of actions that result in creation of new PipelineResources and initiation of a new PipelineRun.

EventListeners tie the concepts of TriggerBindings and TriggerTemplates together. The EventListener listens for the incoming event, handles basic filtering using Interceptors, extracts data using TriggerBindings, and then processes this data to create Kubernetes resources using TriggerTemplates.

The following example shows a code snippet of the `vote-app-binding` TriggerBinding, which extracts the Git repository information from the received event payload:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1 <1>
kind: TriggerBinding <2>
metadata:
  name: vote-app <3>
spec:
  params: <4>
  - name: git-repo-url
    value: $(body.repository.url)
  - name: git-repo-name
    value: $(body.repository.name)
  - name: git-revision
    value: $(body.head_commit.id)
----

<1> TriggerBinding API version `v1alpha1`.
<2> Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, `TriggerBinding`.
<3> Unique name to identify this TriggerBinding.
<4> List of parameters which will be extracted from the received event payload and passed to the TriggerTemplate. In this example, the Git repository URL, name, and revision are extracted from the body of the event payload.


The following example shows a code snippet of a `vote-app-template` TriggerTemplate, which creates Pipeline Resources from the Git repository information received from the TriggerBinding:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1 <1>
kind: TriggerTemplate <2>
metadata:
  name: vote-app <3>
spec:
  params: <4>

    description: The git repository url
  - name: git-revision
    description: The git revision
    default: master
  - name: git-repo-name
    description: The name of the deployment to be created / patched

----

<1> TriggerTemplate API version `v1alpha1`.
<2> Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, `TriggerTemplate`.
<3> Unique name to identify this TriggerTemplate.
<4> Parameters supplied by the TriggerBinding or EventListerner.
<5> List of Resource templates created for the Pipeline from the parameters received in the TriggerBinding or EventListener.


The following example shows an EventListener which uses `vote-app-binding` TriggerBinding and `vote-app-template` TriggerTemplate to process incoming events.

  triggers:
  - bindings: <5>
    - ref: vote-app
    template: <6>
      name: vote-app
----
<1> EventListener API version `v1alpha1`.
<2> Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, `EventListener`.
<3> Unique name to identify this EventListener.
<4> Service account name to be used.
<5> Name of the TriggerBinding to be used for this EventListener.
<6> Name of the Triggertemplate to be used for this Eventlistener.
