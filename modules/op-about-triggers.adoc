= Triggers

Use _Triggers_ in conjunction with pipelines to create a full-fledged CI/CD system where Kubernetes resources define the entire CI/CD execution. Triggers capture the external events, such as a Git pull request, and process them to extract key pieces of information. Mapping this event data to a set of predefined parameters triggers a series of tasks that can then create and deploy Kubernetes resources and instantiate the pipeline.

For example, you define a CI/CD workflow using {pipelines-title} for your application. The pipeline must start for any new changes to take effect in the application repository. Triggers automate this process by capturing and processing any change event and by triggering a pipeline run that deploys the new image with the latest changes.

Triggers consist of the following main resources that work together to form a reusable, decoupled, and self-sustaining CI/CD system:

--
* The `TriggerBinding` resource extracts the fields from an event payload and stores them as parameters.
+
The following example shows a code snippet of the `TriggerBinding` resource, which extracts the Git repository information from the received event payload:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1beta1 <1>
kind: TriggerBinding <2>
metadata:
  name: vote-app <3>
spec:
  params: <4>
  - name: git-repo-url
    value: $(body.repository.url)
  - name: git-repo-name
    value: $(body.repository.name)
  - name: git-revision
    value: $(body.head_commit.id)
----
+
<1> The API version of the `TriggerBinding` resource. In this example, `v1beta1`.
<2> Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, `TriggerBinding`.
<3> Unique name to identify the `TriggerBinding` resource.
<4> List of parameters which will be extracted from the received event payload and passed to the `TriggerTemplate` resource. In this example, the Git repository URL, name, and revision are extracted from the body of the event payload.

* The `TriggerTemplate` resource acts as a standard for the way resources must be created. It specifies the way parameterized data from the `TriggerBinding` resource should be used.
A trigger template receives input from the trigger binding, and then performs a series of actions that results in creation of new pipeline resources, and initiation of a new pipeline run.
+
The following example shows a code snippet of a `TriggerTemplate` resource, which creates a pipeline run using the Git repository information received from the `TriggerBinding` resource you just created:

<1> The API version of the `TriggerTemplate` resource. In this example, `v1beta1`.
<2> Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, `TriggerTemplate`.
<3> Unique name to identify the `TriggerTemplate` resource.
<4> Parameters supplied by the `TriggerBinding` resource.
<5> List of templates that specify the way resources must be created using the parameters received through the `TriggerBinding` or `EventListener` resources.

* The `Trigger` resource combines the `TriggerBinding` and `TriggerTemplate` resources, and optionally, the `interceptors` event processor.
+
Interceptors process all the events for a specific platform that runs before the `TriggerBinding` resource.  You can use interceptors to filter the payload, verify events, define and test trigger conditions, and implement other useful processing. Interceptors use secret for event verification. Once the event data passes through an interceptor, it then goes to the trigger before you pass the payload data to the trigger binding. You can also use an interceptor to modify the behavior of the associated trigger referenced in the `EventListener` specification.

The following example shows a code snippet of a `Trigger` resource, named `vote-trigger` that connects the `TriggerBinding` and `TriggerTemplate` resources, and the `interceptors` event processor.

<1> The API version of the `Trigger` resource. In this example, `v1beta1`.
<2> Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, `Trigger`.
<3> Unique name to identify the `Trigger` resource.
<4> Service account name to be used.
<5> Interceptor name to be referenced. In this example, `github`.
<6> Desired parameters to be specified.
<7> Name of the `TriggerBinding` resource to be connected to the `TriggerTemplate` resource.
<8> Name of the `TriggerTemplate` resource to be connected to the `TriggerBinding` resource.
<9> Secret to be used to verify events.

* The `EventListener` resource provides an endpoint, or an event sink, that listens for incoming HTTP-based events with a JSON payload. It  extracts event parameters from each `TriggerBinding` resource, and then processes this data to create Kubernetes resources as specified by the corresponding `TriggerTemplate` resource. The `EventListener` resource also performs lightweight event processing or basic filtering on the payload using event `interceptors`, which identify the type of payload and optionally modify it. Currently, pipeline triggers support five types of interceptors: _Webhook Interceptors_, _GitHub Interceptors_, _GitLab Interceptors_, _Bitbucket Interceptors_, and _Common Expression Language (CEL) Interceptors_.
