= Uploading a template

If you have a JSON or YAML file that defines a template, for example as seen in
this example, you can upload the template to projects using the CLI. This saves
the template to the project for repeated use by any user with appropriate access
to that project. Instructions on writing your own templates are provided later
in this topic.

.Procedure

* Upload a template to your current project's template library, pass the JSON
or YAML file with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <filename>
----

* Upload a template to a different project using the `-n` option with the
name of the project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <filename> -n <project>
----

The template is now available for selection using the web console or the CLI.
