= About backing up and restoring {microshift-short} data

Before you can create a manual backup, greenboot health checks must finish running and you must stop the {microshift-short} service.

* On `rpm-ostree` systems, {microshift-short} automatically creates a backup on every start. These automatic backups are deleted and replaced with the latest backup each time the system restarts.
* Data is also automatically restored on an `rpm-ostree` system after a greenboot system rollback. This data restoration ensures that the database matches the software running on the host after the rollback is completed.
* On other system types, you must back up and restore data manually.

Automated backups are in the `/var/lib/microshift-backups` directory by default. You can use this directory for manually backing up and restoring data by specifying it in each command. When you restore a backup, you must use the entire file path.

[NOTE]
====
The following procedures only backup and restore {microshift-short} data. Application data is not included.
