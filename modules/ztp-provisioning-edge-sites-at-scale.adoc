= Provisioning edge sites at scale

Telco edge computing presents extraordinary challenges with managing hundreds to tens of thousands of clusters in hundreds of thousands of locations. These challenges require fully-automated management solutions with, as closely as possible, zero human interaction.

Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) allows you to provision new edge sites with declarative configurations of bare-metal equipment at remote sites. Template or overlay configurations install {product-title} features that are required for CNF workloads. End-to-end functional test suites are used to verify CNF related features. All configurations are declarative in nature.

You start the workflow by creating declarative configurations for ISO images that are delivered to the edge nodes to begin the installation process. The images are used to repeatedly provision large numbers of nodes efficiently and quickly, allowing you keep up with requirements from the field for far edge nodes.

Service providers are deploying a more distributed mobile network architecture allowed by the modular functional framework defined for 5G. This allows service providers to move from appliance-based radio access networks (RAN) to open cloud RAN architecture, gaining flexibility and agility in delivering services to end users.

The following diagram shows how ZTP works within a far edge framework.
