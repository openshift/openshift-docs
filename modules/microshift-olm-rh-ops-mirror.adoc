= Using Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs and mirror registries

[role="_abstract"]
You can filter catalogs and delete images to get specific Operators and mirror them by using the oc-mirror {oc-first} plugin. You can also use Operators in disconnected settings or embedded in a {op-system-base-full} image.

* To understand more about how to configure your systems for mirroring, follow the links in the following "Additional resources" section.

* If you are ready to deploy Operators from Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs, mirror them, or to embed them in a {op-system-base} image, start with the following section, "Inspecting catalog contents by using the oc-mirror plugin."
