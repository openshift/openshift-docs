= Debugging a pod

In certain cases, you do not want to directly interact with your pod that is in production.

To avoid interfering with running traffic, you can use a secondary pod that is a copy of your original pod.
The secondary pod uses the same components as that of the original pod but does not have running traffic.

.Procedure

. List the pods by running the following command:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod
