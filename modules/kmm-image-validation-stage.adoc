= Image validation stage

Image validation is always the first stage of the preflight validation to be executed. If image validation is successful, no other validations are run on that specific module. The Operator uses the container runtime to check the image existence and accessibility for the updaded kernel in the module.

If the image validation fails and there is a `build/sign` section in the module that is relevant to the upgraded kernel, the controller tries to build or sign the image. If the `PushBuiltImage` flag is defined in the `PreflightValidationOCP` resource, the controller will also try to push the resulting image into its repository. The resulting image name is taken from the definition of the `containerImage` field of the `Module` CR.

[NOTE]
====
In case a `build` section exists, the input image in the `sign` section is used as the output image by the `build` section. Therefore, in order for the input image to be available to the `sign` section, the `PushBuiltImage` flag must be defined in the `PreflightValidationOCP` CR.
