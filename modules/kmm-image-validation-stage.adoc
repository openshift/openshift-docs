= Image validation stage

Image validation is always the first stage of the preflight validation to be executed. If image validation is successful, no other validations are run on that specific module.

Image validation consists of two stages:

. Image existence and accessibility. The code tries to access the image defined for the upgraded kernel in the module and get its manifests.

. Verify the presence of the kernel module defined in the `Module` in the correct path for future `modprobe` execution. The correct path is `<dirname>/lib/modules/<upgraded_kernel>/`.

If this validation is successful, it probably means that the kernel module was compiled with the correct Linux headers.
