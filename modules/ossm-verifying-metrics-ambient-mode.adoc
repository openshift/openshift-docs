= Verifying metrics in ambient mode

[role="_abstract"]
You can verify that the metrics for your application available in the OpenShift Console.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed the Bookinfo application in ambient mode to use the following example. For more information, see https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_mesh/3.2/html/installing/ossm-istio-ambient-mode#ossm-deploying-bookinfo-application-istio-ambient-mode_ossm-istio-ambient-mode[Deploying the Bookinfo application in Istio ambient mode].

.Procedure

. On the {ocp-short-name} Console go to *Observe* -> *Targets*.

. Find the status of `Metrics Targets` by searching for targets such as `istiod-monitor`, `istio-ztunnel-monitor`, and `istio-waypoint-monitor`. `istio-waypoint-monitor` is created only when the waypoint proxy is created to use Layer 7 (L7) {SMProduct} features.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `ServiceMonitor` resource configuration can take a few minutes to show in the `Metrics Targets` results.
====

. Send some traffic to the Bookinfo `productpage` service for generating metrics, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl "http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage" | grep "<title>"
----

. On the {ocp-short-name} Console go to *Observe* -> *Metrics* and run a query such as, `istio_build`, `istio_tcp_received_bytes_total`, or `istio_requests_total`.
