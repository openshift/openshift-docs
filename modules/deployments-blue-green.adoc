= Blue-green deployments

Blue-green deployments involve running two versions of an application at the
same time and moving traffic from the in-production version (the green version)
to the newer version (the blue version). You can use a Rolling strategy or
switch services in a route.

Because many applications depend on persistent data, you must have an
application that supports _N-1 compatibility_, which means it shares data and
implements live migration between the database, store, or disk by creating two
copies of the data layer.

Consider the data used in testing the new version. If it is the production data,
a bug in the new version can break the production version.

== Setting up a blue-green deployment

Blue-green deployments use two DeploymentConfigs. Both are running, and
the one in production depends on the service the route specifies, with each
DeploymentConfig exposed to a different service.

[NOTE]
====
Routes are intended for web (HTTP and HTTPS) traffic, so this technique is best
suited for web applications.
====

You can create a new route to the new version and test it. When ready, change
the service in the production route to point to the new service and the
new (blue) version is live.

If necessary, you can roll back to the older (green) version by switching
the service back to the previous version.

.Procedure

. Create two independent application components.
.. Create a copy of the example application running the `v1` image under the `example-green` service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example:v1 --name=example-green
----
+
.. Create a second copy that uses the `v2` image under the `example-blue` service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example:v2 --name=example-blue
----

. Create a route that points to the old service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose svc/example-green --name=bluegreen-example
----

. Browse to the application at `example-green.<project>.<router_domain>` to
verify you see the `v1` image.

. Edit the route and change the service name to `example-blue`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch route/bluegreen-example -p '{"spec":{"to":{"name":"example-blue"}}}'
----

. To verify that the route has changed, refresh the browser until you see the
`v2` image.
