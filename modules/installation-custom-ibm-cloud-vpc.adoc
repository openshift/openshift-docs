= About using a custom VPC

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can deploy a cluster into the subnets of an existing IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Deploying {product-title} into an existing VPC can help you avoid limit constraints in new accounts or more easily abide by the operational constraints that your company's guidelines set. If you cannot obtain the infrastructure creation permissions that are required to create the VPC yourself, use this installation option.

Because the installation program cannot know what other components are in your existing subnets, it cannot choose subnet CIDRs and so forth. You must configure networking for the subnets to which you will install the cluster.

[id="installation-custom-ibm-cloud-vpc-requirements_{context}"]
== Requirements for using your VPC

You must correctly configure the existing VPC and its subnets before you install the cluster. The installation program does not create the following components:

* NAT gateways
* Subnets
* Route tables
* VPC network

The installation program cannot:

* Subdivide network ranges for the cluster to use
* Set route tables for the subnets
* Set VPC options like DHCP

[id="installation-custom-ibm-cloud-vpc-validation_{context}"]
== VPC validation

The VPC and all of the subnets must be in an existing resource group. The cluster is deployed to this resource group.

As part of the installation, specify the following in the `install-config.yaml` file:

* The name of the resource group
* The name of VPC
* The subnets for control plane machines and compute machines

To ensure that the subnets that you provide are suitable, the installation program confirms the following:

* All of the subnets that you specify exist.
* For each availability zone in the region, you specify:
** One subnet for control plane machines.
** One subnet for compute machines.
* The machine CIDR that you specified contains the subnets for the compute machines and control plane machines.

[NOTE]
====
Subnet IDs are not supported.

[id="installation-custom-ibm-cloud-vpc-isolation_{context}"]
== Isolation between clusters

If you deploy {product-title} to an existing network, the isolation of cluster services is reduced in the following ways:

* You can install multiple {product-title} clusters in the same VPC.

* ICMP ingress is allowed to the entire network.

* TCP port 22 ingress (SSH) is allowed to the entire network.

* Control plane TCP 6443 ingress (Kubernetes API) is allowed to the entire network.

* Control plane TCP 22623 ingress (MCS) is allowed to the entire network.
