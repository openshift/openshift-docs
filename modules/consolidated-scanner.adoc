= About RHACS Scanner V4

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title-short} provides its own scanner, or you can configure an integration to use {product-title-short} with another vulnerability scanner.

Beginning with version 4.4, Scanner V4, built on link:https://github.com/quay/claircore[ClairCore], provides scanning for language and operating system-specific image components. Currently, {product-title-short} also uses the StackRox Scanner. To continue receiving full scanning support with the latest features, usage of both scanners is required.

[NOTE]
====
Beginning with release 4.6, due to changes in vulnerability sources used, Scanner V4 only considers vulnerabilities affecting Red{nbsp}Hat products dated back to 2014. Previously, when reading Red Hat's OVAL data, the vulnerabilities dated back to before 2000.
