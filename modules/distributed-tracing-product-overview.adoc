= OpenShift distributed tracing platform overview

As a service owner, you can use distributed tracing to instrument your services to gather insights into your service architecture.
You can use the distributed tracing platform for monitoring, network profiling, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern, cloud-native, microservices-based applications.

Using distributed tracing lets you perform the following functions:

* Monitor distributed transactions

* Optimize performance and latency

* Perform root cause analysis

Distributed tracing is based on the vendor-neutral link:https://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing] APIs and instrumentation.
