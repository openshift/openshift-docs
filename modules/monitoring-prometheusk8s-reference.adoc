These settings configure the Prometheus component for core platform monitoring.

.Configuration options

[source,yaml]
----
prometheusK8s:
  # Configures how the Prometheus component should communicate with additional
  # Alertmanager instances, including configuring URL scheme, connection
  # timeout, and authentication method
  # default: nil
  additionalAlertmanagerConfigs: AdditionalAlertmanagerConfig
  # The labels that will be used to add to any time series or alerts when 
  # communicating with external systems 
  # (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  # default: nil
  externalLabels: <map[string]string>
  # The log level for Prometheus.
  # Possible values are: error, warn, info, debug.
  # default: info
  logLevel: <string>
  # Defines the nodes on which the pods are scheduled.
  nodeSelector: v1.NodeSelector
  # Specifies the file to which PromQL queries are logged. 
  # You can specify either a file name or a full path. If a file name
  # is specified, the queries will be saved to an emptyDir volume
  # located at /var/log/prometheus. If a full path is specified,
  # an emptyDir volume will be mounted at that location. 
  # Relative paths are not supported.
  # Writing to linux std streams is also not supported.
  # default: ""
  queryLogFile: <string>
  # Contains the remote write configuration, including setting such as
  # URL, authorization, and relabeling.
  remoteWrite: RemoteWriteSpec
  # Defines resource requests and limits for single pods.
  resources: v1.ResourceRequirements
  # Defines how long Prometheus retains data. 
  # The default is '15d'. The setting must match the regular expression 
  # [0-9]+(ms|s|m|h|d|w|y) (milliseconds seconds minutes
  # hours days weeks years).
  retention: <string>
  # Defines tolerations for the pods.
  tolerations: v1.Toleration
  # Allows a user to configure persistent storage for the Prometheus pods.
  # If enabled, a user can configure storageClass and size of volume.
  volumeClaimTemplate: v1.PersistentVolumeClaim
