= ZTP support for deployment of multi-node clusters

The Telco 5G zero touch provisioning (ZTP) flow uses the Assisted Service,
which is part of {rh-rhacm-first} on the hub cluster, to install clusters. This is done
by generating all of the custom resources (CRs) required by Assisted Service including:

* `AgentClusterInstall`
* `ClusterDeployment`
* `NMStateConfig`
* `ManagedCluster and `KlusterletAddonConfig` (integration with {rh-rhacm})
* `InfraEnv`
* `BareMetalHost`
* `ConfigMap` for extra install manifests

Extending ZTP to support three-node clusters and standard clusters requires updates to these CRs,
including multiple instantiations of some.

ZTP provides support for deploying single node clusters, three-node clusters, and standard OpenShift clusters.
This includes the installation of OpenShift and deployment of the distributed units (DUs) at scale.

The overall flow is identical to the ZTP support for single node clusters, with some differentiation in configuration
depending on the type of cluster:

`SiteConfig`::
* For single node clusters, the `SiteConfig` must have exactly one entry in the `nodes` section.
* For three-node clusters, the `SiteConfig` must have exactly three entries defined in the `nodes` section.
* For standard clusters, the `SiteConfig` must have exactly three entries in the `nodes` section
with `role: master` and one or more additional entries with `role: worker`.

`PolicyGenTemplate`::
* The example `PolicyGenTemplate` is common across all types of clusters.
* There are group `PolicyGenTemplate` examples for each single node, three-node, and standard clusters.
* The site-specific `PolicyGenTemplate` examples are specific to each site.
