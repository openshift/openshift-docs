= Troubleshooting the Dynamic Accelerator Slicer Operator

If you experience issues with the Dynamic Accelerator Slicer (DAS) Operator, use the following troubleshooting steps to diagnose and resolve problems.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the DAS Operator.
* You have access to the {product-title} cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

----

. View detailed information about a specific `AllocationClaim` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]

. View events related to `AllocationClaim` resources by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get events -n das-operator --field-selector involvedObject.kind=AllocationClaim
----

. Check `NodeAccelerator` resources to verify GPU hardware detection by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodeaccelerator -n das-operator
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                     AGE

harpatil000034jma-qh5fm-worker-f-fl4wg   96m
----
+
The `NodeAccelerator` resources represent the GPU-capable nodes detected by the DAS Operator.

.Additional information

The `AllocationClaim` custom resource tracks the following information:

GPU UUID:: The unique identifier of the GPU device.
Slice position:: The position of the MIG slice on the GPU.
Pod reference:: The pod that requested the GPU slice.
State:: The current state of the claim (`staged`, `created`, or `released`).

Claims start in the `staged` state and transition to `created` when all requests are satisfied. When a pod is deleted, the associated claim is automatically cleaned up.

== Verifying GPU device availability

.Procedure

. On a node with GPU hardware, verify that CDI devices were created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node-name>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# chroot /host
sh-4.4# ls -l /var/run/cdi/
----

. Check the NVIDIA GPU Operator status by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterpolicies.nvidia.com -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.state}'
----
+
The output should show `ready`.

== Increasing log verbosity

.Procedure

To get more detailed debugging information:

. Edit the `DASOperator` resource to increase log verbosity by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit dasoperator -n das-operator
----

. Set the `operatorLogLevel` field to `Debug` or `Trace`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  operatorLogLevel: Debug
----

. Save the changes and verify that the operator pods restart with increased verbosity.

== Common issues and solutions

.Pods stuck in UnexpectedAdmissionError state
[NOTE]
====
Due to link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128043[kubernetes/kubernetes#128043], pods might enter an `UnexpectedAdmissionError` state if admission fails. Pods managed by higher level controllers such as Deployments are recreated automatically. Naked pods, however, must be cleaned up manually with `oc delete pod`. Using controllers is recommended until the upstream issue is resolved.
====

.Prerequisites not met
If the DAS Operator fails to start or function properly, verify that all prerequisites are installed:

* Cert-manager
* Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator
* NVIDIA GPU Operator
