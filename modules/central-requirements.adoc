= Prerequisites for installing Central

A single containerized service called _Central_ handles data persistence, API interactions, UI access, and other functions.

Central requires persistent storage:

* You can provide storage with a PersistentVolumeClaim (pvc) or hostPath.
* Use the host-mounted storage only if all your hosts (or a group of hosts)   mount a shared filesystem, such as an NFS share or a storage appliance.
Otherwise, your data is only saved on a single node.
* Use Solid-State Drives (SSDs) for best performance.
However, you can use another storage type if you don't have SSDs available.

[NOTE]
====
You can deploy Central in a separate cluster, or in a cluster which you are using for other purposes.
For security reasons, you should deploy Central in a cluster with limited administrative access.
