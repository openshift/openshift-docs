= Prerequisites for installing Central

A single containerized service called Central handles data persistence, API interactions, and user interface (Portal) access.

Central requires persistent storage:

* You can provide storage with a persistent volume claim (PVC).
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use a hostPath volume for storage only if all your hosts (or a group of hosts) mount a shared file system, such as an NFS share or a storage appliance.
Otherwise, your data is only saved on a single node. Red Hat does not
recommend using a hostPath volume.
====
* Use Solid-State Drives (SSD) for best performance.
However, you can use another storage type if you do not have SSDs available.
* If you use a web proxy or firewall, you must configure bypass rules to allow traffic for the `definitions.stackrox.io` and `collector-modules.stackrox.io` domains and enable {product-title} to trust your web proxy or firewall. Otherwise, updates for vulnerability definitions and kernel support packages will fail.
+
{product-title} requires access to:

** `definitions.stackrox.io` for downloading updated vulnerability definitions. Vulnerability definition updates allow {product-title} to maintain up-to-date vulnerability data when new vulnerabilities are discovered or additional data sources are added.
** `collector-modules.stackrox.io` to download updated kernel support packages. Updated Kernel support packages ensure that {product-title} can monitor the latest operating systems and collect data about the network traffic and processes running inside the containers. Without these updates, {product-title} might fail to monitor containers if you add new nodes in your cluster or if you update your nodes' operating system.

[NOTE]
====
For security reasons, you should deploy Central in a cluster with limited administrative access.
