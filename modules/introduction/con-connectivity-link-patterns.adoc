= {prodname} technologies and patterns

The main technologies and patterns provided by {prodname} include the following:

Gateway API::
Gateways play an essential role in application connectivity and security. In Kubernetes-based environments, link:https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/[Gateway API] is the new standard for deploying ingress Gateways and managing application networking. 
+
Gateway API provides standardized APIs for ingress traffic management and support for multiple protocols. Gateway API is user persona role-oriented by design, and provides configuration flexibility and portability. You can use Gateway API to set up ingress policies on each OpenShift cluster to be identical, consistent, and implemented with minimum effort.

Policy-based configuration::
By using {prodname} policies defined as Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs), platform engineers and application developers can easily secure, protect, and connect their applications and infrastructure. {prodname} provides policies for managing TLS, authentication and authorization, rate limiting, and DNS.
+
The _policy attachment_ pattern  provides a way to add behavior to an network object by using configuration that cannot be described in the object `spec` field. Policy attachments also provide the concept of defaults and overrides, which allow different roles to operate with policy APIs at different levels of the object hierarchy. These policies are then merged with specific rules and strategies to form an effective policy.
+
The following simple example of a rate limiting policy configures a specified limit of 5 requests per 10 seconds for every listener defined in the target Gateway that does not have its own rate limiting policy defined:
+
.Simple rate limiting policy example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1beta2
kind: RateLimitPolicy
metadata:
  name: gw-rlp
spec:
  targetRef: # Specifies Gateway API policy attachment
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: external
  defaults: # Means it can be overridden 
    limits: # Limitador component configuration
      "global":
        rates:
        - limit: 5
          window: 10s
          
----

WebAssembly plug-in::
Unlike other connectivity management systems, {prodname} is not a standalone Gateway. {prodname} is a link:https://webassembly.org/[WebAssembly (WASM)] plug-in, which is developed for the Envoy proxy. This means that users of OpenShift Service Mesh, Istio, or Envoy for ingress do not require major changes to their existing ingress objects and policies to begin using {prodname}. 
+
The WebAssembly plug-in design also means that {prodname} is lightweight, fast, hardware independent, non-intrusive, and secure. 

Multicluster configuration mirroring::
{prodname} uses multicluster configuration mirroring across multicloud and hybrid cloud environments to ensure that you can bring your routing, configuration, and policies wherever they are required. You must no longer set different policies in different ways based on the cloud service provider, and you can bring your own policies instead.
+
You can also ensure that your development, test, and production environments are set up in the same way to prevent surprises later. In this way, {prodname} provides consistency, simplicity, unified experience, global administration, and security compliance.

{api-controller} {api-controller-version}::

{prodname} introduces an {api-controller} {api-controller-version} component that provides a next-generation approach to API management, and which extends beyond traditional API management capabilities provided by other products. 
+
API management requires connectivity, and {prodname} provides scalable multicluster and multi-Gateway connectivity management, along with API 
management features such as API design, API registry, API observability, authentication, and rate limiting.
