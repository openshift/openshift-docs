= Adding Nutanix root CA certificates to your system trust

.Procedure

. Extract the compressed file that contains the Nutanix root CA certificates.
. Add the files for your operating system to the system trust. For example, on a Fedora operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# cp certs/lin/* /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
----

. Update your system trust. For example, on a Fedora operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# update-ca-trust extract
