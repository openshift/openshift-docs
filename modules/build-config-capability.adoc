= Build capability

[discrete]
== Purpose

The `Build` capability enables the `Build` API. The `Build` API manages the lifecycle of `Build` and `BuildConfig` objects.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable the `Build` capability, the following resources will not be available in the cluster:

* `Build` and `BuildConfig` resources
* The `builder` service account

Disable the `Build` capability only if you do not require `Build` and `BuildConfig` resources or the `builder` service account in the cluster.
