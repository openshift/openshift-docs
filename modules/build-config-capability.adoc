= Build capability

[discrete]
== Purpose

The `Build` capability enables the `Build` API. The `Build` API manages the lifecycle of `Build` and `BuildConfig` objects.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the `Build` capability is disabled, the cluster cannot use `Build` or `BuildConfig` resources. Disable the capability only if `Build` and `BuildConfig` resources are not required in the cluster.
