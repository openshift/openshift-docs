= Creating an infrastructure node

[IMPORTANT]
====
See Creating infrastructure machine sets for installer-provisioned infrastructure environments or for any cluster where the master nodes are managed by the machine API.
====

Requirements of the cluster dictate that infrastructure, also called `infra` nodes, be provisioned. The installer only provides provisions for master and worker nodes. Worker nodes can be designated as infrastructure nodes or application, also called `app`, nodes through labeling.

.Procedure

. Add a label to the worker node that you want to act as application node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/app=""
----

. Add a label to the worker nodes that you want to act as infrastructure nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=""
----

. Check to see if applicable nodes now have the `infra` role and `app` roles:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----

. Create a default node selector so that pods without a node selector are assigned a subset of nodes to be deployed on, for example by default deployment in worker nodes. As an example, the `defaultNodeSelector` to deploy pods on worker nodes by default would look like:
+
[source,yaml]
----
defaultNodeSelector: node-role.kubernetes.io/app=
----

. Move infrastructure resources to the newly labeled `infra` nodes.
