= Creating an infrastructure node

[IMPORTANT]
====
See Creating infrastructure machine sets for installer-provisioned infrastructure environments or for any cluster where the control plane nodes are managed by the machine API.
====

Requirements of the cluster dictate that infrastructure, also called `infra` nodes, be provisioned. The installer only provides provisions for control plane and worker nodes. Worker nodes can be designated as infrastructure nodes or application, also called `app`, nodes through labeling.

.Procedure

. Add a label to the worker node that you want to act as application node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/app=""
----

. Add a label to the worker nodes that you want to act as infrastructure nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=""
----

. Check to see if applicable nodes now have the `infra` role and `app` roles:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----

. Create a default cluster-wide node selector. The default node selector is applied to pods created in all namespaces. This creates an intersection with any existing node selectors on a pod, which additionally constrains the pod's selector.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the default node selector key conflicts with the key of a pod's label, then the default node selector is not applied.

However, do not set a default node selector that might cause a pod to become unschedulable. For example, setting the default node selector to a specific node role, such as `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=""`, when a pod's label is set to a different node role, such as `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=""`, can cause the pod to become unschedulable. For this reason, use caution when setting the default node selector to specific node roles.

You can alternatively use a project node selector to avoid cluster-wide node selector key conflicts.
====

.. Edit the `Scheduler` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit scheduler cluster
----

.. Add the `defaultNodeSelector` field with the appropriate node selector:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Scheduler
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNodeSelector: topology.kubernetes.io/region=us-east-1 <1>
# ...
----
<1> This example node selector deploys pods on nodes in the `us-east-1` region by default.

.. Save the file to apply the changes.

You can now move infrastructure resources to the newly labeled `infra` nodes.
