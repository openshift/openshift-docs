= Understanding worker latency profiles

Worker latency profiles are multiple sets of carefully-tuned values for the `node-status-update-frequency`, `node-monitor-grace-period`, `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` parameters. These parameters let you control the reaction of the cluster to latency issues without needing to determine the best values manually.

All worker latency profiles configure the following parameters:

--
* `node-status-update-frequency`. Specifies the amount of time in seconds that a kubelet updates its status to the Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator.
*  `node-monitor-grace-period`.  Specifies the amount of time in seconds that the Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator waits for an update from a kubelet before marking the node unhealthy and adding the `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` or `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint to the node.
* `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds`. Specifies the amount of time in seconds after marking a node unhealthy that the Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator waits before evicting pods from that node. 
* `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds`. Specifies the amount of time in seconds after marking a node unreachable that the Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator waits before evicting pods from that node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Manually modifying the `node-monitor-grace-period` parameter is not supported.
====

The following Operators monitor the changes to the worker latency profiles and respond accordingly:

* The Machine Config Operator (MCO) updates the `node-status-update-frequency` parameter on the worker nodes.
* The Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator updates the `node-monitor-grace-period` parameter on the control plane nodes.
* The Kubernetes API Server Operator updates the `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` parameters on the control plance nodes.

Although the default configuration works in most cases, {product-title} offers two other worker latency profiles for situations where the network is experiencing higher latency than usual. The three worker latency profiles are described in the following sections:

Default worker latency profile:: With the `Default` profile, each kubelet reports its node status to the Kubelet Controller Manager Operator (kube controller) every 10 seconds. The Kubelet Controller Manager Operator checks the kubelet for a status every 5 seconds. 
+
The Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator waits 40 seconds for a status update before considering that node unhealthy. It marks the node with the `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` or `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint and evicts the pods on that node. If a pod on that node has the `NoExecute` toleration, the pod gets evicted in 300 seconds. If the pod has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the eviction waits for the period specified by that parameter.

Medium worker latency profile:: Use the `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile if the network latency is slightly higher than usual.
+
The `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile reduces the frequency of kubelet updates to 20 seconds and changes the period that the Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator waits for those updates to 2 minutes. The pod eviction period for a pod on that node is reduced to 60 seconds. If the pod has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the eviction waits for the period specified by that parameter.
+
The Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator waits for 2 minutes to consider a node unhealthy. In another minute, the eviction process starts.

Low worker latency profile:: Use the `LowUpdateSlowReaction` profile if the network latency is extremely high.
+
The `LowUpdateSlowReaction` profile reduces the frequency of kubelet updates to 1 minute and changes the period that the Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator waits for those updates to 5 minutes. The pod eviction period for a pod on that node is reduced to 60 seconds. If the pod has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the eviction waits for the period specified by that parameter.

The Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator waits for 5 minutes to consider a node unhealthy. In another minute, the eviction process starts.
