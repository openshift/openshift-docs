= Understanding worker latency profiles

Worker latency profiles are four different categories of carefully-tuned parameters. The four parameters which implement these values are `node-status-update-frequency`, `node-monitor-grace-period`, `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds`. These parameters can use values which allow you control the reaction of the cluster to latency issues without needing to determine the best values using manual methods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting these parameters manually is not supported. Incorrect parameter settings adversely affect cluster stability.
====

All worker latency profiles configure the following parameters:

--
node-status-update-frequency:: Specifies how often the kubelet posts node status to the API server.
node-monitor-grace-period::  Specifies the amount of time in seconds that the Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for an update from a kubelet before marking the node unhealthy and adding the `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` or `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint to the node.
default-not-ready-toleration-seconds:: Specifies the amount of time in seconds after marking a node unhealthy that the Kube API Server Operator waits before evicting pods from that node.
default-unreachable-toleration-seconds:: Specifies the amount of time in seconds after marking a node unreachable that the Kube API Server Operator waits before evicting pods from that node.
--

The following Operators monitor the changes to the worker latency profiles and respond accordingly:

* The Machine Config Operator (MCO) updates the `node-status-update-frequency` parameter on the worker nodes.
* The Kubernetes Controller Manager updates the `node-monitor-grace-period` parameter on the control plane nodes.
* The Kubernetes API Server Operator updates the `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` parameters on the control plane nodes.

Although the default configuration works in most cases, {product-title} offers two other worker latency profiles for situations where the network is experiencing higher latency than usual. The three worker latency profiles are described in the following sections:

Default worker latency profile:: With the `Default` profile, each `Kubelet` updates it's status every 10 seconds (`node-status-update-frequency`). The `Kube Controller Manager` checks the statuses of `Kubelet` every 5 seconds (`node-monitor-grace-period`).
+
The Kubernetes Controller Manager waits 40 seconds for a status update from `Kubelet` before considering the `Kubelet` unhealthy. If no status is made available to the Kubernetes Controller Manager, it then marks the node with the `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` or `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint and evicts the pods on that node.
+
If a pod on that node has the `NoExecute` taint, the pod is run according to `tolerationSeconds`. If the pod has no taint, it will be evicted in 300 seconds (`default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` settings of the `Kube API Server`).

Medium worker latency profile:: Use the `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile if the network latency is slightly higher than usual.
+
The `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` profile reduces the frequency of kubelet updates to 20 seconds and changes the period that the Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for those updates to 2 minutes. The pod eviction period for a pod on that node is reduced to 60 seconds. If the pod has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the eviction waits for the period specified by that parameter.
+
The Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for 2 minutes to consider a node unhealthy. In another minute, the eviction process starts.

Low worker latency profile:: Use the `LowUpdateSlowReaction` profile if the network latency is extremely high.
+
The `LowUpdateSlowReaction` profile reduces the frequency of kubelet updates to 1 minute and changes the period that the Kubernetes Controller Manager waits for those updates to 5 minutes. The pod eviction period for a pod on that node is reduced to 60 seconds. If the pod has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the eviction waits for the period specified by that parameter.
