= Sample install-config.yaml for a two-node installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster with fencing

You can use the following `install-config.yaml` configuration as a template for deploying a two-node OpenShift cluster with fencing by using the installer-provisioned infrastructure method:

[NOTE]
====
Do an etcd backup before proceeding to ensure that you can restore the cluster if any issues occur.

----
* `compute.replicas`: Set this field to `0` because a two-node fencing cluster does not include worker nodes.  
* `controlPlane.replicas`: Set this field to `2` for a two-node fencing deployment.  
* `fencing.credentials.hostname`: Provide the Baseboard Management Console (BMC) credentials for each control plane node. These credentials are required for node fencing and prevent split-brain scenarios. 
* `fencing.credentials.certificateVerification`: Set this field to `Disabled` if your Redfish URL uses self-signed certificates, which is common for internally-hosted endpoints. Set this field to `Enabled` for URLs with valid CA-signed certificates.
* `metadata.name`: The cluster name is used as a prefix for hostnames and DNS records.  
* `featureSet`: Set this field to `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` to enable two-node OpenShift cluster deployments.  
* `platform.baremetal.apiVIPs` and `platform.baremetal.ingressVIPs` : Virtual IPs for the API and Ingress endpoints. Ensure they are reachable by all nodes and external clients.  
* `pullSecret`: Contains credentials required to pull container images for the cluster components.  
* `sshKey`: The SSH public key for accessing cluster nodes after installation.
