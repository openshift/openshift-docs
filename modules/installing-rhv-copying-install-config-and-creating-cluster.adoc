= Copying the `install-config.yaml` file and creating the cluster on {rh-virtualization}

[IMPORTANT]
====
* When you run the installation program, it deletes the `install-config.yaml` file. To preserve your customized file, make a working copy of the file in a separate directory.
* Due to bug link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1814172[bz#1814172], you must run the installation program as superuser to install {product-title} on {rh-virtualization-first}.
====

.Procedure
. When you have finished customizing the `install-config.yaml` file, make a working copy of the asset directory. For example:
+
----
$ cp -r ~/my-custom-config/ ~/my-working-dir/
----
+
. Run the installation program and specify the working directory. For example:
+
----
$ sudo ./openshift-install create cluster --my-working-dir
----
+
The installation program starts creating the cluster using the information in the `install-config.yaml` file. It also deletes the `install-config.yaml` file from the working directory.
