= Displaying the Insights status in the web console

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Home* -> *Overview* in the {product-title} web console.

+
The pop-up window lists potential issues grouped by priority. Click the individual categories or *View all in {product-title}* to display further details.
