= Displaying the Insights status in the web console

Insights repeatedly analyzes your cluster and you can display the status of identified potential issues of your cluster in the {product-title} web console. This status shows the number of issues in the different categories and, for further details, links to the reports in {cluster-manager-url}.

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster is registered in {cluster-manager-url}.
* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Home* -> *Overview* in the {product-title} web console.

. Click *Insights* on the *Status* card.
+
The pop-up window lists potential issues grouped by risk. Click the individual categories or *View all recommendations in Insights Advisor* to display more details.
