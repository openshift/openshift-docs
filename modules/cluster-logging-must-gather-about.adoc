= About the must-gather tool

The `oc adm must-gather` CLI command collects the information from your cluster that is most likely needed for debugging issues.

For your {logging}, `must-gather` collects the following information:

* Project-level resources, including pods, configuration maps, service accounts, roles, role bindings, and events at the project level
* Cluster-level resources, including nodes, roles, and role bindings at the cluster level
* OpenShift Logging resources in the `openshift-logging` and `openshift-operators-redhat` namespaces, including health status for the log collector, the log store, and the log visualizer

When you run `oc adm must-gather`, a new pod is created on the cluster. The data is collected on that pod and saved in a new directory that starts with `must-gather.local`. This directory is created in the current working directory.
