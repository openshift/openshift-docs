= Configuring observability dashboards and alerts
:prodname: Connectivity Link

{prodname} provides a variety of starting points for monitoring your {prodname} deployment by using example dashboards and alerts, which are ready-to-use and customizable to fit your environment.

The {prodname} example dashboards are uploaded to the https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/[Grafana dashboards website]. You can import the following dashboards into your Grafana deployment on OpenShift:

This section explains how to enable the example dashboards and alerts and provides links additional resources for more information. 

NOTE: You must perform these steps on each OpenShift cluster that you want to use {prodname} on.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured metrics as described in xref:configure_observability_metrics{context}[].
* You have installed and set up Grafana on OpenShift. For an example, see https://kuadrant.io/blog/grafana-on-openshift-for-kuadrant[Installing Grafana on Openshift for Kaudrant Observability]. 


== Configuring example Grafana dashboards

You can import dashboards into Grafana by using its user interface, or automatically by using custom resources in OpenShift: 	

Importing dashboards in the Grafana UI::
* *JSON file*: Use the *Import* feature in the Grafana UI to upload dashboard JSON files directly.  
* *Dashboard ID*: Use the *Import* feature in the Grafana UI to import via Grafana.com using a dashboard ID.
+
You can download the JSON file or copy the dashboard ID from the relevant dashboard page on https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/[Grafana dashboards website]. For more information, see the https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/import-dashboards/[Grafana documentation on how to import dashbords]. 

Importing dashboards automatically in OpenShift::

You can automate dashboard provisioning in Grafana by adding JSON files to a `ConfigMap`, which must be mounted at `/etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards`.
+
TIP: Alternatively, to avoid adding `ConfigMap` volume mounts in your Grafana deployment, you can use a `GrafanaDashboard` resource to reference a `ConfigMap`. For an example, see https://grafana.github.io/grafana-operator/docs/examples/dashboard_from_configmap/readme/[Dashboard from ConfigMap in the Grafana documentation].  	
+
Data sources are configured as template variables, automatically integrating with your existing data sources. Metrics for these dashboards are sourced from Prometheus. For more information, see the https://docs.kuadrant.io/latest/kuadrant-operator/doc/observability/metrics/[Kuadrant documentation on metrics].

NOTE: For some example dashboard panels to work correctly, HTTPRoutes in {prodname} must include a `service` and `deployment` label with a value that matches the name of the service and deployment being routed to, for example, `service=my-app` and `deployment=my-app`. This allows low-level Istio and Envoy metrics to be joined with Gateway API state metrics.

== Configuring example Prometheus alerts
You can integrate the https://github.com/Kuadrant/kuadrant-operator/tree/main/examples/alerts[Kuadrant example alerts] into Prometheus as `PrometheusRule` resources, and then adjust the alert thresholds to suit your specific operational needs.

Service Level Objective (SLO) alerts generated by using the https://github.com/slok/sloth[Sloth GitHub project] are also included. You can use these alerts to integrate with the https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14348-slo-detail/[SLO Grafana dashboard], which uses generated labels to comprehensively overview your SLOs.

For details on how to configure Prometheus alerts, see the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/latest/html/monitoring/managing-alerts#managing-alerting-rules-for-user-defined-projects_managing-alerts-as-an-administrator[OpenShift documentation on managing alerting rules].
