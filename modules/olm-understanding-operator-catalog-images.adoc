= Understanding Operator catalogs

An Operator catalog is a repository of metadata that Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can query to discover and install Operators and their dependencies on a cluster. OLM always installs Operators from the latest version of a catalog. As of {product-title} 4.6, Red Hat-provided catalogs are distributed using _index images_.

An index image, based on the Operator Bundle Format, is a containerized snapshot of a catalog. It is an immutable artifact that contains the database of pointers to a set of Operator manifest content. A catalog can reference an index image to source its content for OLM on the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Starting in {product-title} 4.6, index images provided by Red Hat replace the App Registry catalog images, based on the deprecated Package Manifest Format, that are distributed for previous versions of {product-title} 4. While App Registry catalog images are not distributed by Red Hat for {product-title} 4.6 and later, custom catalog images based on the Package Manifest Format are still supported.

As catalogs are updated, the latest versions of Operators change, and older versions may be removed or altered. In addition, when OLM runs on an {product-title} cluster in a restricted network environment, it is unable to access the catalogs directly from the Internet to pull the latest content.

As a cluster administrator, you can create your own custom index image, either based on a Red Hat-provided catalog or from scratch, which can be used to source the catalog content on the cluster. Creating and updating your own index image provides a method for customizing the set of Operators available on the cluster, while also avoiding the aforementioned restricted network environment issues.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When creating custom catalog images, previous versions of {product-title} 4 required using the `oc adm catalog build` command, which has been deprecated for several releases. With the availability of Red Hat-provided index images starting in {product-title} 4.6, catalog builders should start switching to using the `opm index` command to manage index images before the `oc adm catalog build` command is removed in a future release.
