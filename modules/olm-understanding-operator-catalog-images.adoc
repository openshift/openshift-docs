= Understanding Operator catalog images

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) always installs Operators from the latest
version of an Operator catalog. As of {product-title} 4.3, Red Hat-provided
Operators are distributed via Quay App Registry catalogs from
link:https://quay.io/[quay.io].

|Catalog
|Description

|`redhat-operators`
|Public catalog for Red Hat products packaged and shipped by Red Hat. Supported
by Red Hat.

|`certified-operators`
|Public catalog for products from leading independent software vendors (ISVs).
Red Hat partners with ISVs to package and ship. Supported by the ISV.

|`community-operators`
|Public catalog for software maintained by relevant representatives in the
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators[operator-framework/community-operators]
GitHub repository. No official support.

|===

As catalogs are updated, the latest versions of Operators change, and older
versions may be removed or altered. This behavior can cause problems maintaining
reproducible installs over time. In addition, when OLM runs on an
{product-title} cluster in a restricted network environment, it is unable to
access the catalogs from link:https://quay.io/[quay.io] directly.

Using the `oc adm catalog build` command, cluster administrators can create an
_Operator catalog image_. An Operator catalog image is:

- a point-in-time export of an App Registry type catalog's content.
- the result of converting an App Registry catalog to a container image type catalog.
- an immutable artifact.

Creating an Operator catalog image provides a simple way to use this content
without incurring the aforementioned issues.
