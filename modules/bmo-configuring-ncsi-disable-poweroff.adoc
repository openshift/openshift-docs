= Configuring NC-SI and DisablePowerOff for shared NICs

The Network Controller Sideband Interface (NC-SI) enables the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) to share a system network interface card (NIC) with the host for management traffic, using protocols like Redfish, IPMI, or vendor-specific interfaces. The `DisablePowerOff` feature prevents hard power-offs, ensuring soft reboots to maintain BMC connectivity.

*Prerequisites*

* NC-SI-capable hardware and NICs.
* BMC configured with an IP address and network connection.
* Administrative access to the BMC.
* Access to the OpenShift cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.

*Procedure*

. Configure the BMC to enable NC-SI for a shared NIC.

. Verify BMC connectivity using Redfish or IPMI by running one of the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -k https://<bmc_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ipmitool -I lanplus -H <bmc_ip> -U <user> -P <pass> power status
----

. Enable the `DisablePowerOff` feature by editing the `BareMetalHost` resource in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BareMetalHost
metadata:
  name: example-host
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  online: true
  bmc:
    address: <protocol>://<bmc_ip>/<bmc_address_format>
    credentialsName: bmc-secret
  disablePowerOff: true
----
+
See the "BMC addressing" sections for details on supported protocols and BMC address formats.

. Apply the changes by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----

.Verification

* Check the `BareMetalHost` status by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get baremetalhost example-host -n openshift-machine-api -o yaml
----
+
Confirm that `disablePowerOff: true` is in the `spec` section.

* Test a reboot by restarting a node pod and verify that BMC connectivity remains active.
* Attempt to set `BareMetalHost.spec.online=false`. It should fail with an error indicating power-off is disabled.
