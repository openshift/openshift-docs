= Setting the cluster details

To create a cluster with the {ai-full} web user interface, use the following procedure.

.Procedure

. Log in to the link:https://console.redhat.com[RedHat Hybrid Cloud Console].

. In the menu, click *OpenShift*.

. Click *Create cluster*.

. Click the *Datacenter* tab.

. Under the *{ai-full}* section, select *Create cluster*.

. Enter a name for the cluster in the *Cluster name* field.

. Enter a base domain for the cluster in the *Base domain* field. All subdomains for the cluster will use this base domain.
+
[NOTE]
====
The base domain must be a valid DNS name. You must not have a wild card domain set up for the base domain.
====

. Select the version of {product-title} to install.

. Optional: Select *Install single node Openshift (SNO)* if you want to install {product-title} on a single node.

. Optional: The {ai-full} already has the pull secret associated to your account. If you want to use a different pull secret, select *Edit pull secret*.

. Optional: {ai-full} defaults to using `x86_64` CPU architecture. If you are installing {product-title} on `arm64` CPUs, select *Use arm64 CPU architecture*. Keep in mind, some features are not available with `arm64` CPU architecture.

. Optional: If you are using a static IP configuration for the cluster nodes instead of DHCP reservations, select *Static network configuration*.

. Optional: If you want to enable encryption of the installation disks, select *Enable encryption of installation disks*. For multi-node clusters, you can choose to encrypt the control plane and worker node installation disks separately.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot change the base domain, the SNO checkbox, the CPU architecture, the host's network configuration, or the disk-encryption after installation begins.
