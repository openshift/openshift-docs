= Retrieving the host firmware schema for a managed cluster

You can discover the host firmware schema for managed clusters.
The host firmware schema for bare-metal hosts is populated with information that the Ironic API returns.
The API returns information about host firmware interfaces, including firmware setting types, allowable values, ranges, and flags.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have installed {rh-rhacm-first} and logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have provisioned a cluster that is managed by {rh-rhacm}.

.Procedure

* Discover the host firmware schema for the managed cluster.
Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get firmwareschema -n <managed_cluster_namespace> -o yaml
