= Using persistent volumes

[role="_abstract"]
Use the following procedures to create a file, store it on a persistent volume in your cluster, and confirm that it still exists after pod failure and re-creation.

.Procedure
. View your persistent volume claim by navigating to the cluster's OpenShift web console.
. Click *Storage* in the left menu, then click *PersistentVolumeClaims* to see a list of all the persistent volume claims. 
. Click a persistence volume claim to see the size, access mode, storage class, and other additional claim details. 
+
[NOTE]
====
The access mode is `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO). This means that the volume can only be mounted to one node and the pod or pods can read and write to the volume.
====
. In the OSToy app console, click *Persistent Storage* in the left menu.
. In the *Filename* box, enter a file name with a `.txt` extension, for example `test-pv.txt`.
. In the *File contents* box, enter a sentence of text, for example `OpenShift is the greatest thing since sliced bread!`.
. Click *Create file*.
