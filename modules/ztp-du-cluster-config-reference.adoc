= Recommended cluster configurations to run vDU applications

Clusters running virtualized distributed unit (vDU) applications require a highly tuned and optimized configuration. The following information describes the various elements that you require to support vDU workloads in {product-title} {product-version} clusters.

== Recommended cluster MachineConfig CRs

The following `MachineConfig` CRs configure the cluster host:

.Recommended MachineConfig CRs
[cols=2*, width="80%", options="header"]
|====
|CR filename
|Description

|`02-workload-partitioning.yaml`
|Configures workload partitioning for the cluster. Apply this `MachineConfig` CR when you install the cluster.

|`MachineConfigSctp.yaml`
|Loads the SCTP kernel module. This `MachineConfig` CR is optional and can be omitted if you do not require this kernel module.

|`MachineConfigContainerMountNS.yaml`
|Configures the container mount namespace and kubelet conf.

|`MachineConfigAcceleratedStartup.yaml`
|Configures accelerated startup for the cluster.

|`06-kdump-master.yaml`, `06-kdump-worker.yaml`
|Configures `kdump` for the cluster.
|====

== Recommended cluster Operators

The following Operators are required for clusters running vDU applications and are a part of the baseline reference configuration:

* Node Tuning Operator (NTO). NTO packages functionality that was previously delivered with the Performance Addon Operator, which is now a part of NTO.

* PTP Operator

* SR-IOV Network Operator

* Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator

* Local Storage Operator

== Recommended cluster kernel configuration

Always use the latest supported realtime kernel version in your cluster. You should also ensure that the following configurations are applied in the cluster:

. Ensure the following `additionalKernelArgs` are set in the cluster performance profile:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  additionalKernelArgs:
  - "idle=poll"
  - "rcupdate.rcu_normal_after_boot=0"
  - "efi=runtime"
----

. Ensure that the `performance-patch` profile in the `Tuned` CR configures the correct CPU isolation set that matches the `isolated` CPU set in the related `PerformanceProfile` CR, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  profile:
    - name: performance-patch
      # The 'include' line must match the associated PerformanceProfile name
      # And the cmdline_crash CPU set must match the 'isolated' set in the associated PerformanceProfile
      data: |
        [main]
        summary=Configuration changes profile inherited from performance created tuned
        include=openshift-node-performance-openshift-node-performance-profile
        [bootloader]
        cmdline_crash=nohz_full=2-51,54-103 <1>
        [sysctl]
        kernel.timer_migration=1
        [scheduler]
        group.ice-ptp=0:f:10:*:ice-ptp.*
        [service]
        service.stalld=start,enable
        service.chronyd=stop,disable
----
<1> Listed CPUs depend on the host hardware configuration, specifically the number of available CPUs in the system and the CPU topology.
