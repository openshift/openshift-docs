[NOTE]
====
Consider using a dedicated AWS account to run production clusters.

.Procedure

. Sign in to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/home[AWS Management Console].

. Navigate to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/home[ROSA service].

. Click *Get started*.
+
The *Verify ROSA prerequisites* page opens.

. Under *ROSA enablement*, ensure that a green check mark and `You previously enabled ROSA` are displayed.
+
If not, follow these steps:

.. Select the checkbox beside `I agree to share my contact information with Red{nbsp}Hat`.
.. Click *Enable ROSA*.
+
After a short wait, a green check mark and `You enabled ROSA` message are displayed.

. Under *Service Quotas*, ensure that a green check and `Your quotas meet the requirements for ROSA` are displayed.
+
If you see `Your quotas don't meet the minimum requirements`, take note of the quota type and the minimum listed in the error message. See Amazon's documentation on link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html[requesting a quota increase] for guidance. It may take several hours for Amazon to approve your quota request.

. Under *ELB service-linked role*, ensure that a green check mark and `AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing already exists` are displayed.

. Click *Continue to Red{nbsp}Hat*.
+
The *Get started with {product-title} (ROSA)* page opens in a new tab. You have already completed Step 1 on this page, and can now continue with Step 2.
