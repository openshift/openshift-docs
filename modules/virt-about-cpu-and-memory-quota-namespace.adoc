= About CPU and memory quotas in a namespace

A _resource quota_, defined by the `ResourceQuota` object, imposes restrictions on
a namespace that limit the total amount of compute resources that can be
consumed by resources within that namespace.

The `CDIConfig` object defines the user configuration for the Containerized Data Importer (CDI). The CPU and
memory request and limit values for the `CDIConfig` object are set to a default
value of 0.
This ensures that pods created by CDI that make no compute resource requirements
are given the default values and are allowed to run in a namespace that is restricted
with a quota.
