= About CPU and memory quotas in a namespace

A _resource quota_, defined by the `ResourceQuota` object, imposes restrictions on a namespace that limit the total amount of compute resources that can be consumed by resources within that namespace.

The `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR) defines the user configuration for the Containerized Data Importer (CDI). The CPU and memory request and limit values are set to a default value of `0`. This ensures that pods created by CDI that do not specify compute resource requirements are given the default values and are allowed to run in a namespace that is restricted with a quota.

When the `AutoResourceLimits` feature gate is enabled, {VirtProductName} automatically manages CPU and memory limits. If a namespace has both CPU and memory quotas, the memory limit is set to double the base allocation and the CPU limit is one per vCPU.
