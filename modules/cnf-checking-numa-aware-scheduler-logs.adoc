= Checking the NUMA-aware scheduler logs

Troubleshoot problems with the NUMA-aware scheduler by reviewing the logs. If required, you can increase the scheduler log level by modifying the `spec.logLevel` field of the `NUMAResourcesScheduler` resource. Acceptable values are `Normal`, `Debug`, and `Trace`, with `Trace` being the most verbose option.

[NOTE]
====
To change the log level of the secondary scheduler, delete the running scheduler resource and re-deploy it with the changed log level. The scheduler is unavailable for scheduling new workloads during this downtime.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Delete the currently running `NUMAResourcesScheduler` resource:

.. Get the active `NUMAResourcesScheduler` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get NUMAResourcesScheduler
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                     AGE
numaresourcesscheduler   90m
----

.. Delete the secondary scheduler resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete NUMAResourcesScheduler numaresourcesscheduler
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
numaresourcesscheduler.nodetopology.openshift.io "numaresourcesscheduler" deleted
----

. Save the following YAML in the file `nro-scheduler-debug.yaml`. This example changes the log level to `Debug`:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesScheduler
metadata:
  name: numaresourcesscheduler
spec:
  imageSpec: "registry.redhat.io/openshift4/noderesourcetopology-scheduler-container-rhel8:v{product-version}"
  logLevel: Debug
----

. Create the updated `Debug` logging `NUMAResourcesScheduler` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f nro-scheduler-debug.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
numaresourcesscheduler.nodetopology.openshift.io/numaresourcesscheduler created
----

.Verification steps

. Check that the NUMA-aware scheduler was successfully deployed:

.. Run the following command to check that the CRD is created succesfully:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get crd | grep numaresourcesschedulers
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                                              CREATED AT
numaresourcesschedulers.nodetopology.openshift.io                 2022-02-25T11:57:03Z
----

.. Check that the new custom scheduler is available by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get numaresourcesschedulers.nodetopology.openshift.io
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                     AGE
numaresourcesscheduler   3h26m
----

. Check that the logs for the scheduler shows the increased log level:

.. Get the list of pods running in the `openshift-numaresources` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-numaresources
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

----

.. Get the logs for the secondary scheduler pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs secondary-scheduler-7976c4d466-qm4sc -n openshift-numaresources
----
+
.Example output
