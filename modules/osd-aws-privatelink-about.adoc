= Understanding AWS PrivateLink

A {product-title} cluster can be created without any requirements on public subnets, internet gateways, or network address translation (NAT) gateways. In this configuration, Red Hat uses AWS PrivateLink to manage and monitor a cluster to avoid all public ingress network traffic. Without a public subnet, it is not possible to configure an application router as public. Configuring private application routers is the only option.

For more information, see link:https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/[AWS PrivateLink] on the AWS website.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only make a PrivateLink cluster at installation time. You cannot change a cluster to PrivateLink after installation.
