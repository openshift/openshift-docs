= Understanding AWS PrivateLink

ifdef::rosa-hcp[]
All {hcp-title} clusters are created with an AWS PrivateLink connection to expose the private Kubernetes API server to the customer's virtual private cloud (VPC).
endif::rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::rosa-hcp[]
A {product-title} cluster can be created without any requirements on public subnets, internet gateways, or network address translation (NAT) gateways. In this configuration, Red Hat uses AWS PrivateLink to manage and monitor a cluster to avoid all public ingress network traffic. Without a public subnet, it is not possible to configure an application router as public. Configuring private application routers is the only option.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only make a PrivateLink cluster at installation time. You cannot change a cluster to PrivateLink after installation.
