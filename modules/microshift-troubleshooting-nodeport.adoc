= Troubleshooting the NodePort service iptable rules

OVN-Kubernetes sets up an iptable chain in the network address translation (NAT) table to handle incoming traffic to the NodePort service. When the NodePort service is not reachable or the connection is refused, check the iptable rules on the host to make sure the relevant rules are properly inserted.

.Procedure

. View the iptable rules for the NodePort service by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ iptables-save | grep NODEPORT
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
-A OUTPUT -j OVN-KUBE-NODEPORT
-A OVN-KUBE-NODEPORT -p tcp -m addrtype --dst-type LOCAL -m tcp --dport 30326 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.43.95.170:80
----
OVN-Kubernetes configures the `OVN-KUBE-NODEPORT` iptable chain in the NAT table to match the destination port and Destination Network Address Translates (DNATs) the packet to the `clusterIP` service. The packet is then routed to the OVN network through the gateway bridge `br-ex` via routing rules on the host.

. Route the packet through the network with routing rules by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ip route
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
10.43.0.0/16 via 192.168.122.1 dev br-ex mtu 1400
----
This routing rule matches the Kubernetes service IP address range and forwards the packet to the gateway bridge `br-ex`. You must enable `ip_forward` on the host. After the packet is forwarded to the OVS bridge `br-ex`, it is handled by OpenFlow rules in OVS which steers the packet to the OVN network and eventually to the pod.
