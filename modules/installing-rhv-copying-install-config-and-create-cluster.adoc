= Copying the `install-config.yaml` file and creating the cluster

IMPORTANT: When you run the installation program, it deletes the `install-config.yaml` file. To preserve your customized file, make a working copy of the file in a separate directory.

.Procedure
. When you have finished customizing the `install-config.yaml` file, make a working copy of the asset directory. For example:
+
----
$ cp -r ~/my-custom-config/ ~/my-working-dir/
----
+
. Run the installation program and specify the working directory. For example:
+
----
$ sudo ./openshift-install create cluster --my-working-dir
----
+
The installation program runs, using the information in the `install-config.yaml` file instead of prompting you for information. It also deletes the `install-config.yaml` file from the working directory.
