= Choose your networking setup

The networking stack is one of the most important components for a Kubernetes-based product like {product-title}. For {ibm-z-name} setups, the networking setup depends on the hypervisor of your choice. Depending on the workload and the application, the best fit usually changes with the use case and the traffic pattern.

Depending on your setup, consider these best practices:

* Consider all options regarding networking devices to optimize your traffic pattern. Explore the advantages of OSA-Express, RoCE Express, HiperSockets, z/VM VSwitch, Linux Bridge (KVM), and others to decide which option leads to the greatest benefit for your setup.
* Always use the latest available NIC version. For example, OSA Express 7S 10 GbE shows great improvement compared to OSA Express 6S 10 GbE with transactional workload types, although both are 10 GbE adapters.
* Each virtual switch adds an additional layer of latency.
* The load balancer plays an important role for network communication outside the cluster. Consider using a production-grade hardware load balancer if this is critical for your application.
* {product-title} SDN introduces flows and rules, which impact the networking performance. Make sure to consider pod affinities and placements, to benefit from the locality of services where communication is critical.
* Balance the trade-off between performance and functionality.
