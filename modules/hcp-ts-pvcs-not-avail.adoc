= Hosted cluster PVCs are not available

If a hosted control plane is not coming fully online because the persistent volume claims (PVCs) for a hosted cluster are not available, check the PVC events and details, and component logs.

.Procedure

* Look for events and details that are associated with the PVC to understand which errors are occurring.

* If a PVC is failing to attach to a pod, view the logs for the kubevirt-csi-node `daemonset` component within the hosted cluster to further investigate the problem. To identify the kubevirt-csi-node pods for each node, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-cluster-csi-drivers -o wide -l app=kubevirt-csi-driver
----

* If a PVC cannot bind to a persistent volume (PV), view the logs of the kubevirt-csi-controller component within the hosted control plane namespace. To identify the kubevirt-csi-controller pod within the hosted control plane namespace, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n <hcp namespace> -l app=kubevirt-csi-driver
