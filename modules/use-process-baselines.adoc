= Using process baselines

[role="_abstract"]
You can minimize risk by using process baselining for infrastructure security. With this approach, {product-title} first discovers existing processes and creates a baseline.
Then it operates in the default deny-all mode and only allows processes listed in the baseline to run.

== Process baselines

When you install {product-title}, there is no default process baseline.
As {product-title} discovers deployments, it creates a process baseline for every container type in a deployment.
Then it adds all discovered processes to their own process baselines.

[discreet]
== Process baseline states

During the process discovery phase, all baselines are in an unlocked state.

In an *unlocked* state:

* When {product-title} discovers a new process, it adds that process to the process baseline.
* Processes do not show up as risks and do not trigger any violations.

After an hour from when {product-title} receives the first process indicator from a container in a deployment, it finishes the process discovery phase.
At this point:

* {product-title} stops adding processes to the process baselines.
* New processes that are not in the process baseline show up as risks, but they do not trigger any violations.

To generate violations, you must manually lock the process baseline.
//See <<lock-and-unlock-process-baselines,Lock and unlock process baselines>>  for more details.

In a *locked* state:

* {product-title} stops adding processes to the process baselines.
* New processes that are not in the process baseline trigger violations.

Independent of the locked or unlocked baseline state, you can always add or remove processes from the baseline.

[NOTE]
====
For a deployment, if each pod has multiple containers in it, {product-title} creates a process baseline for each container type.
For such a deployment, if some baselines are locked and some are unlocked, the baseline status for that deployment shows up as *Mixed*.
