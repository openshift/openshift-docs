= Creating volume clones in {sno}

You create a clone of a volume to make a point-in-time copy of the data.
A persistent volume claim (PVC) cannot be cloned with a different size.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The cloned PVC has write access.
====

.Prerequisites

* You ensured that the PVC is in `Bound` state. This is required for a consistent snapshot.
* You ensured that the `StorageClass` is the same as that of the source PVC.

.Procedure

. Identify the storage class of the source PVC.
. To create a volume clone, save the following YAML to a file with a name such as `lvms-vol-clone.yaml`:
