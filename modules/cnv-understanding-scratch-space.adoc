= Understanding scratch space 

The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) requires scratch space (temporary storage) 
to complete some operations, such as importing and uploading virtual machine images.
During this process, the CDI provisions a scratch space PVC equal to the size of 
the PVC backing the destination DataVolume (DV). The scratch space PVC is deleted 
after the operation completes or aborts.

The CDIConfig object allows you to define which StorageClass to use to bind the 
scratch space PVC by setting the `scratchSpaceStorageClass` in the `spec:` 
section of the CDIConfig object. 

If the defined StorageClass does not match a StorageClass in the cluster, then 
the default StorageClass defined for the cluster is used. If there is no 
default StorageClass defined in the cluster, the StorageClass used to provision 
the original DV or PVC is used. 

[NOTE]
====
The CDI requires requesting scratch space with a `file` volume mode, regardless 
of the PVC backing the origin DataVolume. If the origin PVC is backed by 
`block` volume mode, you must define a StorageClass capable of provisioning 
`file` volume mode PVCs.

== Manual provisioning 

If there are no storage classes, the CDI will use any PVCs in the project that 
match the size requirements for the image. If there are no PVCs that match these 
requirements, the CDI import Pod will remain in a *Pending* state until an 
appropriate PVC is made available or until a timeout function kills the Pod.
