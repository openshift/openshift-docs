{sandboxed-containers-first} can be used on FIPS enabled clusters.

When running in FIPS mode, {sandboxed-containers-first} components, VMs, and VM images are adapted to comply with FIPS.

FIPS compliance is one of the most critical components required in
highly secure environments, to ensure that only supported cryptographic
technologies are allowed on nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a {op-system-base-full} computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/assembly_installing-the-system-in-fips-mode_security-hardening[Installing the system in FIPS mode]. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
