= Configuring event delivery ordering for triggers

If you are using a Kafka broker, you can configure the delivery order of events from triggers to event sinks.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Eventing, and Knative broker implementation for Apache Kafka are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* Kafka broker is enabled for use on your cluster, and you have created a Kafka broker.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* You have installed the OpenShift (`oc`) CLI.

.Procedure

. Create or modify a `Trigger` object and set the `kafka.eventing.knative.dev/delivery.order` annotation:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: <trigger_name>
  annotations:
     kafka.eventing.knative.dev/delivery.order: ordered
...
----
+
The supported consumer delivery guarantees are:
+
`unordered`:: An unordered consumer is a non-blocking consumer that delivers messages unordered, while preserving proper offset management.
+
`ordered`:: An ordered consumer is a per-partition blocking consumer that waits for a successful response from the CloudEvent subscriber before it delivers the next message of the partition.
+
The default ordering guarantee is `unordered`.

. Apply the `Trigger` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
