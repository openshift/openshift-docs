= Collector network policy

{clo} creates a `NetworkPolicy` resource for the collector pods when a `ClusterLogForwarder` resource is deployed if you specify a network policy rule set in the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR).
`NetworkPolicy` resources are automatically created, updated, and removed along with the component deployment lifecycle.

You can specify the network policy rule set by defining the `networkPolicy.ruleSet` field in the collector specification.
The collector supports the following network policy rule set types:

`AllowAllIngressEgress`::
 Allows all ingress and egress traffic.

`RestrictIngressEgress`::
Restricts traffic to specific ports based on the configured inputs, outputs, and the metrics port.

If you do not define a `spec.collector.networkPolicy` field, the Operator will not create a `NetworkPolicy` resource for the collector. 
Without a `NetworkPolicy` resource, logging components might not function if a cluster-wide `AdminNetworkPolicy` restricts traffic or other restrictive network policies are in place.
