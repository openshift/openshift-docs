.MetalLB BGP peer custom resource
[cols="1,1,3",options="header"]
|===

|Field
|Type
|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|Specifies the name for the BGP peer custom resource.

|`metadata.namespace`
|`string`
|Specifies the namespace for the BGP peer custom resource.

|`spec.myASN`
|`integer`
|Specifies the Autonomous System number for the local end of the BGP session.
Specify the same value in all BGP peer custom resources that you add.
The range is `0` to `65535`.

|`spec.peerASN`
|`integer`
|Specifies the Autonomous System number for the remote end of the BGP session.
The range is `0` to `65535`.

|`spec.peerAddress`
|`string`
|Specifies the IP address of the peer to contact for establishing the BGP session.

|`spec.sourceAddress`
|`string`
|Optional: Specifies the IP address to use when establishing the BGP session.
The value must be an IPv4 address.

|`spec.peerPort`
|`integer`
|Optional: Specifies the network port of the peer to contact for establishing the BGP session.
The range is `0` to `16384`.

|`spec.holdTime`
|`string`
|Optional: Specifies the duration for the hold time to propose to the BGP peer.
The minimum value is 3 seconds (`3s`).
The common units are seconds and minutes, such as `3s`, `1m`, and `5m30s`.
To detect path failures more quickly, also configure BFD.

|`spec.keepaliveTime`
|`string`
|Optional: Specifies the maximum interval between sending keep-alive messages to the BGP peer.
If you specify this field, you must also specify a value for the `holdTime` field.
The specified value must be less than the value for the `holdTime` field.

|`spec.routerID`
|`string`
|Optional: Specifies the router ID to advertise to the BGP peer.
If you specify this field, you must specify the same value in every BGP peer custom resource that you add.

|`spec.password`
|`string`
|Optional: Specifies the MD5 password to send to the peer for routers that enforce TCP MD5 authenticated BGP sessions.

|`spec.bfdProfile`
|`string`
|Optional: Specifies the name of a BFD profile.

|`spec.nodeSelectors`
|`object[]`
|Optional: Specifies a selector, using match expressions and match labels, to control which nodes can connect to the BGP peer.

|`spec.ebgpMultiHop`
|`boolean`
|Optional: Specifies that the BGP peer is multiple network hops away.
If the BGP peer is not directly connected to the same network, the speaker cannot establish a BGP session unless this field is set to `true`.
This field applies to _external BGP_.
External BGP is the term that is used to describe when a BGP peer belongs to a different Autonomous System.
