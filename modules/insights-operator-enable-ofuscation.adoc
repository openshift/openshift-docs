= Enabling Insights Operator data obfuscation

You can enable obfuscation to mask sensitive and identifiable IPv4 addresses and cluster base domains Insights Operator sends to link:https://cloud.redhat.com[cloud.redhat.com].

[WARNING]
====
Although this feature is available, Red Hat recommends keeping obfuscation off for a more effective support experience.
====

Obfuscation assigns non-identifying values to cluster IPv4 addresses, and uses a translation table retained in memory to change IP addresses to their obfuscated versions throughout the Insights Operator archive before uploading the data to link:https://cloud.redhat.com[cloud.redhat.com].

For cluster base domains, obfuscation changes the base domain to a hardcoded substring. For example, `cluster-api.openshift.example.com` becomes `cluster-api.<CLUSTER_BASE_DOMAIN>`.
