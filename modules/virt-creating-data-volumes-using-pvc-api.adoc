= Creating data volumes using the PVC API

When you create a data volume using the PVC API, the Containerized Data Interface (CDI) creates the data volume based on what you specify for the following fields:

* `accessModes` (`ReadWriteOnce`, `ReadWriteMany`, or `ReadOnlyMany`)
* `volumeMode` (`Filesystem` or `Block`)
* `capacity` of `storage` (`5Gi`, for example)

In the following YAML, using the PVC API allocates a data volume with a storage capacity of two gigabytes. You specify an access mode of `ReadWriteMany` to enable live migration. Because you know the values your system can support, you specify `Block` storage instead of the default, `Filesystem`.

.Example DataVolume definition
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: DataVolume
metadata:
  name: <datavolume> <1>
spec:
  source:
    pvc: <2>
      namespace: "<source_namespace>" <3>
      name: "<my_vm_disk>" <4>
  pvc: <5>
    accessModes: <6>
      - ReadWriteMany
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 2Gi <7>
    volumeMode: Block <8>
    storageClassName: <storage_class> <9>
----
<1> The name of the new data volume.
<2> In the `source` section, `pvc` indicates that the source of the import is an existing persistent volume claim (PVC).
<3> The namespace where the source PVC exists.
<4> The name of the source PVC.
<5> Indicates allocation using the PVC API.
<6> `accessModes` is required when using the PVC API.
<7> Specifies the amount of space you are requesting for your data volume.
<8> Specifies that the destination is a block PVC.
<9> Optionally, specify the storage class. If the storage class is not specified, the system default storage class is used.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you explicitly allocate a data volume by using the PVC API and you are not using `volumeMode: Block`, consider file system overhead.

File system overhead is the amount of space required by the file system to maintain its metadata. The amount of space required for file system metadata is file system dependent. Failing to account for file system overhead in your storage capacity request can result in an underlying persistent volume claim (PVC) that is not large enough to accommodate your virtual machine disk.

If you use the storage API, the CDI will factor in file system overhead and  request a larger persistent volume claim (PVC) to ensure that your allocation request is successful.
