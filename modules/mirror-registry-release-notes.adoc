=== New features

* _Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is now supported on {op-system-base-full} 9 installations.

* IPv6 support is now available on _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ local host installations.
+
IPv6 is currently unsupported on _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ remote host installations.

* A new feature flag, `--quayStorage`, has been added. With this flag, users with root privileges can manually set the location of their Quay persistent storage.

* A new feature flag, `--pgStorage`, has been added. With this flag, users with root privileges can manually set the location of their Postgres persistent storage.

* Previously, users were required to have root privileges (`sudo`) to install _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_. With this update, `sudo` is no longer required to install _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_.
+
When _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ was installed with `sudo`, an `/etc/quay-install` directory that contained installation files, local storage, and the configuration bundle was created. With the removal of the `sudo` requirement, installation files and the configuration bundle are now installed to `$HOME/quay-install`. Local storage, for example Postgres and Quay, are now stored in named volumes automatically created by Podman.
+
To override the default directories that these files are stored in, you can use the command line arguments for _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_. For more information about _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ command line arguments, see "_Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ flags".

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the following error could be returned when attempting to uninstall _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_: `["Error: no container with name or ID \"quay-postgres\" found: no such container"], "stdout": "", "stdout_lines": []***`. With this update, the order that _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ services are stopped and uninstalled have been changed so that the error no longer occurs when uninstalling _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_.

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:6500[RHBA-2022:6500 - mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift 1.2.7]

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, `getFQDN()` relied on the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) library to determine its FQDN, and the FQDN library tried to read the `/etc/hosts` folder directly. Consequently, on some {op-system-first} installations with uncommon DNS configurations, the FQDN library would fail to install and abort the installation. With this update, _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ uses `hostname` to determine the FQDN. As a result, the FQDN library does not fail to install.

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, all components and workers running inside of the Quay pod Operator had log levels set to `DEBUG`. As a result, large traffic logs were created that consumed unnecessary space. With this update, log levels are set to `WARN` by default, which reduces traffic information while emphasizing problem scenarios.

=== New features

* A new command, `mirror-registry upgrade` has been added. This command upgrades all container images without interfering with configurations or data.

[NOTE]

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the absence of `quayHostname` or `targetHostname` did not default to the local hostname. With this update, `quayHostname` and `targetHostname` now default to the local hostname if they are missing. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3079[*PROJQUAY-3079*])

* Previously, the command `./mirror-registry --version` returned an `unknown flag` error. Now, running `./mirror-registry --version` returns the current version of the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3086[*PROJQUAY-3086*])

* Previously, users could not set a password during installation, for example, when running `./mirror-registry install --initUser <user_name> --initPassword <password> --verbose`. With this update, users can set a password during installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3149[*PROJQUAY-3149*])

* Previously, the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ did not recreate pods if they were destroyed. Now, pods are recreated if they are destroyed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3261[*PROJQUAY-3261*])
