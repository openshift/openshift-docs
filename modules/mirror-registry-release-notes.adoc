==== New features

* _Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is now supported on {op-system-base-full} 9 installations.

* IPv6 support is now available on _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ local host installations.
+
IPv6 is currently unsupported on _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ remote host installations.

* A new feature flag, `--quayStorage`, has been added. By specifying this flag, you can manually set the location for the Quay persistent storage.

* A new feature flag, `--pgStorage`, has been added. By specifying this flag, you can manually set the location for the Postgres persistent storage.

* Previously, users were required to have root privileges (`sudo`) to install _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_. With this update, `sudo` is no longer required to install _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_.
+
When _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ was installed with `sudo`, an `/etc/quay-install` directory that contained installation files, local storage, and the configuration bundle was created. With the removal of the `sudo` requirement, installation files and the configuration bundle are now installed to `$HOME/quay-install`. Local storage, for example Postgres and Quay, are now stored in named volumes automatically created by Podman.
+
To override the default directories that these files are stored in, you can use the command line arguments for _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_. For more information about _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ command line arguments, see "_Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ flags".

[id="mirror-registry-bug-fixes-1-3-0_{context}"]
==== Bug fixes

With this update, the order that _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ services are stopped and uninstalled have been changed so that the error no longer occurs when uninstalling _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_.

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, `getFQDN()` relied on the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) library to determine its FQDN, and the FQDN library tried to read the `/etc/hosts` folder directly. Consequently, on some {op-system-first} installations with uncommon DNS configurations, the FQDN library would fail to install and abort the installation. With this update, _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ uses `hostname` to determine the FQDN. As a result, the FQDN library does not fail to install.
