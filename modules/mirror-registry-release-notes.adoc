=== Bug fixes

* Previously, all components and workers running inside of the Quay pod Operator had log levels set to `DEBUG`. As a result, large traffic logs were created that consumed unnecessary space. With this update, log levels are set to `WARN` by default, which reduces traffic information while emphasizing problem scenarios.

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the absence of `quayHostname` or `targetHostname` did not default to the local hostname. With this update, `quayHostname` and `targetHostname` now default to the local hostname if they are missing. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3079[*PROJQUAY-3079*])

* Previously, the command `./mirror-registry --version` returned an `unknown flag` error. Now, running `./mirror-registry --version` returns the current version of the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3086[*PROJQUAY-3086*])

* Previously, users could not set a password during installation, for example, when running `./mirror-registry install --initUser <user_name> --initPassword <password> --verbose`. With this update, users can set a password during installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3149[*PROJQUAY-3149*])

* Previously, the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ did not recreate pods if they were destroyed. Now, pods are recreated if they are destroyed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3261[*PROJQUAY-3261*])
