= Creating a TLS secret

As an administrator, you can create a Transport Layer Security (TLS) secret, which allows you to store a certificate and its associated key that are typically used for TLS.  When using this type of secret, the `data` parameter of the `Secret` object must contain  the `tls.key` and the `tls.crt` keys to use. The API server does not validate the values for each key.

One common use for TLS secrets is to configure encryption in transit for ingress. You can also use a TLS secret with other resources or directly in your workload.

[NOTE]
====
You can use the `stringData` parameter to use clear text content.

.Procedure

. Create a `Secret` object in a YAML file on a control plane node:
+
.Example `secret` object:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-tls
type: kubernetes.io/tls <1>
data:
  tls.crt: | <2>
        MIIC2DCCAcCgAwIBAgIBATANBgkqh ...
  tls.key: |
        MIIEpgIBAAKCAQEA7yn3bRHQ5FHMQ ...

----
<1> Specifies a TLS secret.
<2> Specifies the `tls.key` and the `tls.crt` keys to use.

. Use the following command to create the `Secret` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
----

. To use the secret in a pod:

.. Update the pod's service account to reference the secret, as shown in the "Understanding how to create secrets" section.

.. Create the pod, which consumes the secret as an environment variable or as a file (using a `secret` volume), as shown in the "Understanding how to create secrets" section.
