= Creating a TLS secret

As an administrator, you can create a Transport Layer Security (TLS) secret, which allows you to store a certificate and its associated key that are typically used for TLS.  When using this type of secret, the `data` parameter of the `Secret` object must contain  the `tls.key` and the `tls.crt` keys to use.

One common use for TLS secrets is to configure encryption in transit for an Ingress, but you can also use it with other resources or directly in your workload. When using this type of secret, you provide the `tls.key` and the `tls.crt` keys in the `data` (or `stringData`) field of the `Secret` object. 

[NOTE]
====
The API server does not validate the values for each key.
====

You can create an opaque secret to pass the credentials used for TLS server and/or client. Using TLS secret type helps ensure the consistency of the secret format in your project.	

.Procedure

. Create a `Secret` object in a YAML file on master.
+
.Example `secret` object:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-tls
type: kubernetes.io/tls <1>
data:
  tls.crt: | <2>
        MIIC2DCCAcCgAwIBAgIBATANBgkqh ...
  tls.key: |
        MIIEpgIBAAKCAQEA7yn3bRHQ5FHMQ ...

----
<1> Specifies a TLS secret.
<2> Specifies the `tls.key` and the `tls.crt` keys to use.

. Use the following command to create the `Secret` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml

. Use the following command to create a Secret object:

$ oc create -f <filename>

. To use the secret in a pod:

.. Update the pod's service account to reference the secret, as shown in the "Understanding how to create secrets" section.

.. Create the pod, which consumes the secret as an environment variable or as a file (using a `secret` volume), as shown in the "Understanding how to create secrets" section.
