= When not to use image short names

Using image short names with public registries is strongly discouraged because the image might not deploy if the public registry requires authentication. Use fully-qualified image names with public registries.

Red{nbsp}Hat internal or private registries typically support the use of image short names.

You cannot list multiple public registries under the `containerRuntimeSearchRegistries` parameter if each public registry requires different credentials and a cluster does not list the public registry in the global pull secret.

For a public registry that requires authentication, you can use an image short name only if the registry has its credentials stored in the global pull secret.

[WARNING]
====
If you list public registries under the `containerRuntimeSearchRegistries` parameter (including the `registry.redhat.io`, `docker.io`, and `quay.io` registries), you expose your credentials to all the registries on the list, and you risk network and registry attacks. Because you can only have one pull secret for pulling images, as defined by the global pull secret, that secret is used to authenticate against every registry in that list. Therefore, if you include public registries in the list, you introduce a security risk.
