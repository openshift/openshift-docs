= Configuring S3 API compatible integrations in {product-title}

To configure S3 API compatible backups, create a new integration in {product-title}.

.Prerequisites
* You have configured an existing S3 bucket.
To create a new bucket with required permissions, see your S3 provider documentation.
* You have `read`, `write`, and `delete` permissions for the S3 bucket, the *Access key ID*, and the *Secret access key*.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Scroll down to the *External backups* section and select *S3 API Compatible*.
. Click *New Integration*.
. Enter a name for *Integration Name*.
. Enter the number of backups to retain in the *Backups To Retain* box.
. For *Schedule*, select the backup frequency as daily or weekly, and select the time to run the backup process.
. Enter the *Bucket* name where you want to store the backup.
. Optionally, enter an *Object Prefix* if you want to save the backups in a specific folder structure.
. Enter the *Endpoint* under which the S3 compatible service is reachable. If no scheme is specified, the default, `https`, is used.
. Enter the *Region* for the bucket. Consult your provider's documentation to enter the correct region.
. Select the *URL style*:
* *Virtual hosted* style buckets are addressed as __\https://<bucket>.<endpoint>__. +
* *Path* style buckets are addressed as __\https://<endpoint>/<bucket>__.
. Enter the *Access Key ID* and the *Secret Access Key*.
. Select *Test* to confirm that the integration with the S3 is working.
. Select *Create* to generate the configuration.

After the integration is configured, {product-title-short} automatically backs up all data according to the specified schedule.
