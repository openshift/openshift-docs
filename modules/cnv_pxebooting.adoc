[[pxebooting]]
=== PXE booting with a specified MAC address

PXE booting, or network booting, is supported in {ProductName}. 
Network booting allows a computer to boot and load an
operating system or other program without requiring a locally attached
storage device. For example, you can use it to choose your desired OS
image from a PXE server when deploying a new host.

We have provided a link:#pxetemplate[configuration file template] for
PXE booting in the Reference section of this article.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster running {product-title} 3.11 or newer
* A configured interface that allows PXE booting

.Procedure

. Configure a PXE network on the cluster:

.. Create `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` of PXE network `pxe-net-conf`:
+
----
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: pxe-net-conf
spec:
  config: '{
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "type": "ovs",
      "bridge": "br1"
    }'
----
+
NOTE: In this example, the VMI will be attached through a trunk port
to the Open vSwitch bridge `br1`.

.. Create Open vSwitch bridge `br1` and connect it to interface `eth1`,
which is connected to a network that allows for PXE booting:
+
----
$ ovs-vsctl add-br br1
$ ovs-vsctl add-port br1 eth1
$ ovs-vsctl show
8d004495-ea9a-44e1-b00c-3b65648dae5f
    Bridge br1
        Port br1
            Interface br1
                type: internal
        Port "eth1"
            Interface "eth1"
    ovs_version: "2.8.1"
----
+
NOTE: This bridge must be configured on all nodes. If it is only
available on a subset of nodes, make sure that VMIs have `nodeSelector`
constraints in place.

. Edit the virtual machine instance configuration file to include the
details of the interface and network.

.. Specify the network and MAC address, if required by the PXE server.
If the MAC address is not specified, a value will be assigned
automatically. However, please note that at this time, MAC addresses
assigned automatically will not be persistent.
+
Ensure that `bootOrder` is set to `1` so that the interface boots first.
In this example, the interface is connected to a network called
`pxe-net`:
+
----
interfaces:
- bridge: {}
  name: default
- bridge: {}
  name: pxe-net
  macAddress: de:00:00:00:00:de
  bootOrder: 1
----
+
NOTE: Boot order is global for interfaces and disks.

.. Assign a boot device number to the disk to ensure proper booting
after OS provisioning.
+
Set the disk `bootOrder` value to 2:
+
----
devices:
  disks:
  - disk: 
      bus: virtio 
    name: registrydisk 
    volumeName: registryvolume 
    bootOrder: 2 
----

.. Specify that the network is connected to the previously created
`NetworkAttachmentDefinition`. In this scenario, `pxe-net` is connected
to the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` called `pxe-net-conf`:
+
----
networks:
- name: default
  pod: {}
- name: pxe-net
  multus:
    networkName: pxe-net-conf
----

. Create the virtual machine instance:
+
----
$ oc create -f vmi-pxe-boot.yaml
virtualmachineinstance.kubevirt.io "vmi-pxe-boot" created
----

. Wait for the virtual machine instance to run:
+
----
$ oc get vmi vmi-pxe-boot -o yaml | grep -i phase
  phase: Running
----

. View the virtual machine instance using VNC:
+
`$ virtctl vnc vmi-pxe-boot`

. Watch the boot screen to verify that the PXE boot is successful.

. Login to the VMI:
+
`$ virtctl console vmi-pxe-boot`

. Verify the interfaces and MAC address on the VM. The interface
connected to the bridge will have the specified MAC address. In this
case, we used `eth1` for the PXE boot, without an IP address. The other
interface, `eth0`, got an IP address from {product-title}.
