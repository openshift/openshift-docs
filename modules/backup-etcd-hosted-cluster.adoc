= Taking a snapshot of etcd on a hosted cluster

As part of the process to back up etcd for a hosted cluster, you take a snapshot of etcd. After you take the snapshot, you can restore it, for example, as part of a disaster recovery operation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure requires API downtime.
====

.Procedure

. Pause reconciliation of the hosted cluster by entering this command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch -n clusters hostedclusters/<hosted_cluster_name> -p '{"spec":{"pausedUntil":"true"}}' --type=merge
----

. Stop all etcd-writer deployments by entering this command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deployment -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> --replicas=0 kube-apiserver openshift-apiserver openshift-oauth-apiserver
----

. To take an etcd snapshot, use the `exec` command in each etcd container by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it <etcd_pod_name> -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> -- env ETCDCTL_API=3 /usr/bin/etcdctl --cacert /etc/etcd/tls/client/etcd-client-ca.crt --cert /etc/etcd/tls/client/etcd-client.crt --key /etc/etcd/tls/client/etcd-client.key --endpoints=localhost:2379 snapshot save /var/lib/data/snapshot.db
----

. To check the snapshot status, use the `exec` command in each etcd container by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it <etcd_pod_name> -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> -- env ETCDCTL_API=3 /usr/bin/etcdctl -w table snapshot status /var/lib/data/snapshot.db
----

. Copy the snapshot data to a location where you can retrieve it later, such as an S3 bucket, as shown in the following example.
+
[NOTE]
====
The following example uses signature version 2. If you are in a region that supports signature version 4, such as the us-east-2 region, use signature version 4. Otherwise, if you use signature version 2 to copy the snapshot to an S3 bucket, the upload fails and signature version 2 is deprecated.
====
+
.Example
[source,terminal]
----
BUCKET_NAME=somebucket
FILEPATH="/${BUCKET_NAME}/${CLUSTER_NAME}-snapshot.db"
CONTENT_TYPE="application/x-compressed-tar"
DATE_VALUE=`date -R`
SIGNATURE_STRING="PUT\n\n${CONTENT_TYPE}\n${DATE_VALUE}\n${FILEPATH}"
ACCESS_KEY=accesskey
SECRET_KEY=secret
SIGNATURE_HASH=`echo -en ${SIGNATURE_STRING} | openssl sha1 -hmac ${SECRET_KEY} -binary | base64`

oc exec -it etcd-0 -n ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE} -- curl -X PUT -T "/var/lib/data/snapshot.db" \
  -H "Host: ${BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com" \
  -H "Date: ${DATE_VALUE}" \
  -H "Content-Type: ${CONTENT_TYPE}" \
  -H "Authorization: AWS ${ACCESS_KEY}:${SIGNATURE_HASH}" \
  https://${BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com/${CLUSTER_NAME}-snapshot.db
----

. If you want to be able to restore the snapshot on a new cluster later, save the encryption secret that the hosted cluster references, as shown in this example:
+
.Example
[source,terminal]
----
oc get hostedcluster $CLUSTER_NAME -o=jsonpath='{.spec.secretEncryption.aescbc}'
{"activeKey":{"name":"CLUSTER_NAME-etcd-encryption-key"}}

# Save this secret, or the key it contains so the etcd data can later be decrypted
oc get secret ${CLUSTER_NAME}-etcd-encryption-key -o=jsonpath='{.data.key}'
----

.Next steps

Restore the etcd snapshot.
