[id="access-default-service-serving-configmap_{context}"]
= Access the service CA bundle in the default config map

A pod can access the service CA certificate by mounting the default
`ConfigMap` object that exists in every namespace (project). The service CA
certificate is in the `service-ca.crt` key of the `openshift-service-ca.crt`
config map. Access to this CA certificate allows TLS clients to verify
connections to services using service serving certificates.

.Procedure

. View the default config map:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap openshift-service-ca.crt -o yaml
----
+
The CA bundle is displayed as the value of the `service-ca.crt` key in the YAML output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  service-ca.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
----

. Mount the config map as a volume to each container that exists in a pod by configuring your `Deployment` object.
+
.Example Deployment object that defines the volume for the mounted config map

            readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: trusted-ca
        configMap:
          name: openshift-service-ca.crt <1>
          items:
            - key: ca-bundle.crt <2>
              path: tls-ca-bundle.pem <3>
# ...
----
<1> `openshift-service-ca.crt` is the name of the default config map.
<2> `ca-bundle.crt` is required as the ConfigMap key.
<3> `tls-ca-bundle.pem` is required as the ConfigMap path.
