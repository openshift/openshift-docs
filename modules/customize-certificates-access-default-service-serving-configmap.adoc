= Access the service CA bundle in the default config map

A pod can access the service CA certificate by mounting the default
`ConfigMap` object that exists in every project. The service CA
certificate is in the `service-ca.crt` key of the `openshift-service-ca.crt`
config map. Access to this CA certificate allows TLS clients to verify
connections to services using service serving certificates.

.Procedure

. View the config map to ensure that the service CA bundle is available:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap openshift-service-ca.crt -o yaml
----
+
The CA bundle is displayed as the value of the `service-ca.crt` key in the YAML output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  service-ca.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
