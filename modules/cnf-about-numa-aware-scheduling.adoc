== Introduction to NUMA

Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is a compute platform architecture that allows different CPUs to access different regions of memory at different speeds. NUMA resource topology refers to the locations of CPUs, memory, and PCI devices relative to each other in the compute node. Colocated resources are said to be in the same _NUMA zone_. For high-performance applications, the cluster needs to process pod workloads in a single NUMA zone.

== Performance considerations

NUMA architecture allows a CPU with multiple memory controllers to use any available memory across CPU complexes, regardless of where the memory is located. This allows for increased flexibility at the expense of performance. A CPU processing a workload using memory that is outside its NUMA zone is slower than a workload processed in a single NUMA zone. Also, for I/O-constrained workloads, the network interface on a distant NUMA zone slows down how quickly information can reach the application. High-performance workloads, such as telecommunications workloads, cannot operate to specification under these conditions.

== NUMA-aware scheduling

NUMA-aware scheduling aligns the requested cluster compute resources (CPUs, memory, devices) in the same NUMA zone to process latency-sensitive or high-performance workloads efficiently. NUMA-aware scheduling also improves pod density per compute node for greater resource efficiency.

== Integration with Node Tuning Operator

By integrating the Node Tuning Operator's performance profile with NUMA-aware scheduling, you can further configure CPU affinity to optimize performance for latency-sensitive workloads.

[id="default-scheduling-logic_{context}"]
== Default scheduling logic

The default {product-title} pod scheduler scheduling logic considers the available resources of the entire compute node, not individual NUMA zones. If the most restrictive resource alignment is requested in the kubelet topology manager, error conditions can occur when admitting the pod to a node. Conversely, if the most restrictive resource alignment is not requested, the pod can be admitted to the node without proper resource alignment, leading to worse or unpredictable performance. For example, runaway pod creation with `Topology Affinity Error` statuses can occur when the pod scheduler makes suboptimal scheduling decisions for guaranteed pod workloads without knowing if the pod's requested resources are available. Scheduling mismatch decisions can cause indefinite pod startup delays. Also, depending on the cluster state and resource allocation, poor pod scheduling decisions can cause extra load on the cluster because of failed startup attempts.

== NUMA-aware pod scheduling diagram

The NUMA Resources Operator deploys a custom NUMA resources secondary scheduler and other resources to mitigate against the shortcomings of the default {product-title} pod scheduler. The following diagram provides a high-level overview of NUMA-aware pod scheduling.

NodeResourceTopology API:: The `NodeResourceTopology` API describes the available NUMA zone resources in each compute node.
NUMA-aware scheduler:: The NUMA-aware secondary scheduler receives information about the available NUMA zones from the `NodeResourceTopology` API and schedules high-performance workloads on a node where it can be optimally processed.
Node topology exporter:: The node topology exporter exposes the available NUMA zone resources for each compute node to the `NodeResourceTopology` API. The node topology exporter daemon tracks the resource allocation from the kubelet by using the `PodResources` API.
PodResources API:: The `PodResources` API is local to each node and exposes the resource topology and available resources to the kubelet.
