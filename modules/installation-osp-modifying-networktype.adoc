= Modifying the network type

By default, the installation program selects the `OpenShiftSDN` network type. To use Kuryr instead, change the value in the installation configuration file that the program generated.

.Prerequisites

* You have the file `install-config.yaml` that was generated by the {product-title} installation program

.Procedure

. In a command prompt, browse to the directory that contains `install-config.yaml`.

. From that directory, either run a script to edit the `install-config.yaml` file or update the file manually:

** To set the value by using a script, run:
+
----
$ python -c '
import yaml;
path = "install-config.yaml";
data = yaml.safe_load(open(path));
data["networking"]["networkType"] = "Kuryr";
open(path, "w").write(yaml.dump(data, default_flow_style=False))'
----

** To set the value manually, open the file and set `networking.networkType` to `"Kuryr"`.
