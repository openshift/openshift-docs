== Bug fixes

* Before this update, clusters with a large number of nodes could overwhelm the Kubernetes API server with requests during collector upgrade.
This update enables caching of Kubernetes API server calls and introduces the `MaxUnavailable` field in the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR) to tune collector rollout strategy. 
Use the `MaxUnavailable` field for collectors during upgrade so as to not overwhelm the Kubernetes API server with requests. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7597[LOG-7597])

* Before this update, Vector could not recover from silently closed TCP connections. With this update, Vector uses `keepalive` probes to detect and automatically re-establish unresponsive TCP connections. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7753[LOG-7753])

* Before this update, buffer corruption following an out-of-memory (OOM) event caused deserialization errors that blocked log forwarding and reduced {LoggingProductName} resilience. This update improves the recovery logic for corrupted buffer files and prevents log forwarding issues after OOM events. The collector now successfully recovers from OOM events and subsequent buffer corruption, ensuring continuous log forwarding. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7873[LOG-7873])
