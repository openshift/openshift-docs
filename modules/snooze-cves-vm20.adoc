= Snoozing platform and node CVEs

[role="_abstract"]
You can snooze platform and node CVEs that do not relate to your infrastructure. You can snooze CVEs for 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, or indefinitely, until you unsnooze them. Snoozing a CVE takes effect immediately and does not require an additional approval step.

[NOTE]
====
The ability to snooze a CVE is not enabled by default in the web portal or in the API. To enable the ability to snooze CVEs, set the runtime environment variable `ROX_VULN_MGMT_LEGACY_SNOOZE` to `true`.
