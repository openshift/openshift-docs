= Filter Processor

[role="_abstract"]
The Filter Processor leverages the OpenTelemetry Transformation Language to establish criteria for discarding telemetry data. If any of these conditions are satisfied, the telemetry data are discarded. You can combine the conditions by using the logical OR operator. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.

  config:
    processors:

        error_mode: ignore # <1>
        traces:

----
<1> Defines the error mode. When set to `ignore`, ignores errors returned by conditions. When set to `propagate`, returns the error up the pipeline. An error causes the payload to be dropped from the Collector.
<2> Filters the spans that have the `container.name == app_container_1` attribute.
<3> Filters the spans that have the `host.name == localhost` resource attribute.
