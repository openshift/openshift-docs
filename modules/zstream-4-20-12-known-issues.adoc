This release contains the following known issues:


* If a `must-gather` archive features a custom namespace directory ending with the suffix `nodes`, the Performance Profile Creator tool fails to analyze the archive. This occurs because of the tool's search logic, which incorrectly reports a `multiple matches` error. To work around this problem, rename the custom namespace directory so that it does not end with the `nodes` suffix, and run the tool again. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-63751[OCPBUGS-63751])

* Upgrading to {product-title} 4.20 sets incorrect `ulimit` values and caused serverless Operator issues. To resolve this issue, upgrade to a nightly build later than {product-title} `4.20.0-0.nightly-2026-01-16-181948`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-70201[OCPBUGS-70201])
