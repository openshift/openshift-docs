= About {product-title}

Working with resource-constrained field environments and hardware presents many challenges not experienced with cloud computing. {product-title} enables you to solve problems for edge devices by:

* Overcoming the operational challenge of minimal system resources, for example, a {op-system-chip}.
* Addressing the environmental challenges of severe networking constraints such as low or no connectivity.
* Meeting the physical constraint of hard-to-access locations by installing your system images directly on edge devices.
* Building on and integrating with edge-optimized operating systems such as {op-system-first}.

{product-title} has the simplicity of single-node deployment with the functions and services you need for computing in resource-constrained locations. You can have many deployments on different hosts, creating the specific system image needed for each of your applications. Installing {product-title} on top of your managed {op-system} devices in hard-to-service locations also allows for streamlined over-the-air updates.
