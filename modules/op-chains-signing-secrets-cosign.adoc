= Manually generating signing secrets with the cosign tool

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the `cosign` signing scheme with {tekton-chains} by using the `cosign` tool.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the Cosign tool. For information about installing the Cosign tool, see the link:https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/[Sigstore documentation for Cosign].

.Procedure

. Generate the `cosign.key` and `cosign.pub` key pairs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cosign generate-key-pair k8s://openshift-pipelines/signing-secrets
----
+
Cosign prompts you for a password and then creates a Kubernetes secret.

. Store the encrypted `cosign.key` private key and the `cosign.password` decryption password in the `signing-secrets` Kubernetes secret. Ensure that you store the private key as an encrypted Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) file of the `ENCRYPTED COSIGN PRIVATE KEY` type.
