= Building the ignition files

To build the Ignition files from the manifest files you just generated and modified, you run the installation program. This action creates a {op-system-first} machine, `initramfs`, which fetches the ignition files and performs the configurations needed to bring a node to life.

In addition to the Ignition files, the installation program generates the following:

* An `auth` directory that contains the admin credentials for connecting to the cluster with the `oc` and `kubectl` utilities.
* A `metadata.json` file that contains information such as the OCP cluster name, OCP cluster ID, and the `infraID` for the current installation.

The Ansible playbooks for this installation process use the value of `infraID` as a prefix for the virtual machines they create. This prevents naming conflicts when there are multiple installations in the same oVirt/{rh-virtualization} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Certificates in Ignition configuration files expire after 24 hours. Complete the cluster installation and keep the cluster running in a non-degraded state for 24 hours so that the first certificate rotation can finish.
