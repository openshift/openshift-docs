= About RukPak
endif::[]

RukPak is a pluggable solution for packaging and distributing cloud-native content. It supports advanced strategies for installation, updates, and policy.

RukPak provides a content ecosystem for installing a variety of artifacts on a Kubernetes cluster. Artifact examples include Git repositories, Helm charts, and OLM bundles. RukPak can then manage, scale, and upgrade these artifacts in a safe way to enable powerful cluster extensions.

At its core, RukPak is a small set of APIs and controllers. The APIs are packaged as custom resource definitions (CRDs) that express what content to install on a cluster and how to create a running deployment of the content. The controllers watch for the APIs.
