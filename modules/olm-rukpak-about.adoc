{product-title} 4.12 introduces the _platform Operator_ type as a Technology Preview feature. The platform Operator mechanism relies on the RukPak component, also introduced in {product-title} 4.12, and its resources to manage content.

RukPak consists of a series of controllers, known as _provisioners_, that install and manage content on a Kubernetes cluster. RukPak also provides two primary APIs: `Bundle` and `BundleDeployment`. These components work together to bring content onto the cluster and install it, generating resources within the cluster.

A provisioner places a watch on both `Bundle` and `BundleDeployment` resources that refer to the provisioner explicitly. For a given bundle, the provisioner unpacks the contents of the `Bundle` resource onto the cluster. Then, given a `BundleDeployment` resource referring to that bundle, the provisioner installs the bundle contents and is responsible for managing the lifecycle of those resources.

Two provisioners are currently implemented and bundled with RukPak: the _plain provisioner_ that sources and unpacks `plain+v0` bundles, and the _registry provisioner_ that sources and unpacks Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) `registry+v1` bundles.
