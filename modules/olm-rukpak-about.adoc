= About RukPak
endif::[]

RukPak is a pluggable solution for packaging and distributing cloud-native content. It supports advanced strategies for installation, updates, and policy.

RukPak provides a content ecosystem for installing artifacts on a Kubernetes cluster. In {product-title} 4.16, RukPak supports {olmv0-first} bundles as artifacts. RukPak can then manage, scale, and upgrade these artifacts in a safe way to enable powerful cluster extensions.

At its core, RukPak is a set of controllers and the `BundleDeployment` API. The API is packaged as a custom resource definition (CRD) that expresses what content to install on a cluster and how to create a running deployment of the content. The controllers watch for the API.
