= Knative Serving supported installation configuration options

This guide provides information for cluster administrators about advanced installation configuration options for Knative Serving.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not modify any YAML contained inside the `config` field. Some of the configuration values in this field are injected by the {ServerlessOperatorName}, and modifying them will cause your deployment to become unsupported.

== Controller Custom Certs

If your registry uses a self-signed certificate, you must enable tag-to-digest resolution by creating a config map or secret.
The {ServerlessOperatorName} then automatically configures Knative Serving controller access to the registry.

To enable tag-to-digest resolution, the Knative Serving controller requires access to the container registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The config map or secret must reside in the same namespace as the Knative Serving custom resource definition (CRD).
====

The following example triggers the {ServerlessOperatorName} to:

. Create and mount a volume containing the certificate in the controller.
. Set the required environment variable properly.

.Example YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeServing
metadata:
  name: knative-serving
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  controller-custom-certs:
    name: certs
    type: ConfigMap
----

The following example uses a certificate in a config map named `certs` in the `knative-serving` namespace.

The supported types are `ConfigMap` and `Secret`.

If no controller custom cert  is specified, this defaults to the `config-service-ca` config map.

.Example default YAML
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  controller-custom-certs:
    name: config-service-ca
    type: ConfigMap
----

== High availability

High availability (HA) defaults to `2` replicas per controller if no number of replicas is specified.

You can set this to `1` to disable HA, or add more replicas by setting a higher integer.

.Example YAML
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  high-availability:
    replicas: 2
