[id="knative-serving-advanced-config_{context}"]
= Advanced configuration options

You can install Knative Serving by using the default settings or configure more advanced settings in the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR). By configuring these advanced settings, you can modify functionality such as use of certificates for your Knative Serving deployment and the number of high availability replicas that are available.
// needs an update once more options are documented here

[id="knative-serving-controller-custom-certs_{context}"]
== Controller custom certs

If your registry uses a self-signed certificate, you must enable tag-to-digest resolution by creating a config map or secret.
To enable tag-to-digest resolution, the Knative Serving controller requires access to the container registry.

The following example `KnativeServing` custom resource configuration uses a certificate in a config map named `certs` in the `knative-serving` namespace.
This example triggers the {ServerlessOperatorName} to:

. Create and mount a volume containing the certificate in the controller.
. Set the required environment variable properly.

.Example YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeServing
metadata:
  name: knative-serving
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  controller-custom-certs:
    name: config-service-ca
    type: ConfigMap <1>
----
<1> The supported types are `ConfigMap` and `Secret`.

If no controller custom cert is specified, this setting defaults to use the `config-service-ca` config map.

After tag-to-digest resolution is enabled, the {ServerlessOperatorName} automatically configures Knative Serving controller access to the registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The config map or secret must reside in the same namespace as the Knative Serving custom resource definition (CRD).

[id="knative-serving-high-availability_{context}"]
== High availability

High availability, which can be configured using the `spec.high-availability` field, defaults to `2` replicas per controller if no number of replicas is specified by a user during the Knative Serving installation.

You can set this to `1` to disable high availability, or add more replicas by setting a higher integer.
