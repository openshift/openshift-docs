= Knative Serving advanced configuration options

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not modify any YAML contained inside the `config` field. Some of the configuration values in this field are injected by the {ServerlessOperatorName}, and modifying them will cause your deployment to become unsupported.

[id="knative-serving-controller-custom-certs_{context}"]
== Controller Custom Certs

If your registry uses a self-signed certificate, you must enable tag-to-digest resolution by creating a config map or secret.
To enable tag-to-digest resolution, the Knative Serving controller requires access to the container registry.

The following example `KnativeServing` custom resource configuration uses a certificate in a config map named `certs` in the `knative-serving` namespace.
This example triggers the {ServerlessOperatorName} to:

. Create and mount a volume containing the certificate in the controller.
. Set the required environment variable properly.

.Example YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeServing
metadata:
  name: knative-serving
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  controller-custom-certs:
    name: config-service-ca
    type: ConfigMap <1>
----
<1> The supported types are `ConfigMap` and `Secret`.

If no controller custom cert is specified, this setting defaults to use the `config-service-ca` config map.

After tag-to-digest resolution is enabled, the {ServerlessOperatorName} automatically configures Knative Serving controller access to the registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The config map or secret must reside in the same namespace as the Knative Serving custom resource definition (CRD).
====

[id="knative-serving-high-availability_{context}"]
== High availability

High availability, which can be configured using the `spec.high-availability` field, defaults to `2` replicas per controller if no number of replicas is specified by a user during the Knative Serving installation.

You can set this to `1` to disable high availability, or add more replicas by setting a higher integer.

apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeServing
metadata:
  name: knative-serving
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  high-availability:
