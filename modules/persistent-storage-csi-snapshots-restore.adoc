= Restoring a volume snapshot

The `VolumeSnapshot` CRD content can be used to restore the existing volume to a previous state.

After your `VolumeSnapshot` CRD is bound and the `readyToUse` value is set to `true`, you can use that resource to provision a new volume that is pre-populated with data from the snapshot.

.Prerequisites
* Logged in to a running {product-title} cluster.
* A persistent volume claim (PVC) created using a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver that supports volume snapshots.
* A storage class to provision the storage back end.

.Procedure

. Specify a `VolumeSnapshot` data source on a PVC as shown in the following:
+
.pvc-restore.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: myclaim-restore
spec:
  storageClassName: csi-hostpath-sc
  dataSource:
    name: mysnap <1>
    kind: VolumeSnapshot <2>
    apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io <3>
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
----
<1> Name of the `VolumeSnapshot` object representing the snapshot to use as source.
<2> Must be set to the `VolumeSnapshot` value.
<3> Must be set to the `snapshot.storage.k8s.io` value.

. Create a PVC by entering the following command:

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f pvc-restore.yaml
----

. Verify that the restored PVC has been created by entering the following command:

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pvc
----
+
Two different PVCs are displayed.
