= About migration hooks

You can use migration hooks to run custom code at certain points during a migration with the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}). You can add up to four migration hooks to a single migration plan, with each hook running at a different phase of the migration.

Migration hooks perform tasks such as customizing application quiescence, manually migrating unsupported data types, and updating applications after migration.

A migration hook runs on a source or a target cluster at one of the following migration steps:

* `PreBackup`: Before resources are backed up on the source cluster
* `PostBackup`: After resources are backed up on the source cluster
* `PreRestore`: Before resources are restored on the target cluster
* `PostRestore`: After resources are restored on the target cluster

You can create a hook by using an Ansible playbook or a custom hook container.

.Ansible playbook

The Ansible playbook is mounted on a hook container as a config map. The hook container runs as a job, using the cluster, service account, and namespace specified in the `MigPlan` custom resource (CR). The job continues to run until it reaches the the default limit of 6 retries or a successful completion. This continues even if the initial pod is evicted or killed.

The default Ansible runtime image is `registry.redhat.io/rhmtc/openshift-migration-hook-runner-rhel7:latest`. This image is based on the Ansible Runner image and includes `python-openshift` for Ansible Kubernetes resources and an updated `oc` binary.

Optional: You can use a custom Ansible runtime image containing additional Ansible modules or tools instead of the default image.

.Custom hook container

You can create a custom hook container that includes Ansible playbooks or custom code.
