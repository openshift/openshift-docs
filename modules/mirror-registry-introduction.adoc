= Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift introduction

For disconnected deployments of {product-title}, a container registry is required to carry out the installation of the clusters. To run a production-grade registry service on such a cluster, you must create a separate registry deployment to install the first cluster. The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ addresses this need and is included in every OpenShift subscription. It is available for download on the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-mirror-registry[OpenShift console *Downloads*] page.

The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ allows users to install a small-scale version of Red Hat Quay and its required components using the `mirror-registry` command line interface (CLI) tool. The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is deployed automatically with pre-configured local storage and a local database. It also includes auto-generated user credentials and access permissions with a single set of inputs and no additional configuration choices to get started.

The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ provides a pre-determined network configuration and reports deployed component credentials and access URLs upon success. A limited set of optional configuration inputs like fully qualified domain name (FQDN) services, superuser name and password, and custom TLS certificates are also provided. This provides users with a container registry so that they can easily create an offline mirror of all {product-title} release content when running {product-title} in restricted network environments.

Use of the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is optional if another container registry is already available in the install environment.

== Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift limitations

The following limitations apply to the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_:

* The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is not a highly-available registry and only local file system storage is supported. It is not intended to replace {quay} or the internal image registry for {product-title}. 

* The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is only supported for hosting images that are required to install a disconnected {product-title} cluster, such as Release images or Red Hat Operator images. It uses local storage on your {op-system-base-full} machine, and storage supported by {op-system-base} is supported by the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_. 

* Support for Red Hat product images that are pushed to the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ for bootstrapping purposes are covered by valid subscriptions for each respective product. A list of exceptions to further enable the bootstrap experience can be found on the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/self-managed-openshift-sizing-subscription-guide[Self-managed Red Hat OpenShift sizing and subscription guide]. 

* Images that are not intended for bootstrapping are not supported by the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_. 

* Content built by customers should not be hosted by the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_. 

* Using the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ with more than one cluster is discouraged because multiple clusters can create a single point of failure when updating your cluster fleet. It is advised to leverage the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ to install a cluster that can host a production-grade, highly-available registry such as {quay}, which can serve {product-title} content to other clusters.
