= Removing unused components if you do not use the default Elasticsearch log store

As an administrator, in the rare case that you forward logs to a third-party log store and do not use the default Elasticsearch log store, you can remove several unused components from your logging cluster.

In other words, if you do not use the default Elasticsearch log store, you can remove the internal Elasticsearch `logStore` and Kibana `visualization` components from the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR). Removing these components is optional but saves resources.

.Prerequisites

* Verify that your log forwarder does not send log data to the default internal Elasticsearch cluster. Inspect the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR YAML file that you used to configure log forwarding. Verify that it _does not_ have an `outputRefs` element that specifies `default`. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
outputRefs:
- default
----

[WARNING]
====
Suppose the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR forwards log data to the internal Elasticsearch cluster, and you remove the `logStore` component from the `ClusterLogging` CR. In that case, the internal Elasticsearch cluster will not be present to store the log data. This absence can cause data loss.
====

.Procedure

. Edit the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) in the `openshift-logging` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit ClusterLogging instance
----

. If they are present, remove the `logStore` and `visualization` stanzas from the `ClusterLogging` CR.

. Preserve the `collection` stanza of the `ClusterLogging` CR. The result should look similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "instance"
  namespace: "openshift-logging"
spec:
  managementState: "Managed"
  collection:
    type: "fluentd"
    fluentd: {}
----

. Verify that the collector pods are redeployed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -l component=collector -n openshift-logging
----
