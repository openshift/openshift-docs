= Choosing between service types and API resources

Service types and API resources offer different benefits for exposing applications and securing network connections. By leveraging the appropriate service type or API resource, you can effectively manage how your applications are exposed and ensure secure, reliable access for both internal and external clients.

{product-title} supports the following service types and API resources:

* Service Types

** `ClusterIP` is intended for internal-only exposure. It is easy to set up and provides a stable internal IP address for accessing services within the cluster. `ClusterIP` is suitable for communication between services within the cluster.

** `NodePort` allows external access by exposing the service on each node's IP at a static port. It is straightforward to set up and useful for development and testing. `NodePort` is good for simple external access without the need for a load balancer from the cloud provider.

** `LoadBalancer` automatically provisions an external load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple nodes.
It is ideal for production environments where reliable, high-availability access is needed.

** `ExternalName` maps a service to an external DNS name to allow services outside the cluster to be accessed using the service's DNS name. It is good for integrating external services or legacy systems with the cluster.

** Headless service is a DNS name that returns the list of pod IPs without providing a stable `ClusterIP`. This is ideal for stateful applications or scenarios where direct access to individual pod IPs is needed.

* API Resources

** `Ingress` provides control over routing HTTP and HTTPS traffic, including support for load balancing, SSL/TLS termination, and name-based virtual hosting. It is more flexible than services alone and supports multiple domains and paths. `Ingress` is ideal when complex routing is required.

** `Route` is similar to `Ingress` but provides additional features, including TLS re-encryption and passthrough. It simplifies the process of exposing services externally. `Route` is best for when you need advanced features, such as integrated certificate management.

If you need a simple way to expose a service to external traffic, `Route` or `Ingress` might be the best choice. These resources can be managed by a namespace admin or developer. The easiest approach is to create a route, check its external DNS name, and configure your DNS to have a CNAME that points to the external DNS name. 

For HTTP/HTTPS/TLS, `Route` or `Ingress` should suffice. Anything else is more complex and requires a cluster admin to ensure ports are accessible or MetalLB is configured. `LoadBalancer` services are also an option in cloud environments or appropriately configured bare-metal environments.
