= {pac} concepts

{pac} interacts with your Git repository provider. To use {pac}, you must first configure this integration.

You can use {pac} with any number of repositories within your Git repository provider. For each repository, you must create a `Repository` custom resource (CR) within an {OCP} namespace that you control. This CR contains information that {pac} can use to access this repository.

{pac} starts the pipeline runs for a repository within the namespace in which the `Repository` CR for this repository is located.

Inside your Git repository, you must create a `.tekton` directory and place pipeline run definitions as YAML files in this directory. Each pipeline run that you define must include annotations that determine the events that must trigger this pipeline run. The definition can also reference other YAML files in the same directory; for example, you can define a pipeline in a separate YAML file and refer to this pipeline in the pipeline run file.

When a matching event happens, {pac} creates a `PipelineRun` CR based on the definition that you provided in the repository. Creating a `PipelineRun` CR triggers execution of the pipeline that is defined in the pipeline run.
