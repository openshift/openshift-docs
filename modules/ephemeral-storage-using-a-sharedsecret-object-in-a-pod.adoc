= Using a SharedSecret custom resource in a pod

[role="_abstract"]
To access the `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) from a pod, you grant role-based access control (RBAC) permission to a service account.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a `SharedSecret` CR instance for the `Secret` object that you want to share across namespaces in the cluster.
* You must have permissions to perform the following actions:
** Run the `oc adm policy who-can use <sharedsecret_identifier>` command to check if a service account is allowed to use the `SharedSecret` CR and the service account is listed in your namespace.
** Confirm that the service account of your pod is allowed to use the `csi` volume. If you created the pod as a user, confirm that you are allowed to use the `csi` volume.

[NOTE]
====
If you are unable to complete the last two prerequisites, the cluster administrator can establish the necessary RBAC permission so that you can enable service accounts to use the `SharedSecret` CR.
====

.Procedure

. Create the `RoleBinding` object in the cluster associated with the role and grant the permission to your service account to use the shared resource. See the following example configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: use-shared-secret <1>
  namespace: app-namespace
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: use-shared-secret
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: <service_account_name> <2> 
----
<1> Name of the `RoleBinding` CR. 
<2> Replace `<service_account_name>` with the service account name of your application.

. Mount the shared resource `csi` driver into a pod or any other resource that accepts `csi` volumes. See the following example configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-shared-secret
  namespace: <app_namespace> <1>
spec:
  ...
  serviceAccountName: default
  volumes:
    - name: shared-secret
      csi:
        readOnly: true 
        driver: csi.sharedresource.openshift.io
        volumeAttributes:
          sharedSecret: shared-test-secret <2>
----
<1> Replace <app_namespace> with the namespace name of your application.
<2> Value of the `sharedSecret` attribute that must be same as the name of the `SharedSecret` CR.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the value of the `sharedSecret` attribute does not match the name of the `SharedSecret` instance, the pod fails to start.
