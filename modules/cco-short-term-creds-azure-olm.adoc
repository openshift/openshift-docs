= OLM-managed Operator support for authentication with Azure AD Workload Identity

In addition to {product-title} cluster components, some Operators managed by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on Azure clusters can use manual mode with Azure AD Workload Identity. These Operators authenticate with short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster. To determine if an Operator supports authentication with Azure AD Workload Identity, see the Operator description in OperatorHub.
