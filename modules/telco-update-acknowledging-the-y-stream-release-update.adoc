= Acknowledging the y-stream release update

When moving between y-stream releases, you must run a patch command to explicitly acknowledge the update.
In the output of the `oc adm upgrade` command, a URL is provided that shows the specific command to run.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you acknowledge the update, verify that there are no Kubernetes APIs in use that are removed in the version you are updating to.
For example, in {product-title} 4.17, there are no API removals. See "Kubernetes API removals" for more information.

$ oc -n openshift-config patch cm admin-acks --patch '{"data":{"ack-4.15-kube-1.29-api-removals-in-4.16":"true"}}' --type=merge
