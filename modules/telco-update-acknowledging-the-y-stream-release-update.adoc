= Acknowledging the y-stream release update

When moving between y-stream releases, you must run a patch command to explicitly acknowledge the update.
In the output of the `oc adm upgrade` command, a URL is provided that shows the specific command to run.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you acknowledge the update, verify that there are no Kubernetes APIs in use that are removed in the version you are updating to.
For example, in {product-title} 4.18, there are no API removals.
See "Kubernetes API removals" for more information.
