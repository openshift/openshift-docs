[id="virt-creating-exposing-mediated-devices_{context}"]
= Creating and exposing mediated devices

As an administrator, you can create mediated devices and expose them to the cluster by editing the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You enabled the Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) driver.
* If your hardware vendor provides drivers, you installed them on the nodes where you want to create mediated devices.
** If you use NVIDIA cards, you link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/openshift-virtualization.html[installed the NVIDIA GRID driver].

.Procedure

. Open the `HyperConverged` CR in your default editor by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n {CNVNamespace}
----
+
.Example configuration file with mediated devices configured
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: {CNVNamespace}
spec:
  mediatedDevicesConfiguration:
    mediatedDeviceTypes:
    - nvidia-231
    nodeMediatedDeviceTypes:
    - mediatedDeviceTypes:
      - nvidia-233
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/hostname: node-11.redhat.com
  permittedHostDevices:
    mediatedDevices:
    - mdevNameSelector: GRID T4-2Q
      resourceName: nvidia.com/GRID_T4-2Q
    - mdevNameSelector: GRID T4-8Q
      resourceName: nvidia.com/GRID_T4-8Q
# ...

. Create mediated devices by adding them to the `spec.mediatedDevicesConfiguration` stanza:
+
.Example YAML snippet
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  mediatedDevicesConfiguration:
    mediatedDeviceTypes: <1>
    - <device_type>
    nodeMediatedDeviceTypes: <2>
    - mediatedDeviceTypes: <3>
      - <device_type>
      nodeSelector: <4>
        <node_selector_key>: <node_selector_value>
# ...
----
<1> Required: Configures global settings for the cluster.
<2> Optional: Overrides the global configuration for a specific node or group of nodes. Must be used with the global `mediatedDeviceTypes` configuration.
<3> Required if you use `nodeMediatedDeviceTypes`. Overrides the global `mediatedDeviceTypes` configuration for the specified nodes.
<4> Required if you use `nodeMediatedDeviceTypes`. Must include a `key:value` pair.

. Identify the name selector and resource name values for the devices that you want to expose to the cluster. You will add these values to the `HyperConverged` CR in the next step.
.. Find the `resourceName` value by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get $NODE -o json \
  | jq '.status.allocatable \
    | with_entries(select(.key | startswith("nvidia.com/"))) \
    | with_entries(select(.value != "0"))'
----

.. Find the `mdevNameSelector` value by viewing the contents of `/sys/bus/pci/devices/<slot>:<bus>:<domain>.<function>/mdev_supported_types/<type>/name`, substituting the correct values for your system.
+
For example, the name file for the `nvidia-231` type contains the selector string `GRID T4-2Q`. Using `GRID T4-2Q` as the `mdevNameSelector` value allows nodes to use the `nvidia-231` type.

. Expose the mediated devices to the cluster by adding the `mdevNameSelector` and `resourceName` values to the 
`spec.permittedHostDevices.mediatedDevices` stanza of the `HyperConverged` CR:
+
.Example YAML snippet
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
  permittedHostDevices:
    mediatedDevices:
    - mdevNameSelector: GRID T4-2Q <1>
      resourceName: nvidia.com/GRID_T4-2Q <2>
# ...
----
<1> Exposes the mediated devices that map to this value on the host.
<2> Matches the resource name that is allocated on the node.

. Save your changes and exit the editor.

.Verification

* Optional: Confirm that a device was added to a specific node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node <node_name>
