= Creating and exposing mediated devices

You can expose and create mediated devices such as virtual GPUs (vGPUs) by editing the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You enabled the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) driver.

.Procedure

. Edit the `HyperConverged` CR in your default editor by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv
----

. Add the mediated device information to the `HyperConverged` CR `spec`, ensuring that you include the `mediatedDevicesConfiguration` and `permittedHostDevices` stanzas. For example:
+
.Example configuration file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  mediatedDevicesConfiguration: <.>
    mediatedDevicesTypes: <.>
    - nvidia-231
    nodeMediatedDeviceTypes: <.>
    - mediatedDevicesTypes: <.>
      - nvidia-233
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/hostname: node-11.redhat.com
  permittedHostDevices: <.>
    mediatedDevices:
    - mdevNameSelector: GRID T4-2Q
      resourceName: nvidia.com/GRID_T4-2Q
    - mdevNameSelector: GRID T4-8Q
      resourceName: nvidia.com/GRID_T4-8Q
...
----
<.> Creates mediated devices.
<.> Required: Global `mediatedDevicesTypes` configuration.
<.> Optional: Overrides the global configuration for specific nodes.
<.> Required if you use `nodeMediatedDeviceTypes`.
<.> Exposes mediated devices to the cluster.

. Save your changes and exit the editor.

.Verification

* You can verify that a device was added to a specific node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node <node_name>
