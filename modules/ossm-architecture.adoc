= {ProductName} Architecture

{ProductName} is logically split into a data plane and a control plane:

The *data plane* is a set of intelligent proxies deployed as sidecars. These proxies intercept and control all inbound and outbound network communication between microservices in the service mesh.

* *Envoy proxy* intercepts all inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service mesh. Envoy is deployed as a sidecar to the relevant service in the same pod.

The *control plane* manages and configures Istiod to enforce proxies to route traffic.

Istiod provides service discovery, configuration and certificate management. It converts high-level routing rules to Envoy configurations and propagates them to the sidecars at runtime.

Secret Discovery Service (SDS) distributes certificates and keys to sidecars directly from Istiod.

{ProductName} also uses the *istio-operator* to manage the installation of the control plane. An _Operator_ is a piece of software that enables you to implement and automate common activities in your OpenShift cluster. It acts as a controller, allowing you to set or change the desired state of objects in your cluster.
