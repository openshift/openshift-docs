= How the network interface is selected

For installations on bare metal or with virtual machines that have more than one network interface controller (NIC), the NIC that {product-title} uses for communication with the Kubernetes API server is determined by the `nodeip-configuration.service` service unit that is run by `systemd` when the node boots. The `nodeip-configuration.service` selects the IP from the interface associated with the default route.

After the `nodeip-configuration.service` service determines the correct NIC, the service creates the `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/20-nodenet.conf` file. The `20-nodenet.conf` file sets the `KUBELET_NODE_IP` environment variable to the IP address that the service selected.

When the kubelet service starts, it reads the value of the environment variable from the `20-nodenet.conf` file and sets the IP address as the value of the `--node-ip` kubelet command-line argument. As a result, the kubelet service uses the selected IP address as the node IP address.

If hardware or networking is reconfigured after installation, or if there is a networking layout where the node IP should not come from the default route interface, it is possible for the `nodeip-configuration.service` service to select a different NIC after a reboot. In some cases, you might be able to detect that a different NIC is selected by reviewing the `INTERNAL-IP` column in the output from the `oc get nodes -o wide` command.

If network communication is disrupted or misconfigured because a different NIC is selected, you might receive the following error: `EtcdCertSignerControllerDegraded`. You can create a hint file that includes the `NODEIP_HINT` variable to override the default IP selection logic. For more information, see Optional: Overriding the default node IP selection logic.

// Link to info for creating a machine config.

By default, the nodeip-configuration service on a cluster host will select the IP address from the interface the default route uses. If multiple default routes are present, the service will select the route with the lowest metric value. This works for the majority of deployments, but in some cases the deployment may depend on the less well-defined behavior in the Kubelet itself that was used prior to {product-title} {version 4.6}. Some less common network layouts may also find the default logic problematic. In these instances, it is necessary to override the node IP address selection logic.

.Creating a Hint file

In {product-title}, a new interface is added to the `nodeip-configuration` that allows for a hint file. This hint file contains a variable named `KUBELET_NODEIP_HINT`.

. Set the node's IP address by setting an IP address from the subnet to the `KUBELET_NODEIP_HINT` variable.

. The hint filename must be `/etc/default/nodeip-configuration` and the output should look like the following example:
