= How the network interface is selected

For installations on bare metal or with virtual machines that have more than one network interface controller (NIC), the NIC that {product-title} uses for communication with the Kubernetes API server is determined by the `nodeip-configuration.service` service unit that is run by systemd when the node boots. The `nodeip-configuration.service` selects the IP from the interface associated with the default route. 

After the `nodeip-configuration.service` service determines the correct NIC, the service creates the `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/20-nodenet.conf` file. The `20-nodenet.conf` file sets the `KUBELET_NODE_IP` environment variable to the IP address that the service selected.

When the kubelet service starts, it reads the value of the environment variable from the `20-nodenet.conf` file and sets the IP address as the value of the `--node-ip` kubelet command-line argument. As a result, the kubelet service uses the selected IP address as the node IP address.

If hardware or networking is reconfigured after installation, or if there is a networking layout where the node IP should not come from the default route interface, it is possible for the `nodeip-configuration.service` service to select a different NIC after a reboot. In some cases, you might be able to detect that a different NIC is selected by reviewing the `INTERNAL-IP` column in the output from the `oc get nodes -o wide` command.

If network communication is disrupted or misconfigured because a different NIC is selected, you might receive the following error: `EtcdCertSignerControllerDegraded`. You can create a hint file that includes the `NODEIP_HINT` variable to override the default IP selection logic. For more information, see Optional: Overriding the default node IP selection logic.
