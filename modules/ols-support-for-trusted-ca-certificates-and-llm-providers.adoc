= Support for trusted-ca certificates and LLM providers

You can establish communication with a large language model (LLM) and the {ols-long} Service using a TLS certificate. Typically, this is required if you are using a custom proxy to communicate with an LLM.

The {ols-long} Service supports adding trusted-ca certificates for the following LLM providers: 

* {rhelai} vLLM

* {rhoai} vLLM

* {openai}

* {azure-openai}

To add a trusted-ca certificate you must create a `ConfigMap` object that contains the certificates. Then, add the  name of the object to the `OLSConfig` custom resource (CR) file as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
ols:
  additionalCAConfigMapRef:
    name: <config_map_name>
