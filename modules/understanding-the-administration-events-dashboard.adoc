= Understanding the administration events dashboard

The administration events dashboard organizes information in the following groups:

* *Domain*: Categorizes events based on the specific area or domain within {product-title-short} in which they occurred. This classification helps organize and understand the context of events. Domains include `Authentication`, `General`, `Image Scanning` , and `Integrations`.
* *Resource type*: Classifies events based on the resource or component type involved. Resource types include `API Token`, `Cluster`, `Image`, `Node`, and `Notifier`.
* *Level*: Indicates the severity or importance of an event. Levels include `Error`, `Warning`, `Success`, `Info` and `Unknown`.
* *Event last occurred at*: Provides information about the timestamp and date when a particular event occurred. It helps track the timing of events, which is essential for diagnosing issues and understanding the sequence of actions or incidents.
* *Count*: Indicates the number of times a particular event occurred. This number is useful in assessing the frequency of an issue. An event that has occurred multiple times indicates a persistent issue that you need to fix.

Each event also gives you an indication of what you need to do to fix the error.
