= Using {prodname} technologies and patterns

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the following technologies and patterns with {prodname}:

Policy-based configuration::
You can use the {prodname} _policy attachment_ pattern to add behavior to a Kubernetes object by using configuration that cannot be described in the object `spec` field.

With policy attachments comes the concept of defaults and overrides. These defaults and overrides mean that you can configure different roles to operate with policy APIs at different levels of the object hierarchy. These policies are then merged with specific rules and strategies to form an effective policy than can be used across your organization.
+
For example, the following rate-limiting policy configures a specified limit of 5 requests per 10 seconds for every listener defined in the target gateway that does not have its own rate limiting policy defined:
+
.Rate-limiting policy example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1
kind: RateLimitPolicy
metadata:
  name: gw-rlp
spec:
  targetRef: # Specifies Gateway API policy attachment
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: external
  defaults: # Means it can be overridden
    limits: # Limitador component configuration
      "global":
        rates:
        - limit: 5
          window: 10s

//this seems out of place?

WebAssembly plugin::

As a link:https://webassembly.org/[WebAssembly (WASM)] plugin developed for the Envoy proxy, {prodname} is lightweight, hardware independent, non-intrusive, and secure. This means that clusters that are using {ocp} {service-mesh}, Istio, or Envoy for ingress do not require major changes to their existing ingress objects and policies to begin using {prodname}.
//do we support clusters that use Istio and Envoy?

Multicluster configuration mirroring::

You can configure and deploy your policies across different cloud service providers in a consistent way with {prodname}. {prodname} uses multicluster configuration mirroring across multicloud and hybrid cloud environments. You can deploy your routing, configuration, and policies wherever you need them with one set of CRDs.
//True? if not, what are we getting at here?
+
This means that your development, test, and production environments can be consistent. Use {prodname} to supply unified experiences, global administration, and security compliance.

API connectivity and API management::

{prodname} provides scalable multicluster and multi-gateway connectivity management, along with API management features such as API observability, authentication, and rate limiting.
