[id="cco-ccoctl-deleting-sts-resources_{context}"]
= Deleting {cp-first} resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

[role="_abstract"]
After uninstalling an {product-title} cluster that uses short-term credentials managed outside the cluster, you can use the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) to remove the {cp-first} resources that `ccoctl` created during installation.

.Prerequisites

* Extract and prepare the `ccoctl` binary.
* Uninstall an {product-title} cluster on {cp} that uses short-term credentials.

.Procedure
//GCP has extra prep steps
ifdef::gcp-workload-id[]
. Set a `$RELEASE_IMAGE` variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
----

. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) from the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests>
----
+
where:

`--included`:: The parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
`<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests>':: Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the `CredentialsRequest` objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

. Delete the {cp} resources that `ccoctl` created by running the following command:

`force-delete-custom-roles`:: Optional: This parameter deletes the custom roles that the `ccoctl` utility creates during installation. {gcp-short} does not permanently delete custom roles immediately. For more information, see {gcp-short} documentation about link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#deleting-custom-role[deleting a custom role].
