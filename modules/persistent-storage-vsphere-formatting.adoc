= Formatting VMware vSphere volumes

Before {product-title} mounts the volume and passes it to a container, it checks that the volume contains a file system that is specified by the `fsType` parameter value in the PersistentVolume (PV) definition. If the device is not formatted with the file system, all data from the device is erased, and the device is automatically formatted with the specified file system.

Because {product-title} formats them before the first use, you can use unformatted vSphere volumes as PVs.
