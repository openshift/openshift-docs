{builds-title} is an extensible framework that you can use to build container images on the {ocp-product-title} cluster. The framework supports tools, such as source-to-image, Cloud Native Buildpacks, Buildah, and others and is based on the following four elements:

Source code:: Defines the source code that you will build
Output image:: Defines the location to push your application images 
Build strategy:: Defines the strategy to assemble your application 
Invocation:: Defines the time when you want to build your application

{builds-title} consists of the following custom resources (CRs):

* `Build`
* `BuildStrategy` and `ClusterBuildStrategy`
* `BuildRun`

{builds-shortname} is based on the open source link:https://shipwright.io/[Shipwright project], which provides a framework to build container images on the Kubernetes platform.
