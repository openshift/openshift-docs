== Overview
All OpenShift applications consist of one web framework cartridge that serves web requests, and additional cartridges that provide other capabilities, such as databases, scheduled jobs, or continuous integration. When a new application is created, a URL with name of the application and the name of the domain is registered in DNS. A copy of the application code is checked out locally into a folder with the same name as the application. Note that different types of applications may require different folder structures. Application components are run on gears. 

With each new application that is created with the client tools, a remote Git repository is populated with the selected cartridge, which is then cloned to the current directory on the local machine. The host name and IP address of the application are also added to the list of known hosts in the [filename]#~/.ssh/known_hosts# directory. 

The following table describes each component that makes up an OpenShift application. 

.Application Components
[cols="2,8",options="header"]
|===
|Component|Description
						
|Domain
|The domain provides a unique group identifier for all the applications of a specific user. The domain is not directly related to DNS; instead, it is appended to the application name to form a final application URL of the form http://_app_name-domain.example.com_

|Application Name
|The name of the application is selected by a user. The final URL to access the application is of the form http://_app_name-domain.example.com_.

|Alias
|DNS names can be provided for the application by registering an alias with OpenShift and pointing the DNS entry to the OpenShift servers.
						
|Git repository
|A Git repository is used to modify application code locally. After the code is applied, the `git push` command is required to deploy the revised code.
|===

OpenShift provides dedicated [filename]#/var/tmp# and [filename]#/tmp# directories for each user application. The [filename]#/var/tmp# directory is a symbolic link to [filename]#/tmp#. Each [filename]#/tmp# directory is completely isolated from the [filename]#/tmp# directories of all other applications. Files that are untouched for any period of ten days are automatically deleted from these directories. 

== Application Life Cycle

The following table describes the general life cycle of most OpenShift applications.  
[cols="2,8",options="header"]
|===
|Process|Description
								
|Code
|Develop the application code with the desired language and tools. Continuously push the application code to the applications remote Git source code repository.
								
|Build
|OpenShift supports various build mechanisms, whether it is a simple script, a personal Jenkins continuous integration server, or an external build system.
								
|Deploy
|Every application is composed of cartridges that simplify server maintenance and configuration. OpenShift supports various technologies to provision the required services automatically.
								
|Manage
|OpenShift allows real-time monitoring, debugging, and tuning of applications. Applications are scaled automatically depending on web traffic.

== Scalable Applications

Applications can be created as either scalable or not scalable. An application that is not scalable only requires one of the quota of gears assigned to run an application, whereas a scalable application consumes two of the available gears; one for the actual application and one for the high-availability proxy (HAProxy). When an add-on cartridge, such as MySQL, is added to an application, it is installed in its own dedicated gear. Scalable applications have the advantage of automatically allocating resources based on demand. 

Scalable applications can be scaled automatically or manually. New applications are automatically scaled based on the number of requests by default. However, you can adjust the minimum and maximum number of gears to be consumed by an application within the defined limits to manually scale it.

== Creating Applications
You can create new applications with the `rhc app create` command and the available options to supply the required information, such as the type of web framework to be used with the new application. Note that if multiple versions of the specified web framework are available, you are prompted to specify the version number.

There are some factors that must be considered beforehand because certain aspects of the application cannot be changed after it is created. For example, whether an application is scalable or not must be specified when it is created. An application that is not scalable cannot be changed to scalable after it is created, and vice versa. The web framework of a cartridge also cannot be changed after an application is created. If you want to change the web framework you must delete the application and all of its data and then create a new one with the desired web framework.


The command syntax to create new applications with the `rhc app create` command is as follows:

----
rhc app create <app_name> <framework> [<cartridge>]
----

[NOTE]
====
Before you attempt to create an application, ensure that you have link:../client_tools_install_guide/overview.html[installed and configured] the client tools on your workstation.

== Command Quick Reference
[cols="8,5",options="header"]
|===

|Task |Command

|Create application
|`rhc app create _<app_name>_ _<cart_name>_`

|Create scalable application
|`rhc app create _<app_name>_ _<cart_name>_ -s`

|Create application in specified domain
|`rhc app create _<app_name>_ _<cart_name>_ -n _<domain_name>_`

|Create application from downloadable cartridge
|`rhc app create _<app_name>_ _<manifest_URL>_`

|Create application from custom code
|`rhc app create _<app_name>_ --from-code _<git_url>_`

|Delete application
|`rhc app delete _<app_name>_`

[WARNING]
====
Deleting an application deletes all remote data associated with the application, which cannot be recovered.

== Tutorial: Creating Applications
The following tutorial shows you how to create applications with available options.

*To create an application*

Use the `rhc app create` command to create the application, specifying the name of the application and the Python web framework. Note that because multiple versions of the Python framework are supported, you must specify the version you want to create:

----
$ rhc app create mypython python-3.3
Application Options
-------------------
Domain:     mydomain
Cartridges: python-3.3
Gear Size:  default
Scaling:    no

Creating application 'mypython' ... done


Waiting for your DNS name to be available ... done

Cloning into 'mypython'...
Warning: Permanently added 'mypython-mydomain.rhcloud.com' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

Your application 'mypython' is now available.

  URL:        http://mypython-mydomain.rhcloud.com/
  SSH to:     54052e482587c84787000ad7@mypython-mydomain.rhcloud.com
  Git remote: ssh://54052e482587c84787000ad7@mypython-mydomain.rhcloud.com/~/git/mypython.git/
  Cloned to:  /home/User/mypython

Run 'rhc show-app mypython' for more details about your app.
----

Although this example shows a Python application, you can substitute any web framework to create an application to suit your requirements.

*To make the application scalable*

Add the `-s` option to the `rhc app create` command to make the application scalable:

----
$ rhc app create mypython python-3.3 -s
----

When you make an application scalable, the automatic scaling feature is enabled by default. However, it is possible to scale an application manually by controlling the number of gears that are used.

[NOTE]
====
At the time of this writing, if a scalable application is created, the scaling function of that application cannot be disabled. However, it is possible to clone a non-scalable application and all its associated data and create a new scalable application using the application clone command.
====

*To specify the domain where to create the application*

If there are multiple domains in your account, the application is created in the default domain. However, you can specify the domain where the application gets created by adding the `-n` option:

----
$ rhc app create mypython python-3.3 -s -n mydomain
----

*To create an application from a downloadable cartridge*

You can create an application from a downloadable cartridge by specifying the manifest URL of the hosted cartridge:

----
$ rhc app create mypython http://www.example.com/manifest.yml
----

*To create an application with custom code*

You can create an application by using custom code from a Git repository, which becomes the initial contents of the application. To create an application with custom code, specify the URL of the Git repository: 

----
$ rhc app create mypython --from-code giturl.git
----
