== Overview
OpenShift uses the Secure Shell (SSH) network protocol to authenticate account credentials with the remote servers for secure communication, and supports both RSA and DSA keys for SSH authentication. SSH utilizes key cryptography for both the connection and for authentication. OpenShift uses SSH for performing Git operations and to provide remote access to your application gear.

When the client tools are installed and the `rhc setup` command is initially run to link:../client_tools_install_guide/configuring_client_tools.html[configure] the client tools, the setup wizard generates a new pair of SSH keys in the default [filename]#.ssh# folder of your home directory. The SSH key pair consists of the public key, [filename]#id_rsa.pub#, and the private key, [filename]#id_rsa#. As part of the initial configuration, you have the option of automatically uploading the public key, [filename]#id_rsa.pub#, to the remote server. Your account can have one or more public SSH keys associated with it, and you can access your account from any workstation that has the private SSH key on it.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends that you use the interactive setup wizard to create and configure SSH keys so that your workstation can authenticate and communicate with the remote server. Run the interactive setup wizard with the `rhc setup` command.

== Tutorial: Creating and Uploading SSH Keys 
This tutorial will show you how to generate SSH keys manually, and then upload the public key or its contents to the remote server. However Red Hat recommends that you use the interactive setup wizard to create  and upload the public SSH key to the remote server.

*To generate SSH keys manually*

Generate an SSH key pair, specifying the type of key to generate, which could be either RSA or DSA:

----
$ ssh keygen -t rsa
----

Press kbd:[Enter] when prompted to save the SSH keys in the default location, which typically is in the [filename]#~/.ssh# directory.

*To upload public key to remote server*

Specify the name of the key and the path to where it was saved:

----
$ rhc sshkey add mysshkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
----

*To upload the actual key contents to remote server*

Specify the name of the key, type of key, and supply the key contents:

----
$ rhc sshkey add mysshkey --type rsa --content AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EhyuiBIwAAAQEA14PDPWsaZMDspZNK7ABsppzwy++Ih2tRwjBkxzC2KEcQi7v8IcyODb7qLJ72tgx3G90zRm7vQ6wuyy7rkYLIvTYiDnchy68ikjyt7wuBuSCgFcHLUdon7xn7VrskjhMN4pae6bjaY1+o4Knpfm3N72+9q/6+T52QIWCE1+Ku6UYYuOGy8qWynddw24bp4jGEKAXqTXcALuBoukC3uB+hrxvZYH1fbek6aEAQPYzO6sGqJqV1UoF0ascelhtyui8kadrKPr/5uJsPS+kGZguU16ykQb2k9K03JMSfvPP4rLe50Q9G4dSZFbUOQXdC3n13CqvsEVzizUGl0HyT8MhRqw

== Resolving Authentication Issues
If you experience authentication issues, or if there is a mismatch between the local and remote keys, Red Hat recommends resolving authentication issues with the interactive setup wizard. The interactive setup wizard also provides the option to automatically upload a new public key to the remote server. Launch the interactive setup wizard with the `rhc setup` command and follow the onscreen instructions.
