You can upgrade a restricted network {product-title} cluster by using the `oc` command-line interface (CLI).

A restricted network environment is the one in which your cluster nodes cannot access the internet. For this reason, you must populate a registry with the installation images. If your registry host cannot access both the internet and the cluster, you can mirror the images to a file system that disconnected from that environment and then bring that host or removable media across that gap. If the local container registry and the cluster are connected to the mirror registry's host, you can directly push the release images to the local registry.

If multiple clusters are present within the restricted network, mirror the required release images to a single container image registry and use that registry to update all the clusters.

.Prerequisites

* Have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
* Have write access to a container registry in the restricted-network environment to push and pull images. The container registry must be compatible with Docker registry API v2.
* You must have the `oc` command-line interface (CLI) tool installed.
* Have access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See xref:../authentication/using-rbac.adoc[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
* Have a recent xref:../backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[etcd backup] in case your upgrade fails and you must xref:../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore your cluster to a previous state].

== Preparing your mirror host

Before you perform the mirror procedure, you must prepare the host to retrieve content
and push it to the remote location.

== Creating the image ConfigMap

Before you update your cluster, you must manually create a ConfigMap that contains the signatures of the release images that you use. This signature allows the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) to verify that the release images have not been modified by comparing the expected and actual image signatures.

If you are upgrading from version 4.4.8 or later, you can use the `oc` CLI to create the ConfigMap. If you are upgrading from an earlier version, you must use the manual method.
