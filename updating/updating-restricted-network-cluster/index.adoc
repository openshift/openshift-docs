toc::[]

A disconnected environment is one in which your cluster nodes cannot access the internet.
For this reason, you must populate a registry with the installation images.
If your registry host cannot access both the internet and the cluster, you can mirror the images to a file system that is disconnected from that environment and then bring that host or removable media across that gap.
If the local container registry and the cluster are connected to the mirror registry's host, you can directly push the release images to the local registry.

A single container image registry is sufficient to host mirrored images for several clusters in the disconnected network.

== Performing a disconnected environment update

You can use one of the following procedures to update a disconnected {product-title} cluster:
