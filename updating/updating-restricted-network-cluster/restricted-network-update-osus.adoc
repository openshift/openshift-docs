For clusters with internet accessibility, Red Hat provides update recommendations through an {product-title} update service as a hosted service located behind public APIs. However, clusters in a disconnected environment have no way to access public APIs for update information.

To provide a similar update experience in a disconnected environment, you can install and configure the OpenShift Update Service locally so that it is available within a disconnected environment.

The following sections describe how to provide updates for your disconnected cluster and its underlying operating system.

[id="update-service-prereqs"]
== Prerequisites

* Have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
* Have write access to a container registry in the disconnected environment to push and pull images. The container registry must be compatible with Docker registry API v2.
* You must have the `oc` command-line interface (CLI) tool installed.
* For more information on installing Operators, see xref:../../operators/user/olm-installing-operators-in-namespace.adoc#olm-installing-operators-in-namespace[Installing Operators in your namespace].

== Configuring access to a secured registry for the OpenShift Update Service

If the release images are contained in a registry whose HTTPS X.509 certificate is signed by a custom certificate authority, complete the steps in xref:../../registry/configuring-registry-operator.adoc#images-configuration-cas_configuring-registry-operator[Configuring additional trust stores for image registry access] along with following changes for the update service.

The OpenShift Update Service Operator needs the config map key name `updateservice-registry` in the registry CA cert.

.Image registry CA config map example for the update service
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-registry-ca
data:
  updateservice-registry: | <1>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  registry-with-port.example.com..5000: | <2>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
<1> The OpenShift Update Service Operator requires the config map key name updateservice-registry in the registry CA cert.
<2> If the registry has the port, such as `registry-with-port.example.com:5000`, `:` should be replaced with `..`.

== Installing the OpenShift Update Service Operator

To install the OpenShift Update Service, you must first install the OpenShift Update Service Operator by using the {product-title} web console or CLI.

[NOTE]
====
For clusters that are installed on disconnected environments, also known as disconnected clusters, Operator Lifecycle Manager by default cannot access the Red Hat-provided OperatorHub sources hosted on remote registries because those remote sources require full internet connectivity. For more information, see xref:../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks].

== Creating an OpenShift Update Service application

You can create an OpenShift Update Service application by using the {product-title} web console or CLI.

[NOTE]
====
The policy engine route name must not be more than 63 characters based on RFC-1123. If you see `ReconcileCompleted` status as `false`  with the reason `CreateRouteFailed` caused by `host must conform to DNS 1123 naming convention
and must be no more than 63 characters`, try creating the Update Service with a shorter name.
