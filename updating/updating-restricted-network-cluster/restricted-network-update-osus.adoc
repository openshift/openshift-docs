For clusters with internet accessibility, Red Hat provides update recommendations through an {product-title} update service as a hosted service located behind public APIs. However, clusters in a disconnected environment have no way to access public APIs for update information.

To provide a similar update experience in a disconnected environment, you can install and configure the OpenShift Update Service locally so that it is available within a disconnected environment.

The following sections describe how to provide updates for your disconnected cluster and its underlying operating system.

[id="update-service-prereqs"]
== Prerequisites

* Have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
* Have write access to a container registry in the disconnected environment to push and pull images. The container registry must be compatible with Docker registry API v2.
* You must have the `oc` command-line interface (CLI) tool installed.
* For more information on installing Operators, see xref:../../operators/user/olm-installing-operators-in-namespace.adoc#olm-installing-operators-in-namespace[Installing Operators in your namespace].

== Configuring access to a secured registry for the OpenShift Update Service

If the release images are contained in a registry whose HTTPS X.509 certificate is signed by a custom certificate authority, complete the steps in xref:../../registry/configuring-registry-operator.adoc#images-configuration-cas_configuring-registry-operator[Configuring additional trust stores for image registry access] along with following changes for the update service.

The OpenShift Update Service Operator needs the config map key name `updateservice-registry` in the registry CA cert.

.Image registry CA config map example for the update service
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-registry-ca
data:
  updateservice-registry: | <1>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  registry-with-port.example.com..5000: | <2>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
<1> The OpenShift Update Service Operator requires the config map key name updateservice-registry in the registry CA cert.
<2> If the registry has the port, such as `registry-with-port.example.com:5000`, `:` should be replaced with `..`.

== Installing the OpenShift Update Service Operator

To install the OpenShift Update Service, you must first install the OpenShift Update Service Operator by using the {product-title} web console or CLI.

[NOTE]
====
For clusters that are installed in disconnected environments, also known as disconnected clusters, Operator Lifecycle Manager by default cannot access the Red Hat-provided OperatorHub sources hosted on remote registries because those remote sources require full internet connectivity. For more information, see xref:../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks].

[id="update-service-mirror-release-osus"]
== Mirroring the {product-title} image repository

The OpenShift Update Service requires a locally accessible registry containing update release payloads.

You must mirror container images onto a mirror registry before you can update a cluster in a disconnected environment. You can also use this procedure in connected environment to ensure your clusters only use container images that have satisfied your organizational controls on external content.

There are two supported methods for mirroring images onto a mirror registry:

* Using the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin

* Using the oc adm release mirror command

Choose one of the following supported options.

== Creating an OpenShift Update Service application

You can create an OpenShift Update Service application by using the {product-title} web console or CLI.

include::modules/update-service-create-service-cli.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[NOTE]
====
The policy engine route name must not be more than 63 characters based on RFC-1123. If you see `ReconcileCompleted` status as `false`  with the reason `CreateRouteFailed` caused by `host must conform to DNS 1123 naming convention
and must be no more than 63 characters`, try creating the Update Service with a shorter name.

== Uninstalling the OpenShift Update Service Operator

To uninstall the OpenShift Update Service, you must first delete all OpenShift Update Service applications by using the {product-title} web console or CLI.
