toc::[]

To get an update experience similar to connected clusters, you can use the following procedures to install and configure the OpenShift Update Service (OSUS) in a disconnected environment.

The following steps outline the high-level workflow on how to update a cluster in a disconnected environment using OSUS:

. Configure access to a secured registry.

. Update the global cluster pull secret to access your mirror registry.

. Install the OSUS Operator.

. Create a graph data container image for the OpenShift Update Service.

. Install the OSUS application and configure your clusters to use the local OpenShift Update Service.

. Perform a supported update procedure from the documentation as you would with a connected cluster.

[id="update-service-prereqs"]
== Prerequisites

* You must have the `oc` command-line interface (CLI) tool installed.
* You must provision a local container image registry with the container images for your update, as described in xref:../../updating/updating-restricted-network-cluster/mirroring-image-repository.adoc#mirroring-ocp-image-repository[Mirroring the {product-title} image repository].

== Configuring access to a secured registry for the OpenShift Update Service

If the release images are contained in a registry whose HTTPS X.509 certificate is signed by a custom certificate authority, complete the steps in xref:../../registry/configuring-registry-operator.adoc#images-configuration-cas_configuring-registry-operator[Configuring additional trust stores for image registry access] along with following changes for the update service.

The OpenShift Update Service Operator needs the config map key name `updateservice-registry` in the registry CA cert.

.Image registry CA config map example for the update service
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-registry-ca
data:
  updateservice-registry: | <1>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

<1> The OpenShift Update Service Operator requires the config map key name updateservice-registry in the registry CA cert.
<2> If the registry has the port, such as `registry-with-port.example.com:5000`, `:` should be replaced with `..`.

== Installing the OpenShift Update Service Operator

To install the OpenShift Update Service, you must first install the OpenShift Update Service Operator by using the {product-title} web console or CLI.

[NOTE]
====
For clusters that are installed in disconnected environments, Operator Lifecycle Manager by default cannot access the Red Hat-provided OperatorHub sources hosted on remote registries because those remote sources require full internet connectivity. For more information, see xref:../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks].

== Creating an OpenShift Update Service application

You can create an OpenShift Update Service application by using the {product-title} web console or CLI.

include::modules/update-service-create-service-web-console.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[NOTE]
====
The policy engine route name must not be more than 63 characters based on RFC-1123. If you see `ReconcileCompleted` status as `false`  with the reason `CreateRouteFailed` caused by `host must conform to DNS 1123 naming convention
and must be no more than 63 characters`, try creating the Update Service with a shorter name.

== Next steps

Before updating your cluster, confirm that the following conditions are met:

* The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) is configured to use your locally-installed OpenShift Update Service application.
* The release image signature config map for the new release is applied to your cluster.
* The current release and update target release images are mirrored to a locally accessible registry.
* A recent graph data container image has been mirrored to your local registry.

After you configure your cluster to use the locally-installed OpenShift Update Service and local mirror registry, you can use any of the following update methods:
