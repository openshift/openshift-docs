== Prerequisites

* Have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
* Have write access to a container registry in the disconnected environment to push and pull images. The container registry must be compatible with Docker registry API v2.
* You must have the `oc` command-line interface (CLI) tool installed.
* Have access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See xref:../../authentication/using-rbac.adoc#using-rbac[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
* Have a recent xref:../../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[etcd backup] in case your update fails and you must xref:../../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore your cluster to a previous state].
* Ensure that all machine config pools (MCPs) are running and not paused. Nodes associated with a paused MCP are skipped during the update process. You can pause the MCPs if you are performing a canary rollout update strategy.
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials, ensure that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is in an upgradeable state. For more information, see _Upgrading clusters with manually maintained credentials_ for xref:../../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-aws[AWS], xref:../../installing/installing_azure/manually-creating-iam-azure.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-azure[Azure], or xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-gcp[GCP].
//STS is not currently supported in a disconnected environment, but the following bullet can be uncommented when that changes.
//* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials with the AWS Secure Token Service (STS), obtain a copy of the `ccoctl` utility from the release image being upgraded to and use it to process any updated credentials. For more information, see xref:../../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-sts.adoc#sts-mode-upgrading[_Upgrading an OpenShift Container Platform cluster configured for manual mode with STS_].
* If you run an Operator or you have configured any application with the pod disruption budget, you might experience an interruption during the upgrade process. If `minAvailable` is set to 1 in `PodDisruptionBudget`, the nodes are drained to apply pending machine configs which might block the eviction process. If several nodes are rebooted, all the pods might run on only one node, and the `PodDisruptionBudget` field can prevent the node drain.

== Preparing your mirror host

Before you perform the mirror procedure, you must prepare the host to retrieve content
and push it to the remote location.

== Mirroring the {product-title} image repository

You must mirror container images onto a mirror registry before you can update a cluster in a disconnected environment. You can also use this procedure in connected environment to ensure your clusters only use container images that have satisfied your organizational controls on external content.

There are two supported methods for mirroring images onto a mirror registry:

* Using the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin

* Using the oc adm release mirror command

Choose one of the following supported options.
