toc::[]

You must ensure that your nodes running in vSphere are running on the hardware version supported by {product-title}. Currently, hardware version 13 or later is supported for vSphere virtual machines in a cluster.

You can update your virtual hardware immediately or schedule an update in vCenter.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using hardware version 13 for your cluster nodes running on vSphere is now deprecated. This version is still fully supported, but support will be removed in a future version of {product-title}. Hardware version 15 is now the default for vSphere virtual machines in {product-title}.

== Updating virtual hardware on vSphere

To update the hardware of your virtual machines (VMs) on VMware vSphere, update your virtual machines separately to reduce the risk of downtime for your cluster.
