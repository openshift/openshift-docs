For clusters with internet accessibility, Red Hat provides over-the-air updates through an {product-title} update service as a hosted service located behind public APIs.

[NOTE]
====
If you are on a restricted network where disconnected clusters cannot access the public APIs, you can install the OpenShift Update Service locally. See xref:../updating/installing-update-service.adoc#installing-update-service[Installing and configuring the OpenShift Update Service].
