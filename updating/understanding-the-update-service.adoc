For clusters with internet accessibility, Red Hat provides over-the-air updates through an {product-title} update service as a hosted service located behind public APIs. 

[NOTE]
====
Because clusters cannot access public APIs in a restricted network, you can install the OpenShift Update Service locally if you are in a disconnected network. See xref:../updating/installing-update-service.adoc#installing-update-service[Installing and configuring the OpenShift Update Service].
