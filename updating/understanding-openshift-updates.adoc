With {product-title} 4, you can update a {product-title} cluster with a single operation by using the web console or the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). Platform administrators are automatically notified when an update is available for their cluster.

The OpenShift Update Service (OSUS) builds a graph of update possibilities based on release images in the registry.
The graph is based on recommended, tested update paths from a specific version. {product-title} clusters connect to the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud servers and identify which clusters the user is running, along with the version information. OSUS responds with information about known update targets. Either a cluster administrator or an automatic update controller edits the custom resource (CR) of the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) with the new version to update to.
After the CVO receives the update image from the registry, the CVO then applies the changes.

[NOTE]
====
Operators previously installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) follow a different process for updates. See xref:../operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.adoc#olm-upgrading-operators[Updating installed Operators] for more information.
