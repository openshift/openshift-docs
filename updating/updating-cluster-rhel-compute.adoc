toc::[]

You can update, or upgrade, an {product-title} cluster. If your cluster contains
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machines, you must perform more steps to update
those machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
During the {product-title} beta period, update functionality is limited in the
following ways:

* You cannot update between different beta drops, such as from OpenShift 4 Beta
Drop 3 to OpenShift 4 Beta Drop 4.
* The ability to update from a beta drop of {product-title} to a full version of
{product-title} is not guaranteed.
* After you install OpenShift 4 Beta Drop 4, you can update your cluster to
one of the available nightly builds.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See xref:../authentication/using-rbac.adoc[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].

== (Optional) Adding hooks to perform Ansible tasks on RHEL machines

You can use _hooks_ to run Ansible tasks on the RHEL compute machines during
the {product-title} update.
