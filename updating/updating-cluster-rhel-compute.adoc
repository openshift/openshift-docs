You can update, or upgrade, an {product-title} cluster. If your cluster contains
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machines, you must perform more steps to update
those machines.

== Prerequisites

* Have access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See xref:../authentication/using-rbac.adoc[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
* Have a recent xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[etcd backup] in case your update fails and you must xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore your cluster to a previous state].
* Support for {op-system-base}7 workers is removed in {product-title} {product-version}. You must replace {op-system-base}7 workers with {op-system-base}8 or {op-system} workers before upgrading to {product-title} {product-version}. Red Hat does not support in-place {op-system-base}7 to {op-system-base}8 updates for {op-system-base} workers; those hosts must be replaced with a clean operating system install.
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials, ensure that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is in an upgradeable state. For more information, see _Upgrading clusters with manually maintained credentials_ for xref:../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-aws[AWS], xref:../installing/installing_azure/manually-creating-iam-azure.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-azure[Azure], or xref:../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-gcp[GCP].
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials with the AWS Secure Token Service (STS), obtain a copy of the `ccoctl` utility from the release image being updated to and use it to process any updated credentials. For more information, see xref:../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-sts.adoc#sts-mode-upgrading[_Upgrading an OpenShift Container Platform cluster configured for manual mode with STS_].
* If you run an Operator or you have configured any application with the pod disruption budget, you might experience an interruption during the upgrade process. If `minAvailable` is set to 1 in `PodDisruptionBudget`, the nodes are drained to apply pending machine configs which might block the eviction process. If several nodes are rebooted, all the pods might run on only one node, and the `PodDisruptionBudget` field can prevent the node drain.

== Optional: Adding hooks to perform Ansible tasks on RHEL machines

You can use _hooks_ to run Ansible tasks on the RHEL compute machines during
the {product-title} update.
