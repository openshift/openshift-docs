You can update, or upgrade, an {product-title} cluster. If your cluster contains
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machines, you must perform more steps to update
those machines.

== Prerequisites

* Have access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See xref:../authentication/using-rbac.adoc[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
* Have a recent xref:../backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[etcd backup] in case your upgrade fails and you must xref:../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore your cluster to a previous state].
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials, ensure that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is in an upgradeable state. For more information, see _Upgrading clusters with manually maintained credentials_ for xref:../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-aws[AWS], xref:../installing/installing_azure/manually-creating-iam-azure.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-azure[Azure], or xref:../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-gcp[GCP].
* If your cluster contains Operators, like OpenShift Container Storage, AMQ, Redis, or Spectrum Scale, or contains applications that are configured with pod disruption budgets, you might experience a block during the upgrade process. The `PodDisruptionBudget` with the `minAvailable: 1` setting can be a blocker for the eviction process while nodes are drained to apply pending machine configs. If several nodes are rebooted, all the pods can be running in only one node, and the pod disruption budget can prevent the node from draining. For remediation steps, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4857671[PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) could cause Machine-Config-Operator (MCO) to be degraded during OCP4 upgrade].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are running cluster monitoring with an attached PVC for Prometheus, you might experience OOM kills during cluster upgrade. When persistent storage is in use for Prometheus, Prometheus memory usage doubles during cluster upgrade and for several hours after upgrade is complete. To avoid the OOM kill issue, allow worker nodes with double the size of memory that was available prior to the upgrade. For example, if you are running monitoring on the minimum recommended nodes, which is 2 cores with 8 GB of RAM, increase memory to 16 GB. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1925061[BZ#1925061].

== Optional: Adding hooks to perform Ansible tasks on RHEL machines

You can use _hooks_ to run Ansible tasks on the RHEL compute machines during
the {product-title} update.
