Update channels are tied to a minor version of {product-title}. For instance, {product-title} 4.10 update channels recommend updates to 4.10 and updates within 4.10. They also recommend updates within 4.9 and from 4.9 to 4.10 allowing all 4.9 to eventually update to 4.10, even if they do not immediately meet the minimum z-stream version requirements. They do not recommend updates to 4.11 or later releases. This strategy ensures that administrators explicitly decide to update to the next minor version of {product-title}.

Update channels control only release selection and do not impact the version of the cluster that you install. The `openshift-install` binary file for a specific version of {product-title} always installs that version.

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
{product-title} {product-version} offers the following update channels:

* `stable-{product-version}`
* `eus-4.y` (only offered for EUS versions and meant to facilitate upgrades between EUS versions)
* `fast-{product-version}`
* `candidate-{product-version}`

If you do not want the Cluster Version Operator to fetch available updates from the update recommendation service, you can use the `oc adm upgrade channel` command in the OpenShift CLI to configure an empty channel. This configuration can be helpful if, for example, a cluster has restricted network access and there is no local, reachable update recommendation service.

[WARNING]
====
Red Hat recommends upgrading to versions suggested by OpenShift Update Service only. For a minor version update, versions must be contiguous. Red Hat does not test updates to noncontiguous versions and cannot guarantee compatibility with earlier versions.
