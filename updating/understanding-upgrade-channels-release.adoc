In {product-title} 4.1, Red Hat introduced the concept of channels for recommending the appropriate release versions for cluster upgrades. By controlling the pace of upgrades, these upgrade channels allow you to choose an upgrade strategy. Upgrade channels are tied to a minor version of {product-title}. For instance, {product-title} 4.6 upgrade channels recommend upgrades to 4.6 and upgrades within 4.6. They also recommend upgrades within 4.5 and from 4.5 to 4.6, to allow clusters on 4.5 to eventually upgrade to 4.6. They do not recommend upgrades to 4.7 or later releases. This strategy ensures that administrators explicitly decide to upgrade to the next minor version of {product-title}.

Upgrade channels control only release selection and do not impact the version of the cluster that you install; the `openshift-install` binary file for a specific version of {product-title} always installs that version.

{product-title} {product-version} offers the following upgrade channels:

* `candidate-{product-version}`
* `fast-{product-version}`
* `stable-{product-version}`
* `eus-4.y` (only when running an even-numbered 4.y cluster release, like 4.6)

If you do not want the Cluster Version Operator to fetch available updates from the upgrade recommendation service, you can use the `oc adm upgrade channel` command in the OpenShift CLI to configure an empty channel. This configuration can be helpful if, for example, a cluster has restricted network access and there is no local, reachable upgrade recommendation service.
