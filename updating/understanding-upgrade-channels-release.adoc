Upgrade channels enable cluster administrators to choose an upgrade strategy. {product-title} 4 releases are sequential. Updates are decoupled from releases which enables you to create dynamic upgrade paths.

{product-title}introduced upgrade channels as a way to recommend appropriate release versions for cluster upgrades. The upgrade channels establish a controlled pace for upgrades between minor versions. You can select an upgrade strategy that is best suited for your needs. Channels are tied to a minor version, for example, 4.7. Each channel has an independently-maintained update graph.

Upgrade channels control only release selection and do not impact the version of the cluster that you install; the `openshift-install` binary file for a specific version of {product-title} always installs that version.
