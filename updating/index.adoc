You can update an {product-title} 4 cluster with a single operation by using the web console or the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

== Understanding OpenShift Container Platform updates
xref:../updating/understanding-openshift-updates.adoc#understanding-openshift-updates[About the OpenShift Update Service]: For clusters with internet access, Red Hat provides over-the-air updates by using an {product-title} update service as a hosted service located behind public APIs.

== Understanding upgrading channels and releases
xref:../updating/understanding-upgrade-channels-release.adoc#understanding-upgrade-channels_understanding-upgrade-channels-releases[Upgrading channels and releases]: With upgrade channels, you can choose an upgrade strategy. Upgrade channels are specific to a minor version of {product-title}. Upgrade channels only control release selection and do not impact the version of the cluster that you install. The `openshift-install` binary file for a specific version of the {product-title} always installs that minor version. For more information, see the following:

== Preparing to perform an EUS-to-EUS update
xref:../updating/preparing-eus-eus-upgrade.adoc#preparing-eus-eus-upgrade[Preparing to perform an EUS-to-EUS update]: Due to fundamental Kubernetes design, all {product-title} updates between minor versions must be serialized. You must update from {product-title} 4.8 to 4.9, and then to 4.10. You cannot update from {product-title} 4.8 to 4.10 directly. However, if you want to update between two Extended Update Support (EUS) versions, you can do so by incurring only a single reboot of non-control plane hosts. For more information, see the following:

The following steps update a cluster within a minor version. You can use the same instructions for updating a cluster between minor versions.

== Performing a canary rollout update
xref:../updating/update-using-custom-machine-config-pools.adoc#update-using-custom-machine-config-pools[Performing a canary rollout update]: By controlling the rollout of an update to the worker nodes, you can ensure that mission-critical applications stay available during the whole update, even if the update process causes your applications to fail. Depending on your organizational needs, you might want to update a small subset of worker nodes, evaluate cluster and workload health over a period of time, and then update the remaining nodes. This is referred to as a _canary_ update. Alternatively, you might also want to fit worker node updates, which often requires a host reboot, into smaller defined maintenance windows when it is not possible to take a large maintenance window to update the entire cluster at one time. You can perform the following procedures:

== Updating a disconnected cluster
xref:../updating/updating-restricted-network-cluster/index.adoc#about-restricted-network-updates[Updating a disconnected cluster]: If your mirror host cannot access both the internet and the cluster, you can mirror the images to a file system that is disconnected from that environment. You can then bring that host or removable media across that gap. If the local container registry and the cluster are connected to the mirror host of a registry, you can directly push the release images to the local registry.
