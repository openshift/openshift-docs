You can update, or upgrade, an {product-title} cluster within a minor version by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). You can also update a cluster between minor versions by following the same instructions.

== Prerequisites

* Have access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See xref:../authentication/using-rbac.adoc[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
* Have a recent xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[etcd backup] in case your update fails and you must xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore your cluster to a previous state].
* Support for {op-system-base}7 workers is removed in {product-title} {product-version}. You must replace {op-system-base}7 workers with {op-system-base}8 or {op-system} workers before upgrading to {product-title} {product-version}. Red Hat does not support in-place {op-system-base}7 to {op-system-base}8 updates for {op-system-base} workers; those hosts must be replaced with a clean operating system install.
* Ensure all Operators previously installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) are updated to their latest version in their latest channel. Updating the Operators ensures they have a valid update path when the default OperatorHub catalogs switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster update. See xref:../operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.adoc#olm-upgrading-operators[Updating installed Operators] for more information.
* Ensure that all machine config pools (MCPs) are running and not paused. Nodes associated with a paused MCP are skipped during the update process. You can pause the MCPs if you are performing a canary rollout update strategy.
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials, ensure that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is in an upgradeable state. For more information, see xref:../updating/updating-cluster-cli.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_updating-cluster-cli[Upgrading clusters with manually maintained credentials].
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials with the AWS Secure Token Service (STS), obtain a copy of the `ccoctl` utility from the release image being updated to and use it to process any updated credentials. For more information, see xref:../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-sts.adoc#sts-mode-upgrading[Upgrading an OpenShift Container Platform cluster configured for manual mode with STS].
* Ensure that you address all `Upgradeable=False` conditions so the cluster allows an update to the next minor version. An alert displays at the top of the *Cluster Settings* page when you have one or more cluster Operators that cannot be upgraded. You can still update to the next available patch update for the minor release you are currently on.
* Review the list of APIs that were removed in Kubernetes 1.25, migrate any affected components to use the new API version, and provide the administrator acknowledgment. For more information, see xref:../updating/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare[Preparing to update to {product-title} 4.12].
* If you run an Operator or you have configured any application with the pod disruption budget, you might experience an interruption during the upgrade process. If `minAvailable` is set to 1 in `PodDisruptionBudget`, the nodes are drained to apply pending machine configs which might block the eviction process. If several nodes are rebooted, all the pods might run on only one node, and the `PodDisruptionBudget` field can prevent the node drain.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* When an update is failing to complete, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) reports the status of any blocking components while attempting to reconcile the update. Rolling your cluster back to a previous version is not supported.  If your update is failing to complete, contact Red Hat support.
* Using the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` section to modify the configuration of an Operator is unsupported and might block cluster updates. You must remove this setting before you can update your cluster.
