You can update, or upgrade, an {product-title} cluster within a minor version by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

== Prerequisites

* Have access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See xref:../authentication/using-rbac.adoc[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
* Have a recent xref:../backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[etcd backup] in case your upgrade fails and you must xref:../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore your cluster to a previous state].
* Ensure all Operators previously installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) are updated to their latest version in their latest channel. Updating the Operators ensures they have a valid upgrade path when the default OperatorHub catalogs switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster upgrade. See xref:../operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.adoc#olm-upgrading-operators[Upgrading installed Operators] for more information.
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials, ensure that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is in an upgradeable state. For more information, see _Upgrading clusters with manually maintained credentials_ for xref:../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-aws[AWS], xref:../installing/installing_azure/manually-creating-iam-azure.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-azure[Azure], or xref:../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-gcp[GCP].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` section to modify the configuration of an Operator is unsupported and might block cluster upgrades. You must remove this setting before you can upgrade your cluster.
