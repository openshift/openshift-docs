WARNING: This assembly has been moved into a subdirectory for 4.14+. Changes to this assembly for earlier versions should be done in separate PRs based off of their respective version branches. Otherwise, your cherry picks may fail.

To do: Remove this comment once 4.13 docs are EOL.
////

Due to fundamental Kubernetes design, all {product-title} updates between minor versions must be serialized.
Administrators who want to update across multiple minor versions quickly may perform multiple Control Plane Updates followed by a single Worker Node update.

[NOTE]
====
Currently this is only supported between two EUS versions, however EUS subscriptions are not necessary. For instance clusters running 4.12 could apply the control plane update from 4.12 to 4.13, then the control plane update from 4.13 to 4.14 followed by updating workers directly from 4.12 to 4.14. A cluster running 4.15 cannot currently apply the same pattern when updating from 4.16 to 4.17. This may change in the future as we expand our tested version skew.
====


There are a number of caveats to consider when applying multiple control plane updates.

* If you encounter issues during or after applying the first control plane update remediation of those issues may require that non-control plane hosts complete the update to that version before applying a second control plane update.

* Until the machine config pools are unpaused and the update is complete, features and bugs fixes which depend on worker updates are not available.

* All the clusters may apply multiple control plane updates, but only clusters with non control-plane `MachineConfigPools` objects can benefit from skipping worker updates.
