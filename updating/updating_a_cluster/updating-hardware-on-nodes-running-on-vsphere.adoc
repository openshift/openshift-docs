You must ensure that your nodes running in vSphere are running on the hardware version supported by {product-title}. Currently, hardware version 13 or later is supported for vSphere virtual machines in a cluster.

You can update your virtual hardware immediately or schedule an update in vCenter.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before upgrading Openshift 4.12 to Openshift 4.13, you must update vSphere to *v7.0.2 or later*; otherwise, the Openshift 4.12 cluster is marked *un-upgradeable*.

== Updating virtual hardware on vSphere

To update the hardware of your virtual machines (VMs) on VMware vSphere, update your virtual machines separately to reduce the risk of downtime for your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of {product-title} 4.13, VMware virtual hardware version 13 is no longer supported. You need to update to VMware version 15 or later for supporting functionality.
