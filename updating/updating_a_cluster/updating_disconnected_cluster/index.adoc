A disconnected environment is one in which your cluster nodes cannot access the internet.
For this reason, you must populate a registry with the installation images.
If your registry host cannot access both the internet and the cluster, you can mirror the images to a file system that is disconnected from that environment and then bring that host or removable media across that gap.
If the local container registry and the cluster are connected to the mirror registry's host, you can directly push the release images to the local registry.

A single container image registry is sufficient to host mirrored images for several clusters in the disconnected network.

== Mirroring {product-title} images
To update your cluster in a disconnected environment, your cluster environment must have access to a mirror registry that has the necessary images and resources for your targeted update. The following page has instructions for mirroring images onto a repository in your disconnected cluster:

== Uninstalling the OpenShift Update Service from a cluster

You can use the following procedure to uninstall a local copy of the OpenShift Update Service (OSUS) from your cluster:
