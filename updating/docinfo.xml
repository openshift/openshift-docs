    <para>This document describes how version upgrades are managed for Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry. Learn about the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) that controls installation, upgrades, and RBAC for the OpenTelemetry Operator. Understand the automatic upgrade process where the Operator upgrades all OpenTelemetryCollector custom resources during startup, reconciles managed instances, and handles upgrade failures with exponential backoff retry mechanisms. Includes information about version synchronization between the Operator and Collector instances.</para>
