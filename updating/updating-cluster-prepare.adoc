// NOTE: This assembly and included modules are currently not used, but are being kept becuase it might be needed again for Kubernetes 1.25/OCP 4.12 (when more Kubernetes APIs are being removed).

{product-title} 4.9 uses Kubernetes 1.22, which removed a significant number of deprecated `v1beta1` APIs.

{product-title} 4.8.14 introduced a requirement that an administrator must provide a manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be upgraded from {product-title} 4.8 to 4.9. This is to help prevent issues after upgrading to {product-title} 4.9, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this evaluation and migration is complete, the administrator can provide the acknowledgment.

Before you can upgrade your {product-title} 4.8 cluster to 4.9, you must provide the administrator acknowledgment.

== Evaluating your cluster for removed APIs

There are several methods to help administrators identify where APIs that will be removed are in use. However, {product-title} cannot identify all instances, especially workloads that are idle or external tools that are used. It is the responsibility of the administrator to properly evaluate all workloads and other integrations for instances of removed APIs.
