You can update, or upgrade, an {product-title} cluster by using the web console. The following steps update a cluster within a minor version. You can use the same instructions for updating a cluster between minor versions.

[NOTE]
====
Use the web console or `oc adm upgrade channel _<channel>_` to change the update channel. You can follow the steps in xref:../updating/updating-cluster-cli.adoc#updating-cluster-cli[Updating a cluster using the CLI] to complete the update after you change to a {product-version} channel.
====

== Prerequisites

* Have access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See xref:../authentication/using-rbac.adoc[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
* Have a recent xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[etcd backup] in case your update fails and you must xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore your cluster to a previous state].
+
{product-title} 4.9 requires an update from etcd version 3.4 to 3.5. If the etcd Operator halts the update, an alert is triggered. To clear this alert, cancel the update with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --clear
----

* Ensure all Operators previously installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) are updated to their latest version in their latest channel. Updating the Operators ensures they have a valid update path when the default OperatorHub catalogs switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster update. See xref:../operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.adoc#olm-upgrading-operators[Upgrading installed Operators] for more information.
* Ensure that all machine config pools (MCPs) are running and not paused. Nodes associated with a paused MCP are skipped during the update process. You can pause the MCPs if you are performing a canary rollout update strategy.
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials, ensure that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is in an upgradeable state. For more information, see _Upgrading clusters with manually maintained credentials_ for xref:../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-aws[AWS], xref:../installing/installing_azure/manually-creating-iam-azure.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-azure[Azure], or xref:../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-gcp[GCP].
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials with the AWS Secure Token Service (STS), obtain a copy of the `ccoctl` utility from the release image being updated to and use it to process any updated credentials. For more information, see xref:../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-sts.adoc#sts-mode-upgrading[_Upgrading an OpenShift Container Platform cluster configured for manual mode with STS_].
* Review the list of APIs that were removed in Kubernetes 1.22, migrate any affected components to use the new API version, and provide the administrator acknowledgment. For more information, see xref:../updating/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare[Preparing to update to {product-title} 4.9].
+
// TODO: Currently, this ^ admin ack is only applicable for 4.9 and should be removed for 4.10+

[IMPORTANT]
====
* When an update is failing to complete, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) reports the status of any blocking components while attempting to reconcile the update. Rolling your cluster back to a previous version is not supported.  If your update is failing to complete, contact Red Hat support.
* Using the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` section to modify the configuration of an Operator is unsupported and might block cluster updates. You must remove this setting before you can update your cluster.
