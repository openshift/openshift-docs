You can update, or upgrade, an {product-title} cluster between minor versions.

[NOTE]
====
Use the web console or `oc adm upgrade channel _<channel>_` to change the update channel. You can follow the steps in xref:../updating/updating-cluster-cli.adoc#updating-cluster-cli[Updating a cluster within a minor version by using the CLI] to complete the update after you change to a {product-version} channel.
====

== Prerequisites

* Have access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See xref:../authentication/using-rbac.adoc[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
* Have a recent xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[etcd backup] in case your upgrade fails and you must xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore your cluster to a previous state].
+
{product-title} 4.9 requires an upgrade from etcd version 3.4 to 3.5. If the etcd Operator halts the upgrade, an alert is triggered. To clear this alert, ensure that you have a current etcd backup and restart the upgrade using the `--force` flag.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --force

* Ensure all Operators previously installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) are updated to their latest version in their latest channel. Updating the Operators ensures they have a valid upgrade path when the default OperatorHub catalogs switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster upgrade. See xref:../operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.adoc#olm-upgrading-operators[Upgrading installed Operators] for more information.
* Ensure that all machine config pools (MCPs) are running and not paused. Nodes associated with a paused MCP are skipped during the update process. You can pause the MCPs if you are performing a canary rollout update strategy.
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials, ensure that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is in an upgradeable state. For more information, see _Upgrading clusters with manually maintained credentials_ for xref:../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-aws[AWS], xref:../installing/installing_azure/manually-creating-iam-azure.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-azure[Azure], or xref:../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-maintained-credentials-upgrade_manually-creating-iam-gcp[GCP].
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials with the AWS Secure Token Service (STS), obtain a copy of the `ccoctl` utility from the release image being upgraded to and use it to process any updated credentials. For more information, see xref:../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-sts.adoc#sts-mode-upgrading[_Upgrading an OpenShift Container Platform cluster configured for manual mode with STS_].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` section to modify the configuration of an Operator is unsupported and might block cluster upgrades. You must remove this setting before you can upgrade your cluster.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are running cluster monitoring with an attached PVC for Prometheus, you might experience OOM kills during cluster upgrade. When persistent storage is in use for Prometheus, Prometheus memory usage doubles during cluster upgrade and for several hours after upgrade is complete. To avoid the OOM kill issue, allow worker nodes with double the size of memory that was available prior to the upgrade. For example, if you are running monitoring on the minimum recommended nodes, which is 2 cores with 8 GB of RAM, increase memory to 16 GB. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1925061[BZ#1925061].
