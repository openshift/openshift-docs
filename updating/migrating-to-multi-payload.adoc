You can migrate your current cluster with single-architecture compute machines to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines by updating to a multi-architecture, manifest-listed payload. This allows you to add mixed architecture compute nodes to your cluster. 

For information about configuring your multi-architecture compute machines, see _Configuring multi-architecture compute machines on an {product-title} cluster_.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Migration from a multi-architecture payload to a single-architecture payload is not supported. Once a cluster has transitioned to using a multi-architecture payload, it can no longer accept a single-architecture upgrade payload.
