For clusters with internet accessibility, Red Hat provides over-the-air updates through an OpenShift Container Platform update service as a hosted service located behind public APIs. However, clusters in a restricted network have no way to access public APIs for update information.

To provide a similar upgrade experience in a restricted network, you can install and configure the OpenShift Update Service locally so that it is available within a disconnected environment. 

The following sections describe how to provide over-the-air updates for your disconnected cluster and its underlying operating system.

=== Configuring access to a secured registry for the OpenShift update service

If the release images are contained in a secure registry, complete the steps in xref:../registry/configuring-registry-operator.adoc#images-configuration-cas_configuring-registry-operator[Configuring additional trust stores for image registry access] along with following changes for the update service.

The OpenShift Update Service Operator needs the config map key name `updateservice-registry` in the registry CA cert.

.Image registry CA config map example for the update service
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-registry-ca
data:
  updateservice-registry: | <1>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  registry-with-port.example.com..5000: | <2>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
<1> The OpenShift Update Service Operator requires the config map key name updateservice-registry in the registry CA cert.
<2>  If the registry has the port, such as `registry-with-port.example.com:5000`, `:` should be replaced with `..`.

== Installing the OpenShift Update Service Operator

To install the OpenShift Update Service, you must first install the OpenShift Update Service Operator by using the {product-title} web console or CLI.

[NOTE]
====
For clusters that are installed on restricted networks, also known as disconnected clusters, Operator Lifecycle Manager by default cannot access the Red Hat-provided OperatorHub sources hosted on remote registries because those remote sources require full internet connectivity. For more information, see xref:../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks].

[NOTE]
====
The policy engine route name must not be more than 63 characters based on RFC-1123. If you see `ReconcileCompleted` status as `false`  with the reason `CreateRouteFailed` caused by `host must conform to DNS 1123 naming convention
and must be no more than 63 characters`, try creating the Update Service with a shorter name.
