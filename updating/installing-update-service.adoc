For clusters with internet accessibility, Red Hat provides over-the-air updates through an OpenShift Container Platform update service as a hosted service located behind public APIs. However, for clusters in a restricted network, thereâ€™s no way to access these public APIs to obtain this information. In order to provide a similar user upgrade experience in a restricted network users can install and configure the OpenShift Update Service locally, i.e. accessible within their disconnected network, to provide over-the-air updates for your cluster and its underlying operating system as described in the following sections.

== Installing the OpenShift Update Service Operator

The OpenShift Update Service is installed by first installing the OpenShift Update Service Operator by using the {product-title} web console or CLI.

[NOTE]
====
For clusters that are installed on restricted networks, also known as disconnected clusters, Operator Lifecycle Manager by default cannot access the Red Hat-provided OperatorHub sources hosted on remote registries because those remote sources require full internet connectivity. For more information, see xref:../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks].
