[role="_abstract"]
With {product-title} you have a control plane log forwarder that is a separate system outside your cluster. You can use the control plane log forwarder to send your logs to either an Amazon CloudWatch group or Amazon S3 bucket, depending on your preference. 

Since the {product-title} control plane log forwarder is a managed system, it does not contend for resources against your workloads on your worker nodes.
