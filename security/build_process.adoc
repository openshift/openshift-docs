== Build Once, Deploy Everywhere

In a container environment, the software build process is the stage in the life
cycle where application code is integrated with the required runtime libraries.
Managing this build process is key to securing the software stack.

Using {product-title} as the standard platform for container builds enables you
to guarantee the security of the build environment. Adhering to a "build once,
deploy everywhere" philosophy ensures that the product of the build process is
exactly what is deployed in production.

It is also important to maintain the immutability of your containers. You should
not patch running containers, but rebuild and redeploy them.

[[security-build-management-and-security]]
== Build Management and Security

You can use source-to-Image (S2I) to combine source code and base images.
_Builder images_ make use of S2I to enable your development and operations teams
to collaborate on a reproducible build environment.

When developers commit code with Git for an application using build images,
{product-title} can perform the following functions:

- Trigger, either via webhooks on the code repository or other automated
continuous integration (CI) process, to automatically assemble a new image from
available artifacts, the S2I builder image, and the newly committed code.
- Automatically deploy the newly-built image for testing.
- Promote the tested image to production where it can be automatically deployed
using CI process.

You can use OpenShift Container Registry to manage access to final images. Both
S2I and native build images are automatically pushed to the OpenShift Container
Registry.

In addition to the included Jenkins for CI, you can also integrate your own
build / CI environment with {product-title} using RESTful APIs, as well as use
any API-compliant image registry.

[[security-build-securing-inputs-during-builds]]
== Securing Inputs During Builds

In some scenarios, build operations require credentials to access dependent
resources, but it is undesirable for those credentials to be available in the
final application image produced by the build. You can define input secrets for
this purpose.

For example, when building a Node.js application, you can set up your private
mirror for Node.js modules. In order to download modules from that private
mirror, you have to supply a custom *_.npmrc_* file for the build that contains
a URL, user name, and password. For security reasons, you do not want to expose
your credentials in the application image.

Using this example scenario, you can add an input secret to a new `BuildConfig`:

. Create the secret, if it does not exist:
+
----
$ oc create secret generic secret-npmrc --from-file=.npmrc=~/.npmrc
----
+
This creates a new secret named *_secret-npmrc_*, which contains the base64
encoded content of the *_~/.npmrc_* file.

. Add the secret to the `source` section in the existing `BuildConfig`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex.git
  secrets:
    - secret:
        name: secret-npmrc
----

. To include the secret in a new `BuildConfig`, run the following command:
+
----
$ oc new-build \
    openshift/nodejs-010-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex.git \
    --build-secret secret-npmrc
----

[[security-build-designing-your-build-process]]
== Designing Your Build Process

You can design your container image management and build process to use container layers so that you can separate control.

image::build_process2.png["Designing Your Build Process", align="center"]

For example, an operations team manages base images, while architects manage
middleware, runtimes, databases, and other solutions. Developers can then focus
on application layers and just write code.

Because new vulnerabilities are identified daily, you need to proactively check
container content over time. To do this, you should integrate automated security
testing into your build or CI process. For example:

- SAST / DAST â€“ Static and Dynamic security testing tools.
- Scanners for real-time checking against known vulnerabilities. Tools like these
catalog the open source packages in your container, notify you of any known
vulnerabilities, and update you when new vulnerabilities are discovered in
previously scanned packages.

Your CI process should include policies that flag builds with issues discovered
by security scans so that your team can take appropriate action to address those
issues. You should sign your custom built containers to ensure that nothing is
tampered with between build and deployment.
