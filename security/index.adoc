== About This Guide

This guide provides a high-level walkthrough of the container security measures
available in {product-title}, including solutions for the host layer, the
container and orchestration layer, and the build and application layer. This
guide contains the following information:

- Why container security is important and how it compares with existing security standards.
- Which container security measures are provided by the host (RHEL) layer and
which are provided by {product-title}.
- How to evaluate your container content and sources for vulnerabilities.
- How to design your build and deployment process to proactively check container content.
- How to control access to containers via authentication and authorization.
- How networking and attached storage are secured in {product-title}.
- Containerized solutions for API management and SSO.

[[security-intro-what-are-containers]]
== What Are Containers?

Containers package an application and all its dependencies into a single image
that can be promoted from development, to test, to production, without change.

Containers provide consistency across environments and multiple deployment
targets: physical servers, virtual machines (VMs), and private or public cloud.

Some of the benefits of using containers include:

|INFRASTRUCTURE |APPLICATIONS

|Sandboxed application processes on a shared Linux OS kernel
|Package my application and all of its dependencies

|Simpler, lighter, and denser than virtual machines
|Deploy to any environment in seconds and enable CI/CD

|Portable across different environments
|Easily access and share containerized components

== Container Security in {product-title}

This guide describes the key elements of security for each layer of the
container solution stack, while also showing how {product-title} can be used to
to create, deploy, and manage containers at scale, with security in mind at
every stage and every layer.
