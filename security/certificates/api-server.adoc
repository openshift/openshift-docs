toc::[]

The default API server certificate is issued by an internal {product-title}
cluster CA. Clients outside of the cluster will not be able to verify the
API server's certificate by default. This certificate can be replaced
by one that is issued by a CA that clients trust.

[NOTE]
====
In hosted control plane clusters, you cannot replace self-signed certificates from the API.
