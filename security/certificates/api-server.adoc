toc::[]

The default API server certificate is issued by an internal {product-title}
cluster CA. Clients outside of the cluster will not be able to verify the
API server's certificate by default. This certificate can be replaced
by one that is issued by a CA that clients trust.

[WARNING]
====
Before applying a custom API named certificate, xref:../../security/certificates/updating-ca-bundle.adoc#ca-bundle-understanding_updating-ca-bundle[update the CA bundle]. The cluster must trust the CA bundle of the named API certificate, to avoid `x509 signed by unknown authority` errors. Some internal {product-title} components use the `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` endpoint for accessing the Kubernetes API server. If the API named certificate is not trusted by cluster, the cluster might become inaccessible.
