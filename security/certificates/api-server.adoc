toc::[]

The default API server certificate is issued by an internal {product-title} cluster CA. Clients outside of the cluster cannot verify the API server's certificate by default. You cannot replace this certificate for the default domain; however, you can add a certificate, which is issued by a CA that clients trust, for the additional domains specified in your certificate to use.

[NOTE]
====
When you click *Copy login command* from the web console, the `oc login` commands that are displayed always use the self-signed CA that matches the external self-signed load balancer certificate. This CA is generated and rotated by the Kubernetes API Server Operator. It is currently not possible to override this with a custom domain.
