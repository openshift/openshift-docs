The Security Profiles Operator provides a way to define secure computing (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/[seccomp]) and SELinux profiles as custom resources, synchronizing profiles to every node in a given namespace.

These release notes track the development of the Security Profiles Operator in {product-title}.

For an overview of the Security Profiles Operator, see xref:../../security/security_profiles_operator/spo-overview.adoc#[Security Profiles Operator Overview].

[id="spo-0-7-1-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, a Security Profiles Operator (SPO) SELinux policy did not inherit low-level policy definitions from the container template. If you selected another template, such as net_container, the policy would not work because it required low-level policy definitions that only existed in the container template. This issue occurred when the SPO SELinux policy attempted to translate SELinux policies from the SPO custom format to the Common Intermediate Language (CIL) format. With this update, the container template appends to any SELinux policies that require translation from SPO to CIL. Additionally, the SPO SELinux policy can inherit low-level policy definitions from any supported policy template. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-12879[*OCPBUGS-12879*])
