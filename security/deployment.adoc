== Controlling What Can Be Deployed in a Container

If something happens during the build process, or if a vulnerability is
discovered after an image has been deployed, you can use tooling for automated,
policy-based deployment. You can use triggers to rebuild and replace images
instead of patching running containers, which is not recommended.

image::secure_deployments.png["Secure Deployments", align="center"]

For example, you build an application using three container image layers: core,
middleware, and applications. An issue is discovered in the core image and that
image is rebuilt. After the build is complete, the image is pushed to the
OpenShift Container Registry. {product-title} detects that the image has changed
and automatically rebuilds and deploys the application image, based on the
defined triggers. This change incorporates the fixed libraries and ensures that
the production code is identical to the most current image.

The `oc set triggers` command can be used to set a deployment trigger for a
deployment configuration. For example, to set an `ImageChangeTrigger` in a
deployment configuration called `frontend`:

----
$ oc set triggers dc/frontend \
    --from-image=myproject/origin-ruby-sample:latest \
    -c helloworld
----

== Controlling What Image Sources Can Be Deployed

It is important that the intended images are actually being deployed, that they
are from trusted sources, and they have not been altered. Cryptographic signing
provides this assurance. {product-title} enables cluster administrators to apply
security policy that is broad or narrow, reflecting deployment environment and
security requirements. Two parameters define this policy:

- one or more registries (with optional project namespace)
- trust type (accept, reject, or require public key(s))

With these policy parameters, registries or parts of registries, even individual
images, may be whitelisted (accept), blacklisted (reject), or define a trust
relationship using trusted public key(s) to ensure the source is
cryptographically verified. The policy rules apply to nodes. Policy may be
applied uniformly across all nodes or targeted for different node workloads (for
example, build, zone, or environment).

.Example Image Signature Policy File
----
{
    "default": [{"type": "reject"}],
    "transports": {
        "docker": {
            "access.redhat.com": [
                {
                    "type": "signedBy",
                    "keyType": "GPGKeys",
                    "keyPath": "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release"
                }
            ]
        },
        "atomic": {
            "172.30.1.1:5000/openshift": [
                {

                    "keyType": "GPGKeys",

                }

                {
                    "type": "signedBy",
                    "keyType": "GPGKeys",
                    "keyPath": "/etc/pki/example.com/pubkey"
                }

            "172.30.1.1:5000": [{"type": "insecureAcceptAnything"}]
        }
    }
}
----

The policy can be saved onto a node as *_/etc/containers/policy.json_*. This
example enforces the following rules:

. Require images from the Red Hat Registry (`access.redhat.com`) to be
signed by the Red Hat public key.
. Require images from the OpenShift Container Registry in the *openshift*
namespace to be signed by the Red Hat public key.
. Require images from the OpenShift Container Registry in the *production*
namespace to be signed by the public key for `example.com`.
. Reject all other registries not specified by the global `default` definition.

xref:../install/host_preparation.adoc#enabling-image-signature-support[Enabling Image Signature Support].

[[security-deployment-signature-transports]]
=== Signature Transports

A signature transport is a way to store and retrieve the binary signature blob.
There are two types of signature transports.

- `atomic`: Managed by the {product-title} API.
- `docker`: Served as a local file or by a web server.

The {product-title} API manages signatures that use the `atomic` transport type.
You must store the images that use this signature type in the 
the OpenShift Container Registry. Because the *docker/distribution* 
xref:../admin_guide/image_signatures.adoc#reading-image-signatures-via-registry-api[`extensions` API]
auto-discovers the image signature endpoint, no additional
configuration is required.

Signatures that use the `docker` transport type are served by local file or web
server. These signatures are more flexible: you can serve images from any 
container registry and use an independent server to deliver binary
signatures. According to the
link:https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/signature-protocols.md[Signature access protocols],
you access the signatures for each image directly; the root of the server
directory does not display its file structure.

However, the `docker` transport type requires additional configuration. You must
configure the nodes with the URI of the signature server by placing
arbitrarily-named YAML files into a directory on the host system,
*_/etc/containers/registries.d_* by default. The YAML configuration files contain a
registry URI and a signature server URI, or _sigstore_:

.Example Registries.d File
----
docker:
    access.redhat.com:
        sigstore: https://access.redhat.com/webassets/docker/content/sigstore
----

In this example, the Red Hat Registry, `access.redhat.com`, is the signature
server that provides signatures for the `docker` transport type. Its URI is
defined in the `sigstore` parameter. You might name this file 
*_/etc/containers/registries.d/redhat.com.yaml_* and use Ansible to
automatically place the file on each node in your cluster. No service
restart is required since policy and *_registries.d_* files are dynamically
loaded by the container runtime.

For more details, see the
link:https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/registries.d.md[Registries Configuration Directory] or
link:https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/signature-protocols.md[Signature access protocols] source code documentation.

[[security-deployment-secrets-configmaps]]
== Secrets and ConfigMaps

The `Secret` object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such
as passwords, {product-title} client configuration files, *_dockercfg_* files,
and private source repository credentials. Secrets decouple sensitive content
from pods. You can mount secrets into containers using a volume plug-in or the
system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.

For example, to add a secret to your deployment configuration using the web
console so that it can access a private image repository:

. Create a new project.

. Navigate to *Resources -> Secrets* and create a new secret. Set *Secret Type* to
*Image Secret* and *Authentication Type* to *Image Registry Credentials* to
enter credentials for accessing a private image repository.

. When creating a deployment configuration (for example, from the *Add to Project ->
Deploy Image* page), set the *Pull Secret* to your new secret.

`ConfigMaps` are similar to secrets, but are designed to support working with
strings that do not contain sensitive information. The `ConfigMap` object holds
key-value pairs of configuration data that can be consumed in pods or used to
store configuration data for system components such as controllers.

[[security-deployment-sccs]]
== Security Context Constraints (SCCs)

You can use _security context constraints_ (SCCs) to define a set of conditions
that a pod (a collection of containers) must run with in order to be accepted
into the system.

Some aspects that can be managed by SCCs include:

- Running of privileged containers.
- Capabilities a container can request to be added.
- Use of host directories as volumes.
- SELinux context of the container.
- Container user ID.

If you have the required permissions, you can adjust the default SCC policies to
be more permissive.

[[security-deployment-cd-tooling]]
== Continuous Deployment Tooling

You can integrate your own continuous deployment (CD) tooling with
{product-title}.

By leveraging CI/CD and {product-title}, you can automate the process of
rebuilding the application to incorporate the latest fixes, testing, and
ensuring that it is deployed everywhere within the environment.
