Using the Container Security Operator (CSO), you can access vulnerability
scan results from the {product-title} web console for container images
used in active pods on the cluster. The CSO:

* Watches containers associated with pods on all or specified namespaces
* Queries the container registry where the containers came from for
vulnerability information, provided an imageâ€™s registry is running image
scanning (such as
link:https://quay.io[Quay.io] or a
link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-quay[Red Hat Quay] registry with Clair scanning)
* Exposes vulnerabilities via the `ImageManifestVuln` object in the Kubernetes API

Using the instructions here, the CSO is installed in the `openshift-operators`
namespace, so it is available to all namespaces on your OpenShift cluster.
