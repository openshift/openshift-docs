[[security-auth-controlling-access]]
== Controlling Access Using OAuth

API access control via authentication and authorization is critical for securing
your container platform. The {product-title} master includes a built-in OAuth
server. Developers and administrators obtain OAuth access tokens to authenticate
themselves to the API.

As an administrator, you can configure OAuth to authenticate using the _identity
provider_ of your choice, including:

- Keystone
- LDAP
- Basic Authentication
- GitHub / GitLab
- Google
- OpenID Connect
- and more.

[[security-auth-secure-self-service-web-console]]
== Secure Self-service Web Console

One of the key values of a container platform is the ability to enable developer
self-service, making it easier and faster for your development teams to deliver
applications built on approved layers. Multi-tenancy security is a must for the
platform itself to make sure teams do not access each other's environments
without authorization.

{product-title} provides a self-service web console that gives enough control to
teams to foster collaboration while still providing security. {product-title}
adds several components to Kubernetes to ensure a secure multi-tenant master:

- All access to the master is over TLS
- Access to the API Server is X.509 certificate or token based
- Project quota is used to limit how much damage a rogue token could do
- Etcd is not exposed directly to the cluster
