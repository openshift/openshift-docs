[[security-content-inside-the-container]]
== Security Inside the Container

Applications and infrastructures are composed of readily available components,
many of which are open source packages such as, the Linux operating system,
JBoss Web Server, PostgreSQL, and Node.js.

Containerized versions of these packages are also available. However, you need
to know where the packages originally came from, who built them, and whether
there is any malicious code inside them.

Some questions to answer include:

- What inside the containers will compromise your infrastructure?
- Are there known vulnerabilities in the application layer?
- Are the runtime and OS layers current?

[[security-content-scanning]]
== Container Content Scanning

Container scanning tools can leverage continuously updated vulnerability
databases to ensure that you always have the latest information on known
vulnerabilities for your container content. The list of known vulnerabilities
constantly evolves; you must check the contents of your container images when
you first download them and continue to track vulnerability status over time for
all of your approved and deployed images.

RHEL provides a pluggable API to support multiple scanners. You can also use Red
Hat CloudForms with OpenSCAP to scan container images for security issues. See
the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/security_guide/index#scanning-the-system-for-configuration-compliance-and-vulnerabilities_security-hardening[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Security Guide] for general information on OpenSCAP in
RHEL, and the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.2/html-single/policies_and_profiles_guide/#openscap[Red Hat CloudForms Policies and Profiles Guide] for specifics on OpenSCAP
integration.

{product-title} enables you to leverage such scanners with your CI/CD process.
For example, you can integrate static code analysis tools that test for security
flaws in your source code and software composition analysis tools that identify
open source libraries in order to provide metadata on those libraries such as
known vulnerabilities. This is covered in more detail in
xref:../security/build_process.adoc#security-build[Build Process].

[[security-integrate-external-scanners]]
== Integrating External Scanning Tools with OpenShift

{product-title} makes use of link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/[object annotations]
to extend functionality. External tools, such as vulnerability scanners, may
annotate image objects with metadata to summarize results and control pod
execution. This section describes the recognized format of this annotation so it
may be reliably used in consoles to display useful data to users.

[[security-image-metadata]]
=== Image Metadata

There are different types of image quality data, including package
vulnerabilities and open source software (OSS) license compliance. Additionally,
there may be more than one provider of this metadata. To that end, the following
annotation format has been reserved:

----
quality.images.openshift.io/<qualityType>.<providerId>: {}
----

.Annotation Key Format
[option="header"]
|===
|Component |Description |Acceptable Values

|`qualityType`
|Metadata type
|`vulnerability` +
`license` +
`operations` +
`policy`

|`providerId`
|Provider ID string
|`openscap` +
`redhatcatalog` +
`redhatinsights` +
`blackduck` +
`jfrog`
|===

[[security-example-annotation-keys]]
==== Example Annotation Keys

----
quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.blackduck: {}
quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.jfrog: {}
quality.images.openshift.io/license.blackduck: {}
quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.openscap: {}
----

The value of the image quality annotation is structured data that must adhere to
the following format:

.Annotation Value Format
[option="header"]
|===
|Field |Required? |Description |Type

|`name`
|Yes
|Provider display name
|String

|`timestamp`
|Yes
|Scan timestamp
|String

|`description`
|No
|Short description
|String

|`reference`
|Yes
|URL of information source and/or more details. Required so user may validate the data.
|String

|`scannerVersion`
|No
|Scanner version
|String

|`compliant`
|No
|Compliance pass/fail
|Boolean

|`summary`
|No
|Summary of issues found
|List (see table below)
|===

The `summary` field must adhere to the following format:

.Summary Field Value Format
[option="header"]
|===
|Field |Description |Type

|`label`
|Display label for component (for example, "critical," "important," "moderate,"
"low," or "health")
|String

|`data`
|Data for this component (for example, count of vulnerabilities found or score)
|String

|`severityIndex`
|Component index allowing for ordering and assigning graphical
representation. The value is range `0..3` where `0` = low.
|Integer

|`reference`
|URL of information source and/or more details. Optional.
|String
|===

[[security-example-annotation-values]]
==== Example Annotation Values

This example shows an OpenSCAP annotation for an image with
vulnerability summary data and a compliance boolean:

.OpenSCAP Annotation
[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "OpenSCAP",
  "description": "OpenSCAP vulnerability score",
  "timestamp": "2016-09-08T05:04:46Z",
  "reference": "https://www.open-scap.org/930492",
  "compliant": true,
  "scannerVersion": "1.2",
  "summary": [
    { "label": "critical", "data": "4", "severityIndex": 3, "reference": null },
    { "label": "important", "data": "12", "severityIndex": 2, "reference": null },
    { "label": "moderate", "data": "8", "severityIndex": 1, "reference": null },
    { "label": "low", "data": "26", "severityIndex": 0, "reference": null }
  ]
}
----

This example shows a
xref:../security/registries.adoc#security-registries-red-hat-registry-and-container-catalog[Red Hat Container Catalog] annotation for an image with health index data
with an external URL for additional details:

.Red Hat Container Catalog Annotation
[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "Red Hat Container Catalog",
  "description": "Container health index",
  "timestamp": "2016-09-08T05:04:46Z",
  "reference": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2016:1566",
  "compliant": null,
  "scannerVersion": "1.2",
  "summary": [
    { "label": "Health index", "data": "B", "severityIndex": 1, "reference": null }
  ]
}
----

[[security-annotating-image-objects]]
=== Annotating Image Objects

While
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream objects] are what an end-user of {product-title} operates against,
image objects are annotated with
security metadata. Image objects are cluster-scoped, pointing to a single image
that may be referenced by many image streams and tags.

[[security-example-annotate-CLI]]
==== Example Annotate CLI Command

Replace `<image>` with an image digest, for example
`sha256:fec8a395afe3e804b3db5cb277869142d2b5c561ebb517585566e160ff321988`:

----
$ oc annotate image <image> \
    quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.redhatcatalog='{ \
    "name": "Red Hat Container Catalog", \
    "description": "Container health index", \
    "timestamp": "2016-09-08T05:04:46Z", \
    "compliant": null, \
    "scannerVersion": "1.2", \
    "reference": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2016:1566", \
    "summary": "[ \
      { "label": "Health index", "data": "B", "severityIndex": 1, "reference": null } ]" }'
----

[[controlling-pod-execution]]
=== Controlling Pod Execution

To programmatically control if an image may be run, the
`images.openshift.io/deny-execution` image policy may be used. See
xref:../admin_guide/image_policy.adoc#admin-guide-image-policy[Image Policy] for
more information.

[[security-controlling-pod-execution-example-annotation]]
==== Example Annotation

[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  images.openshift.io/deny-execution: true
----

[[security-integration-reference]]
=== Integration Reference

In most cases, external tools such as vulnerability scanners will develop a
script or plug-in that watches for image updates, performs scanning, and
annotates the associated image object with the results. Typically this
automation calls the {product-title} REST API to write the annotation. See
xref:../rest_api/index.adoc#rest-api-index[REST API Reference] for general
information on the REST API and `PATCH` call to update images.

[[security-integration-reference-example-api-call]]
==== Example REST API Call

The following example call using `curl` overrides the value of the
annotation. Be sure to replace the values for `<token>`, `<openshift_server>`,
`<image_id>`, and `<image_annotation>`.

.Patch API Call
----
$ curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json" \
  https://<openshift_server>:8443/oapi/v1/images/<image_id> \
  --data '{ <image_annotation> }'
----

The following is an example of `PATCH` payload data:

.Patch Call Data
----
{
"metadata": {
  "annotations": {
    "quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.redhatcatalog":
       "{ 'name': 'Red Hat Container Catalog', 'description': 'Container health index', 'timestamp': '2016-09-08T05:04:46Z', 'compliant': null, 'reference': 'https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2016:1566', 'summary': [{'label': 'Health index', 'data': '4', 'severityIndex': 1, 'reference': null}] }"
    }
  }
}
