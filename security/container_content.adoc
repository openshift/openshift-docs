[[security-content-whats-in-your-container]]
== What's in Your Container?

When it comes to security, what is inside your container matters. Applications
and infrastructures are composed of readily available components, many of which
are open source packages such as, the Linux operating system, JBoss Web Server,
PostgreSQL, and Node.js.

Containerized versions of these packages are now also readily available, so that
you do not have to build your own. But, as with any code you download from some
external source, you need to know where they originally came from, who built
them, and whether there is any malicious code inside them. Ask yourself:

- Will what is inside the containers compromise your infrastructure?
- Are there known vulnerabilities in the application layer?
- Are the runtime and OS layers up to date?

[[security-content-scanning]]
== Scanning Container Content

To help answer these questions, container scanning tools can leverage
continuously updated vulnerability databases to be sure you always have the
latest information on known vulnerabilities for your container content. Because
the list of known vulnerabilities is constantly evolving, you need to check the
contents of your container images when you first download them and continue to
track vulnerability status over time for all your approved and deployed images.

RHEL provides a pluggable API to supports multiple scanners. Red Hat CloudForms
can also be used with OpenSCAP to scan container images for security issues.

In addition, {product-title} gives you the ability to leverage such scanners
with your CI/CD process. For example, you can integrate static code analysis
tools that test for security flaws in your source code and software composition
analysis tools that identify open source libraries in order to provide metadata
on those libraries such as known vulnerabilities. This is covered in more detail
in xref:{sourcedir}security/build_process.adoc#security-build[Build Process].

[[integrate-external-scanners]]
== Integrating External Scanning Tools with OpenShift

OpenShift makes use of link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/[object annotations]
to extend functionality. External tools, such as vulnerability scanners, may
annotate image objects with metadata to summarize results and control pod
execution. This section describes the recognized format of this annotation so it
may be reliably used in consoles to display useful data to users.

[[image-metadata]]
=== Image Metadata

There are different types of image quality data, including package
vulnerabilities and open source software (OSS) license compliance. Additionally,
there may be more than one provider of this metadata. To that end, the following
annotation format has been reserved:

====
----
quality.images.openshift.io/<qualityType>.<providerId>: {}
----
====

.Annotation key format
[option="header"]
|===
|Component |Description |Acceptable values

|qualityType
|metadata type
|vulnerability, license, operations

|providerId
|provider ID string
|redhatcloudforms, redhatcatalog, redhatinsights, blackduck, jfrog
|===

==== Example Annotation Keys

====
----
quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.blackduck: {}
quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.jfrog: {}
quality.images.openshift.io/license.blackduck: {}
quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.redhatcloudforms: {}
----
====

The value of the image quality annotation is structured data that must adhere to
the following format:

.Annotation value format
[option="header"]
|===
|Field |Required? |Description |Type

|name
|yes
|provider display name
|string

|timestamp
|yes
|scan timestamp
|int

|description
|no
|short description
|string

|reference
|no
|URL for detailed information
|string

|compliant
|no
|compliance pass/fail
|boolean

|summary
|no
|summary of vulnerabilities found
|list (see table below)
|===

The *summary* field must adhere to the following format:

.Summary field value format
[option="header"]
|===
|Field |Description |Type

|label
|display label for component, e.g. critical, important, moderate, low or freshness.
|string

|score
|score for this component, e.g. count of vulnerabilities found
|int

|severityIndex
|component score index allowing for ordering and assigning graphical
representation. The value is a range where 0=low or none.
|int
|===

==== Example Annotation Values

In this example, a Red Hat CloudForms annotation for an image with vulnerability
summary data and a compliance boolean.

.Red Hat CloudForms Annotation
[source,json]
----
{
  “name”: “CloudForms”,
  “description”: “vulnerability score”,
  “timestamp”: 2147483647,
  “reference”: null,
  “compliant”: true,
  “summary”: [
    { “label”: “critical”, “score”: 4, “severityIndex”: 3 },
    { “label”: “important”, “score”: 12, “severityIndex”: 2 },
    { “label”: “moderate”, “score”: 8, “severityIndex”: 1 },
    { “label”: “low”, “score”: 26, “severityIndex”: 0 }
  ]
}
----

In this example, a Red Hat Container Catalog annotation for an image with
vulnerability summary data with an external URL for additional details.

.Red Hat Container Catalog Annotation
[source,json]
----
{
  “name”: “Red Hat Container Catalog”,
  “description”: “Container freshness score”,
  “timestamp”: 2147483647,
  “reference”: “https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2016:1566”,
  “compliant”: null,
  “summary”: [
    { “label”: “Freshness”, “score”: 4, “severityIndex”: 4 }
  ]
}
----

[[annotating-image-objects]]
=== Annotating Image Objects

While xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[imagestream objects]
are what an end-user of OpenShift operates against, xref:../rest_api/openshift_v1.html#v1-image[image objects]
are annotated with security metadata. Image objects are cluster-scoped, pointing
to a single image that may be referenced by many imagestreams and tags.

==== Example annotate CLI command

Replace *IMAGE* with an image name, e.g. *sha256:fec8a395afe3e804b3db5cb277869142d2b5c561ebb517585566e160ff321988*.

====
----
$ oc annotate image IMAGE \
    quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.redhatcatalog='{
    "name": "Red Hat Container Catalog",
    “description”: “Container freshness score”,
    “timestamp”: 2147483647,
    “compliant”: null,
    "reference": “https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2016:1566”,
    "summary": “[
      { “label”: “Freshness”, “score”: 4, “severityIndex”: 4 } ]" }'
----
====

[[controlling-pod-execution]]
=== Controlling Pod Execution

To programmatically control if an image may be run, the
*images.openshift.io/deny-execution* image policy may be used. See
xref:../admin_guide/image_policy.adoc[image policy] for more information.

==== Example annotation

[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  images.openshift.io/deny-execution: true
----

[[integration-reference]]
=== Integration Reference

In most cases, external tools such as vulnerability scanners will develop a
script or plugin that watches for image updates, performs scanning
and annotate the associated image object with the results. Typically this
automation calls the OpenShift REST API to write the annotation.
See xref:../rest_api/index.adoc[REST API documentation] for more information on
making REST API calls.
