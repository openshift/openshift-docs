== Where Do Your Containers Come From?

There are tools you can use to scan and track the contents of your downloaded
and deployed container images. However, there are many public sources of
container images. When using public container registries, you can add a layer of
protection by using trusted sources.

[[security-registries-immutable-and-certified-containers]]
== Immutable and Certified Containers

Consuming security updates is particularly important when managing _immutable
containers_. Immutable containers are containers that will never be changed
while running. When you deploy immutable containers, you do not step into the
running container to replace one or more binaries; you rebuild and redeploy an
updated container image.

Red Hat certified images are:

- Free of known vulnerabilities in the platform components or layers.
- Compatible across the RHEL platforms, from bare metal to cloud.
- Supported by Red Hat.

The list of known vulnerabilities is constantly evolving, so you must track the
contents of your deployed container images, as well as newly downloaded images,
over time. You can use
link:https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories[Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs)] to alert you to any newly discovered issues in
Red Hat certified container images, and direct you to the updated image.

== Red Hat Registry and Red Hat Container Catalog

Red Hat provides certified containers for Red Hat products and partner offerings
via the _Red Hat Registry_, which is a public container registry hosted by Red
Hat at link:https://registry.access.redhat.com[registry.access.redhat.com]. The
link:https://access.redhat.com/containers[_Red Hat Container Catalog_] enables
you to identify bug fix or security advisories associated with container images
provided in the Red Hat Registry.

Container content is monitored for vulnerabilities by Red Hat and updated
regularly. When Red Hat releases security updates, such as fixes to *glibc*,
Drown, or Dirty Cow, any affected container images are also rebuilt and pushed
to the Red Hat Registry.

Red Hat uses a "health index" for security risk with containers provided through
the Red Hat Container Catalog. These containers consume software provided by Red
Hat and the errata process, so old, stale containers are insecure whereas new,
fresh containers are more secure.

To illustrate the age of containers, the Red Hat Container Catalog uses a
grading system. A freshness grade is a measure of the oldest and most severe
security errata available for an image. "A" is more up-to-date than "F". See
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2803031[Container Health Index grades as used inside the Red Hat Container Catalog] for more details on this grading system.

== OpenShift Container Registry

{product-title} includes the _OpenShift Container Registry_, a private registry
that runs integrated with the platform that you can use to manage your container
images. The OpenShift Container Registry provides role-based access controls
that allow you to manage who can pull and push which container images.

{product-title} also supports integration with other private registries you may
already be using.
