[[security-network-namespaces]]
== Network Namespaces

{product-title} uses software-defined networking (SDN) to provide a unified
cluster network that enables communication between containers across the
cluster.

Using network namespaces, you can isolate pod networks. Each pod gets its own IP
and port range to bind to, thereby isolating pod networks from each other on the
node. Pods from different projects cannot send packets to or receive packets
from pods and services of a different project. You can use this to isolate
developer, test and production environments within a cluster.

{product-title} also provides the ability to control egress traffic using either
a router or firewall method. For example, you can use IP whitelisting to control
database access.

[[security-network-isolating-applications]]
== Isolating Applications

{product-title} enables you to segment network traffic on a single cluster to
make multi-tenant clusters that isolate users, teams, applications, and
environments.

For example, to isolate a project network in the cluster and vice versa, run:

----
$ oc adm pod-network isolate-projects <project1> <project2>
----

In the above example, all of the pods and services in `<project1>` and
`<project2>` can not access any pods and services from other non-global projects
in the cluster and vice versa.
