* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:0536[RHSA-2025:0536]

Version `1.15.0` of the {cert-manager-operator} is based on the upstream cert-manager version `v1.15.4`. For more information, see the link:https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.15/#v1154[cert-manager project release notes for v1.15.4].

[id="cert-manager-operator-1-15-0-features-enhancements_{context}"]
=== New features and enhancements

*Scheduling overrides for {cert-manager-operator}*

With this release, you can configure scheduling overrides for {cert-manager-operator}, including the cert-manager controller, webhook, and CA injector.

*Google CAS issuer*

The {cert-manager-operator} now supports the Google Certificate Authority Service (CAS) issuer. The `google-cas-issuer` is an external issuer for cert-manager that automates certificate lifecycle management, including issuance and renewal, with CAS-managed private certificate authorities.

[NOTE]
====
The Google CAS issuer is validated only with version 0.9.0 and {cert-manager-operator} version 1.15.0. These versions support tasks such as issuing, renewing, and managing certificates for the API server and ingress controller in {product-title} clusters.
====

*Default `installMode` updated to `AllNamespaces`*

Starting from version 1.15.0, the default and recommended Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) `installMode` is `AllNamespaces`. Previously, the default was `SingleNamespace`. This change aligns with best practices for multi-namespace Operator management.
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23406[OCPBUGS-23406].

*Redundant `kube-rbac-proxy` sidecar removed*

The Operator no longer includes the redundant `kube-rbac-proxy` sidecar container, reducing resource usage and complexity.
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CM-436[CM-436].

== {cert-manager-operator} 1.14.0

Issued: 2024-07-08

The following advisory is available for the {cert-manager-operator} 1.14.0:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2024:4360[RHEA-2024:4360]

Version `1.14.0` of the {cert-manager-operator} is based on the upstream cert-manager version `v1.14.5`. For more information, see the link:https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.14/#v1145[cert-manager project release notes for v1.14.5].

[id="cert-manager-operator-new-features-1-14-0"]
=== New features and enhancements

*FIPS compliance support*

With this release, FIPS mode is now automatically enabled for {cert-manager-operator}. When installed on an {product-title} cluster in FIPS mode, {cert-manager-operator} ensures compatibility without affecting the cluster's FIPS support status.

*Securing routes with cert-manager managed certificates (Technology Preview)*

With this release, you can manage certificates referenced in `Route` resources by using the {cert-manager-operator}. For more information, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-securing-routes.adoc#cert-manager-securing-routes[Securing routes with the {cert-manager-operator}].

*NCM issuer*

The {cert-manager-operator} now supports the Nokia NetGuard Certificate Manager (NCM) issuer. The `ncm-issuer` is a cert-manager external issuer that integrates with the NCM PKI system using a Kubernetes controller to sign certificate requests. This integration streamlines the process of obtaining non-self-signed certificates for applications, ensuring their validity and keeping them updated.

[NOTE]
====
The NCM issuer is validated only with version 1.1.1 and the {cert-manager-operator} version 1.14.0. This version handles tasks such as issuance, renewal, and managing certificates for the API server and ingress controller of {product-title} clusters.

=== New features and enhancements

* You can now manage certificates for API Server and Ingress Controller by using the {cert-manager-operator}.
For more information, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-creating-certificate.adoc#cert-manager-creating-certificate[Configuring certificates with an issuer].

* With this release, the scope of the {cert-manager-operator}, which was previously limited to the {product-title} on AMD64 architecture, has now been expanded to include support for managing certificates on {product-title} running on {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`) and ARM64 architectures.

* With this release, you can use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for performing the self-checks during the ACME DNS-01 challenge verification. The DNS self-check method can be controlled by using the command line flags, `--dns01-recursive-nameservers-only` and `--dns01-recursive-nameservers`.
