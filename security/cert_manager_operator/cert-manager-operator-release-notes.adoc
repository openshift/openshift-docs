=== Bug fixes

* Previously, you could not configure the CPU and memory requests and limits for the cert-manager components such as cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook. Now, you can configure the CPU and memory requests and limits for the cert-manager components by using the command-line interface (CLI). For more information, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-customizing-api-fields.adoc#cert-manager-configure-cpu-memory_cert-manager-customizing-api-fields[Overriding CPU and memory limits for the cert-manager components]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-13830[*OCPBUGS-13830*])

* Previously, if you updated the `ClusterIssuer` object, the {cert-manager-operator} could not verify and update the change in the cluster issuer. Now, if you modify the `ClusterIssuer` object, the {cert-manager-operator} verifies the ACME account registration and updates the change. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8210[*OCPBUGS-8210*])

* Previously, the {cert-manager-operator} did not support enabling the  `--enable-certificate-owner-ref` flag. Now, the {cert-manager-operator} supports enabling the `--enable-certificate-owner-ref` flag by adding the `spec.controllerConfig.overrideArgs` field in the `cluster` object. After enabling the `--enable-certificate-owner-ref` flag, cert-manager can automatically delete the secret when the `Certificate` resource is removed from the cluster. For more information on enabling the `--enable-certificate-owner-ref` flag and deleting the TLS secret automatically, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-customizing-api-fields.adoc#cert-manager-override-flag-controller_cert-manager-customizing-api-fields[Deleting a TLS secret automatically upon Certificate removal] (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CM-98[*CM-98*])

* Previously, the {cert-manager-operator} could not pull the `jetstack-cert-manager-container-v1.12.4-1` image. The cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook pods were stuck in the `ImagePullBackOff` state. Now, the {cert-manager-operator} pulls the `jetstack-cert-manager-container-v1.12.4-1` image to run the cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook pods successfully.

** DNS-01
** HTTP-01

* The following DNS-01 providers for ACME issuers are supported:
** Amazon Route 53
** Azure DNS
** Google Cloud DNS

* The {cert-manager-operator} now supports injecting custom CA certificates and propagating cluster-wide egress proxy environment variables.

* You can customize the {cert-manager-operator} API fields by overriding environment variables and arguments. For more information, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-customizing-api-fields.adoc#cert-manager-customizing-api-fields[Customizing cert-manager Operator API fields]

[WARNING]
====
Using the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` section to modify the configuration of an Operator is unsupported and might block cluster upgrades.

* The {cert-manager-operator} does not support using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) pod identities to assign a managed identity to a pod. As a workaround, you can use a service principal to assign a managed identity. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8665[*OCPBUGS-8665*])

* The {cert-manager-operator} does not support using Google workload identity federation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9998[*OCPBUGS-9998*])
