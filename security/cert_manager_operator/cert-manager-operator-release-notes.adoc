[id="cert-manager-operator-1-18-0-features-enhancements_{context}"]
=== New features and enhancements

Istio-CSR integration with {cert-manager-operator} (Generally Available)::
With this release, the integration of the {cert-manager-operator} with Istio-CSR, which was previously provided as a Technology Preview feature, is fully supported. This feature offers enhanced support for securing workloads and control plane components within {SMProductName} or Istio environments. By utilizing the {cert-manager-operator} managed Istio-CSR agent, Istio can obtain, sign, deliver, and renew certificates required for mutual TLS (mTLS).
For more information, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-operator-integrating-istio.adoc#cert-manager-operator-istio-csr-installing_cert-manager-operator-integrating-istio[Integrating the cert-manager Operator with Istio-CSR].

Replica count configuration for {cert-manager-operator} operands::
With this release, you can override the default replica counts for the {cert-manager-operator} `controller`, `webhook`, and `cainjector` operands. To configure these values, specify the new `overrideReplicas` fields in the `CertManager` custom resource. With this enhancement, you can configure high availability (HA) and scale operands based on your specific operational requirements. For more information, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-customizing-api-fields.adoc#cert-manager-explanation-of-certmanager-cr-fields_cert-manager-customizing-api-fields[Common configurable fields in the CertManager CR for the cert-manager components].

Root filesystem is read-only for {cert-manager-operator} containers::
With this release, to improve security, the {cert-manager-operator} and all its operands have the `readOnlyRootFilesystem` security context set to `true` by default. This enhancement hardens the containers and prevents a potential attacker from modifying the contents of the container's root file system.

Network policy hardening is now available for {cert-manager-operator} components::
With this release, the {cert-manager-operator} includes predefined `NetworkPolicy` resources to enhance security by controlling ingress and egress traffic for its components. These policies cover internal traffic, such as ingress to metrics and webhook servers, and egress to the OpenShift API and DNS servers.

By default, this feature is disabled to prevent connectivity issues during upgrades. You must explicitly enable it in the `CertManager` custom resource. For more information, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-nw-policy.adoc#cert-manager-nw-policy[Network policy configuration for {cert-manager-operator}].


[id="cert-manager-operator-1-18-0-known-issues_{context}"]
=== Known issues

* The upstream cert-manager `v1.18` release updated the ACME HTTP-01 challenge ingress path type from `ImplementationSpecific` to `Exact`. The OpenShift Route API does not have an equivalent for the `Exact` path type, which prevents the ingress-to-route controller from supporting it. As a result, ingress resources created for HTTP-01 challenges cannot route traffic to the solver pod, causing the challenge to fail with a 503 error.
To mitigate this issue, the `ACMEHTTP01IngressPathTypeExact` feature gate is disabled by default in this release.

* Previously, the `status` field in the `IstioCSR` custom resource (CR) was not set to `Ready` even after the successful deployment of Istio‑CSR. With this fix, the `status` field is correctly set to `Ready`, ensuring consistent and reliable status reporting. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CM-546[CM-546])

[id="cert-manager-operator-1-17-0-features-enhancements_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

*Support to configure resource requests and limits for ACME HTTP‑01 solver pods*

With this release, the {cert-manager-operator} supports configuring CPU and memory resource requests and limits for ACME HTTP‑01 solver pods. You can configure the CPU and memory resource requests and limits by using the following overridable arguments in the `CertManager` custom resource (CR):

* `--acme-http01-solver-resource-limits-cpu`
* `--acme-http01-solver-resource-limits-memory`
* `--acme-http01-solver-resource-request-cpu`
* `--acme-http01-solver-resource-request-memory`

== Bug fixes

Previously, {cert-manager-operator} failed to create the `cert-manager-tokenrequest` role due to insufficient RBAC permissions. This resulted in `RoleCreateFailed` errors and a degraded static-resource controller. With this release, the issue is resolved by adding the necessary `serviceaccounts/token` create permission to the  RBAC configuration. As a result, the `cert-manager-tokenrequest` role and role binding are now successfully created, and `RoleCreateFailed` errors no longer appear in the operator logs. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56758[(OCPBUGS-56758)]

== New features and enhancements

*Disconnected environment support*

With this release, the {cert-manager-operator} has been verified to be mirrored to and installed in a disconnected environment.

The Operator has also been validated to work with the following issuer types in disconnected environments: ACME, CA, Self-signed, and Vault.
Specifically, private or self-hosted ACME servers have been validated, as Let's Encrypt or other public ACME services are not feasible options in disconnected environments.
The oc-mirror plugin v2 is the preferred method to mirror Operator images.
For more information, see xref:../../disconnected/about-installing-oc-mirror-v2.adoc#about-installing-oc-mirror-v2[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation by using the oc-mirror plugin v2].

*Extended operand metrics support*

With this release, cert-manager webhook and cainjector operands now expose Prometheus metrics on port 9402 by default via the `/metrics` service endpoint.
You can configure OpenShift Monitoring to collect metrics from all cert-manager operands by enabling the built-in user workload monitoring stack.
For more information, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-monitoring.adoc#cert-manager-monitoring[Monitoring {cert-manager-operator}].

*Streaming Lists enablement*

With this release, the {cert-manager-operator} now uses the new upstream WatchListClient feature.
This enables use of the Streaming Lists feature of the Kubernetes API server, which reduces the load on the API server.
The peak memory use of the cert-manager components when they start up is optimized on {product-title} 4.14 and later.

*Scheduling overrides for {cert-manager-operator}*

With this release, you can configure scheduling overrides for {cert-manager-operator}, including the cert-manager controller, webhook, and CA injector.

*Google CAS issuer*

The {cert-manager-operator} now supports the Google Certificate Authority Service (CAS) issuer. The `google-cas-issuer` is an external issuer for cert-manager that automates certificate lifecycle management, including issuance and renewal, with CAS-managed private certificate authorities.

[NOTE]
====
The Google CAS issuer is validated only with version 0.9.0 and {cert-manager-operator} version 1.15.0. These versions support tasks such as issuing, renewing, and managing certificates for the API server and ingress controller in {product-title} clusters.

*Default `installMode` updated to `AllNamespaces`*

Starting from version 1.15.0, the default and recommended Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) `installMode` is `AllNamespaces`. Previously, the default was `SingleNamespace`. This change aligns with best practices for multi-namespace Operator management.
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23406[OCPBUGS-23406].

*Redundant `kube-rbac-proxy` sidecar removed*

The Operator no longer includes the redundant `kube-rbac-proxy` sidecar container, reducing resource usage and complexity.
