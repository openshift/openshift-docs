=== New features and enhancements

* You can now manage certificates for API Server and Ingress Controller by using the {cert-manager-operator}.
For more information, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-creating-certificate.adoc#cert-manager-creating-certificate[Configuring certificates with an issuer].

* With this release, the scope of the {cert-manager-operator}, which was previously limited to the {product-title} on AMD64 architecture, has now been expanded to include support for managing certificates on {product-title} running on {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`) and ARM64 architectures.

* With this release, you can use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for performing the self-checks during the ACME DNS-01 challenge verification. The DNS self-check method can be controlled by using the command line flags, `--dns01-recursive-nameservers-only` and `--dns01-recursive-nameservers`.
