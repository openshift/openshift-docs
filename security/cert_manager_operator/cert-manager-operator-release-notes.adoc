== {cert-manager-operator} 1.16.0

Issued: 2025-05-27

The following advisories are available for the {cert-manager-operator} 1.16.0:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2025:8163[RHEA-2025:8163]

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2025:8198[RHEA-2025:8198]

Version `1.16.0` of the {cert-manager-operator} is based on the upstream cert-manager version `v1.16.4`. For more information, see the link:https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.16/#v1164[cert-manager project release notes for v1.16.4].

[id="cert-manager-operator-1-16-0-features-enhancements_{context}"]
=== New features and enhancements

*Disconnected environment support*

With this release, the {cert-manager-operator} has been verified to be mirrored to and installed in a disconnected environment.

The Operator has also been validated to work with the following issuer types in disconnected environments: ACME, CA, Self-signed, and Vault.
Specifically, private or self-hosted ACME servers have been validated, as Let's Encrypt or other public ACME services are not feasible options in disconnected environments.
The oc-mirror plugin v2 is the preferred method to mirror Operator images.
For more information, see xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#installing-mirroring-disconnected[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation by using the oc-mirror plugin].

*Extended operand metrics support*

With this release, cert-manager webhook and cainjector operands now expose Prometheus metrics on port 9402 by default via the `/metrics` service endpoint.
You can configure OpenShift Monitoring to collect metrics from all cert-manager operands by enabling the built-in user workload monitoring stack.
For more information, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-monitoring.adoc#cert-manager-monitoring[Monitoring {cert-manager-operator}].

*Streaming Lists enablement*

With this release, the {cert-manager-operator} now uses the new upstream WatchListClient feature.
This enables use of the Streaming Lists feature of the Kubernetes API server, which reduces the load on the API server.
The peak memory use of the cert-manager components when they start up is optimized on {product-title} 4.14 and later.

*Integrating the {cert-manager-operator} with Istio-CSR* (Technology Preview)

The {cert-manager-operator} now supports the Istio-CSR. With this integration, cert-manager Operator's issuers can issue, sign, and renew certificates for mutual TLS (mTLS) communication. {SMProductName} and `Istio` can now request these certificates directly from the cert-manager Operator.

=== New features and enhancements

*Scheduling overrides for {cert-manager-operator}*

With this release, you can configure scheduling overrides for {cert-manager-operator}, including the cert-manager controller, webhook, and CA injector.

*Google CAS issuer*

The {cert-manager-operator} now supports the Google Certificate Authority Service (CAS) issuer. The `google-cas-issuer` is an external issuer for cert-manager that automates certificate lifecycle management, including issuance and renewal, with CAS-managed private certificate authorities.

[NOTE]
====
The Google CAS issuer is validated only with version 0.9.0 and {cert-manager-operator} version 1.15.0. These versions support tasks such as issuing, renewing, and managing certificates for the API server and ingress controller in {product-title} clusters.
====

*Default `installMode` updated to `AllNamespaces`*

Starting from version 1.15.0, the default and recommended Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) `installMode` is `AllNamespaces`. Previously, the default was `SingleNamespace`. This change aligns with best practices for multi-namespace Operator management.
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23406[OCPBUGS-23406].

*Redundant `kube-rbac-proxy` sidecar removed*

The Operator no longer includes the redundant `kube-rbac-proxy` sidecar container, reducing resource usage and complexity.
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CM-436[CM-436].

=== New features and enhancements

*FIPS compliance support*

With this release, FIPS mode is now automatically enabled for {cert-manager-operator}. When installed on an {product-title} cluster in FIPS mode, {cert-manager-operator} ensures compatibility without affecting the cluster's FIPS support status.

*NCM issuer*

The {cert-manager-operator} now supports the Nokia NetGuard Certificate Manager (NCM) issuer. The `ncm-issuer` is a cert-manager external issuer that integrates with the NCM PKI system using a Kubernetes controller to sign certificate requests. This integration streamlines the process of obtaining non-self-signed certificates for applications, ensuring their validity and keeping them updated.

[NOTE]
====
The NCM issuer is validated only with version 1.1.1 and the {cert-manager-operator} version 1.14.0. This version handles tasks such as issuance, renewal, and managing certificates for the API server and ingress controller of {product-title} clusters.

* With this release, the scope of the {cert-manager-operator}, which was previously limited to the {product-title} on AMD64 architecture, has now been expanded to include support for managing certificates on {product-title} running on {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`) and ARM64 architectures.

* With this release, you can use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for performing the self-checks during the ACME DNS-01 challenge verification. The DNS self-check method can be controlled by using the command-line flags, `--dns01-recursive-nameservers-only` and `--dns01-recursive-nameservers`.

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `cm-acme-http-solver` pod did not use the latest published Red Hat image `registry.redhat.io/cert-manager/jetstack-cert-manager-acmesolver-rhel9`. With this release, the `cm-acme-http-solver` pod uses the latest published Red Hat image `registry.redhat.io/cert-manager/jetstack-cert-manager-acmesolver-rhel9`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-10821[*OCPBUGS-10821*])

* Previously, the {cert-manager-operator} did not support changing labels for cert-manager pods such as controller, CA injector, and Webhook pods. With this release, you can add labels to cert-manager pods. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8466[*OCPBUGS-8466*])

* Previously, you could not update the log verbosity level in the {cert-manager-operator}. You can now update the log verbosity level by using an environmental variable `OPERATOR_LOG_LEVEL` in its subscription resource. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9994[*OCPBUGS-9994*])

* Previously, when uninstalling the {cert-manager-operator}, if you select the *Delete all operand instances for this operator* checkbox in the {product-title} web console, the Operator was not uninstalled properly. The {cert-manager-operator} is now properly uninstalled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9960[*OCPBUGS-9960*])

[id="cert-manager-operator-1-11-1-known-issues"]
=== Known issues

* After installing the {cert-manager-operator}, if you navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators* and select *Operator details* in the {product-title} web console, you cannot see the cert-manager resources that are created across all namespaces. As a workaround, you can navigate to *Home -> API Explorer* to see the cert-manager resources. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11647[*OCPBUGS-11647*])

* After uninstalling the {cert-manager-operator} by using the web console, the {cert-manager-operator} does not remove the cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook pods automatically from the `cert-manager` namespace. As a workaround, you can manually delete the cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook pod deployments present in the `cert-manager` namespace.
