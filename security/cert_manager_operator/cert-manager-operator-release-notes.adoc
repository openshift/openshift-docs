=== Bug fixes

* Previously, you could not configure the CPU and memory requests and limits for the cert-manager components such as cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook. Now, you can configure the CPU and memory requests and limits for the cert-manager components by using the command-line interface (CLI). For more information, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-customizing-api-fields.adoc#cert-manager-configure-cpu-memory_cert-manager-customizing-api-fields[Overriding CPU and memory limits for the cert-manager components]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-13830[*OCPBUGS-13830*])

* Previously, if you updated the `ClusterIssuer` object, the {cert-manager-operator} could not verify and update the change in the cluster issuer. Now, if you modify the `ClusterIssuer` object, the {cert-manager-operator} verifies the ACME account registration and updates the change. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8210[*OCPBUGS-8210*])

* Previously, the {cert-manager-operator} did not support enabling the  `--enable-certificate-owner-ref` flag. Now, the {cert-manager-operator} supports enabling the `--enable-certificate-owner-ref` flag by adding the `spec.controllerConfig.overrideArgs` field in the `cluster` object. After enabling the `--enable-certificate-owner-ref` flag, cert-manager can automatically delete the secret when the `Certificate` resource is removed from the cluster. For more information on enabling the `--enable-certificate-owner-ref` flag and deleting the TLS secret automatically, see xref:../../security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-customizing-api-fields.adoc#cert-manager-override-flag-controller_cert-manager-customizing-api-fields[Deleting a TLS secret automatically upon Certificate removal] (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CM-98[*CM-98*])

* Previously, the {cert-manager-operator} could not pull the `jetstack-cert-manager-container-v1.12.4-1` image. The cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook pods were stuck in the `ImagePullBackOff` state. Now, the {cert-manager-operator} pulls the `jetstack-cert-manager-container-v1.12.4-1` image to run the cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook pods successfully.

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `cm-acme-http-solver` pod did not use the latest published Red Hat image `registry.redhat.io/cert-manager/jetstack-cert-manager-acmesolver-rhel9`. With this release, the `cm-acme-http-solver` pod uses the latest published Red Hat image `registry.redhat.io/cert-manager/jetstack-cert-manager-acmesolver-rhel9`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-10821[*OCPBUGS-10821*])

* Previously, the {cert-manager-operator} did not support changing labels for cert-manager pods such as controller, CA injector, and Webhook pods. With this release, you can add labels to cert-manager pods. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8466[*OCPBUGS-8466*])

* Previously, you could not update the log verbosity level in the {cert-manager-operator}. You can now update the log verbosity level by using an environmental variable `OPERATOR_LOG_LEVEL` in its subscription resource. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9994[*OCPBUGS-9994*])

* Previously, when uninstalling the {cert-manager-operator}, if you select the *Delete all operand instances for this operator* checkbox in the {product-title} web console, the Operator was not uninstalled properly.

=== Known issues

* After installing the {cert-manager-operator}, if you navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators* and select *Operator details* in the {product-title} web console, you cannot see the cert-manager resources that are created across all namespaces. As a workaround, you can navigate to *Home -> API Explorer* to see the cert-manager resources. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11647[*OCPBUGS-11647*])

* After uninstalling the {cert-manager-operator} by using the web console, the {cert-manager-operator} does not remove the cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook pods automatically from the `cert-manager` namespace. As a workaround, you can manually delete the cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook pod deployments present in the `cert-manager` namespace.
