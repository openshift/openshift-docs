[id="cert-manager-operator-1.11.1-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `cm-acme-http-solver` pod did not use the latest published Red Hat image `registry.redhat.io/cert-manager/jetstack-cert-manager-acmesolver-rhel9`. With this release, the `cm-acme-http-solver` pod uses the latest published Red Hat image `registry.redhat.io/cert-manager/jetstack-cert-manager-acmesolver-rhel9`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-10821[*OCPBUGS-10821*])

* Previously, the {cert-manager-operator} did not support changing labels for cert-manager pods such as controller, CA injector, and Webhook pods. With this release, you can add labels to cert-manager pods. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8466[*OCPBUGS-8466*])

* Previously, you could not update the log verbosity level in the {cert-manager-operator}. You can now update the log verbosity level by using an environmental variable `OPERATOR_LOG_LEVEL` in its subscription resource. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9994[*OCPBUGS-9994*])

* Previously, when uninstalling the {cert-manager-operator}, if you select the *Delete all operand instances for this operator* checkbox in the {product-title} web console, the Operator was not uninstalled properly. The {cert-manager-operator} is now properly uninstalled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9960[*OCPBUGS-9960*])

* Previously, the {cert-manager-operator} did not support using Google workload identity federation. The {cert-manager-operator} now supports using Google workload identity federation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9998[*OCPBUGS-9998*])

[id="cert-manager-operator-1.11.1-known-issues"]
=== Known issues

* After installing the {cert-manager-operator}, if you navigate to *Operators â†’ Installed Operators* and select *Operator details* in the {product-title} web console, you cannot see the cert-manager resources that are created across all namespaces. As a workaround, you can navigate to *Home -> API Explorer* to see the cert-manager resources. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11647[*OCPBUGS-11647*])

* After uninstalling the {cert-manager-operator} by using the web console, the {cert-manager-operator} does not remove the cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook pods automatically from the `cert-manager` namespace. As a workaround, you can manually delete the cert-manager controller, CA injector, and Webhook pod deployments present in the `cert-manager` namespace. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-13679[*OCPBUGS-13679*])

[id="cert-manager-operator-1.10.2-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` field replaced user-provided arguments instead of appending them. Now, the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` field properly appends user-provided arguments. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CM-23[*CM-23*])
+
[WARNING]
====
Using the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` section to modify the configuration of an Operator is unsupported and might block cluster upgrades.
====

* Previously, the {cert-manager-operator} was installed as a cluster Operator. With this release, the {cert-manager-operator} is now properly installed as an OLM Operator. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CM-35[*CM-35*])

[id="cert-manager-operator-1.10.2-known-issues"]
=== Known issues

* Using `Route` objects is not fully supported. Currently, to use {cert-manager-operator} with `Routes`, users must create `Ingress` objects, which are translated to `Route` objects by the Ingress-to-Route Controller. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CM-16[*CM-16*])

* The {cert-manager-operator} does not support using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) pod identities to assign a managed identity to a pod. As a workaround, you can use a service principal to assign a managed identity. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8665[*OCPBUGS-8665*])

* The {cert-manager-operator} does not support using Google workload identity federation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9998[*OCPBUGS-9998*])

* When uninstalling the {cert-manager-operator}, if you select the *Delete all operand instances for this operator* checkbox in the {product-title} web console, the Operator is not uninstalled properly. As a workaround, do not select this checkbox when uninstalling the {cert-manager-operator}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9960[*OCPBUGS-9960*])
