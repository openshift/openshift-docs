=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` field replaced user-provided arguments instead of appending them. Now, the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` field properly appends user-provided arguments. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CM-23[*CM-23*])
+
[WARNING]
====
Using the `unsupportedConfigOverrides` section to modify the configuration of an Operator is unsupported and might block cluster upgrades.
====

* Previously, the {cert-manager-operator} was installed as a cluster Operator. With this release, the {cert-manager-operator} is now properly installed as an OLM Operator. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CM-35[*CM-35*])

[id="cert-manager-operator-1.10.2-known-issues"]
=== Known issues

* Using `Route` objects is not fully supported. Currently, to use {cert-manager-operator} with `Routes`, users must create `Ingress` objects, which are translated to `Route` objects by the Ingress-to-Route Controller. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CM-16[*CM-16*])

* The {cert-manager-operator} does not support using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) pod identities to assign a managed identity to a pod. As a workaround, you can use a service principal to assign a managed identity. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8665[*OCPBUGS-8665*])

* The {cert-manager-operator} does not support using Google workload identity federation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9998[*OCPBUGS-9998*])

* When uninstalling the {cert-manager-operator}, if you select the *Delete all operand instances for this operator* checkbox in the {product-title} web console, the Operator is not uninstalled properly. As a workaround, do not select this checkbox when uninstalling the {cert-manager-operator}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9960[*OCPBUGS-9960*])
