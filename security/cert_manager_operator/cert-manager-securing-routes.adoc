In the {product-title}, the route API is extended to provide a configurable option to reference TLS certificates via secrets. With xref:../../networking/ingress_load_balancing/routes/creating-advanced-routes.adoc#nw-ingress-route-secret-load-external-cert_secured-routes[externally managed certificates] enabled, you can minimize errors from manual intervention, streamline the certificate management process, and enable the {product-title} router to promptly serve the referenced certificate.
