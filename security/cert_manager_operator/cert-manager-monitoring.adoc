toc::[]

You can expose controller metrics for the {cert-manager-operator} in the format provided by the Prometheus Operator.

[NOTE]
====
Platform monitoring previously supported namespaces with the `kube` or `openshift` prefixes. As stated in the `configuring the monitoring stack`, creating `ServiceMonitors` in these namespaces is not supported.

Cluster monitoring now includes namespaces labeled `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true`, but adding `ServiceMonitors` for platform monitoring in these namespaces is also unsupported. Ensure monitoring configurations align with the supported practices.
