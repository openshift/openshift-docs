:FeatureName: Istio-CSR integration for {cert-manager-operator}
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The {cert-manager-operator} provides enhanced support for securing workloads and control plane components in {SMProductName} or Istio. This includes support for certificates enabling mutual TLS (mTLS), which are signed, delivered, and renewed using cert-manager issuers. You can secure Istio workloads and control plane components by using the {cert-manager-operator} managed Istio-CSR agent.

With this Istio-CSR integration, Istio can now obtain certificates from the {cert-manager-operator}, simplifying security and certificate management.
