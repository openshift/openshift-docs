The File Integrity Operator is an {product-title} Operator that continually runs
file integrity checks on the cluster nodes. It deploys a DaemonSet that
initializes and runs privileged advanced intrusion detection environment (AIDE)
containers on each node, providing a status object with a log of files that are
modified during the initial run of the DaemonSet pods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, only {op-system-first} nodes are supported.
