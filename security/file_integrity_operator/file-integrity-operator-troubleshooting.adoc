== General troubleshooting

Issue::
You want to generally troubleshoot issues with the File Integrity Operator.

Resolution::
Enable the debug flag in the `FileIntegrity` object. The `debug` flag increases
the verbosity of the demons that run in the `DaemonSet` pods and run the AIDE
checks.

== Checking the AIDE configuration

Issue::
You want to check the AIDE configuration.

Resolution::
The AIDE configuration is stored in a config map with the same name as the
`FileIntegrity` object. All AIDE configuration config maps are labeled
with `file-integrity.openshift.io/aide-conf`.

== Determining the FileIntegrity object's phase

Issue::
You want to determine if the `FileIntegrity` object exists and see its current
status.

Resolution::
To see the `FileIntegrity` object's current status, run:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get fileintegrities/worker-fileintegrity  -o jsonpath="{ .status }"
----

Once the `FileIntegrity` object and the backing daemon set are created, the status
should switch to `Active`. If it does not, check the Operator pod logs.

== Determining that the daemon set's pods are running on the expected nodes

Issue::
You want to confirm that the daemon set exists and that its pods are running on
the nodes you expect them to run on.

Resolution::
Run:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -lapp=aide-ds-$(<FIO_NAME>)
----

* `FIO_NAME` is the name of the `FileIntegrity` object to get a list of the pods.
* Adding `-owide` adds the IP address of the node the pod is running on.

To check the logs of the daemon pods, run `oc logs`

Check the return value of the AIDE command to see if the check passed or failed.
