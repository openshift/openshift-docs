== OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.22

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.22:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:0142[RHBA-2022:0142 OpenShift File Integrity Operator Bug Fix]

[id="openshift-file-integrity-operator-0-1-22-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes
* Previously, a system with a File Integrity Operator installed might interrupt the {product-title} update, due to the  `/etc/kubernetes/aide.reinit` file.  This occurred if the `/etc/kubernetes/aide.reinit` file was present, but later removed prior to the `ostree` validation. With this update, `/etc/kubernetes/aide.reinit` is moved to the `/run` directory so that it does not conflict with the {product-title} update. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033311[*BZ#2033311*])

== OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.21

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.21:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:4631[RHBA-2021:4631 OpenShift File Integrity Operator Bug Fix and Enhancement Update]

[id="file-integrity-operator-0-1-21-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* The metrics related to `FileIntegrity` scan results and processing metrics are displayed on the monitoring dashboard on the web console. The results are labeled with the prefix of `file_integrity_operator_`.
+
* If a node has an integrity failure for more than 1 second, the default `PrometheusRule` provided in the operator namespace alerts with a warning.
+
* The following dynamic Machine Config Operator and Cluster Version Operator related filepaths are excluded from the default AIDE policy to help prevent false positives during node updates:
 - /etc/machine-config-daemon/currentconfig
 - /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/java/cacerts
 - /etc/cvo/updatepayloads
 - /root/.kube
+
* The AIDE daemon process has stability improvements over v0.1.16, and is more resilient to errors that might occur when the AIDE database is initialized.

* Previously, when the Operator automatically upgraded, outdated daemon sets were not removed. With this release, outdated daemon sets are removed during the automatic upgrade.
