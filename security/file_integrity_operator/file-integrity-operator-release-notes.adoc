=== Bug fixes

* Previously, some FIO pods with private default mount propagation in combination with `hostPath: path: /` volume mounts would break the CSI driver relying on multipath. This problem has been fixed and the CSI driver works correctly. (link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7017081[Some OpenShift Operator pods blocking unmounting of CSI volumes when multipath is in use])

* This update resolves CVE-2023-39325. (link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-39325[*CVE-2023-39325*])

== OpenShift File Integrity Operator 1.3.2

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift File Integrity Operator 1.3.2:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2023:5107[RHBA-2023:5107 OpenShift File Integrity Operator Bug Fix Update]

This update addresses a CVE in an underlying dependency.

== OpenShift File Integrity Operator 1.3.1

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift File Integrity Operator 1.3.1:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2023:3600[RHBA-2023:3600 OpenShift File Integrity Operator Bug Fix Update]

[id="file-integrity-operator-1-3-1-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* FIO now includes kubelet certificates as default files, excluding them from issuing warnings when they're managed by {product-title}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-14348[*OCPBUGS-14348*])

* FIO now correctly directs email to the address for Red Hat Technical Support. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5023[*OCPBUGS-5023*])

[id="file-integrity-operator-1-3-1-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, FIO would not clean up `FileIntegrityNodeStatus` CRDs when nodes are removed from the cluster. FIO has been updated to correctly clean up node status CRDs on node removal.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4321[*OCPBUGS-4321*])

* Previously, FIO would also erroneously indicate that new nodes failed integrity checks. FIO has been updated to correctly show node status CRDs when adding new nodes to the cluster. This provides correct node status notifications. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8502[*OCPBUGS-8502*])

* Previously, when FIO was reconciling `FileIntegrity` CRDs, it would pause scanning until the reconciliation was done. This caused an overly aggressive re-initiatization process on nodes not impacted by the reconciliation. This problem also resulted in unnecessary daemonsets for machine config pools which are unrelated to the `FileIntegrity` being changed. FIO correctly handles these cases and only pauses AIDE scanning for nodes that are affected by file integrity changes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CMP-1097[*CMP-1097*])

[id="file-integrity-operator-1-3-1-known-issues"]

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, alerts issued by the File Integrity Operator did not set a namespace, making it difficult to understand from which namespace the alert originated. Now, the Operator sets the appropriate namespace, providing more information about the alert. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2112394[*BZ#2112394*])

* Previously, The File Integrity Operator did not update the metrics service on Operator startup, causing the metrics targets to be unreachable. With this release, the File Integrity Operator now ensures the metrics service is updated on Operator startup. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2115821[*BZ#2115821*])

[id="file-integrity-operator-release-notes-0-1-24"]
== OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.24

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.24:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:1331[RHBA-2022:1331 OpenShift File Integrity Operator Bug Fix]

[id="file-integrity-operator-0-1-24-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* You can now configure the maximum number of backups stored in the `FileIntegrity` Custom Resource (CR) with the `config.maxBackups` attribute. This attribute specifies the number of AIDE database and log backups left over from the `re-init` process to keep on the node. Older backups beyond the configured number are automatically pruned. The default is set to five backups.

[id="openshift-file-integrity-operator-0-1-24-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, upgrading the Operator from versions older than 0.1.21 to 0.1.22 could cause the `re-init` feature to fail. This was a result of the Operator failing to update `configMap` resource labels. Now, upgrading to the latest version fixes the resource labels. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049206[*BZ#2049206*])

* Previously, when enforcing the default `configMap` script contents, the wrong data keys were compared. This resulted in the `aide-reinit` script not being updated properly after an Operator upgrade, and caused the `re-init` process to fail. Now,`daemonSets` run to completion and the AIDE database `re-init` process executes successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2072058[*BZ#2072058*])

[id="file-integrity-operator-release-notes-0-1-22"]
== OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.22

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.22:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:0142[RHBA-2022:0142 OpenShift File Integrity Operator Bug Fix]

[id="openshift-file-integrity-operator-0-1-22-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, a system with a File Integrity Operator installed might interrupt the {product-title} update, due to the  `/etc/kubernetes/aide.reinit` file. This occurred if the `/etc/kubernetes/aide.reinit` file was present, but later removed prior to the `ostree` validation. With this update, `/etc/kubernetes/aide.reinit` is moved to the `/run` directory so that it does not conflict with the {product-title} update. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033311[*BZ#2033311*])

[id="file-integrity-operator-release-notes-0-1-21"]
== OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.21

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.21:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:4631[RHBA-2021:4631 OpenShift File Integrity Operator Bug Fix and Enhancement Update]

[id="file-integrity-operator-0-1-21-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* The metrics related to `FileIntegrity` scan results and processing metrics are displayed on the monitoring dashboard on the web console. The results are labeled with the prefix of `file_integrity_operator_`.
+
* If a node has an integrity failure for more than 1 second, the default `PrometheusRule` provided in the operator namespace alerts with a warning.
+
* The following dynamic Machine Config Operator and Cluster Version Operator related filepaths are excluded from the default AIDE policy to help prevent false positives during node updates:
 - /etc/machine-config-daemon/currentconfig
 - /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/java/cacerts
 - /etc/cvo/updatepayloads
 - /root/.kube
+
* The AIDE daemon process has stability improvements over v0.1.16, and is more resilient to errors that might occur when the AIDE database is initialized.

[id="openshift-file-integrity-operator-0-1-21-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, when the Operator automatically upgraded, outdated daemon sets were not removed. With this release, outdated daemon sets are removed during the automatic upgrade.
