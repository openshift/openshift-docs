The File Integrity Operator for {product-title} continually runs file integrity checks on {op-system} nodes.

These release notes track the development of the File Integrity Operator in the {product-title}.

For an overview of the File Integrity Operator, see xref:../../security/file_integrity_operator/file-integrity-operator-understanding.adoc#understanding-file-integrity-operator[Understanding the File Integrity Operator].

== OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.30

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.30:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:5538[RHBA-2022:5538 OpenShift File Integrity Operator Bug Fix and Enhancement Update]

[id="file-integrity-operator-0-1-30-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* The File Integrity Operator is now supported on the following architectures:
+
** IBM Power
** IBM Z and LinuxONE

[id="file-integrity-operator-0-1-30-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, alerts issued by the File Integrity Operator did not set a namespace, making it difficult to understand where the alert originated. Now, the Operator sets the appropriate namespace, increasing understanding of the alert. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101393[*BZ#2101393*])

[id="file-integrity-operator-release-notes-0-1-24"]
== OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.24

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.24:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:1331[RHBA-2022:1331 OpenShift File Integrity Operator Bug Fix]

[id="file-integrity-operator-0-1-24-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* You can now configure the maximum number of backups stored in the `FileIntegrity` Custom Resource (CR) with the `config.maxBackups` attribute. This attribute specifies the number of AIDE database and log backups left over from the `re-init` process to keep on the node. Older backups beyond the configured number are automatically pruned. The default is set to five backups.

[id="openshift-file-integrity-operator-0-1-24-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, upgrading the Operator from versions older than 0.1.21 to 0.1.22 could cause the `re-init` feature to fail. This was a result of the Operator failing to update `configMap` resource labels. Now, upgrading to the latest version fixes the resource labels. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049206[*BZ#2049206*])

* Previously, when enforcing the default `configMap` script contents, the wrong data keys were compared. This resulted in the `aide-reinit` script not being updated properly after an Operator upgrade, and caused the `re-init` process to fail. Now,`daemonSets` run to completion and the AIDE database `re-init` process executes successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2072058[*BZ#2072058*])

[id="file-integrity-operator-release-notes-0-1-22"]
== OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.22

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.22:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:0142[RHBA-2022:0142 OpenShift File Integrity Operator Bug Fix]

[id="openshift-file-integrity-operator-0-1-22-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, a system with a File Integrity Operator installed might interrupt the {product-title} update, due to the  `/etc/kubernetes/aide.reinit` file.  This occurred if the `/etc/kubernetes/aide.reinit` file was present, but later removed prior to the `ostree` validation. With this update, `/etc/kubernetes/aide.reinit` is moved to the `/run` directory so that it does not conflict with the {product-title} update. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033311[*BZ#2033311*])

[id="file-integrity-operator-release-notes-0-1-21"]
== OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.21

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift File Integrity Operator 0.1.21:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:4631[RHBA-2021:4631 OpenShift File Integrity Operator Bug Fix and Enhancement Update]

[id="file-integrity-operator-0-1-21-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* The metrics related to `FileIntegrity` scan results and processing metrics are displayed on the monitoring dashboard on the web console. The results are labeled with the prefix of `file_integrity_operator_`.
+
* If a node has an integrity failure for more than 1 second, the default `PrometheusRule` provided in the operator namespace alerts with a warning.
+
* The following dynamic Machine Config Operator and Cluster Version Operator related filepaths are excluded from the default AIDE policy to help prevent false positives during node updates:
 - /etc/machine-config-daemon/currentconfig
 - /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/java/cacerts
 - /etc/cvo/updatepayloads
 - /root/.kube
+
* The AIDE daemon process has stability improvements over v0.1.16, and is more resilient to errors that might occur when the AIDE database is initialized.

[id="openshift-file-integrity-operator-0-1-21-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, when the Operator automatically upgraded, outdated daemon sets were not removed. With this release, outdated daemon sets are removed during the automatic upgrade.
