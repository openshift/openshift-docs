[id="file-integrity-operator-0-1-21-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* The metrics related to `FileIntegrity` scan results and processing metrics are displayed on the monitoring dashboard on the web console. The results are labeled with the prefix of `file_integrity_operator_`.
+
* If a node has an integrity failure for more than 1 second, the default `PrometheusRule` provided in the operator namespace alerts with a warning.
+
* The following dynamic Machine Config Operator and Cluster Version Operator related filepaths are excluded from the default AIDE policy to help prevent false positives during node updates:
 - /etc/machine-config-daemon/currentconfig
 - /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/java/cacerts
 - /etc/cvo/updatepayloads
 - /root/.kube
+
* The AIDE daemon process has stability improvements over v0.1.16, and is more resilient to errors that might occur when the AIDE database is initialized.
