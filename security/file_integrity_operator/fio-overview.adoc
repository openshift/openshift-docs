The File Integrity Operator continually runs file integrity checks on the cluster nodes. It deploys a DaemonSet that initializes and runs privileged link:https://aide.github.io/[Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment] (AIDE) containers on each node, providing a log of files that have been modified since the initial run of the DaemonSet pods.
