:context: rosa-configuring-the-log-forwarder

toc::[]

With {rosa-short} you can forward your control plane logs to your preferred logging tool, such as, `CloudWatch` or `S3`. When you link a log forwarder object to your {rosa-short} cluster, that log forwarder configures the log forwarding for control planes for that cluster. You can make this log forwarder a compliance requirement for storing audit logs. 

With {rosa-short}, you have the capability to customize and forward control plane logs in all your clusters without having any additional migration steps. 

.Prerequisite 

* You have installed and configured the latest {rosa-cli} on your installation host.
