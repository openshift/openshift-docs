== Purpose

Node certificates are signed by the cluster; they come from a certificate authority (CA) that is generated by the bootstrap process. After the cluster is installed, the node certificates are auto-rotated.

== Management

These certificates are managed by the system and not the user.

== Expiration

These certificates are managed by the system and not the user.

== Services



== Customization

These certificates are managed by the system and not the user.

== Renewal

The node controller automatically rotates the certificates that it issues. However, it is possible to use `oc delete secret <secret>` to manually rotate service serving certificates.
