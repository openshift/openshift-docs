== Purpose

`service-ca` is an Operator that creates a self-signed CA when an {product-title} cluster is deployed.

== Expiration

A custom expiration term is not supported. The self-signed CA is stored in a secret with qualified name `service-ca/signing-key` in fields `tls.crt` (certificate(s)), `tls.key` (private key), and `ca-bundle.crt` (CA bundle).

Other services can request a service serving certificate by annotating a service resource with `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: <secret name>`. In response, the Operator generates a new certificate, as `tls.crt`, and private key, as `tls.key` to the named secret. The certificate is valid for two years.

Other services can request that the CA bundle for the service CA be injected into API service or config map resources by annotating with `service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle: true` to support validating certificates generated from the service CA. In response, the Operator writes its current CA bundle to the `CABundle` field of an API service or as `service-ca.crt` to a config map.

As of {product-title} 4.3.5, automated rotation is supported and is backported to some 4.2.z and 4.3.z releases. For any release supporting automated rotation, the service CA is valid for 26 months and is automatically refreshed when there is less than 13 months validity left. If necessary, you can manually refresh the service CA.

The service CA expiration of 26 months is longer than the expected upgrade interval for a supported {product-title} cluster, such that non-control plane consumers of service CA certificates will be refreshed after CA rotation and prior to the expiration of the pre-rotation CA.

[WARNING]
====
A manually-rotated service CA does not maintain trust with the previous service CA. You might experience a temporary service disruption until the pods in the cluster are restarted, which ensures that pods are using service serving certificates issued by the new service CA.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Applications using the `service-ca` certificate must be capable of dynamically reloading CA certificates. Otherwise, when automated rotation occurs, the application pods might require a restart in order to rebuild certificate trust.
====

== Management

These certificates are managed by the system and not the user.
