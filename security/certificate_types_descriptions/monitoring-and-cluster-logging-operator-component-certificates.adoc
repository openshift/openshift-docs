== Expiration

Monitoring components secure their traffic with service CA certificates. These certificates are valid for 2 years and are replaced automatically on rotation of the service CA, which is every 13 months.

If the certificate lives in the `openshift-monitoring` or `openshift-logging` namespace, it is system managed and rotated automatically.

== Management

These certificates are managed by the system and not the user.
