[[security-platform-container-orchestration]]
== Container Orchestration

APIs are key to automating container management at scale. APIs are used to:

- Validate and configure the data for pods, services, and replication controllers.
- Perform project validation on incoming requests and invoke triggers on other
major system components.

[[security-platform-auth]]
== Authentication and Authorization

[[security-platform-auth-controlling-access]]
=== Controlling Access Using OAuth

You can use API access control via authentication and authorization for securing
your container platform. The {product-title} master includes a built-in OAuth
server. Users can obtain OAuth access tokens to authenticate themselves to the
API.

As an administrator, you can configure OAuth to authenticate using an _identity
provider_, such as LDAP, GitHub, or Google. The
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[Deny All]
ifdef::openshift-origin[Allow All]
identity provider is used by default for new {product-title} deployments, but
you can configure this at initial installation time or post-installation. See
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[Configuring authentication and user agent] for a full list of identity providers.

For example, to configure the GitHub identity provider post-installation:

. Edit the master configuration file at *_/etc/origin/master-config.yaml_*.

. Modify the `oauthConfig` stanza per the following:
+
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: github
    challenge: false
    login: true
    mappingMethod: claim
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: GitHubIdentityProvider
      clientID: ...
      clientSecret: ...
      organizations:
      - myorganization1
      - myorganization2
      teams:
      - myorganization1/team-a
      - myorganization2/team-b

[NOTE]
====
See the xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#GitHub[GitHub]
section in Configuring Authentication for more detailed information and usage.

. After saving your changes, restart the master services for the changes to take
effect:

# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers

[[security-platform-api-access-control]]
=== API Access Control and Management

Applications can have multiple, independent API services which have different
endpoints that require management. {product-title} includes a containerized
version of the 3scale API gateway so that you can manage your APIs and control
access.

3scale gives you a variety of standard options for API authentication and
security, which can be used alone or in combination to issue credentials and
control access: Standard API keys, Application ID and key pair, and OAuth 2.0.

You can restrict access to specific end points, methods, and services and apply
access policy for groups of users. Application plans allow you to set rate
limits for API usage and control traffic flow for groups of developers.

For a tutorial on using APIcast v2, the containerized 3scale API Gateway, see
link:https://support.3scale.net/docs/deployment-options/apicast-openshift[Running APIcast on Red Hat OpenShift].

[[security-platform-red-hat-sso]]
=== Red Hat SSO

The Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) Server enables you to secure your
applications by providing Web SSO capabilities based on standards, including
SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, and OAuth 2.0. The Server can act as a SAML or OpenID
Connect–based identity provider (IdP), mediating with your enterprise user
directory or third-party identity provider for identity information and your
applications using standards-based tokens. You can integrate Red Hat SSO with
LDAP-based directory services including Microsoft Active Directory and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux Identity Management.

See
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_middleware_for_openshift/3/html/red_hat_jboss_sso_for_openshift/tutorials[Red Hat JBoss SSO for OpenShift] documentation for usage tutorials.

[[security-platform-auth-secure-self-service-web-console]]
=== Secure Self-service Web Console

{product-title} provides a self-service web console to ensure that teams do not
access other environments without authorization. {product-title} ensures a
secure multi-tenant master by providing the following:

- Access to the master uses Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- Access to the API Server uses X.509 certificates or OAuth access tokens
- Project quota limits the damage that a rogue token could do
- Etcd is not exposed directly to the cluster

[[security-platform-cert-mgmt]]
== Managing Certificates for the Platform

{product-title} has multiple components within its framework that use REST-based
HTTPS communication leveraging encryption via TLS certificates.
{product-title}'s Ansible-based installer configures these certificates during
installation. There are some primary components that generate this traffic:

- masters (API server and controllers)
- etcd
- nodes
- registry
- router

[[security-platform-config-custom-certs]]
=== Configuring Custom Certificates

You can configure custom serving certificates for the public host names of the
API server and web console during initial installation or when redeploying
certificates. You can also use a custom CA.

During initial advanced installations using Ansible playbooks, custom
certificates can be configured using the
`openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates` Ansible variable, which is
configurable in the inventory file. For example:

----
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/path/on/host/to/custom1.crt", "keyfile": "/path/on/host/to/custom1.key", "cafile": "/path/on/host/to/custom-ca1.crt"}]
----

See the Advanced Installation's
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-custom-certificates[Configuring Custom Certificates] for more options and instructions on how to run the
installation playbook.

The installer provides Ansible playbooks for checking on the expiration dates of
all cluster certificates. Additional playbooks can automatically redeploy all
certificates at once using the current CA, redeploy specific certificates only,
or redeploy a newly generated or custom CA on its own. See
xref:../install_config/redeploying_certificates.adoc#install-config-redeploying-certificates[Redeploying Certificates] for more on these playbooks.
