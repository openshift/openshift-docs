Container registries store container images to:

* Make images accessible to others
* Organize images into repositories that can include multiple versions of an image
* Optionally limit access to images, based on different authentication methods, or
make them publicly available

There are public container registries, such as Quay.io and Docker Hub
where many people and organizations share their images.
The Red Hat Registry offers supported Red Hat and partner images,
while the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog offers detailed descriptions
and health checks for those images.
To manage your own registry, you could purchase a container
registry such as

From a security standpoint, some registries provide special features to
check and improve the health of your containers.
For example, Red Hat Quay offers container vulnerability scanning
with Clair security scanner, build triggers to automatically rebuild
images when source code changes in GitHub and other locations, and
the ability to use role-based access control (RBAC) to
secure access to images.
