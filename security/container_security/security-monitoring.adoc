The ability to monitor and audit an {product-title} cluster is an
important part of safeguarding the cluster and its users against
inappropriate usage.

There are two main sources of cluster-level information that
are useful for this purpose: events and logging.

// Cluster events

// Logging
include::modules/security-monitoring-cluster-logging.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// Audit logging
include::modules/security-monitoring-audit-logging.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
