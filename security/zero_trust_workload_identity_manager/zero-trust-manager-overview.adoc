:FeatureName: Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The {zero-trust-full} leverages {spiffe-full} and the SPIFFE Runtime Environment (SPIRE) to provide a comprehensive identity management solution for distributed systems. SPIFFE and SPIRE provide a standardized approach to workload identity, allowing workloads to communicate with other services whether on the same cluster, or in another environment.

{zero-trust-full} replaces long-lived, manually managed secrets with cryptographically verifiable identities. It provides strong authentication ensuring workloads that are communicating with each other are who they claim to be. SPIRE automates the issuing, rotating, and revoking of a {svid-full}, reducing the workload of developers and administrators managing secrets.

SPIFFE can work across diverse infrastructures including on-premise, cloud, and hybrid environments. SPIFFE identities are cryptographically enabled providing a basis for auditing and compliance.

The following are components of the {zero-trust-full} architecture:
