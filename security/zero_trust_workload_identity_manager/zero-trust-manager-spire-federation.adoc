= Deploying SPIRE federation on two clusters with the https_spiffe profile

[role="_abstract"]
Configure SPIRE federation to enable workloads in different trust domains to securely authenticate each other across clusters, cloud providers, and organizational boundaries. By establishing trust relationships between separate SPIRE deployments, you can build a zero-trust architecture that spans multiple environments without compromising security or sharing secrets.

The `https_spiffe`` profile uses SPIRE-generated self-signed certificates for federation. Because of this, secure inter-cluster communication is contingent upon a manual trust bootstrap process to distribute trust bundles.
