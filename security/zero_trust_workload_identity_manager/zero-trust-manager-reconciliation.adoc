toc::[]

By enabling the `create-only` mode, you can pause the Operator reconciliation, which allows you to perform manual configurations or debug without the controller overwriting your changes. This is done by annotating the API resources which are managed by the Operator. The following scenarios are examples of when the `create-only` mode might be of use:

**Manual Customization Required**: You need to customize operator-managed resources (ConfigMaps, Deployments, DaemonSets, etc.) with specific configurations that differ from the operator's defaults

**Day 2 Operations**: After initial deployment, you want to prevent the operator from overwriting their manual changes during subsequent reconciliation cycles

**Configuration Drift Prevention**: You want to maintain control over certain resource configurations while still benefiting from the operator's lifecycle management
