Install {zero-trust-full} to help ensure secure communication between your workloads. You can install the {zero-trust-full} by using either the web console or CLI.

If you install the Operator into a custom namespace (for example, `my-custom-namespace`), all managed operand resources are deployed within that same namespace. All secrets and ConfigMaps referenced by the Custom Resources (CRs) must also exist in that custom namespace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Operator installation is not supported in the `openshift-*` namespaces and the `default` namespace.
