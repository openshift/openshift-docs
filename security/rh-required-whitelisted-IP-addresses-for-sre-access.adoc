== Overview

For Red Hat SREs to troubleshoot any issues within {product-title} clusters, they must have ingress access to the API server through allowlist IP addresses.

[id="required-whitelisted-access_{context}"]
== Obtaining  allowlisted IP addresses
{product-title} users can use an {cluster-manager} CLI command to obtain the most up-to-date allowlist IP addresses for the Red Hat machines that are necessary for SRE access to {product-title} clusters.

[NOTE]
====
These allowlist IP addresses are not permanent and are subject to change. You must continuously review the API output for the most current allowlist IP addresses.
====
.Prerequisites
*  You installed the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads[OpenShift Cluster Manager API command-line interface (`ocm`)].
* You are able to configure your firewall to include the allowlist IP addresses.

.Procedure
. To get the current allowlist IP addresses needed for SRE access to your {product-title} cluster, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ocm get /api/clusters_mgmt/v1/trusted_ip_addresses|jq -r '.items[].id'
----
. Configure your firewall to grant access to the allowlist IP addresses.
