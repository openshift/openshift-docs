Cluster administrators can choose which cipher suites to use for the control plane. This provides a convenient way to ensure that {product-title} control plane components use cryptographic libraries that do not allow known insecure protocols, ciphers, or algorithms.

// Questions:
//  - is there a default if not configured, and if so, what is it?
//  - is only intermediate and old supported right now?

// TODO: Consider calling out the components?

At time of writing, the latest version of OpenShift 4 (4.7) supports TLS 1.3 and the API server (port 6443) is configured to use the “Intermediate” TLS security profile, which includes a reduced cipher suites from both TLS 1.3 and 1.2, without any known vulnerabilities. No further configuration of the API server should be necessary, however one can do so by using the configuration described here:

from oc explain apiserver.spec.tlsSecurityProfile

tlsSecurityProfile	<Object>
  tlsSecurityProfile specifies settings for TLS connections for externally
  exposed servers. If unset, a default (which may change between releases) is
  chosen. Note that only Old and Intermediate profiles are currently
  supported, and the maximum available MinTLSVersions is VersionTLS12.

^^ TODO: Ask: This says that only Old and Intermediate profiles are currently supported?!? Is this true?

//As a OCP admin i want my OCP platform  to enable TLS secure communication between components in OCP so that my platform  is secure

// To support cluster wide cryptographic policy include TLS profile  parameter in kubelet

// Customer info: My customer is requesting to see if any vulnerable TLS ciphers can be disabled by default in order to prevent having their security scans identify security issues with OCP.
