Before you can use the Compliance Operator, you must ensure it is deployed in the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Compliance Operator might report incorrect results on managed platforms, such as OpenShift Dedicated, Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Service on AWS Classic, and Microsoft Azure Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift. For more information, see the Knowledgebase article link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6983418[Compliance Operator reports incorrect results on Managed Services].
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before deploying the Compliance Operator, you are required to define persistent storage in your cluster to store the raw results output. For more information, see xref:../../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#persistent-storage-overview_understanding-persistent-storage[Persistant storage overview] and xref:../../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-sc-manage.adoc#overview[Managing the default storage class].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the `restricted` Security Context Constraints (SCC) have been modified to contain the `system:authenticated` group or has added `requiredDropCapabilities`, the Compliance Operator may not function properly due to permissions issues.

You can create a custom SCC for the Compliance Operator scanner pod service account. For more information, see xref:../../../security/compliance_operator/co-scans/compliance-operator-advanced.adoc#compliance-custom-scc_compliance-advanced[Creating a custom SCC for the Compliance Operator].
