Each `ComplianceCheckResult` represents a result of one compliance rule check. If the rule can be remediated automatically, a `ComplianceRemediation` object with the same name, owned by the `ComplianceCheckResult` is created. Unless requested, the remediations are not applied automatically, which gives an {product-title} administrator the opportunity to review what the remediation does and only apply a remediation once it has been verified.
