== OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.59

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.59:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:8538[RHBA-2022:8538 - OpenShift Compliance Operator bug fix update]

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-59-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* The Compliance Operator now supports Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) `ocp4-pci-dss` and `ocp4-pci-dss-node` profiles on the `ppc64le` architecture.

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-59-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the Compliance Operator did not support the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) `ocp4-pci-dss` and `ocp4-pci-dss-node` profiles on different architectures such as `ppc64le`. Now, the Compliance Operator supports `ocp4-pci-dss` and `ocp4-pci-dss-node` profiles on the `ppc64le` architecture. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3252[*OCPBUGS-3252*])

* Previously, after the recent update to version 0.1.57, the `rerunner` service account (SA) was no longer owned by the cluster service version (CSV), which caused the SA to be removed during the Operator upgrade. Now, the CSV owns the `rerunner` SA in 0.1.59, and upgrades from any previous version will not result in a missing SA. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3452[*OCPBUGS-3452*])

* In 0.1.57, the Operator started the controller metrics endpoint listening on port `8080`. This resulted in `TargetDown` alerts since cluster monitoring expected port is `8383`. With 0.1.59, the Operator starts the endpoint listening on port `8383` as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3097[*OCPBUGS-3097*])

[id="compliance-operator-release-notes-0-1-57"]
== OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.57

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.57:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:6657[RHBA-2022:6657 - OpenShift Compliance Operator bug fix update]

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-57-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* `KubeletConfig` checks changed from `Node` to `Platform` type. `KubeletConfig` checks the default configuration of the `KubeletConfig`. The configuration files are aggregated from all nodes into a single location per node pool. See xref:../../security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-remediation.adoc#compliance-evaluate-kubeletconfig-rules_compliance-remediation[Evaluating `KubeletConfig` rules against default configuration values].

* The `ScanSetting` Custom Resource now allows users to override the default CPU and memory limits of scanner pods through the `scanLimits` attribute.  For more information, see xref:../../security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-troubleshooting.adoc#compliance-increasing-operator-limits_compliance-troubleshooting[Increasing Compliance Operator resource limits].

* A `PriorityClass` object can now be set through `ScanSetting`. This ensures the Compliance Operator is prioritized and minimizes the chance that the cluster falls out of compliance. For more information, see xref:../../security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-advanced.adoc#compliance-priorityclass_compliance-advanced[Setting `PriorityClass` for `ScanSetting` scans].

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-57-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the Compliance Operator hard-coded notifications to the default `openshift-compliance` namespace. If the Operator were installed in a non-default namespace, the notifications would not work as expected. Now, notifications work in non-default `openshift-compliance` namespaces. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060726[*BZ#2060726*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator was unable to evaluate default configurations used by kubelet objects, resulting in inaccurate results and false positives. xref:../../security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-remediation.adoc#compliance-evaluate-kubeletconfig-rules_compliance-remediation[This new feature] evaluates the kubelet configuration and now reports accurately. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2075041[*BZ#2075041*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator reported the `ocp4-kubelet-configure-event-creation` rule in a `FAIL` state after applying an automatic remediation because the `eventRecordQPS` value was set higher than the default value. Now, the `ocp4-kubelet-configure-event-creation` rule remediation sets the default value, and the rule applies correctly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082416[*BZ#2082416*])

* The `ocp4-configure-network-policies` rule requires manual intervention to perform effectively. New descriptive instructions and rule updates increase applicability of the `ocp4-configure-network-policies` rule for clusters using Calico CNIs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2091794[*BZ#2091794*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator would not clean up pods used to scan infrastructure when using the `debug=true` option in the scan settings. This caused pods to be left on the cluster even after deleting the `ScanSettingBinding`. Now, pods are always deleted when a `ScanSettingBinding` is deleted.(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2092913[*BZ#2092913*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator used an older version of the `operator-sdk` command that caused alerts about deprecated functionality. Now, an updated version of the `operator-sdk` command is included and there are no more alerts for deprecated functionality. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098581[*BZ#2098581*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator would fail to apply remediations if it could not determine the relationship between kubelet and machine configurations. Now, the Compliance Operator has improved handling of the machine configurations and is able to determine if a kubelet configuration is a subset of a machine configuration. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102511[*BZ#2102511*])

* Previously, the rule for `ocp4-cis-node-master-kubelet-enable-cert-rotation` did not properly describe success criteria. As a result, the requirements for `RotateKubeletClientCertificate` were unclear. Now, the rule for `ocp4-cis-node-master-kubelet-enable-cert-rotation` reports accurately regardless of the configuration present in the kubelet configuration file. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105153[*BZ#2105153*])

* Previously, the rule for checking idle streaming timeouts did not consider default values, resulting in inaccurate rule reporting. Now, more robust checks ensure increased accuracy in results based on default configuration values. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105878[*BZ#2105878*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator would fail to fetch API resources when parsing machine configurations without Ignition specifications, which caused the `api-check-pods` processes to crash loop. Now, the Compliance Operator handles Machine Config Pools that do not have Ignition specifications correctly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117268[*BZ#2117268*])

* Previously, rules evaluating the `modprobe` configuration would fail even after applying remediations due to a mismatch in values for the `modprobe` configuration. Now, the same values are used for the `modprobe` configuration in checks and remediations, ensuring consistent results. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117747[*BZ#2117747*])

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-57-deprecations"]
=== Deprecations

* Specifying *Install into all namespaces in the cluster* or setting the `WATCH_NAMESPACES` environment variable to `""` no longer affects all namespaces. Any API resources installed in namespaces not specified at the time of Compliance Operator installation is no longer be operational. API resources might require creation in the selected namespace, or the `openshift-compliance` namespace by default. This change improves the Compliance Operator's memory usage.

[id="compliance-operator-release-notes-0-1-53"]
== OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.53

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.53:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:5537[RHBA-2022:5537 - OpenShift Compliance Operator bug fix update]

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-53-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `ocp4-kubelet-enable-streaming-connections` rule contained an incorrect variable comparison, resulting in false positive scan results. Now, the Compliance Operator provides accurate scan results when setting `streamingConnectionIdleTimeout`.  (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2069891[*BZ#2069891*])

* Previously, group ownership for `/etc/openvswitch/conf.db` was incorrect on IBM Z architectures, resulting in `ocp4-cis-node-worker-file-groupowner-ovs-conf-db` check failures. Now, the check is marked `NOT-APPLICABLE` on IBM Z architecture systems. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2072597[*BZ#2072597*])

* Previously, the `ocp4-cis-scc-limit-container-allowed-capabilities` rule reported in a `FAIL` state due to incomplete data regarding the security context constraints (SCC) rules in the deployment. Now, the result is `MANUAL`, which is consistent with other checks that require human intervention. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2077916[*BZ#2077916*])

* Previously, the following rules failed to account for additional configuration paths for API servers and TLS certificates and keys, resulting in reported failures even if the certificates and keys were set properly:
+
--
** `ocp4-cis-api-server-kubelet-client-cert`
** `ocp4-cis-api-server-kubelet-client-key`
** `ocp4-cis-kubelet-configure-tls-cert`
** `ocp4-cis-kubelet-configure-tls-key`
--
+
Now, the rules report accurately and observe legacy file paths specified in the kubelet configuration file. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2079813[*BZ#2079813*])

* Previously, the `content_rule_oauth_or_oauthclient_inactivity_timeout` rule did not account for a configurable timeout set by the deployment when assessing compliance for timeouts. This resulted in the rule failing even if the timeout was valid. Now, the Compliance Operator uses the `var_oauth_inactivity_timeout` variable to set valid timeout length. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2081952[*BZ#2081952*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator used administrative permissions on namespaces not labeled appropriately for privileged use, resulting in warning messages regarding pod security-level violations. Now, the Compliance Operator has appropriate namespace labels and permission adjustments to access results without violating permissions. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2088202[*BZ#2088202*])

* Previously, applying auto remediations for `rhcos4-high-master-sysctl-kernel-yama-ptrace-scope` and `rhcos4-sysctl-kernel-core-pattern` resulted in subsequent failures of those rules in scan results, even though they were remediated. Now, the rules report `PASS` accurately, even after remediations are applied.(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2094382[*BZ#2094382*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator would fail in a `CrashLoopBackoff` state because of out-of-memory exceptions. Now, the Compliance Operator is improved to handle large machine configuration data sets in memory and function correctly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2094854[*BZ#2094854*])

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-53-known-issue"]
=== Known issue

* When `"debug":true` is set within the `ScanSettingBinding` object, the pods generated by the `ScanSettingBinding` object are not removed when that binding is deleted. As a workaround, run the following command to delete the remaining pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pods -l compliance.openshift.io/scan-name=ocp4-cis

== OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.52

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.52:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:4657[RHBA-2022:4657 - OpenShift Compliance Operator bug fix update]

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-52-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* The FedRAMP high SCAP profile is now available for use in {product-title} environments. For more information, See xref:../compliance_operator/compliance-operator-supported-profiles.adoc#compliance-operator-supported-profiles[Supported compliance profiles].

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-52-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `OpenScap` container would crash due to a mount permission issue in a security environment where `DAC_OVERRIDE` capability is dropped. Now, executable mount permissions are applied to all users. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082151[*BZ#2082151*])

* Previously, the compliance rule `ocp4-configure-network-policies` could be configured as `MANUAL`. Now, compliance rule `ocp4-configure-network-policies` is set to `AUTOMATIC`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2072431[*BZ#2072431*])

* Previously, the Cluster Autoscaler would fail to scale down because the Compliance Operator scan pods were never removed after a scan. Now, the pods are removed from each node by default unless explicitly saved for debugging purposes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2075029[*BZ#2075029*])

* Previously, applying the Compliance Operator to the `KubeletConfig` would result in the node going into a `NotReady` state due to unpausing the Machine Config Pools too early. Now, the Machine Config Pools are unpaused appropriately and the node operates correctly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2071854[*BZ#2071854*])

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator used `base64` instead of `url-encoded` code in the latest release, causing Compliance Operator remediation to fail. Now, the Compliance Operator checks encoding to handle both `base64` and `url-encoded` Machine Config code and the remediation applies correctly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082431[*BZ#2082431*])

[id="compliance-operator-release-notes-0-1-49"]
== OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.49

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.49:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:1148[RHBA-2022:1148 - OpenShift Compliance Operator bug fix and enhancement update]

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-49-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* The Compliance Operator is now supported on the following architectures:
+
** IBM Power
** IBM Z
** IBM LinuxONE

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-49-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `openshift-compliance` content did not include platform-specific checks for network types. As a result, OVN- and SDN-specific checks would show as `failed` instead of `not-applicable` based on the network configuration. Now, new rules contain platform checks for networking rules, resulting in a more accurate assessment of network-specific checks. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1994609[*BZ#1994609*])

* Previously, the `ocp4-moderate-routes-protected-by-tls` rule incorrectly checked TLS settings that results in the rule failing the check, even if the connection secure SSL TLS protocol. Now, the check properly evaluates TLS settings that are consistent with the networking guidance and profile recommendations. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002695[*BZ#2002695*])

* Previously, `ocp-cis-configure-network-policies-namespace` used pagination when requesting namespaces. This caused the rule to fail because the deployments truncated lists of more than 500 namespaces. Now, the entire namespace list is requested, and the rule for checking configured network policies works for deployments with more than 500 namespaces. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2038909[*BZ#2038909*])

* Previously, remediations using the `sshd jinja` macros were hard-coded to specific sshd configurations. As a result, the configurations were inconsistent with the content the rules were checking for and the check would fail. Now, the sshd configuration is parameterized and the rules apply successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049141[*BZ#2049141*])

* Previously, the `ocp4-cluster-version-operator-verify-integrity` always checked the first entry in the Cluter Version Operator (CVO) history. As a result, the upgrade would fail in situations where subsequent versions of {product-name} would be verified. Now, the compliance check result for `ocp4-cluster-version-operator-verify-integrity` is able to detect verified versions and is accurate with the CVO history. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2053602[*BZ#2053602*])

* Previously, the `ocp4-api-server-no-adm-ctrl-plugins-disabled` rule did not check for a list of empty admission controller plugins. As a result, the rule would always fail, even if all admission plugins were enabled. Now, more robust checking of the `ocp4-api-server-no-adm-ctrl-plugins-disabled` rule accurately passes with all admission controller plugins enabled. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2058631[*BZ#2058631*])

* Previously, scans did not contain platform checks for running against Linux worker nodes. As a result, running scans against worker nodes that were not Linux-based resulted in a never ending scan loop. Now, the scan schedules appropriately based on platform type and labels complete successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2056911[*BZ#2056911*])

[id="compliance-operator-release-notes-0-1-48"]
== OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.48

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.48:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:0416[RHBA-2022:0416 - OpenShift Compliance Operator bug fix and enhancement update]

[id="openshift-compliance-operator-0-1-48-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, some rules associated with extended Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) definitions had a `checkType` of `None`. This was because the Compliance Operator was not processing extended OVAL definitions when parsing rules. With this update, content from extended OVAL definitions is parsed so that these rules now have a `checkType` of either `Node` or `Platform`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040282[*BZ#2040282*])

* Previously, a manually created `MachineConfig` object for `KubeletConfig` prevented a `KubeletConfig` object from being generated for remediation, leaving the remediation in the `Pending` state.  With this release, a `KubeletConfig`  object is created by the remediation, regardless if there is a manually created `MachineConfig` object for `KubeletConfig`. As a result, `KubeletConfig` remediations now work as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040401[*BZ#2040401*])

[id="compliance-operator-release-notes-0-1-47"]
== OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.47

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.47:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:0014[RHBA-2022:0014 - OpenShift Compliance Operator bug fix and enhancement update]

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-47-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* The Compliance Operator now supports the following compliance benchmarks for the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS):
+
** ocp4-pci-dss
** ocp4-pci-dss-node

* Additional rules and remediations for FedRAMP moderate impact level are added to the OCP4-moderate, OCP4-moderate-node, and rhcos4-moderate profiles.

* Remediations for KubeletConfig are now available in node-level profiles.

[id="openshift-compliance-operator-0-1-47-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, if your cluster was running {product-title} 4.6 or earlier, remediations for USBGuard-related rules would fail for the moderate profile. This is because the remediations created by the Compliance Operator were based on an older version of USBGuard that did not support drop-in directories. Now, invalid remediations for USBGuard-related rules are not created for clusters running {product-title} 4.6. If your cluster is using {product-title} 4.6, you must manually create remediations for USBGuard-related rules.
+
Additionally, remediations are created only for rules that satisfy minimum version requirements. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1965511[*BZ#1965511*])

* Previously, when rendering remediations, the compliance operator would check that the remediation was well-formed by using a regular expression that was too strict. As a result, some remediations, such as those that render `sshd_config`, would not pass the regular expression check and therefore, were not created. The regular expression was found to be unnecessary and removed. Remediations now render correctly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033009[*BZ#2033009*])

[id="compliance-operator-release-notes-0-1-44"]
== OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.44

The following advisory is available for the OpenShift Compliance Operator 0.1.44:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:4530[RHBA-2021:4530 - OpenShift Compliance Operator bug fix and enhancement update]

[id="compliance-operator-0-1-44-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* In this release, the `strictNodeScan` option is now added to the `ComplianceScan`, `ComplianceSuite` and `ScanSetting` CRs. This option defaults to `true` which matches the previous behavior, where an error occurred if a scan was not able to be scheduled on a node. Setting the option to `false` allows the Compliance Operator to be more permissive about scheduling scans. Environments with ephemeral nodes can set the `strictNodeScan` value to false, which allows a compliance scan to proceed, even if some of the nodes in the cluster are not available for scheduling.
+
* You can now customize the node that is used to schedule the result server workload by configuring the `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` attributes of the `ScanSetting` object. These attributes are used to place the `ResultServer` pod, the pod that is used to mount a PV storage volume and store the raw Asset Reporting Format (ARF) results. Previously, the `nodeSelector` and the `tolerations` parameters defaulted to selecting one of the control plane nodes and tolerating the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master taint`. This did not work in environments where control plane nodes are not permitted to mount PVs. This feature provides a way for you to select the node and tolerate a different taint in those environments.
+
* The Compliance Operator can now remediate `KubeletConfig` objects.
+
* A comment containing an error message is now added to help content developers differentiate between objects that do not exist in the cluster versus objects that cannot be fetched.
+
* Rule objects now contain two new attributes, `checkType` and `description`. These attributes allow you to determine if the rule pertains to a node check or platform check, and also allow you to review what the rule does.
+
* This enhancement removes the requirement that you have to extend an existing profile in order to create a tailored profile. This means the `extends` field in the `TailoredProfile` CRD is no longer mandatory. You can now select a list of rule objects to create a tailored profile.  Note that you must select whether your profile applies to nodes or the platform by setting the `compliance.openshift.io/product-type:` annotation or by setting the `-node` suffix for the `TailoredProfile` CR.
+
* In this release, the Compliance Operator is now able to schedule scans on all nodes irrespective of their taints. Previously, the scan pods would only tolerated the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master taint`, meaning that they would either ran on nodes with no taints or only on nodes with the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` taint. In deployments that use custom taints for their nodes, this resulted in the scans not being scheduled on those nodes. Now, the scan pods tolerate all node taints.
+
* In this release, the Compliance Operator supports the following North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) security profiles:
+
** ocp4-nerc-cip
** ocp4-nerc-cip-node
** rhcos4-nerc-cip
+
* In this release, the Compliance Operator supports the NIST 800-53 Moderate-Impact Baseline for the Red Hat OpenShift - Node level, ocp4-moderate-node, security profile.

[id="openshift-compliance-operator-0-1-44-templating"]
=== Templating and variable use

* In this release, the remediation template now allows multi-value variables.
+
* With this update, the Compliance Operator can change remediations based on variables that are set in the compliance profile. This is useful for remediations that include deployment-specific values such as time outs, NTP server host names, or similar. Additionally, the `ComplianceCheckResult` objects now use the label `compliance.openshift.io/check-has-value` that lists the variables a check has used.

[id="openshift-compliance-operator-0-1-44-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, while performing a scan, an unexpected termination occurred in one of the scanner containers of the pods. In this release, the Compliance Operator uses the latest OpenSCAP version 1.3.5 to avoid a crash.
+
* Previously, using `autoReplyRemediations` to apply remediations triggered an update of the cluster nodes. This was disruptive if some of the remediations did not include all of the required input variables. Now, if a remediation is missing one or more required input variables, it is  assigned a state of `NeedsReview`.  If one or more remediations are in a `NeedsReview` state, the machine config pool remains paused, and the remediations are not applied until all of the required variables are set. This helps minimize disruption to the nodes.
+
* The RBAC Role and Role Binding used for Prometheus metrics are changed to 'ClusterRole' and 'ClusterRoleBinding' to ensure that monitoring works without customization.
+
* Previously, if an error occurred while parsing a profile, rules or variables objects were removed and deleted from the profile. Now, if an error occurs during parsing, the `profileparser` annotates the object with a temporary annotation that prevents the object from being deleted until after parsing completes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1988259[*BZ#1988259*])
+
* Previously, an error occurred if titles or descriptions were missing from a tailored profile. Because the XCCDF standard requires titles and descriptions for tailored profiles, titles and descriptions are now required to be set in `TailoredProfile` CRs.
+
* Previously, when using tailored profiles, `TailoredProfile` variable values were allowed to be set using only a specific selection set. This restriction is now removed, and `TailoredProfile` variables can be set to any value.
