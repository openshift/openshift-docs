This section describes how to troubleshoot the Compliance Operator. The information can be useful either to diagnose a problem or provide information in a bug report. Some general tips:

* The Compliance Operator emits Kubernetes events when something important happens. You can either view all events in the cluster using the command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 $ oc get events -nopenshift-compliance
----
+
Or view events for an object like a scan using the command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe compliancescan/$scan_name
----

* The Compliance Operator consists of several controllers, approximately one per API object. It could be useful to filter only those controllers that correspond to the API object having issues. If a `ComplianceRemediation` can't be applied, view the messages from the `remediationctrl` controller. You can filter the messages from a single controller by parsing with `jq`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs compliance-operator-775d7bddbd-gj58f | jq -c 'select(.logger == "profilebundlectrl")'
----

* The timestamps are logged as seconds since UNIX epoch in UTC. To convert them to a human-readable date, use `date -d @timestamp --utc`, For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ date -d @1596184628.955853 --utc
----

* Many CustomResources, most importantly `ComplianceSuite` and `ScanSetting`, allow the `debug` option to be set. Enabling this option increases verbosity of the OpenSCAP scanner pods, as well as some other helper pods.

* If a single rule is passing or failing unexpectedly, it could be helpful to run a single scan or a suite with only that rule to find the rule ID from the corresponding `ComplianceCheckResult` object and use it as the `rule` attribute value in a Scan CR. Then, together with the `debug` option enabled, the `scanner` container logs in the scanner pod would show the raw OpenSCAP logs.
