While the Compliance Operator comes with ready-to-use profiles, they must be modified in order to fit the organizationsâ€™ needs and requirements. The process of modifying a profile is called _tailoring_.

The Compliance Operator provides an object to easily tailor profiles called a `TailoredProfile`. This assumes that you are extending a pre-existing profile, and allows you to enable and disable rules and values which come from the ProfileBundle.

[NOTE]
====
You will only be able to use rules and variables that are available as part of the ProfileBundle that the Profile you want to extend belongs to.
