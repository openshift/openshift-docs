Although the xref:../../../security/compliance_operator/co-concepts/compliance-operator-understanding.adoc#understanding-compliance-operator[Compliance Operator] automates many of the checks and remediations for the cluster, the full process of bringing a cluster into compliance often requires administrator interaction with the Compliance Operator API and other components.
