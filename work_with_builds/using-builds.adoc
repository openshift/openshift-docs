Create container images using `buildah`, `source-to-image`, `buildpacks` or Open Container Initiative(OCI) artifact depending on your source code, application framework, or automation requirements. Container images package your application code, dependencies, and runtime environment into a consistent and portable format, enabling reliable deployment across different environments. Additionally, you can edit and delete custom resources (CR) that are not required for a build. This helps in maintaining a clean and efficient build configuration.
