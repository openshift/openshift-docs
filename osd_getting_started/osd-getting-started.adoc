Follow this getting started document to quickly create a {product-title} cluster, grant user access, deploy your first application, and learn how to scale and delete your cluster.

[id="osd-getting-started-prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed the xref:../osd_architecture/osd-understanding.adoc#osd-understanding[introduction to {product-title}] and the documentation on xref:../architecture/index.adoc#architecture-overview[architecture concepts].
* You reviewed the xref:../osd_getting_started/osd-understanding-your-cloud-deployment-options.adoc#osd-understanding-your-cloud-deployment-options[{product-title} cloud deployment options].

[id="osd-getting-started-create-cluster"]
== Creating an {product-title} cluster

You can install {product-title} in your own cloud provider account through the Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model or in a cloud account that is owned by Red Hat. For more information about the deployment options for {product-title}, see xref:../osd_getting_started/osd-understanding-your-cloud-deployment-options.adoc#osd-understanding-your-cloud-deployment-options[Understanding your cloud deployment options].

Choose from one of the following methods to deploy your cluster.
