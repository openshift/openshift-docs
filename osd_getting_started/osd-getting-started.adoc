[role="_abstract"]
Follow this getting started document to create a {product-title} cluster, grant user access, deploy your first application, and learn how to scale and delete your cluster.

For {product-title} clusters deployed on {gcp-short}, Red Hat recommends using {gcp-short} Workload Identity Federation (WIF) as the authentication type for installing and interacting with the {product-title} cluster deployed on {gcp-short} because it provides enhanced security.

Red Hat also recommends creating an {product-title} cluster deployed on {gcp-short} in Private cluster mode with Private Service Connect (PSC) to manage and monitor a cluster to avoid all public ingress network traffic. For more information, see xref:../osd_gcp_clusters/creating-a-gcp-psc-enabled-private-cluster.adoc#creating-a-gcp-psc-enabled-private-cluster[Private Service Connect overview].
