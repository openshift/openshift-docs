{product-title} executes all cluster upgrades as part of the managed service. You do not need to run any commands or make changes to the cluster. You can schedule the upgrades at a convenient time.

Ways to schedule a cluster upgrade include:

* *Manually using the command line interface (CLI)*: Start a one-time immediate upgrade or schedule a one-time upgrade for a future date and time.
* *Manually using the Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager user interface (UI)*: Start a one-time immediate upgrade or schedule a one-time upgrade for a future date and time.
* *Automated upgrades*: Set an upgrade window for recurring y-stream upgrades whenever a new version is available without needing to manually schedule it. Minor versions have to be manually scheduled.

For more details about cluster upgrades, run the following command:
