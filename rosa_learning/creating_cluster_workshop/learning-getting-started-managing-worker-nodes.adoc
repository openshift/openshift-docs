In {product-title}, changing aspects of your worker nodes is performed through the use of machine pools. A machine pool allows users to manage many machines as a single entity. Every {product-title} cluster has a default machine pool that is created when the cluster is created. You can create your machine pools using {rosa-cli-first} or within {cluster-manager-url}.
