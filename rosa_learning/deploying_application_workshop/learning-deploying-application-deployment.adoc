Deploying an application involves creating a container image, storing it in an image repository, and defining Deployment object that uses that image.

Deploying an application involves the following steps:

* Create the images for the front-end and back-end microservice containers
* Store the container images in an image repository
* Create the Kubernetes Deployment object for the application
* Deploy the application

[NOTE]
====
This workshop focuses on application deployment and has users run a remote file which uses an existing image.

[id="new-project-cli_deploying-application-deployment"]
=== Creating a new project using the CLI

.Procedure
* Create a new project named `ostoy` in your cluster by running following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project ostoy
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Now using project "ostoy" on server "https://api.myrosacluster.abcd.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443".
----

** *Optional*: Create a unique project name by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project ostoy-$(uuidgen | cut -d - -f 2 | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

[id="backend-microservice_deploying-application-deployment"]
== Deploying the back-end microservice

The microservice serves internal web requests and returns a JSON object containing the current hostname and a randomly generated color string.

.Procedure
* Deploy the microservice by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-cs/rosaworkshop/master/rosa-workshop/ostoy/yaml/ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-cs/rosaworkshop/master/rosa-workshop/ostoy/yaml/ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/ostoy-microservice created
service/ostoy-microservice-svc created
----

[id="frontend-microservice_deploying-application-deployment"]
== Deploying the front-end microservice

The front-end deployment uses the Node.js front-end for the application and additional Kubernetes objects.

Front-end deployment defines the following features:

* Persistent volume claim
* Deployment object
* Service
* Route
* ConfigMaps
* Secrets

.Procedure
* Deploy the application front-end and create the objects by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-cs/rosaworkshop/master/rosa-workshop/ostoy/yaml/ostoy-frontend-deployment.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
persistentvolumeclaim/ostoy-pvc created
deployment.apps/ostoy-frontend created
service/ostoy-frontend-svc created
route.route.openshift.io/ostoy-route created
configmap/ostoy-configmap-env created
secret/ostoy-secret-env created
configmap/ostoy-configmap-files created
secret/ostoy-secret created
----
+
All objects should create successfully.

[id="obtain-route_deploying-application-deployment"]
== Obtain the route to your application

Obtain the route to access the application.

.Procedure
* Get the route to your application by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get route
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME          HOST/PORT                                                 PATH   SERVICES             PORT    TERMINATION   WILDCARD
ostoy-route   ostoy-route-ostoy.apps.<your-rosa-cluster>.abcd.p1.openshiftapps.com          ostoy-frontend-svc   <all>                 None
----

[id="viewing-application_deploying-application-deployment"]
== Viewing the application

.Procedure
. Copy the `ostoy-route-ostoy.apps.<your-rosa-cluster>.abcd.p1.openshiftapps.com` URL output from the previous step.
. Paste the copied URL into your web browser and press enter. You should see the homepage of your application. If the page does not load, make sure you used `http` and not `https`.
