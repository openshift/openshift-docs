Deploying an application involves creating a container image, storing it in an image repository, and defining Deployment object that uses that image.

Deploying an application involves the following steps:

* Create the images for the front-end and back-end microservice containers
* Store the container images in an image repository
* Create the Kubernetes Deployment object for the application
* Deploy the application

[NOTE]
====
This workshop focuses on application deployment and has users run a remote file which uses an existing image.
