.Verification

After you make the application malfunction, the application stops responding with a `200 HTTP code`. After 3 consecutive failures, Kubernetes stops the pod and restarts it.

* From the web console, switch back to the pod events page to see that the liveness probe failed and the pod restarted.

The following image shows an example of what you will see on your pod events page.

*A.* The pod has three consecutive failures.

*B.* Kubernetes stops the pod.

*C.* Kubernetes restarts the pod.
