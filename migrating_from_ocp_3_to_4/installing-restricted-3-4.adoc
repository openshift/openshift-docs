You can install the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) on {product-title} 3 and on {product-title} {product-version} in a restricted network environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must install the same {mtc-short} version on all clusters.
====

By default, the {mtc-short} web console and the `Migration Controller` pod run on the target cluster.

You can configure the `Migration Controller` custom resource manifest to run the {mtc-short} web console and the `Migration Controller` pod on a link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5064151[source cluster or on a remote cluster].

After you have installed {mtc-short}, you must configure an object storage to use as a replication repository.

== Configuring a replication repository

The Multicloud Object Gateway is the only supported option for a restricted network environment.

{mtc-short} supports the xref:../migrating_from_ocp_3_to_4/about-mtc-3-4.adoc#migration-understanding-data-copy-methods_about-mtc-3-4[file system and snapshot data copy methods] for migrating data from the source cluster to the target cluster. You can select a method that is suited for your environment and is supported by your storage provider.

All clusters must have uninterrupted network access to the replication repository.

If you use a proxy server with an internally hosted replication repository, you must ensure that the proxy allows access to the replication repository.
