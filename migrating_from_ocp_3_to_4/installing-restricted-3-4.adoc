You can install the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) on {product-title} 3 and 4 in a restricted network environment by performing the following procedures:

. Create a xref:../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-mirror-catalog_olm-restricted-networks[mirrored Operator catalog].
+
This process creates a `mapping.txt` file, which contains the mapping between the `registry.redhat.io` image and your mirror registry image. The `mapping.txt` file is required for installing the Operator on the source cluster.
. Install the {mtc-full} Operator on the {product-title} {product-version} target cluster by using Operator Lifecycle Manager.
+
By default, the {mtc-short} web console and the `Migration Controller` pod run on the target cluster. You can configure the `Migration Controller` custom resource manifest to run the {mtc-short} web console and the `Migration Controller` pod on a link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5064151[source cluster or on a remote cluster].

. Install the _legacy_ {mtc-full} Operator on the {product-title} 3 source cluster from the command line interface.
. Configure object storage to use as a replication repository.

== Configuring a replication repository

The Multicloud Object Gateway is the only supported option for a restricted network environment.

{mtc-short} supports the xref:../migrating_from_ocp_3_to_4/about-mtc-3-4.adoc#migration-understanding-data-copy-methods_about-mtc-3-4[file system and snapshot data copy methods] for migrating data from the source cluster to the target cluster. You can select a method that is suited for your environment and is supported by your storage provider.

[id="replication-repository-prerequisites_{context}"]
=== Prerequisites

* All clusters must have uninterrupted network access to the replication repository.
* If you use a proxy server with an internally hosted replication repository, you must ensure that the proxy allows access to the replication repository.
