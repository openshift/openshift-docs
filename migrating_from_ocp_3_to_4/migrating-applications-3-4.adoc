You can migrate your applications by using the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) web console or from the xref:../migrating_from_ocp_3_to_4/advanced-migration-options-3-4.adoc#migrating-applications-cli_advanced-migration-options-3-4[command line].

You can use stage migration and cutover migration to migrate an application between clusters:

* Stage migration copies data from the source cluster to the target cluster without stopping the application. You can run a stage migration multiple times to reduce the duration of the cutover migration.
* Cutover migration stops the transactions on the source cluster and moves the resources to the target cluster.

You can use state migration to migrate an application's state:

* State migration copies selected persistent volume claims (PVCs).
* You can use state migration to migrate a namespace within the same cluster.

Most cluster-scoped resources are not yet handled by {mtc-short}. If your applications require cluster-scoped resources, you might have to create them manually on the target cluster.

During migration, {mtc-short} preserves the following namespace annotations:

* `openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs`
* `openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups`
* `openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range`

These annotations preserve the UID range, ensuring that the containers retain their file system permissions on the target cluster. There is a risk that the migrated UIDs could duplicate UIDs within an existing or future namespace on the target cluster.

== Migrating your applications by using the {mtc-short} web console

You can configure clusters and a replication repository by using the {mtc-short} web console. Then, you can create and run a migration plan.
