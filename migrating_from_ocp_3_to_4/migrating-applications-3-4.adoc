== Migrating your applications by using the {mtc-short} web console

You can configure clusters and a replication repository by using the {mtc-short} web console. Then, you can create and run a migration plan.

== Migrating your applications from the command line

You can migrate your applications on the command line by creating or editing the {mtc-short} custom resource (CR) manifests.

You can migrate applications from a local cluster to a remote cluster, from a remote cluster to a local cluster, and between remote clusters.

=== {mtc-short} terminology

The following terms are relevant for configuring clusters:

* `host` cluster:
** The `migration-controller` pod runs on the `host` cluster.
** A `host` cluster does not require an exposed secure registry route for direct image migration.
* Local cluster: The local cluster is often the same as the `host` cluster but this is not a requirement.
* Remote cluster:
** A remote cluster must have an exposed secure registry route for direct image migration.
** A remote cluster must have a `Secret` CR containing the `migration-controller` service account token.

The following terms are relevant for performing a migration:

* Source cluster: Cluster from which the applications are migrated.
* Destination cluster: Cluster to which the applications are migrated.
