The {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) enables you to migrate stateful application workloads from {product-title} 3 to {product-version} at the granularity of a namespace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you begin your migration, be sure to review the xref:../migrating_from_ocp_3_to_4/planning-migration-3-4.adoc#planning-migration-3-4[differences between {product-title} 3 and 4].
====

{mtc-short} provides a web console and an API, based on Kubernetes custom resources, to help you control the migration and minimize application downtime.

The {mtc-short} console is installed on the target cluster by default. You can configure the {mtc-full} Operator to install the console on an link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5064151[{product-title} 3 source cluster or on a remote cluster].

{mtc-short} supports the file system and snapshot data copy methods for migrating data from the source cluster to the target cluster. You can select a method that is suited for your environment and is supported by your storage provider.

The service catalog is deprecated in {product-title} 4. You can migrate workload resources provisioned with the service catalog from {product-title} 3 to 4 but you cannot perform service catalog actions such as `provision`, `deprovision`, or `update` on these workloads after migration. The {mtc-short} console displays a message if the service catalog resources cannot be migrated.
