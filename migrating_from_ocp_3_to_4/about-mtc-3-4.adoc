The {mtc-short} web console and API, based on Kubernetes custom resources, enable you to migrate stateful application workloads at the granularity of a namespace.

You can migrate application workloads from {product-title} 3.7, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 to {product-title} {product-version} with the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}). {mtc-short} enables you to control the migration and to minimize application downtime.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you begin your migration, be sure to review the information on xref:../migrating_from_ocp_3_to_4/planning-migration-3-4.adoc#planning-migration-3-4[planning your migration].
====

The {mtc-short} console is installed on the target cluster by default. You can configure the {mtc-full} Operator to install the console on an link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5064151[{product-title} 3 source cluster or on a remote cluster].

{mtc-short} supports the file system and snapshot data copy methods for migrating data from the source cluster to the target cluster. You can select a method that is suited for your environment and is supported by your storage provider.

You can use migration hooks to run Ansible playbooks at certain points during the migration. The hooks are added when you create a migration plan.

The service catalog is deprecated in {product-title} 4. You can migrate workload resources provisioned with the service catalog from {product-title} 3 to 4 but you cannot perform service catalog actions such as `provision`, `deprovision`, or `update` on these workloads after migration. The {mtc-short} console displays a message if the service catalog resources cannot be migrated.
