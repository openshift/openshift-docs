| `softwareRAIDVolumes`
| ``
| The list of logical disks for software RAID, if rootDeviceHints isn't used, first volume is root volume. If HardwareRAIDVolumes is set this item will be invalid. The number of created Software RAID devices must be 1 or 2. If there is only one Software RAID device, it has to be a RAID-1. If there are two, the first one has to be a RAID-1, while the RAID level for the second one can be 0, 1, or 1+0. As the first RAID device will be the deployment device, enforcing a RAID-1 reduces the risk of ending up with a non-booting node in case of a disk failure. Software RAID will always be deleted.

| `checksumType`
| `string`
| ChecksumType is the checksum algorithm for the image, e.g md5, sha256 or sha512. The special value "auto" can be used to detect the algorithm from the checksum. If missing, MD5 is used. If in doubt, use "auto".

| `format`
| `string`
| DiskFormat contains the format of the image (raw, qcow2, ...). Needs to be set to raw for raw images streaming. Note live-iso means an iso referenced by the url will be live-booted and not deployed to disk, and in this case the checksum options are not required and if specified will be ignored.

| `url`
| `string`
| URL is a location of an image to deploy.

=== .status.provisioning.raid
Description::
+
--
The Raid set by the user
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `hardwareRAIDVolumes`
| ``
| The list of logical disks for hardware RAID, if rootDeviceHints isn't used, first volume is root volume. You can set the value of this field to `[]` to clear all the hardware RAID configurations.

| `softwareRAIDVolumes`
| ``
| The list of logical disks for software RAID, if rootDeviceHints isn't used, first volume is root volume. If HardwareRAIDVolumes is set this item will be invalid. The number of created Software RAID devices must be 1 or 2. If there is only one Software RAID device, it has to be a RAID-1. If there are two, the first one has to be a RAID-1, while the RAID level for the second one can be 0, 1, or 1+0. As the first RAID device will be the deployment device, enforcing a RAID-1 reduces the risk of ending up with a non-booting node in case of a disk failure. Software RAID will always be deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`

| `fieldValidation`

| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
