Description::
+
--
Provisioning contains configuration used by the Provisioning service (Ironic) to provision baremetal hosts. Provisioning is created by the OpenShift installer using admin or user provided information about the provisioning network and the NIC on the server that can be used to PXE boot it. This CR is a singleton, created by the installer and currently only consumed by the cluster-baremetal-operator to bring up and update containers in a metal3 cluster.

| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `bootIsoSource`
| `string`
| BootIsoSource provides a way to set the location where the iso image to boot the nodes will be served from. By default the boot iso image is cached locally and served from the Provisioning service (Ironic) nodes using an auxiliary httpd server. If the boot iso image is already served by an httpd server, setting this option to http allows to directly provide the image from there; in this case, the network (either internal or external) where the httpd server that hosts the boot iso is needs to be accessible by the metal3 pod.

| `disableVirtualMediaTLS`
| `boolean`
| DisableVirtualMediaTLS turns off TLS on the virtual media server, which may be required for hardware that cannot accept HTTPS links.

| `preProvisioningOSDownloadURLs`
| `object`
| PreprovisioningOSDownloadURLs is set of CoreOS Live URLs that would be necessary to provision a worker either using virtual media or PXE.

| `provisioningDHCPExternal`
| `boolean`
| ProvisioningDHCPExternal indicates whether the DHCP server for IP addresses in the provisioning DHCP range is present within the metal3 cluster or external to it. This field is being deprecated in favor of provisioningNetwork.

| `provisioningDHCPRange`
| `string`
| ProvisioningDHCPRange needs to be interpreted along with ProvisioningDHCPExternal. If the value of provisioningDHCPExternal is set to False, then ProvisioningDHCPRange represents the range of IP addresses that the DHCP server running within the metal3 cluster can use while provisioning baremetal servers. If the value of ProvisioningDHCPExternal is set to True, then the value of ProvisioningDHCPRange will be ignored. When the value of ProvisioningDHCPExternal is set to False, indicating an internal DHCP server and the value of ProvisioningDHCPRange is not set, then the DHCP range is taken to be the default range which goes from .10 to .100 of the ProvisioningNetworkCIDR. This is the only value in all of the Provisioning configuration that can be changed after the installer has created the CR. This value needs to be two comma sererated IP addresses within the ProvisioningNetworkCIDR where the 1st address represents the start of the range and the 2nd address represents the last usable address in the  range.

| `provisioningDNS`
| `boolean`
| ProvisioningDNS allows sending the DNS information via DHCP on the provisionig network. It is off by default since the Provisioning service itself (Ironic) does not require DNS, but it may be useful for layered products (e.g. ZTP).

| `provisioningIP`
| `string`
| ProvisioningIP is the IP address assigned to the provisioningInterface of the baremetal server. This IP address should be within the provisioning subnet, and outside of the DHCP range.

| `provisioningInterface`
| `string`
| ProvisioningInterface is the name of the network interface on a baremetal server to the provisioning network. It can have values like eth1 or ens3.

| `provisioningMacAddresses`
| `array (string)`
| ProvisioningMacAddresses is a list of mac addresses of network interfaces on a baremetal server to the provisioning network. Use this instead of ProvisioningInterface to allow interfaces of different names. If not provided it will be populated by the BMH.Spec.BootMacAddress of each master.

| `provisioningNetwork`
| `string`
| ProvisioningNetwork provides a way to indicate the state of the underlying network configuration for the provisioning network. This field can have one of the following values - `Managed`- when the provisioning network is completely managed by the Baremetal IPI solution. `Unmanaged`- when the provsioning network is present and used but the user is responsible for managing DHCP. Virtual media provisioning is recommended but PXE is still available if required. `Disabled`- when the provisioning network is fully disabled. User can bring up the baremetal cluster using virtual media or assisted installation. If using metal3 for power management, BMCs must be accessible from the machine networks. User should provide two IPs on the external network that would be used for provisioning services.

| `provisioningNetworkCIDR`
| `string`
| ProvisioningNetworkCIDR is the network on which the baremetal nodes are provisioned. The provisioningIP and the IPs in the dhcpRange all come from within this network. When using IPv6 and in a network managed by the Baremetal IPI solution this cannot be a network larger than a /64.

| `provisioningOSDownloadURL`
| `string`
| ProvisioningOSDownloadURL is the location from which the OS Image used to boot baremetal host machines can be downloaded by the metal3 cluster.

| `virtualMediaViaExternalNetwork`
| `boolean`
| VirtualMediaViaExternalNetwork flag when set to "true" allows for workers to boot via Virtual Media and contact metal3 over the External Network. When the flag is set to "false" (which is the default), virtual media deployments can still happen based on the configuration specified in the ProvisioningNetwork i.e when in Disabled mode, over the External Network and over Provisioning Network when in Managed mode. PXE deployments will always use the Provisioning Network and will not be affected by this flag.

| `watchAllNamespaces`
| `boolean`
| WatchAllNamespaces provides a way to explicitly allow use of this Provisioning configuration across all Namespaces. It is an optional configuration which defaults to false and in that state will be used to provision baremetal hosts in only the openshift-machine-api namespace. When set to true, this provisioning configuration would be used for baremetal hosts across all namespaces.

HTTP method::
  `DELETE`

Description::
  delete collection of Provisioning


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `sendInitialEvents`
| `boolean`
| `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
  when request started being processed.
- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
  Invalid error is returned.

Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldManager`
| `string`
| fieldManager is a name associated with the actor or entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or 128 characters long, and only contain printable characters, as defined by https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsPrint.
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
