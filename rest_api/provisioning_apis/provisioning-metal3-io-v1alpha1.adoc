Description::
+
--
Provisioning contains configuration used by the Provisioning
service (Ironic) to provision baremetal hosts.
Provisioning is created by the OpenShift installer using admin or
user provided information about the provisioning network and the
NIC on the server that can be used to PXE boot it.
This CR is a singleton, created by the installer and currently only
consumed by the cluster-baremetal-operator to bring up and update
containers in a metal3 cluster.

== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| ProvisioningSpec defines the desired state of Provisioning

| `status`
| `object`
| ProvisioningStatus defines the observed state of Provisioning

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `bootIsoSource`
| `string`
| BootIsoSource provides a way to set the location where the iso image
to boot the nodes will be served from.
By default the boot iso image is cached locally and served from
the Provisioning service (Ironic) nodes using an auxiliary httpd server.
If the boot iso image is already served by an httpd server, setting
this option to http allows to directly provide the image from there;
in this case, the network (either internal or external) where the
httpd server that hosts the boot iso is needs to be accessible
by the metal3 pod.

| `disableVirtualMediaTLS`
| `boolean`
| DisableVirtualMediaTLS turns off TLS on the virtual media server,
which may be required for hardware that cannot accept HTTPS links.

| `preProvisioningOSDownloadURLs`
| `object`
| PreprovisioningOSDownloadURLs is set of CoreOS Live URLs that would be necessary to provision a worker
either using virtual media or PXE.

| `provisioningDHCPExternal`
| `boolean`
| ProvisioningDHCPExternal indicates whether the DHCP server
for IP addresses in the provisioning DHCP range is present
within the metal3 cluster or external to it. This field is being
deprecated in favor of provisioningNetwork.

| `provisioningDHCPRange`
| `string`
| ProvisioningDHCPRange needs to be interpreted along with
ProvisioningDHCPExternal. If the value of
provisioningDHCPExternal is set to False, then
ProvisioningDHCPRange represents the range of IP addresses
that the DHCP server running within the metal3 cluster can
use while provisioning baremetal servers. If the value of
ProvisioningDHCPExternal is set to True, then the value of
ProvisioningDHCPRange will be ignored. When the value of
ProvisioningDHCPExternal is set to False, indicating an
internal DHCP server and the value of ProvisioningDHCPRange
is not set, then the DHCP range is taken to be the default
range which goes from .10 to .100 of the
ProvisioningNetworkCIDR. This is the only value in all of
the Provisioning configuration that can be changed after
the installer has created the CR. This value needs to be
two comma sererated IP addresses within the
ProvisioningNetworkCIDR where the 1st address represents
the start of the range and the 2nd address represents the
last usable address in the  range.

| `provisioningDNS`
| `boolean`
| ProvisioningDNS allows sending the DNS information via DHCP on the
provisionig network. It is off by default since the Provisioning
service itself (Ironic) does not require DNS, but it may be useful
for layered products (e.g. ZTP).

| `provisioningIP`
| `string`
| ProvisioningIP is the IP address assigned to the
provisioningInterface of the baremetal server. This IP
address should be within the provisioning subnet, and
outside of the DHCP range.

| `provisioningInterface`
| `string`
| ProvisioningInterface is the name of the network interface
on a baremetal server to the provisioning network. It can
have values like eth1 or ens3.

| `provisioningMacAddresses`
| `array (string)`
| ProvisioningMacAddresses is a list of mac addresses of network interfaces
on a baremetal server to the provisioning network.
Use this instead of ProvisioningInterface to allow interfaces of different
names. If not provided it will be populated by the BMH.Spec.BootMacAddress
of each master.

| `provisioningNetwork`
| `string`
| ProvisioningNetwork provides a way to indicate the state of the
underlying network configuration for the provisioning network.
This field can have one of the following values -
`Managed`- when the provisioning network is completely managed by
the Baremetal IPI solution.
`Unmanaged`- when the provsioning network is present and used but
the user is responsible for managing DHCP. Virtual media provisioning
is recommended but PXE is still available if required.
`Disabled`- when the provisioning network is fully disabled. User can
bring up the baremetal cluster using virtual media or assisted
installation. If using metal3 for power management, BMCs must be
accessible from the machine networks. User should provide two IPs on
the external network that would be used for provisioning services.

| `provisioningNetworkCIDR`
| `string`
| ProvisioningNetworkCIDR is the network on which the
baremetal nodes are provisioned. The provisioningIP and the
IPs in the dhcpRange all come from within this network. When using IPv6
and in a network managed by the Baremetal IPI solution this cannot be a
network larger than a /64.

| `provisioningOSDownloadURL`
| `string`
| ProvisioningOSDownloadURL is the location from which the OS
Image used to boot baremetal host machines can be downloaded
by the metal3 cluster.

| `virtualMediaViaExternalNetwork`
| `boolean`
| VirtualMediaViaExternalNetwork flag when set to "true" allows for workers
to boot via Virtual Media and contact metal3 over the External Network.
When the flag is set to "false" (which is the default), virtual media
deployments can still happen based on the configuration specified in the
ProvisioningNetwork i.e when in Disabled mode, over the External Network
and over Provisioning Network when in Managed mode.
PXE deployments will always use the Provisioning Network and will not be
affected by this flag.

| `watchAllNamespaces`
| `boolean`
| WatchAllNamespaces provides a way to explicitly allow use of this
Provisioning configuration across all Namespaces. It is an
optional configuration which defaults to false and in that state
will be used to provision baremetal hosts in only the
openshift-machine-api namespace. When set to true, this provisioning
configuration would be used for baremetal hosts across all namespaces.
