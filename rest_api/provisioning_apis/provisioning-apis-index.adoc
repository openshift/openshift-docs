== Provisioning [metal3.io/v1alpha1]

Description::
+
--
Provisioning contains configuration used by the Provisioning service (Ironic) to provision baremetal hosts. Provisioning is created by the OpenShift installer using admin or user provided information about the provisioning network and the NIC on the server that can be used to PXE boot it. This CR is a singleton, created by the installer and currently only consumed by the cluster-baremetal-operator to bring up and update containers in a metal3 cluster.
