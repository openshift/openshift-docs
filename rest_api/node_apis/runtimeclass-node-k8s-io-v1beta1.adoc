Description::
  RuntimeClass defines a class of container runtime supported in the cluster. The RuntimeClass is used to determine which container runtime is used to run all containers in a pod. RuntimeClasses are (currently) manually defined by a user or cluster provisioner, and referenced in the PodSpec. The Kubelet is responsible for resolving the RuntimeClassName reference before running the pod.  For more details, see https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `handler`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.handler`
| `string`
| Handler specifies the underlying runtime and configuration that the CRI implementation will use to handle pods of this class. The possible values are specific to the node & CRI configuration.  It is assumed that all handlers are available on every node, and handlers of the same name are equivalent on every node. For example, a handler called "runc" might specify that the runc OCI runtime (using native Linux containers) will be used to run the containers in a pod. The Handler must conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123) requirements, and is immutable.

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.overhead`
| `object`
| Overhead structure represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod.

| `.scheduling`
| `object`
| Scheduling specifies the scheduling constraints for nodes supporting a RuntimeClass.

Description::
  Overhead structure represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `podFixed`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#quantity-api-resource[`object (Quantity api/resource)`]
| PodFixed represents the fixed resource overhead associated with running a pod.

|===
..scheduling
Description::
  Scheduling specifies the scheduling constraints for nodes supporting a RuntimeClass.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `nodeSelector`
| `object (string)`
| nodeSelector lists labels that must be present on nodes that support this RuntimeClass. Pods using this RuntimeClass can only be scheduled to a node matched by this selector. The RuntimeClass nodeSelector is merged with a pod's existing nodeSelector. Any conflicts will cause the pod to be rejected in admission.

| `tolerations`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#toleration-core-v1[`array (Toleration core/v1)`]
| tolerations are appended (excluding duplicates) to pods running with this RuntimeClass during admission, effectively unioning the set of nodes tolerated by the pod and the RuntimeClass.
