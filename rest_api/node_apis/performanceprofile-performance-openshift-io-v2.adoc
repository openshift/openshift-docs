Type::
  `object`



== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| PerformanceProfileSpec defines the desired state of PerformanceProfile.

| `status`
| `object`
| PerformanceProfileStatus defines the observed state of PerformanceProfile.

|===
=== .spec
Description::
+
--
PerformanceProfileSpec defines the desired state of PerformanceProfile.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `cpu`
  - `nodeSelector`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `additionalKernelArgs`
| `array (string)`
| Addional kernel arguments.

| `cpu`
| `object`
| CPU defines a set of CPU related parameters.

| `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing`
| `boolean`
| GloballyDisableIrqLoadBalancing toggles whether IRQ load balancing will be disabled for the Isolated CPU set. When the option is set to "true" it disables IRQs load balancing for the Isolated CPU set. Setting the option to "false" allows the IRQs to be balanced across all CPUs, however the IRQs load balancing can be disabled per pod CPUs when using irq-load-balancing.crio.io/cpu-quota.crio.io annotations. Defaults to "false"

| `hugepages`
| `object`
| HugePages defines a set of huge pages related parameters. It is possible to set huge pages with multiple size values at the same time. For example, hugepages can be set with 1G and 2M, both values will be set on the node by the Performance Profile Controller. It is important to notice that setting hugepages default size to 1G will remove all 2M related folders from the node and it will be impossible to configure 2M hugepages under the node.

| `machineConfigLabel`
| `object (string)`
| MachineConfigLabel defines the label to add to the MachineConfigs the operator creates. It has to be used in the MachineConfigSelector of the MachineConfigPool which targets this performance profile. Defaults to "machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role=<same role as in NodeSelector label key>"

| `machineConfigPoolSelector`
| `object (string)`
| MachineConfigPoolSelector defines the MachineConfigPool label to use in the MachineConfigPoolSelector of resources like KubeletConfigs created by the operator. Defaults to "machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role=<same role as in NodeSelector label key>"

| `net`
| `object`
| Net defines a set of network related features

| `nodeSelector`
| `object (string)`
| NodeSelector defines the Node label to use in the NodeSelectors of resources like Tuned created by the operator. It most likely should, but does not have to match the node label in the NodeSelector of the MachineConfigPool which targets this performance profile. In the case when machineConfigLabels or machineConfigPoolSelector are not set, we are expecting a certain NodeSelector format <domain>/<role>: "" in order to be able to calculate the default values for the former mentioned fields.

| `numa`
| `object`
| NUMA defines options related to topology aware affinities

| `realTimeKernel`
| `object`
| RealTimeKernel defines a set of real time kernel related parameters. RT kernel won't be installed when not set.

| `workloadHints`
| `object`
| WorkloadHints defines hints for different types of workloads. It will allow defining exact set of tuned and kernel arguments that should be applied on top of the node.

Type::
  `object`

Required::

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `balanceIsolated`
| `boolean`
| BalanceIsolated toggles whether or not the Isolated CPU set is eligible for load balancing work loads. When this option is set to "false", the Isolated CPU set will be static, meaning workloads have to explicitly assign each thread to a specific cpu in order to work across multiple CPUs. Setting this to "true" allows workloads to be balanced across CPUs. Setting this to "false" offers the most predictable performance for guaranteed workloads, but it offloads the complexity of cpu load balancing to the application. Defaults to "true"

| `isolated`
| `string`
| Isolated defines a set of CPUs that will be used to give to application threads the most execution time possible, which means removing as many extraneous tasks off a CPU as possible. It is important to notice the CPU manager can choose any CPU to run the workload except the reserved CPUs. In order to guarantee that your workload will run on the isolated CPU:   1. The union of reserved CPUs and isolated CPUs should include all online CPUs   2. The isolated CPUs field should be the complementary to reserved CPUs field

| `offlined`
| `string`
| Offline defines a set of CPUs that will be unused and set offline

| `reserved`
| `string`
| Reserved defines a set of CPUs that will not be used for any container workloads initiated by kubelet.

.Global query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
|===

HTTP method::
  `DELETE`

Description::
  delete collection of PerformanceProfile


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `sendInitialEvents`
| `boolean`
| `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
  when request started being processed.
- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
  Invalid error is returned.

Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldManager`
| `string`
| fieldManager is a name associated with the actor or entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or 128 characters long, and only contain printable characters, as defined by https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsPrint. This field is required for apply requests (application/apply-patch) but optional for non-apply patch types (JsonPatch, MergePatch, StrategicMergePatch).
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
| `force`
| `boolean`
| Force is going to "force" Apply requests. It means user will re-acquire conflicting fields owned by other people. Force flag must be unset for non-apply patch requests.
