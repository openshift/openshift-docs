| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`

| Property | Type | Description

| `imageTagMirrors`
| `array`
| imageTagMirrors allows images referenced by image tags in pods to be pulled from alternative mirrored repository locations. The image pull specification provided to the pod will be compared to the source locations described in imageTagMirrors and the image may be pulled down from any of the mirrors in the list instead of the specified repository allowing administrators to choose a potentially faster mirror. To use mirrors to pull images using digest specification only, users should configure a list of mirrors using "ImageDigestMirrorSet" CRD. 
 If the image pull specification matches the repository of "source" in multiple imagetagmirrorset objects, only the objects which define the most specific namespace match will be used. For example, if there are objects using quay.io/libpod and quay.io/libpod/busybox as the "source", only the objects using quay.io/libpod/busybox are going to apply for pull specification quay.io/libpod/busybox. Each “source” repository is treated independently; configurations for different “source” repositories don’t interact. 
 If the "mirrors" is not specified, the image will continue to be pulled from the specified repository in the pull spec. 
 When multiple policies are defined for the same “source” repository, the sets of defined mirrors will be merged together, preserving the relative order of the mirrors, if possible. For example, if policy A has mirrors `a, b, c` and policy B has mirrors `c, d, e`, the mirrors will be used in the order `a, b, c, d, e`.  If the orders of mirror entries conflict (e.g. `a, b` vs. `b, a`) the configuration is not rejected but the resulting order is unspecified. Users who want to use a deterministic order of mirrors, should configure them into one list of mirrors using the expected order.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `source`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `mirrorSourcePolicy`
| `string`
| mirrorSourcePolicy defines the fallback policy if fails to pull image from the mirrors. If unset, the image will continue to be pulled from the repository in the pull spec. sourcePolicy is valid configuration only when one or more mirrors are in the mirror list.

| `mirrors`
| `array (string)`
| mirrors is zero or more locations that may also contain the same images. No mirror will be configured if not specified. Images can be pulled from these mirrors only if they are referenced by their tags. The mirrored location is obtained by replacing the part of the input reference that matches source by the mirrors entry, e.g. for registry.redhat.io/product/repo reference, a (source, mirror) pair *.redhat.io, mirror.local/redhat causes a mirror.local/redhat/product/repo repository to be used. Pulling images by tag can potentially yield different images, depending on which endpoint we pull from. Configuring a list of mirrors using "ImageDigestMirrorSet" CRD and forcing digest-pulls for mirrors avoids that issue. The order of mirrors in this list is treated as the user's desired priority, while source is by default considered lower priority than all mirrors. If no mirror is specified or all image pulls from the mirror list fail, the image will continue to be pulled from the repository in the pull spec unless explicitly prohibited by "mirrorSourcePolicy". Other cluster configuration, including (but not limited to) other imageTagMirrors objects, may impact the exact order mirrors are contacted in, or some mirrors may be contacted in parallel, so this should be considered a preference rather than a guarantee of ordering. "mirrors" uses one of the following formats: host[:port] host[:port]/namespace[/namespace…] host[:port]/namespace[/namespace…]/repo for more information about the format, see the document about the location field: https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md#choosing-a-registry-toml-table

| `source`
| `string`
| source matches the repository that users refer to, e.g. in image pull specifications. Setting source to a registry hostname e.g. docker.io. quay.io, or registry.redhat.io, will match the image pull specification of corressponding registry. "source" uses one of the following formats: host[:port] host[:port]/namespace[/namespace…] host[:port]/namespace[/namespace…]/repo [*.]host for more information about the format, see the document about the location field: https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md#choosing-a-registry-toml-table

HTTP method::
  `DELETE`

Description::
  delete collection of ImageTagMirrorSet


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `sendInitialEvents`
| `boolean`
| `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
  when request started being processed.
- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
  Invalid error is returned.

Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldManager`
| `string`
| fieldManager is a name associated with the actor or entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or 128 characters long, and only contain printable characters, as defined by https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsPrint. This field is required for apply requests (application/apply-patch) but optional for non-apply patch types (JsonPatch, MergePatch, StrategicMergePatch).
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
| `force`
| `boolean`
| Force is going to "force" Apply requests. It means user will re-acquire conflicting fields owned by other people. Force flag must be unset for non-apply patch requests.
