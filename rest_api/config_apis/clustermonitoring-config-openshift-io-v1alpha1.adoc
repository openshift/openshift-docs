Required::
  - `maxSkew`
  - `topologyKey`
  - `whenUnsatisfiable`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `labelSelector`
| `object`
| LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.
Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods
in their corresponding topology domain.

| `matchLabelKeys`
| `array (string)`
| MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

| `maxSkew`
| `integer`
| MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
In this case, the global minimum is 1.
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\|  P P  \|  P P  \|   P   \|
- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
violate MaxSkew(1).
- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
to topologies that satisfy it.
It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

| `minDomains`
| `integer`
| MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
this value has no effect on scheduling.
As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
Valid values are integers greater than 0.
When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\|  P P  \|  P P  \|  P P  \|
The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
it will violate MaxSkew.

| `nodeAffinityPolicy`
| `string`
| NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.
- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.

If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.

| `nodeTaintsPolicy`
| `string`
| NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating
pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod
has a toleration, are included.
- Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.

If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.

| `topologyKey`
| `string`
| TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
of pods into each bucket.
We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.
It's a required field.

| `whenUnsatisfiable`
| `string`
| WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
the spread constraint.
- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
  skew.
A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
"MaxSkew" on some topology.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\| P P P \|   P   \|   P   \|
If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
won't make it *more* imbalanced.
It's a required field.

There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is

it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string or nil value indicates that no
VolumeAttributesClass will be applied to the claim. If the claim enters an Infeasible error state,
this field can be reset to its previous value (including nil) to cancel the modification.

dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.

(Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

| `array (string)`
| accessModes contains the actual access modes the volume backing the PVC has.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1

| `allocatedResourceStatuses`
| `object (string)`
| allocatedResourceStatuses stores status of resource being resized for the given PVC.
Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:
	* Un-prefixed keys:
		- storage - the capacity of the volume.
	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered
reserved and hence may not be used.

ClaimResourceStatus can be in any of following states:
	- ControllerResizeInProgress:
		State set when resize controller starts resizing the volume in control-plane.
	- ControllerResizeFailed:
		State set when resize has failed in resize controller with a terminal error.
	- NodeResizePending:
		State set when resize controller has finished resizing the volume but further resizing of
		volume is needed on the node.
	- NodeResizeInProgress:
		State set when kubelet starts resizing the volume.
	- NodeResizeFailed:
		State set when resizing has failed in kubelet with a terminal error. Transient errors don't set
		NodeResizeFailed.
For example: if expanding a PVC for more capacity - this field can be one of the following states:
	- pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeInProgress"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeFailed"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizePending"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeInProgress"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeFailed"
When this field is not set, it means that no resize operation is in progress for the given PVC.

A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName or ClaimResourceStatus
should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller that
only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid
resources associated with PVC.

This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature.

| `allocatedResources`
| `integer-or-string`
| allocatedResources tracks the resources allocated to a PVC including its capacity.
Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:
	* Un-prefixed keys:
		- storage - the capacity of the volume.
	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered
reserved and hence may not be used.

Capacity reported here may be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion operation
is requested.
For storage quota, the larger value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used.
If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation.
If a volume expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only
lowered if there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume capacity
is equal or lower than the requested capacity.

A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName
should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller that
only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid
resources associated with PVC.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `labelSelector`
| `object`
| LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.
Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods
in their corresponding topology domain.

| `matchLabelKeys`
| `array (string)`
| MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

| `maxSkew`
| `integer`
| MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
In this case, the global minimum is 1.
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\|  P P  \|  P P  \|   P   \|
- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
violate MaxSkew(1).
- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
to topologies that satisfy it.
It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

| `minDomains`
| `integer`
| MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
this value has no effect on scheduling.
As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
Valid values are integers greater than 0.
When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\|  P P  \|  P P  \|  P P  \|
The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
it will violate MaxSkew.

| `nodeAffinityPolicy`
| `string`
| NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.
- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.

If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.

| `nodeTaintsPolicy`
| `string`
| NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating
pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod
has a toleration, are included.
- Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.

If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.

| `topologyKey`
| `string`
| TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
of pods into each bucket.
We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.
It's a required field.

| `whenUnsatisfiable`
| `string`
| WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
the spread constraint.
- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
  skew.
A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
"MaxSkew" on some topology.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\| P P P \|   P   \|   P   \|
If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
won't make it *more* imbalanced.
It's a required field.

| `values`
| `array (string)`
| values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn,
the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,
the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
merge patch.

=== .spec.userDefined
Description::
+
--
userDefined set the deployment mode for user-defined monitoring in addition to the default platform monitoring.
userDefined is optional.
When omitted, this means no opinion and the platform is left to choose a reasonable default, which is subject to change over time.
The current default value is `Disabled`.
--

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `mode`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `mode`
| `string`
| mode defines the different configurations of UserDefinedMonitoring
Valid values are Disabled and NamespaceIsolated
Disabled disables monitoring for user-defined projects. This restricts the default monitoring stack, installed in the openshift-monitoring project, to monitor only platform namespaces, which prevents any custom monitoring configurations or resources from being applied to user-defined namespaces.
NamespaceIsolated enables monitoring for user-defined projects with namespace-scoped tenancy. This ensures that metrics, alerts, and monitoring data are isolated at the namespace level.
The current default value is `Disabled`.

|===
=== .status
Description::
+
--
status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.
--

Type::
  `object`

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
