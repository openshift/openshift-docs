== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec holds user settable values for configuration

| `status`
| `object`
| status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `appsDomain`
| `string`
| appsDomain is an optional domain to use instead of the one specified in the domain field when a Route is created without specifying an explicit host. If appsDomain is nonempty, this value is used to generate default host values for Route. Unlike domain, appsDomain may be modified after installation. This assumes a new ingresscontroller has been setup with a wildcard certificate.

| `componentRoutes`
| `array`
| componentRoutes is an optional list of routes that are managed by OpenShift components that a cluster-admin is able to configure the hostname and serving certificate for. The namespace and name of each route in this list should match an existing entry in the status.componentRoutes list.
 To determine the set of configurable Routes, look at namespace and name of entries in the .status.componentRoutes list, where participating operators write the status of configurable routes.

| `componentRoutes[]`
| `object`
| ComponentRouteSpec allows for configuration of a route's hostname and serving certificate.

| `domain`
| `string`
| domain is used to generate a default host name for a route when the route's host name is empty. The generated host name will follow this pattern: "<route-name>.<route-namespace>.<domain>".
 It is also used as the default wildcard domain suffix for ingress. The default ingresscontroller domain will follow this pattern: "*.<domain>".
 Once set, changing domain is not currently supported.

| `loadBalancer`
| `object`
| loadBalancer contains the load balancer details in general which are not only specific to the underlying infrastructure provider of the current cluster and are required for Ingress Controller to work on OpenShift.

| `requiredHSTSPolicies`
| `array`
| requiredHSTSPolicies specifies HSTS policies that are required to be set on newly created  or updated routes matching the domainPattern/s and namespaceSelector/s that are specified in the policy. Each requiredHSTSPolicy must have at least a domainPattern and a maxAge to validate a route HSTS Policy route annotation, and affect route admission.
 A candidate route is checked for HSTS Policies if it has the HSTS Policy route annotation: "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header" E.g. haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;preload;includeSubDomains
 - For each candidate route, if it matches a requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, then the maxAge, preloadPolicy, and includeSubdomainsPolicy must be valid to be admitted.  Otherwise, the route is rejected. - The first match, by domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, in the ordering of the RequiredHSTSPolicies determines the route's admission status. - If the candidate route doesn't match any requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, then it may use any HSTS Policy annotation.
 The HSTS policy configuration may be changed after routes have already been created. An update to a previously admitted route may then fail if the updated route does not conform to the updated HSTS policy configuration. However, changing the HSTS policy configuration will not cause a route that is already admitted to stop working.
 Note that if there are no RequiredHSTSPolicies, any HSTS Policy annotation on the route is valid.

Required::
  - `domainPatterns`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `domainPatterns`
| `array (string)`
| domainPatterns is a list of domains for which the desired HSTS annotations are required. If domainPatterns is specified and a route is created with a spec.host matching one of the domains, the route must specify the HSTS Policy components described in the matching RequiredHSTSPolicy.
 The use of wildcards is allowed like this: *.foo.com matches everything under foo.com. foo.com only matches foo.com, so to cover foo.com and everything under it, you must specify *both*.

| `includeSubDomainsPolicy`
| `string`
| includeSubDomainsPolicy means the HSTS Policy should apply to any subdomains of the host's domain name.  Thus, for the host bar.foo.com, if includeSubDomainsPolicy was set to RequireIncludeSubDomains: - the host app.bar.foo.com would inherit the HSTS Policy of bar.foo.com - the host bar.foo.com would inherit the HSTS Policy of bar.foo.com - the host foo.com would NOT inherit the HSTS Policy of bar.foo.com - the host def.foo.com would NOT inherit the HSTS Policy of bar.foo.com

| `maxAge`
| `object`
| maxAge is the delta time range in seconds during which hosts are regarded as HSTS hosts. If set to 0, it negates the effect, and hosts are removed as HSTS hosts. If set to 0 and includeSubdomains is specified, all subdomains of the host are also removed as HSTS hosts. maxAge is a time-to-live value, and if this policy is not refreshed on a client, the HSTS policy will eventually expire on that client.

| `namespaceSelector`
| `object`
| namespaceSelector specifies a label selector such that the policy applies only to those routes that are in namespaces with labels that match the selector, and are in one of the DomainPatterns. Defaults to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.

| `preloadPolicy`
| `string`
| preloadPolicy directs the client to include hosts in its host preload list so that it never needs to do an initial load to get the HSTS header (note that this is not defined in RFC 6797 and is therefore client implementation-dependent).

.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `sendInitialEvents`
| `boolean`
| `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the

.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `sendInitialEvents`
| `boolean`
| `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
  when request started being processed.
- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
  Invalid error is returned.

Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
