== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta_v2-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta_v2 meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec holds user settable values for configuration

| `status`
| `object`

| Property | Type | Description

| `appsDomain`
| `string`
| appsDomain is an optional domain to use instead of the one specified in the domain field when a Route is created without specifying an explicit host. If appsDomain is nonempty, this value is used to generate default host values for Route. Unlike domain, appsDomain may be modified after installation. This assumes a new ingresscontroller has been setup with a wildcard certificate.

| `componentRoutes`
| `array`
| componentRoutes is an optional list of routes that are managed by OpenShift components that a cluster-admin is able to configure the hostname and serving certificate for. The namespace and name of each route in this list should match an existing entry in the status.componentRoutes list. 
 To determine the set of configurable Routes, look at namespace and name of entries in the .status.componentRoutes list, where participating operators write the status of configurable routes.

| `componentRoutes[]`
| `object`
| ComponentRouteSpec allows for configuration of a route's hostname and serving certificate.

| `domain`
| `string`
| domain is used to generate a default host name for a route when the route's host name is empty. The generated host name will follow this pattern: "<route-name>.<route-namespace>.<domain>". 
 It is also used as the default wildcard domain suffix for ingress. The default ingresscontroller domain will follow this pattern: "*.<domain>". 
 Once set, changing domain is not currently supported.

| Property | Type | Description

| `conditions`
| `array`
| conditions are used to communicate the state of the componentRoutes entry. 
 Supported conditions include Available, Degraded and Progressing. 
 If available is true, the content served by the route can be accessed by users. This includes cases where a default may continue to serve content while the customized route specified by the cluster-admin is being configured. 
 If Degraded is true, that means something has gone wrong trying to handle the componentRoutes entry. The currentHostnames field may or may not be in effect. 
 If Progressing is true, that means the component is taking some action related to the componentRoutes entry.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource. --- This struct is intended for direct use as an array at the field path .status.conditions.  For example, type FooStatus struct{     // Represents the observations of a foo's current state.     // Known .status.conditions.type are: "Available", "Progressing", and "Degraded"     // +patchMergeKey=type     // +patchStrategy=merge     // +listType=map     // +listMapKey=type     Conditions []metav1.Condition `json:"conditions,omitempty" patchStrategy:"merge" patchMergeKey:"type" protobuf:"bytes,1,rep,name=conditions"`

| consumingUsers is a slice of ServiceAccounts that need to have read permission on the servingCertKeyPairSecret secret.

| `currentHostnames`
| `array (string)`
| currentHostnames is the list of current names used by the route. Typically, this list should consist of a single hostname, but if multiple hostnames are supported by the route the operator may write multiple entries to this list.

| `defaultHostname`
| `string`
| defaultHostname is the hostname of this route prior to customization.

| `name`
| `string`
| name is the logical name of the route to customize. It does not have to be the actual name of a route resource but it cannot be renamed. 
 The namespace and name of this componentRoute must match a corresponding entry in the list of spec.componentRoutes if the route is to be customized.

| `namespace`
| `string`
| namespace is the namespace of the route to customize. It must be a real namespace. Using an actual namespace ensures that no two components will conflict and the same component can be installed multiple times. 
 The namespace and name of this componentRoute must match a corresponding entry in the list of spec.componentRoutes if the route is to be customized.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This may be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field may not be empty.

| `status`
| `string`
| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. --- Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important. The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)

HTTP method::
  `DELETE`

Description::
  delete collection of Ingress


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

| `continue`

| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token.

This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.
