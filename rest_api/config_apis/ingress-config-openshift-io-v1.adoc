| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `appsDomain`
| `string`
| appsDomain is an optional domain to use instead of the one specified in the domain field when a Route is created without specifying an explicit host. If appsDomain is nonempty, this value is used to generate default host values for Route. Unlike domain, appsDomain may be modified after installation. This assumes a new ingresscontroller has been setup with a wildcard certificate.

| `componentRoutes`
| `array`
| componentRoutes is an optional list of routes that are managed by OpenShift components that a cluster-admin is able to configure the hostname and serving certificate for. The namespace and name of each route in this list should match an existing entry in the status.componentRoutes list. 
 To determine the set of configurable Routes, look at namespace and name of entries in the .status.componentRoutes list, where participating operators write the status of configurable routes.

| `componentRoutes[]`
| `object`
| ComponentRouteSpec allows for configuration of a route's hostname and serving certificate.

| `domain`
| `string`
| domain is used to generate a default host name for a route when the route's host name is empty. The generated host name will follow this pattern: "<route-name>.<route-namespace>.<domain>". 
 It is also used as the default wildcard domain suffix for ingress. The default ingresscontroller domain will follow this pattern: "*.<domain>". 
 Once set, changing domain is not currently supported.

| `loadBalancer`
| `object`
| loadBalancer contains the load balancer details in general which are not only specific to the underlying infrastructure provider of the current cluster and are required for Ingress Controller to work on OpenShift.

| `requiredHSTSPolicies`
| `array`
| requiredHSTSPolicies specifies HSTS policies that are required to be set on newly created  or updated routes matching the domainPattern/s and namespaceSelector/s that are specified in the policy. Each requiredHSTSPolicy must have at least a domainPattern and a maxAge to validate a route HSTS Policy route annotation, and affect route admission. 
 A candidate route is checked for HSTS Policies if it has the HSTS Policy route annotation: "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header" E.g. haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;preload;includeSubDomains 
 - For each candidate route, if it matches a requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, then the maxAge, preloadPolicy, and includeSubdomainsPolicy must be valid to be admitted.  Otherwise, the route is rejected. - The first match, by domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, in the ordering of the RequiredHSTSPolicies determines the route's admission status. - If the candidate route doesn't match any requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, then it may use any HSTS Policy annotation. 
 The HSTS policy configuration may be changed after routes have already been created. An update to a previously admitted route may then fail if the updated route does not conform to the updated HSTS policy configuration. However, changing the HSTS policy configuration will not cause a route that is already admitted to stop working. 
 Note that if there are no RequiredHSTSPolicies, any HSTS Policy annotation on the route is valid.

  `object`

Required::
  - `domainPatterns`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `domainPatterns`
| `array (string)`
| domainPatterns is a list of domains for which the desired HSTS annotations are required. If domainPatterns is specified and a route is created with a spec.host matching one of the domains, the route must specify the HSTS Policy components described in the matching RequiredHSTSPolicy. 
 The use of wildcards is allowed like this: *.foo.com matches everything under foo.com. foo.com only matches foo.com, so to cover foo.com and everything under it, you must specify *both*.

| `includeSubDomainsPolicy`
| `string`
| includeSubDomainsPolicy means the HSTS Policy should apply to any subdomains of the host's domain name.  Thus, for the host bar.foo.com, if includeSubDomainsPolicy was set to RequireIncludeSubDomains: - the host app.bar.foo.com would inherit the HSTS Policy of bar.foo.com - the host bar.foo.com would inherit the HSTS Policy of bar.foo.com - the host foo.com would NOT inherit the HSTS Policy of bar.foo.com - the host def.foo.com would NOT inherit the HSTS Policy of bar.foo.com

| `maxAge`
| `object`
| maxAge is the delta time range in seconds during which hosts are regarded as HSTS hosts. If set to 0, it negates the effect, and hosts are removed as HSTS hosts. If set to 0 and includeSubdomains is specified, all subdomains of the host are also removed as HSTS hosts. maxAge is a time-to-live value, and if this policy is not refreshed on a client, the HSTS policy will eventually expire on that client.

| `namespaceSelector`
| `object`
| namespaceSelector specifies a label selector such that the policy applies only to those routes that are in namespaces with labels that match the selector, and are in one of the DomainPatterns. Defaults to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.

| `preloadPolicy`
| `string`
| preloadPolicy directs the client to include hosts in its host preload list so that it never needs to do an initial load to get the HSTS header (note that this is not defined in RFC 6797 and is therefore client implementation-dependent).

 If Degraded is true, that means something has gone wrong trying to handle the componentRoutes entry. The currentHostnames field may or may not be in effect.

| `consumingUsers`
| `array (string)`
| consumingUsers is a slice of ServiceAccounts that need to have read permission on the servingCertKeyPairSecret secret.

| `currentHostnames`

| `defaultHostname`
| `string`
| defaultHostname is the hostname of this route prior to customization.

| `name`
| `string`
| name is the logical name of the route to customize. It does not have to be the actual name of a route resource but it cannot be renamed.

The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present.

HTTP method::

Description::
  partially update the specified Ingress


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
