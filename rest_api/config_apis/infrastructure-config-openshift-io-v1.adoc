| `type`
| `string`
| type defines the type of load balancer used by the cluster on OpenStack platform which can be a user-managed or openshift-managed load balancer that is to be used for the OpenShift API and Ingress endpoints. When set to OpenShiftManagedDefault the static pods in charge of API and Ingress traffic load-balancing defined in the machine config operator will be deployed. When set to UserManaged these static pods will not be deployed and it is expected that the load balancer is configured out of band by the deployer. When omitted, this means no opinion and the platform is left to choose a reasonable default. The default value is OpenShiftManagedDefault.

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present.
