| `type`
| `string`
| type defines the type of load balancer used by the cluster on Nutanix platform which can be a user-managed or openshift-managed load balancer that is to be used for the OpenShift API and Ingress endpoints. When set to OpenShiftManagedDefault the static pods in charge of API and Ingress traffic load-balancing defined in the machine config operator will be deployed. When set to UserManaged these static pods will not be deployed and it is expected that the load balancer is configured out of band by the deployer.
