Description::

--
Network holds cluster-wide information about Network. The canonical name is `cluster`. It is used to configure the desired network configuration, such as: IP address pools for services/pod IPs, network plugin, etc. Please view network.spec for an explanation on what applies when configuring this resource. 
 Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec holds user settable values for configuration. As a general rule, this SHOULD NOT be read directly. Instead, you should consume the NetworkStatus, as it indicates the currently deployed configuration. Currently, most spec fields are immutable after installation. Please view the individual ones for further details on each.

| `status`
| `object`
| status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.

| `clusterNetwork[]`
| `object`
| ClusterNetworkEntry is a contiguous block of IP addresses from which pod IPs are allocated.

| `externalIP`
| `object`
| externalIP defines configuration for controllers that affect Service.ExternalIP. If nil, then ExternalIP is not allowed to be set.

| `networkDiagnostics`
| `object`
| networkDiagnostics defines network diagnostics configuration. 
 Takes precedence over spec.disableNetworkDiagnostics in network.operator.openshift.io. If networkDiagnostics is not specified or is empty, and the spec.disableNetworkDiagnostics flag in network.operator.openshift.io is set to true, the network diagnostics feature will be disabled.

| `networkType`
| `string`
| NetworkType is the plugin that is to be deployed (e.g. OVNKubernetes). This should match a value that the cluster-network-operator understands, or else no networking will be installed. Currently supported values are: - OVNKubernetes This field is immutable after installation.

| `array (string)`
| IP address pool for services. Currently, we only support a single entry here. This field is immutable after installation.

| `serviceNodePortRange`
| `string`

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`

| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. --- Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
