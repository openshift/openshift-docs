Description::
  APIServer holds configuration (like serving certificates, client CA and CORS domains) shared by all API servers in the system, among them especially kube-apiserver and openshift-apiserver. The canonical name of an instance is &#x27;cluster&#x27;.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| spec holds user settable values for configuration

| `.status`
| `object`
| status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `additionalCORSAllowedOrigins`
| `array (string)`
| additionalCORSAllowedOrigins lists additional, user-defined regular expressions describing hosts for which the API server allows access using the CORS headers. This may be needed to access the API and the integrated OAuth server from JavaScript applications. The values are regular expressions that correspond to the Golang regular expression language.

| `clientCA`
| `object`
| clientCA references a ConfigMap containing a certificate bundle for the signers that will be recognized for incoming client certificates in addition to the operator managed signers. If this is empty, then only operator managed signers are valid. You usually only have to set this if you have your own PKI you wish to honor client certificates from. The ConfigMap must exist in the openshift-config namespace and contain the following required fields: - ConfigMap.Data["ca-bundle.crt"] - CA bundle.

| `encryption`
| `object`
| encryption allows the configuration of encryption of resources at the datastore layer.

| `servingCerts`
| `object`
| servingCert is the TLS cert info for serving secure traffic. If not specified, operator managed certificates will be used for serving secure traffic.

| `tlsSecurityProfile`
| `object`
| tlsSecurityProfile specifies settings for TLS connections for externally exposed servers. 
 If unset, a default (which may change between releases) is chosen. Note that only Old and Intermediate profiles are currently supported, and the maximum available MinTLSVersions is VersionTLS12.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `type`
| `string`
| type defines what encryption type should be used to encrypt resources at the datastore layer. When this field is unset (i.e. when it is set to the empty string), identity is implied. The behavior of unset can and will change over time.  Even if encryption is enabled by default, the meaning of unset may change to a different encryption type based on changes in best practices. 
 When encryption is enabled, all sensitive resources shipped with the platform are encrypted. This list of sensitive resources can and will change over time.  The current authoritative list is: 
   1. secrets   2. configmaps   3. routes.route.openshift.io   4. oauthaccesstokens.oauth.openshift.io   5. oauthauthorizetokens.oauth.openshift.io

| `type`
| `string`
| type is one of Old, Intermediate, Modern or Custom. Custom provides the ability to specify individual TLS security profile parameters. Old, Intermediate and Modern are TLS security profiles based on: 
 https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations 
 The profiles are intent based, so they may change over time as new ciphers are developed and existing ciphers are found to be insecure.  Depending on precisely which ciphers are available to a process, the list may be reduced. 
 Note that the Modern profile is currently not supported because it is not yet well adopted by common software libraries.

.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it&#x27;s 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
