== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec is the desired state of the cluster version - the operator will work to ensure that the desired version is applied to the cluster.

| `status`
| `object`
| status contains information about the available updates and any in-progress updates.

| `capabilities`
| `object`
| capabilities configures the installation of optional, core cluster components.  A null value here is identical to an empty object; see the child properties for default semantics.

| `channel`
| `string`
| channel is an identifier for explicitly requesting that a non-default set of updates be applied to this cluster. The default channel will be contain stable updates that are appropriate for production clusters.

| `clusterID`
| `string`
| clusterID uniquely identifies this cluster. This is expected to be an RFC4122 UUID value (xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx in hexadecimal values). This is a required field.

| `desiredUpdate`
| `object`
| desiredUpdate is an optional field that indicates the desired value of the cluster version. Setting this value will trigger an upgrade (if the current version does not match the desired version). The set of recommended update values is listed as part of available updates in status, and setting values outside that range may cause the upgrade to fail.
 Some of the fields are inter-related with restrictions and meanings described here. 1. image is specified, version is specified, architecture is specified. API validation error. 2. image is specified, version is specified, architecture is not specified. You should not do this. version is silently ignored and image is used. 3. image is specified, version is not specified, architecture is specified. API validation error. 4. image is specified, version is not specified, architecture is not specified. image is used. 5. image is not specified, version is specified, architecture is specified. version and desired architecture are used to select an image. 6. image is not specified, version is specified, architecture is not specified. version and current architecture are used to select an image. 7. image is not specified, version is not specified, architecture is specified. API validation error. 8. image is not specified, version is not specified, architecture is not specified. API validation error.
 If an upgrade fails the operator will halt and report status about the failing component. Setting the desired update value back to the previous version will cause a rollback to be attempted. Not all rollbacks will succeed.

| `overrides`
| `array`
| overrides is list of overides for components that are managed by cluster version operator. Marking a component unmanaged will prevent the operator from creating or updating the object.

| `overrides[]`
| `object`
| ComponentOverride allows overriding cluster version operator's behavior for a component.

.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `sendInitialEvents`
| `boolean`
| `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
  when request started being processed.
- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
  Invalid error is returned.

Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
