=== .spec.identityProviders[].requestHeader.ca
Description::
+
--
ca is a required reference to a config map by name containing the PEM-encoded CA bundle. It is used as a trust anchor to validate the TLS certificate presented by the remote server. Specifically, it allows verification of incoming requests to prevent header spoofing. The key "ca.crt" is used to locate the data. If the config map or expected key is not found, the identity provider is not honored. If the specified ca data is not valid, the identity provider is not honored. The namespace for this config map is openshift-config.

| `accessTokenInactivityTimeout`
| `string`
| accessTokenInactivityTimeout defines the token inactivity timeout for tokens granted by any client. The value represents the maximum amount of time that can occur between consecutive uses of the token. Tokens become invalid if they are not used within this temporal window. The user will need to acquire a new token to regain access once a token times out. Takes valid time duration string such as "5m", "1.5h" or "2h45m". The minimum allowed value for duration is 300s (5 minutes). If the timeout is configured per client, then that value takes precedence. If the timeout value is not specified and the client does not override the value, then tokens are valid until their lifetime. 
 WARNING: existing tokens' timeout will not be affected (lowered) by changing this value

| `accessTokenInactivityTimeoutSeconds`

| accessTokenInactivityTimeoutSeconds - DEPRECATED: setting this field has no effect.

| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
