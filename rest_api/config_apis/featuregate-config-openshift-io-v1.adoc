--
Feature holds cluster-wide information about feature gates.  The canonical name is `cluster` 
 Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec holds user settable values for configuration

| `status`
| `object`
| status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `customNoUpgrade`
| ``
| customNoUpgrade allows the enabling or disabling of any feature. Turning this feature set on IS NOT SUPPORTED, CANNOT BE UNDONE, and PREVENTS UPGRADES. Because of its nature, this setting cannot be validated.  If you have any typos or accidentally apply invalid combinations your cluster may fail in an unrecoverable way.  featureSet must equal "CustomNoUpgrade" must be set to use this field.

| `featureSet`
| `string`
| featureSet changes the list of features in the cluster.  The default is empty.  Be very careful adjusting this setting. Turning on or off features may cause irreversible changes in your cluster which cannot be undone.

=== .status
Description::

status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `conditions`
| `array`
| conditions represent the observations of the current state. Known .status.conditions.type are: "DeterminationDegraded"

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource. --- This struct is intended for direct use as an array at the field path .status.conditions.  For example, 
 type FooStatus struct{ // Represents the observations of a foo's current state. // Known .status.conditions.type are: "Available", "Progressing", and "Degraded" // +patchMergeKey=type // +patchStrategy=merge // +listType=map // +listMapKey=type Conditions []metav1.Condition `json:"conditions,omitempty" patchStrategy:"merge" patchMergeKey:"type" protobuf:"bytes,1,rep,name=conditions"` 
 // other fields }

| `featureGates`
| `array`
| featureGates contains a list of enabled and disabled featureGates that are keyed by payloadVersion. Operators other than the CVO and cluster-config-operator, must read the .status.featureGates, locate the version they are managing, find the enabled/disabled featuregates and make the operand and operator match. The enabled/disabled values for a particular version may change during the life of the cluster as various .spec.featureSet values are selected. Operators may choose to restart their processes to pick up these changes, but remembering past enable/disable lists is beyond the scope of this API and is the responsibility of individual operators. Only featureGates with .version in the ClusterVersion.status will be present in this list.

  - `lastTransitionTime`

  - `status`
  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This may be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field may not be empty.

| `status`
| `string`
| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. --- Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important. The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
