== Binding [core/v1]


Description::
  Binding ties one object to another; for example, a pod is bound to a node by a scheduler. Deprecated in 1.7, please use the bindings subresource of pods instead.

Type::
  `object`

The following table describes the parameters for the `Binding` object:

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.`
| object
| Binding ties one object to another; for example, a pod is bound to a node by a scheduler. Deprecated in 1.7, please use the bindings subresource of pods instead.

| `.apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| string
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| object
| ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.

| `.metadata.annotations`
| object (string)
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

| `.metadata.clusterName`
| string
| The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.

| `.metadata.creationTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.deletionGracePeriodSeconds`
| integer
| Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.

| `.metadata.deletionTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.finalizers`
| array (string)
| Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

| `.metadata.generateName`
| string
| GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency

| `.metadata.generation`
| integer
| A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.

| `.metadata.labels`
| object (string)
| Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels

| `.metadata.managedFields`
| array
| ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

| `.metadata.managedFields[]`
| object
| ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsType`
| string
| FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsV1`
| object
| FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

| `.metadata.managedFields[].manager`
| string
| Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].operation`
| string
| Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].time`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.name`
| string
| Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

| `.metadata.namespace`
| string
| Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

| `.metadata.ownerReferences`
| array
| List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[]`
| object
| OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an owning object. An owning object must be in the same namespace as the dependent, or be cluster-scoped, so there is no namespace field.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].apiVersion`
| string
| API version of the referent.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].blockOwnerDeletion`
| boolean
| If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].controller`
| boolean
| If true, this reference points to the managing controller.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].kind`
| string
| Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].name`
| string
| Name of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].uid`
| string
| UID of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

| `.metadata.resourceVersion`
| string
| An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

| `.metadata.selfLink`
| string
| SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.

DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.

| `.metadata.uid`
| string
| UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

| `.target`
| object
| ObjectReference contains enough information to let you inspect or modify the referred object.

| `.target.apiVersion`
| string
| API version of the referent.

| `.target.fieldPath`
| string
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.

| `.target.kind`
| string
| Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.target.name`
| string
| Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names

| `.target.namespace`
| string
| Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/

| `.target.resourceVersion`
| string
| Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

    },
 ]

Type::
  `object`

The following table describes the parameters for the `Endpoints` object:

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.`
| object
| Endpoints is a collection of endpoints that implement the actual service. Example:
  Name: "mysvc",
  Subsets: [
    {
      Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.1.1"}, {"ip": "10.10.2.2"}],
      Ports: [{"name": "a", "port": 8675}, {"name": "b", "port": 309}]
    },
    {
      Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.3.3"}],
      Ports: [{"name": "a", "port": 93}, {"name": "b", "port": 76}]
    },
 ]

| `.apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| string
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| object
| ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.

| `.metadata.annotations`
| object (string)
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

| `.metadata.clusterName`
| string
| The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.

| `.metadata.creationTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.deletionGracePeriodSeconds`
| integer
| Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.

| `.metadata.deletionTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.finalizers`
| array (string)
| Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

| `.metadata.generateName`
| string
| GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency

| `.metadata.managedFields`
| array
| ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

| `.metadata.managedFields[]`
| object
| ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsType`
| string
| FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsV1`
| object
| FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

| `.metadata.managedFields[].manager`

| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.name`
| string
| Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

| `.metadata.namespace`
| string
| Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

| `.metadata.ownerReferences`
| array
| List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[]`

| string
| UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

| `.subsets`
| array
| The set of all endpoints is the union of all subsets. Addresses are placed into subsets according to the IPs they share. A single address with multiple ports, some of which are ready and some of which are not (because they come from different containers) will result in the address being displayed in different subsets for the different ports. No address will appear in both Addresses and NotReadyAddresses in the same subset. Sets of addresses and ports that comprise a service.

| `.subsets[]`
| object
| EndpointSubset is a group of addresses with a common set of ports. The expanded set of endpoints is the Cartesian product of Addresses x Ports. For example, given:
  {
    Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.1.1"}, {"ip": "10.10.2.2"}],
    Ports:     [{"name": "a", "port": 8675}, {"name": "b", "port": 309}]
  }
The resulting set of endpoints can be viewed as:
    a: [ 10.10.1.1:8675, 10.10.2.2:8675 ],
    b: [ 10.10.1.1:309, 10.10.2.2:309 ]

| `.subsets[].addresses[].nodeName`
| string
| Optional: Node hosting this endpoint. This can be used to determine endpoints local to a node.

| ObjectReference contains enough information to let you inspect or modify the referred object.

| `.subsets[].addresses[].targetRef.apiVersion`
| string
| API version of the referent.

| `.subsets[].addresses[].targetRef.fieldPath`
| string
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.

The following table describes the parameters for the `LimitRange` object:

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.`
| object
| LimitRange sets resource usage limits for each kind of resource in a Namespace.

| `.apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| string
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| object
| ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.

| `.metadata.annotations`
| object (string)
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

| `.metadata.clusterName`
| string
| The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.

| `.metadata.creationTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.deletionGracePeriodSeconds`
| integer
| Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.

| `.metadata.deletionTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.finalizers`
| array (string)
| Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

| `.metadata.generateName`
| string
| GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency

The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

| `.metadata.managedFields[]`
| object
| ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.

| string
| FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsV1`
| object
| FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

| Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

| `.metadata.clusterName`
| string
| The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.

| `.metadata.finalizers`
| array (string)
| Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

| `.metadata.generateName`
| string
| GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

Description::
  PersistentVolume (PV) is a storage resource provisioned by an administrator. It is analogous to a node. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes

Type::
  `object`

The following table describes the parameters for the `PersistentVolume` object:

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.`
| object
| PersistentVolume (PV) is a storage resource provisioned by an administrator. It is analogous to a node. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes

| `.apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| string
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| object
| ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.

| `.metadata.annotations`
| object (string)
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

| `.metadata.clusterName`
| string
| The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.

| `.metadata.creationTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.deletionGracePeriodSeconds`
| integer
| Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.

| `.metadata.deletionTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.finalizers`
| array (string)
| Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

| `.metadata.generateName`
| string
| GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency

| `.metadata.generation`
| integer
| A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.

| `.metadata.labels`
| object (string)
| Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels

| `.metadata.managedFields`
| array
| ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

| `.metadata.managedFields[]`
| object
| ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsType`
| string
| FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsV1`
| object
| FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

| `.metadata.managedFields[].manager`
| string
| Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].operation`

| `.metadata.namespace`
| string
| Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].apiVersion`
| string
| API version of the referent.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].blockOwnerDeletion`
| boolean
| If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].controller`
| boolean
| If true, this reference points to the managing controller.

=== Operations


== Pod [core/v1]


Description::
  Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is created by clients and scheduled onto hosts.

Type::
  `object`

The following table describes the parameters for the `Pod` object:

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.`
| object
| Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is created by clients and scheduled onto hosts.

| `.apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| string
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| object
| ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.

| `.metadata.annotations`
| object (string)
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

| `.metadata.clusterName`
| string
| The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.

| `.metadata.creationTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.deletionGracePeriodSeconds`
| integer
| Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.

| `.metadata.deletionTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.finalizers`
| array (string)
| Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

| `.metadata.generateName`
| string
| GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency

| `.metadata.generation`
| integer
| A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.

| `.metadata.managedFields`
| array
| ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

| `.metadata.managedFields[]`
| object
| ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsType`
| string
| FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsV1`
| object
| FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

| `.metadata.managedFields[].manager`
| string
| Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].operation`

Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

| `.metadata.namespace`
| string
| Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

| `.metadata.ownerReferences`
| array
| List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[]`
| object
| OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an owning object. An owning object must be in the same namespace as the dependent, or be cluster-scoped, so there is no namespace field.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].apiVersion`
| string
| API version of the referent.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].blockOwnerDeletion`
| boolean
| If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].controller`
| boolean
| If true, this reference points to the managing controller.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].kind`
| string

| `.metadata.resourceVersion`
| string
| An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

| TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. It's a required field.

| `.spec.topologySpreadConstraints[].whenUnsatisfiable`
| string
| WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to still schedule it It's considered as "Unsatisfiable" if and only if placing incoming pod on any topology violates "MaxSkew". For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: \| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \| \| P P P \|   P   \|   P   \| If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

| string
| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting. Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod.

Description::
  PodTemplate describes a template for creating copies of a predefined pod.

Type::
  `object`

The following table describes the parameters for the `PodTemplate` object:

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.`
| object
| PodTemplate describes a template for creating copies of a predefined pod.

| `.apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| string
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| object
| ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.

| `.metadata.annotations`
| object (string)
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

| `.metadata.clusterName`
| string
| The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.

| `.metadata.creationTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.deletionGracePeriodSeconds`
| integer
| Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.

| `.metadata.deletionTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.finalizers`
| array (string)
| Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

| `.metadata.generateName`
| string
| GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency

| `.metadata.generation`
| integer
| A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.

| `.metadata.labels`
| object (string)
| Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels

| `.metadata.managedFields`
| array
| ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

| `.metadata.managedFields[]`
| object
| ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsType`
| string
| FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsV1`
| object
| FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

| `.metadata.namespace`
| string
| Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

| string
| API version of the referent.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].blockOwnerDeletion`
| boolean
| If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.

| boolean
| If true, this reference points to the managing controller.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].kind`

| string
| UID of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

| `.metadata.resourceVersion`
| string
| An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

| `.template.spec.ephemeralContainers`
| array
| List of ephemeral containers run in this pod. Ephemeral containers may be run in an existing pod to perform user-initiated actions such as debugging. This list cannot be specified when creating a pod, and it cannot be modified by updating the pod spec. In order to add an ephemeral container to an existing pod, use the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the EphemeralContainers feature.

| `.template.spec.ephemeralContainers[]`
| object
| An EphemeralContainer is a container that may be added temporarily to an existing pod for user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a pod is removed or restarted. If an ephemeral container causes a pod to exceed its resource allocation, the pod may be evicted. Ephemeral containers may not be added by directly updating the pod spec. They must be added via the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource, and they will appear in the pod spec once added. This is an alpha feature enabled by the EphemeralContainers feature flag.

| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

| `.template.spec.shareProcessNamespace`
| boolean
| Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set. Optional: Default to false.

| `.template.spec.subdomain`
| string
| If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be "<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>". If not specified, the pod will not have a domainname at all.

| `.template.spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds`

If this value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.

| `.template.spec.tolerations`
| array
| If specified, the pod's tolerations.

| `.template.spec.tolerations[].key`
| string
| Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

| `.template.spec.tolerations[].operator`
| string
| Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

| `.template.spec.tolerations[].tolerationSeconds`
| integer
| TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

| `.template.spec.tolerations[].value`
| string
| Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

| `.template.spec.topologySpreadConstraints`
| array

| object
| TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread matching pods among the given topology.

| `.template.spec.topologySpreadConstraints[].labelSelector`

| array (string)
| values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.

| `.template.spec.topologySpreadConstraints[].labelSelector.matchLabels`
| object (string)
| matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

| `.template.spec.topologySpreadConstraints[].maxSkew`
| integer
| MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. It's the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in any two topology domains of a given topology type. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 1/1/0: \| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \| \|   P   \|   P   \|       \| - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

| `.template.spec.topologySpreadConstraints[].topologyKey`
| string
| TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. It's a required field.

| `.template.spec.topologySpreadConstraints[].whenUnsatisfiable`
| string
| WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to still schedule it It's considered as "Unsatisfiable" if and only if placing incoming pod on any topology violates "MaxSkew". For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: \| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \| \| P P P \|   P   \|   P   \| If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

| string
| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

| string
| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

== ReplicationController [core/v1]


Description::
  ReplicationController represents the configuration of a replication controller.

Type::
  `object`

The following table describes the parameters for the `ReplicationController` object:

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.`
| object
| ReplicationController represents the configuration of a replication controller.

| `.apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| string
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| object
| ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.

| `.metadata.annotations`
| object (string)
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

| `.metadata.clusterName`
| string
| The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.

| `.metadata.creationTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.deletionGracePeriodSeconds`
| integer
| Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.

| `.metadata.deletionTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.finalizers`
| array (string)
| Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

| `.metadata.generateName`
| string
| GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

| `.metadata.managedFields`
| array
| ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

| `.metadata.managedFields[]`
| object
| ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsType`
| string
| FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsV1`
| object
| FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

| `.metadata.managedFields[].manager`
| string
| Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.

Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

| `.metadata.namespace`
| string
| Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

| API version of the referent.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].blockOwnerDeletion`
| boolean
| If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.

| string
| An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

| `.metadata.selfLink`

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

| `.spec`
| object
| ReplicationControllerSpec is the specification of a replication controller.

| `.spec.minReadySeconds`

| `.spec.replicas`
| integer
| Replicas is the number of desired replicas. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and unspecified. Defaults to 1. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller#what-is-a-replicationcontroller

| `.spec.selector`
| object (string)
| Selector is a label query over pods that should match the Replicas count. If Selector is empty, it is defaulted to the labels present on the Pod template. Label keys and values that must match in order to be controlled by this replication controller, if empty defaulted to labels on Pod template. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors

| `.spec.template`
| object
| PodTemplateSpec describes the data a pod should have when created from a template

| `.spec.template.metadata`
| object
| ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.

| `.spec.template.metadata.annotations`
| object (string)
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

| `.spec.template.metadata.deletionTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.spec.template.metadata.finalizers`
| array (string)
| Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: \| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \| \| P P P \|   P   \|   P   \| If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

| Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> \| <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> \| <digits>.<digits> \| <digits>. \| .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" \| "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> \| <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> \| <decimalExponent> \| <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m \| "" \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> \| "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

== ResourceQuota [core/v1]


Description::
  ResourceQuota sets aggregate quota restrictions enforced per namespace

Type::
  `object`

The following table describes the parameters for the `ResourceQuota` object:

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.`
| object
| ResourceQuota sets aggregate quota restrictions enforced per namespace

| `.apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| string
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| object
| ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.

| `.metadata.annotations`
| object (string)
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

| `.metadata.clusterName`
| string
| The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.

| `.metadata.creationTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.deletionGracePeriodSeconds`
| integer
| Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.

| `.metadata.deletionTimestamp`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.finalizers`
| array (string)
| Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

| `.metadata.generateName`
| string
| GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency

| `.metadata.generation`
| integer
| A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.

| `.metadata.labels`
| object (string)
| Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels

| `.metadata.managedFields`
| array
| ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

| `.metadata.managedFields[]`
| object
| ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsType`
| string
| FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsV1`
| object
| FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

| `.metadata.managedFields[].manager`
| string
| Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].operation`
| string
| Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].time`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.name`
| string
| Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

| `.metadata.namespace`
| string
| Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

| `.metadata.ownerReferences`
| array
| List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[]`
| object
| OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an owning object. An owning object must be in the same namespace as the dependent, or be cluster-scoped, so there is no namespace field.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].apiVersion`
| string
| API version of the referent.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].blockOwnerDeletion`
| boolean
| If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].controller`
| boolean
| If true, this reference points to the managing controller.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].kind`

If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

| `.metadata.managedFields`
| array
| ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field.

The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

| `.metadata.managedFields[]`
| object
| ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.

| string
| FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsV1`
| object
| FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

| API version of the referent.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].blockOwnerDeletion`
| boolean
| If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.

If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency

| `.metadata.generation`
| integer
| A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.

| `.metadata.labels`
| object (string)
| Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels

| `.metadata.managedFields`
| array
| ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

| `.metadata.managedFields[]`
| object
| ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].apiVersion`
| string
| APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsType`
| string
| FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"

| `.metadata.managedFields[].fieldsV1`
| object
| FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

| `.metadata.managedFields[].manager`
| string
| Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].operation`
| string
| Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.

| `.metadata.managedFields[].time`
| string
| Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

| `.metadata.name`
| string
| Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

| `.metadata.namespace`
| string
| Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

| `.metadata.ownerReferences`
| array
| List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[]`
| object
| OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an owning object. An owning object must be in the same namespace as the dependent, or be cluster-scoped, so there is no namespace field.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].apiVersion`
| string
| API version of the referent.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].blockOwnerDeletion`
| boolean
| If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].controller`
| boolean
| If true, this reference points to the managing controller.

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].kind`
| string
| Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].name`
| string
| Name of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

| `.metadata.ownerReferences[].uid`
| string
| UID of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

| `.metadata.resourceVersion`
| string
| An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

| `.metadata.selfLink`
| string
| SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.

DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.

| `.metadata.uid`
| string
| UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

| `.spec`
| object
| ServiceSpec describes the attributes that a user creates on a service.

| `.spec.clusterIP`
| string
| clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned randomly by the master. If an address is specified manually and is not in use by others, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise, creation of the service will fail. This field can not be changed through updates. Valid values are "None", empty string (""), or a valid IP address. "None" can be specified for headless services when proxying is not required. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is ExternalName. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies

| `.spec.externalIPs`
| array (string)
| externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes.  The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes system.

| `.spec.externalName`
| string
| externalName is the external reference that kubedns or equivalent will return as a CNAME record for this service. No proxying will be involved. Must be a valid RFC-1123 hostname (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires Type to be ExternalName.

| `.spec.externalTrafficPolicy`
| string
| externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. "Local" preserves the client source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer and Nodeport type services, but risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading. "Cluster" obscures the client source IP and may cause a second hop to another node, but should have good overall load-spreading.

| `.spec.healthCheckNodePort`
| integer
| healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service. If not specified, HealthCheckNodePort is created by the service api backend with the allocated nodePort. Will use user-specified nodePort value if specified by the client. Only effects when Type is set to LoadBalancer and ExternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local.

| `.spec.ipFamily`
| string
| ipFamily specifies whether this Service has a preference for a particular IP family (e.g. IPv4 vs. IPv6).  If a specific IP family is requested, the clusterIP field will be allocated from that family, if it is available in the cluster.  If no IP family is requested, the cluster's primary IP family will be used. Other IP fields (loadBalancerIP, loadBalancerSourceRanges, externalIPs) and controllers which allocate external load-balancers should use the same IP family.  Endpoints for this Service will be of this family.  This field is immutable after creation. Assigning a ServiceIPFamily not available in the cluster (e.g. IPv6 in IPv4 only cluster) is an error condition and will fail during clusterIP assignment.

| `.spec.loadBalancerIP`
| string
| Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer LoadBalancer will get created with the IP specified in this field. This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.

| `.spec.loadBalancerSourceRanges`
| array (string)
| If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature." More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-cloud-provider-firewall/

| `.spec.ports`
| array
| The list of ports that are exposed by this service. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies

| `.spec.ports[]`
| object
| ServicePort contains information on service's port.

| `.spec.ports[].name`
| string
| The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL. All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering the endpoints for a Service, this must match the 'name' field in the EndpointPort. Optional if only one ServicePort is defined on this service.

| `.spec.ports[].nodePort`
| integer
| The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type=NodePort or LoadBalancer. Usually assigned by the system. If specified, it will be allocated to the service if unused or else creation of the service will fail. Default is to auto-allocate a port if the ServiceType of this Service requires one. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport

| `.spec.ports[].port`
| integer
| The port that will be exposed by this service.

| `.spec.ports[].protocol`
| string
| The IP protocol for this port. Supports "TCP", "UDP", and "SCTP". Default is TCP.

| `.spec.ports[].targetPort`
| string
| IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.

| `.spec.publishNotReadyAddresses`
| boolean
| publishNotReadyAddresses, when set to true, indicates that DNS implementations must publish the notReadyAddresses of subsets for the Endpoints associated with the Service. The default value is false. The primary use case for setting this field is to use a StatefulSet's Headless Service to propagate SRV records for its Pods without respect to their readiness for purpose of peer discovery.

| `.spec.selector`
| object (string)
| Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching this selector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have an external process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will not modify. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is ExternalName. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/

| `.spec.sessionAffinity`
| string
| Supports "ClientIP" and "None". Used to maintain session affinity. Enable client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to None. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies

| `.spec.sessionAffinityConfig`
| object
| SessionAffinityConfig represents the configurations of session affinity.

| `.spec.sessionAffinityConfig.clientIP`
| object
| ClientIPConfig represents the configurations of Client IP based session affinity.

| `.spec.sessionAffinityConfig.clientIP.timeoutSeconds`
| integer
| timeoutSeconds specifies the seconds of ClientIP type session sticky time. The value must be >0 && <=86400(for 1 day) if ServiceAffinity == "ClientIP". Default value is 10800(for 3 hours).

| `.spec.topologyKeys`
| array (string)
| topologyKeys is a preference-order list of topology keys which implementations of services should use to preferentially sort endpoints when accessing this Service, it can not be used at the same time as externalTrafficPolicy=Local. Topology keys must be valid label keys and at most 16 keys may be specified. Endpoints are chosen based on the first topology key with available backends. If this field is specified and all entries have no backends that match the topology of the client, the service has no backends for that client and connections should fail. The special value "*" may be used to mean "any topology". This catch-all value, if used, only makes sense as the last value in the list. If this is not specified or empty, no topology constraints will be applied.

| `.spec.type`
| string
| type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. "ExternalName" maps to the specified externalName. "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the clusterIP. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types

| `.status`
| object
| ServiceStatus represents the current status of a service.

| `.status.loadBalancer`
| object
| LoadBalancerStatus represents the status of a load-balancer.

| `.status.loadBalancer.ingress`
| array
| Ingress is a list containing ingress points for the load-balancer. Traffic intended for the service should be sent to these ingress points.

| `.status.loadBalancer.ingress[]`
| object
| LoadBalancerIngress represents the status of a load-balancer ingress point: traffic intended for the service should be sent to an ingress point.

| `.status.loadBalancer.ingress[].hostname`
| string
| Hostname is set for load-balancer ingress points that are DNS based (typically AWS load-balancers)

| `.status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip`
| string
| IP is set for load-balancer ingress points that are IP based (typically GCE or OpenStack load-balancers)
