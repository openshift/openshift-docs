Description::
  CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509 certificates by submitting a certificate signing request, and having it asynchronously approved and issued.

Kubelets use this API to obtain:
 1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet" signerName).
 2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely (with the "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" signerName).

This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client" signerName), or to obtain certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| 

| `.spec`
| `object`
| CertificateSigningRequestSpec contains the certificate request.

| `.status`
| `object`

| 

| `groups`
| `array (string)`
| groups contains group membership of the user that created the CertificateSigningRequest. Populated by the API server on creation and immutable.

| `request`
| `string`
| request contains an x509 certificate signing request encoded in a "CERTIFICATE REQUEST" PEM block. When serialized as JSON or YAML, the data is additionally base64-encoded.

| `signerName`
| `string`
| signerName indicates the requested signer, and is a qualified name.

List/watch requests for CertificateSigningRequests can filter on this field using a "spec.signerName=NAME" fieldSelector.

Well-known Kubernetes signers are:
 1. "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client": issues client certificates that can be used to authenticate to kube-apiserver.
  Requests for this signer are never auto-approved by kube-controller-manager, can be issued by the "csrsigning" controller in kube-controller-manager.
 2. "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet": issues client certificates that kubelets use to authenticate to kube-apiserver.
  Requests for this signer can be auto-approved by the "csrapproving" controller in kube-controller-manager, and can be issued by the "csrsigning" controller in kube-controller-manager.
 3. "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" issues serving certificates that kubelets use to serve TLS endpoints, which kube-apiserver can connect to securely.
  Requests for this signer are never auto-approved by kube-controller-manager, and can be issued by the "csrsigning" controller in kube-controller-manager.

More details are available at https://k8s.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#kubernetes-signers

Custom signerNames can also be specified. The signer defines:
 1. Trust distribution: how trust (CA bundles) are distributed.
 2. Permitted subjects: and behavior when a disallowed subject is requested.
 3. Required, permitted, or forbidden x509 extensions in the request (including whether subjectAltNames are allowed, which types, restrictions on allowed values) and behavior when a disallowed extension is requested.
 4. Required, permitted, or forbidden key usages / extended key usages.
 5. Expiration/certificate lifetime: whether it is fixed by the signer, configurable by the admin.
 6. Whether or not requests for CA certificates are allowed.

| `uid`
| `string`
| uid contains the uid of the user that created the CertificateSigningRequest. Populated by the API server on creation and immutable.

| `usages`
| `array (string)`
| usages specifies a set of key usages requested in the issued certificate.

Requests for TLS client certificates typically request: "digital signature", "key encipherment", "client auth".

Requests for TLS serving certificates typically request: "key encipherment", "digital signature", "server auth".

Valid values are:
 "signing", "digital signature", "content commitment",
 "key encipherment", "key agreement", "data encipherment",
 "cert sign", "crl sign", "encipher only", "decipher only", "any",
 "server auth", "client auth",
 "code signing", "email protection", "s/mime",
 "ipsec end system", "ipsec tunnel", "ipsec user",
 "timestamping", "ocsp signing", "microsoft sgc", "netscape sgc"

| `username`
| `string`
| username contains the name of the user that created the CertificateSigningRequest. Populated by the API server on creation and immutable.

|===
..spec.extra
Description::
  extra contains extra attributes of the user that created the CertificateSigningRequest. Populated by the API server on creation and immutable.

Type::
  `object`




..status
Description::
  CertificateSigningRequestStatus contains conditions used to indicate approved/denied/failed status of the request, and the issued certificate.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `certificate`
| `string`
| certificate is populated with an issued certificate by the signer after an Approved condition is present. This field is set via the /status subresource. Once populated, this field is immutable.

If the certificate signing request is denied, a condition of type "Denied" is added and this field remains empty. If the signer cannot issue the certificate, a condition of type "Failed" is added and this field remains empty.

Validation requirements:
 1. certificate must contain one or more PEM blocks.
 2. All PEM blocks must have the "CERTIFICATE" label, contain no headers, and the encoded data
  must be a BER-encoded ASN.1 Certificate structure as described in section 4 of RFC5280.
 3. Non-PEM content may appear before or after the "CERTIFICATE" PEM blocks and is unvalidated,
  to allow for explanatory text as described in section 5.2 of RFC7468.

If more than one PEM block is present, and the definition of the requested spec.signerName does not indicate otherwise, the first block is the issued certificate, and subsequent blocks should be treated as intermediate certificates and presented in TLS handshakes.

The certificate is encoded in PEM format.

When serialized as JSON or YAML, the data is additionally base64-encoded, so it consists of:

    base64(
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    )

| `conditions`
| `array`
| conditions applied to the request. Known conditions are "Approved", "Denied", and "Failed".

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#time-meta-v1[`Time meta/v1`]
| lastTransitionTime is the time the condition last transitioned from one status to another. If unset, when a new condition type is added or an existing condition's status is changed, the server defaults this to the current time.

| `lastUpdateTime`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#time-meta-v1[`Time meta/v1`]
| lastUpdateTime is the time of the last update to this condition

| `message`
| `string`

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason indicates a brief reason for the request state

| `status`
| `string`
| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown. Approved, Denied, and Failed conditions may not be "False" or "Unknown".

| `type`
| `string`
| type of the condition. Known conditions are "Approved", "Denied", and "Failed".

An "Approved" condition is added via the /approval subresource, indicating the request was approved and should be issued by the signer.

A "Denied" condition is added via the /approval subresource, indicating the request was denied and should not be issued by the signer.

A "Failed" condition is added via the /status subresource, indicating the signer failed to issue the certificate.

Approved and Denied conditions are mutually exclusive. Approved, Denied, and Failed conditions cannot be removed once added.

Only one condition of a given type is allowed.

.Global guery parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If &#x27;true&#x27;, then the output is pretty printed.
|===

HTTP method::
  `DELETE`

Description::
  delete collection of CertificateSigningRequest


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `gracePeriodSeconds`
| `integer`
| The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `orphanDependents`
| `boolean`
| Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the &quot;orphan&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object&#x27;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
| `propagationPolicy`
| `string`
| Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: &#x27;Orphan&#x27; - orphan the dependents; &#x27;Background&#x27; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; &#x27;Foreground&#x27; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize.
