== CertificateSigningRequest [certificates.k8s.io/v1]

Description::
  CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509 certificates by submitting a certificate signing request, and having it asynchronously approved and issued.

Kubelets use this API to obtain:
 1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet" signerName).
 2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely (with the "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" signerName).

This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client" signerName), or to obtain certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.

== PodSecurityPolicySelfSubjectReview [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
  PodSecurityPolicySelfSubjectReview checks whether this user/SA tuple can create the PodTemplateSpec

Type::

  RangeAllocation is used so we can easily expose a RangeAllocation typed for security group

Type::
  `object`

== Secret [core/v1]

Description::
  Secret holds secret data of a certain type. The total bytes of the values in the Data field must be less than MaxSecretSize bytes.

Type::

== SecurityContextConstraints [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
  SecurityContextConstraints governs the ability to make requests that affect the SecurityContext that will be applied to a container. For historical reasons SCC was exposed under the core Kubernetes API group. That exposure is deprecated and will be removed in a future release - users should instead use the security.openshift.io group to manage SecurityContextConstraints.

Type::
  `object`

== ServiceAccount [core/v1]

Description::
  ServiceAccount binds together: * a name, understood by users, and perhaps by peripheral systems, for an identity * a principal that can be authenticated and authorized * a set of secrets

Type::
