== CertificateSigningRequest [certificates.k8s.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509 certificates by submitting a certificate signing request, and having it asynchronously approved and issued.

Kubelets use this API to obtain:
 1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet" signerName).
 2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely (with the "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" signerName).

This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client" signerName), or to obtain certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.

  `object`

== CredentialsRequest [cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
CredentialsRequest is the Schema for the credentialsrequests API

Type::
  `object`

== PodSecurityPolicyReview [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
PodSecurityPolicyReview checks which service accounts (not users, since that would be cluster-wide) can create the `PodTemplateSpec` in question.

Compatibility level 2: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 9 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).
--

Type::
  `object`

== PodSecurityPolicySelfSubjectReview [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
PodSecurityPolicySelfSubjectReview checks whether this user/SA tuple can create the PodTemplateSpec

Compatibility level 2: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 9 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).
--

Type::
  `object`

== PodSecurityPolicySubjectReview [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
PodSecurityPolicySubjectReview checks whether a particular user/SA tuple can create the PodTemplateSpec.

Compatibility level 2: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 9 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).
--

Type::
  `object`

== RangeAllocation [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
RangeAllocation is used so we can easily expose a RangeAllocation typed for security group

Compatibility level 4: No compatibility is provided, the API can change at any point for any reason. These capabilities should not be used by applications needing long term support.
--

Type::
  `object`

== SharedSecret [sharedresource.openshift.io/v1alpha1]

Description::
+
--
SharedSecret allows a Secret to be shared across namespaces. Pods can mount the shared Secret by adding a CSI volume to the pod specification using the "csi.sharedresource.openshift.io" CSI driver and a reference to the SharedSecret in the volume attributes: 
 spec: volumes: - name: shared-secret csi: driver: csi.sharedresource.openshift.io volumeAttributes: sharedSecret: my-share 
 For the mount to be successful, the pod's service account must be granted permission to 'use' the named SharedSecret object within its namespace with an appropriate Role and RoleBinding. For compactness, here are example `oc` invocations for creating such Role and RoleBinding objects. 
 `oc create role shared-resource-my-share --verb=use --resource=sharedsecrets.sharedresource.openshift.io --resource-name=my-share` `oc create rolebinding shared-resource-my-share --role=shared-resource-my-share --serviceaccount=my-namespace:default` 
 Shared resource objects, in this case Secrets, have default permissions of list, get, and watch for system authenticated users. 
 Compatibility level 4: No compatibility is provided, the API can change at any point for any reason. These capabilities should not be used by applications needing long term support. These capabilities should not be used by applications needing long term support.

== Secret [v1]

Description::
+
--
Secret holds secret data of a certain type. The total bytes of the values in the Data field must be less than MaxSecretSize bytes.
--

Type::
  `object`

== SecurityContextConstraints [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
SecurityContextConstraints governs the ability to make requests that affect the SecurityContext that will be applied to a container. For historical reasons SCC was exposed under the core Kubernetes API group. That exposure is deprecated and will be removed in a future release - users should instead use the security.openshift.io group to manage SecurityContextConstraints. 
 Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).
--

Type::
  `object`

== ServiceAccount [v1]

Description::
+
--
ServiceAccount binds together: * a name, understood by users, and perhaps by peripheral systems, for an identity * a principal that can be authenticated and authorized * a set of secrets

Type::
  `object`
