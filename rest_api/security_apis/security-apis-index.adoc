== CertificateSigningRequest [certificates.k8s.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509 certificates by submitting a certificate signing request, and having it asynchronously approved and issued.

Kubelets use this API to obtain:
 1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet" signerName).
 2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely (with the "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" signerName).

This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client" signerName), or to obtain certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.

== PodSecurityPolicyReview [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
PodSecurityPolicyReview checks which service accounts (not users, since that would be cluster-wide) can create the `PodTemplateSpec` in question.

Compatibility level 2: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 9 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).
--

Type::
  `object`

== PodSecurityPolicySelfSubjectReview [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
PodSecurityPolicySelfSubjectReview checks whether this user/SA tuple can create the PodTemplateSpec

Compatibility level 2: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 9 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).
--

Type::
  `object`

== PodSecurityPolicySubjectReview [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
PodSecurityPolicySubjectReview checks whether a particular user/SA tuple can create the PodTemplateSpec.

Compatibility level 2: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 9 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).
--

Type::
  `object`

== RangeAllocation [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
RangeAllocation is used so we can easily expose a RangeAllocation typed for security group

Compatibility level 4: No compatibility is provided, the API can change at any point for any reason. These capabilities should not be used by applications needing long term support.
--

Type::
  `object`

== Secret [v1]

Description::
+
--
Secret holds secret data of a certain type. The total bytes of the values in the Data field must be less than MaxSecretSize bytes.
--

Type::
  `object`

== SecurityContextConstraints [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
SecurityContextConstraints governs the ability to make requests that affect the SecurityContext that will be applied to a container. For historical reasons SCC was exposed under the core Kubernetes API group. That exposure is deprecated and will be removed in a future release - users should instead use the security.openshift.io group to manage SecurityContextConstraints. 
 Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).
--

Type::
  `object`

== ServiceAccount [v1]

Description::
+
--
