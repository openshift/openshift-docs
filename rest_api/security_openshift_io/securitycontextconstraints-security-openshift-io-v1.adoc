Description::
  SecurityContextConstraints governs the ability to make requests that affect the SecurityContext that will be applied to a container. For historical reasons SCC was exposed under the core Kubernetes API group. That exposure is deprecated and will be removed in a future release - users should instead use the security.openshift.io group to manage SecurityContextConstraints.

== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.allowHostDirVolumePlugin`
| `boolean`
| AllowHostDirVolumePlugin determines if the policy allow containers to use the HostDir volume plugin

| `.allowHostIPC`
| `boolean`
| AllowHostIPC determines if the policy allows host ipc in the containers.

| `.allowHostNetwork`
| `boolean`
| AllowHostNetwork determines if the policy allows the use of HostNetwork in the pod spec.

| `.allowHostPID`
| `boolean`
| AllowHostPID determines if the policy allows host pid in the containers.

| `.allowHostPorts`
| `boolean`
| AllowHostPorts determines if the policy allows host ports in the containers.

| `.allowPrivilegeEscalation`
| `boolean`
| AllowPrivilegeEscalation determines if a pod can request to allow privilege escalation. If unspecified, defaults to true.

| `.allowPrivilegedContainer`
| `boolean`
| AllowPrivilegedContainer determines if a container can request to be run as privileged.

| `.allowedCapabilities`
| `array (string)`
| AllowedCapabilities is a list of capabilities that can be requested to add to the container. Capabilities in this field maybe added at the pod author's discretion. You must not list a capability in both AllowedCapabilities and RequiredDropCapabilities. To allow all capabilities you may use '*'.

| `.allowedFlexVolumes`
| `array`
| AllowedFlexVolumes is a whitelist of allowed Flexvolumes.  Empty or nil indicates that all Flexvolumes may be used.  This parameter is effective only when the usage of the Flexvolumes is allowed in the "Volumes" field.

| `.allowedFlexVolumes[]`
| `object`
| AllowedFlexVolume represents a single Flexvolume that is allowed to be used.

| `.allowedUnsafeSysctls`
| `array (string)`
| AllowedUnsafeSysctls is a list of explicitly allowed unsafe sysctls, defaults to none. Each entry is either a plain sysctl name or ends in "*" in which case it is considered as a prefix of allowed sysctls. Single * means all unsafe sysctls are allowed. Kubelet has to whitelist all allowed unsafe sysctls explicitly to avoid rejection.

Examples: e.g. "foo/*" allows "foo/bar", "foo/baz", etc. e.g. "foo.*" allows "foo.bar", "foo.baz", etc.

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.defaultAddCapabilities`
| `array (string)`
| DefaultAddCapabilities is the default set of capabilities that will be added to the container unless the pod spec specifically drops the capability.  You may not list a capabiility in both DefaultAddCapabilities and RequiredDropCapabilities.

| `.defaultAllowPrivilegeEscalation`
| `boolean`
| DefaultAllowPrivilegeEscalation controls the default setting for whether a process can gain more privileges than its parent process.

| `.forbiddenSysctls`
| `array (string)`
| ForbiddenSysctls is a list of explicitly forbidden sysctls, defaults to none. Each entry is either a plain sysctl name or ends in "*" in which case it is considered as a prefix of forbidden sysctls. Single * means all sysctls are forbidden.

Examples: e.g. "foo/*" forbids "foo/bar", "foo/baz", etc. e.g. "foo.*" forbids "foo.bar", "foo.baz", etc.

| `.fsGroup`
| `object`
| FSGroupStrategyOptions defines the strategy type and options used to create the strategy.

| `.groups`
| `array (string)`
| The groups that have permission to use this security context constraints

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: http://releases.k8s.io/HEAD/docs/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.priority`
| `integer`
| Priority influences the sort order of SCCs when evaluating which SCCs to try first for a given pod request based on access in the Users and Groups fields.  The higher the int, the higher priority. An unset value is considered a 0 priority. If scores for multiple SCCs are equal they will be sorted from most restrictive to least restrictive. If both priorities and restrictions are equal the SCCs will be sorted by name.

| `.readOnlyRootFilesystem`
| `boolean`
| ReadOnlyRootFilesystem when set to true will force containers to run with a read only root file system.  If the container specifically requests to run with a non-read only root file system the SCC should deny the pod. If set to false the container may run with a read only root file system if it wishes but it will not be forced to.

| `.requiredDropCapabilities`
| `array (string)`
| RequiredDropCapabilities are the capabilities that will be dropped from the container.  These are required to be dropped and cannot be added.

| `.runAsUser`
| `object`
| RunAsUserStrategyOptions defines the strategy type and any options used to create the strategy.

| `.seLinuxContext`
| `object`
| SELinuxContextStrategyOptions defines the strategy type and any options used to create the strategy.

| `.seccompProfiles`
| `array (string)`
| SeccompProfiles lists the allowed profiles that may be set for the pod or container's seccomp annotations.  An unset (nil) or empty value means that no profiles may be specifid by the pod or container.	The wildcard '*' may be used to allow all profiles.  When used to generate a value for a pod the first non-wildcard profile will be used as the default.

| `.supplementalGroups`
| `object`
| SupplementalGroupsStrategyOptions defines the strategy type and options used to create the strategy.

| `.users`
| `array (string)`
| The users who have permissions to use this security context constraints

| `.volumes`
| `array (string)`
| Volumes is a white list of allowed volume plugins.  FSType corresponds directly with the field names of a VolumeSource (azureFile, configMap, emptyDir).  To allow all volumes you may use "*". To allow no volumes, set to ["none"].

.Global guery parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If &#x27;true&#x27;, then the output is pretty printed.
|===

HTTP method::
  `DELETE`

Description::
  delete collection of SecurityContextConstraints


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `includeUninitialized`
| `boolean`
| If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it&#x27;s 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
