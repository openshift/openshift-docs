== Image [image.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
  Image is an immutable representation of a Docker image and metadata at a point in time.

Type::
  `object`

== ImageSignature [image.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
  ImageSignature holds a signature of an image. It allows to verify image identity and possibly other claims as long as the signature is trusted. Based on this information it is possible to restrict runnable images to those matching cluster-wide policy. Mandatory fields should be parsed by clients doing image verification. The others are parsed from signature's content by the server. They serve just an informative purpose.

Type::
  `object`

== ImageStreamImage [image.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
  ImageStreamImage represents an Image that is retrieved by image name from an ImageStream.

Type::
  `object`

== ImageStreamImport [image.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
  The image stream import resource provides an easy way for a user to find and import Docker images from other Docker registries into the server. Individual images or an entire image repository may be imported, and users may choose to see the results of the import prior to tagging the resulting images into the specified image stream.

This API is intended for end-user tools that need to see the metadata of the image prior to import (for instance, to generate an application from it). Clients that know the desired image can continue to create spec.tags directly into their image streams.

Type::
  `object`

== ImageStreamMapping [image.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
  ImageStreamMapping represents a mapping from a single tag to a Docker image as well as the reference to the Docker image stream the image came from.

Type::
  `object`

== ImageStream [image.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
  ImageStream stores a mapping of tags to images, metadata overrides that are applied when images are tagged in a stream, and an optional reference to a Docker image repository on a registry.

Type::
  `object`

== ImageStreamTag [image.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
  ImageStreamTag represents an Image that is retrieved by tag name from an ImageStream.

Type::
  `object`
