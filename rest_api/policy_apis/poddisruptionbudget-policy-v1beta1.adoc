--
PodDisruptionBudget is an object to define the max disruption that can be caused to a collection of pods
--

Type::
  `object`



== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| 

| `spec`
| `object`
| PodDisruptionBudgetSpec is a description of a PodDisruptionBudget.

| `status`
| `object`
| PodDisruptionBudgetStatus represents information about the status of a PodDisruptionBudget. Status may trail the actual state of a system.

|===
..spec
Description::
+
--
PodDisruptionBudgetSpec is a description of a PodDisruptionBudget.
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `maxUnavailable`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#intorstring-util-none[`IntOrString util/none`]
| An eviction is allowed if at most "maxUnavailable" pods selected by "selector" are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence of the evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "minAvailable".

| `minAvailable`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#intorstring-util-none[`IntOrString util/none`]
| An eviction is allowed if at least "minAvailable" pods selected by "selector" will still be available after the eviction, i.e. even in the absence of the evicted pod.  So for example you can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying "100%".

| `selector`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#labelselector-meta-v1[`LabelSelector meta/v1`]
| Label query over pods whose evictions are managed by the disruption budget. A null selector selects no pods. An empty selector ({}) also selects no pods, which differs from standard behavior of selecting all pods. In policy/v1, an empty selector will select all pods in the namespace.

|===
..status
Description::
+
--
PodDisruptionBudgetStatus represents information about the status of a PodDisruptionBudget. Status may trail the actual state of a system.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `disruptionsAllowed`
  - `currentHealthy`
  - `desiredHealthy`

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `conditions`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#condition-meta-v1[`array (Condition meta/v1)`]
| Conditions contain conditions for PDB. The disruption controller sets the DisruptionAllowed condition. The following are known values for the reason field (additional reasons could be added in the future): - SyncFailed: The controller encountered an error and wasn't able to compute
              the number of allowed disruptions. Therefore no disruptions are
              allowed and the status of the condition will be False.
- InsufficientPods: The number of pods are either at or below the number
                    required by the PodDisruptionBudget. No disruptions are
                    allowed and the status of the condition will be False.
- SufficientPods: There are more pods than required by the PodDisruptionBudget.
                  The condition will be True, and the number of allowed
                  disruptions are provided by the disruptionsAllowed property.

| `currentHealthy`
| `integer`
| current number of healthy pods

| `desiredHealthy`
| `integer`
| minimum desired number of healthy pods

| `disruptedPods`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#time-meta-v1[`object (Time meta/v1)`]
| DisruptedPods contains information about pods whose eviction was processed by the API server eviction subresource handler but has not yet been observed by the PodDisruptionBudget controller. A pod will be in this map from the time when the API server processed the eviction request to the time when the pod is seen by PDB controller as having been marked for deletion (or after a timeout). The key in the map is the name of the pod and the value is the time when the API server processed the eviction request. If the deletion didn't occur and a pod is still there it will be removed from the list automatically by PodDisruptionBudget controller after some time. If everything goes smooth this map should be empty for the most of the time. Large number of entries in the map may indicate problems with pod deletions.

| `disruptionsAllowed`
| `integer`
| Number of pod disruptions that are currently allowed.

| `expectedPods`
| `integer`
| total number of pods counted by this disruption budget

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| Most recent generation observed when updating this PDB status. DisruptionsAllowed and other status information is valid only if observedGeneration equals to PDB's object generation.

.Global query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If &#x27;true&#x27;, then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

| `orphanDependents`
| `boolean`
| Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the &quot;orphan&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object&#x27;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
| `propagationPolicy`
| `string`
| Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: &#x27;Orphan&#x27; - orphan the dependents; &#x27;Background&#x27; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; &#x27;Foreground&#x27; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
