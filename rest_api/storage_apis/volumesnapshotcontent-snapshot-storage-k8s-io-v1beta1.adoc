| `string`
| deletionPolicy determines whether this VolumeSnapshotContent and its physical snapshot on the underlying storage system should be deleted when its bound VolumeSnapshot is deleted. Supported values are "Retain" and "Delete". "Retain" means that the VolumeSnapshotContent and its physical snapshot on underlying storage system are kept. "Delete" means that the VolumeSnapshotContent and its physical snapshot on underlying storage system are deleted. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in with the "DeletionPolicy" field defined in the VolumeSnapshotClass the VolumeSnapshot refers to. For pre-existing snapshots, users MUST specify this field when creating the VolumeSnapshotContent object. Required.

| `volumeSnapshotClassName`
| `string`
| name of the VolumeSnapshotClass to which this snapshot belongs.

| `volumeSnapshotRef`
| `object`
| volumeSnapshotRef specifies the VolumeSnapshot object to which this VolumeSnapshotContent object is bound. VolumeSnapshot.Spec.VolumeSnapshotContentName field must reference to this VolumeSnapshotContent's name for the bidirectional binding to be valid. For a pre-existing VolumeSnapshotContent object, name and namespace of the VolumeSnapshot object MUST be provided for binding to happen. This field is immutable after creation. Required.

For a pre-existing VolumeSnapshotContent object, name and namespace of the VolumeSnapshot object MUST be provided for binding to happen. This field is immutable after creation. Required.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| API version of the referent.

| `fieldPath`
| `string`
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `name`
| `string`
| Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/

| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

| `uid`
| `string`
| UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids

|===
..status
Description::
  status represents the current information of a snapshot.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `creationTime`
| `integer`
| creationTime is the timestamp when the point-in-time snapshot is taken by the underlying storage system. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in with the "creation_time" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshotRequest" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "creation_time" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it. If not specified, it indicates the creation time is unknown. The format of this field is a Unix nanoseconds time encoded as an int64. On Unix, the command `date +%s%N` returns the current time in nanoseconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.

| `error`
| `object`
| error is the latest observed error during snapshot creation, if any.

| `readyToUse`
| `boolean`
| readyToUse indicates if a snapshot is ready to be used to restore a volume. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in with the "ready_to_use" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshotRequest" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "ready_to_use" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it, otherwise, this field will be set to "True". If not specified, it means the readiness of a snapshot is unknown.

| `restoreSize`
| `integer`
| restoreSize represents the complete size of the snapshot in bytes. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in with the "size_bytes" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshotRequest" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "size_bytes" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it. When restoring a volume from this snapshot, the size of the volume MUST NOT be smaller than the restoreSize if it is specified, otherwise the restoration will fail. If not specified, it indicates that the size is unknown.

| `snapshotHandle`
| `string`
| snapshotHandle is the CSI "snapshot_id" of a snapshot on the underlying storage system. If not specified, it indicates that dynamic snapshot creation has either failed or it is still in progress.

|===
..status.error
Description::
  error is the latest observed error during snapshot creation, if any.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a string detailing the encountered error during snapshot creation if specified. NOTE: message may be logged, and it should not contain sensitive information.

HTTP method::
  `DELETE`

Description::
  delete collection of VolumeSnapshotContent


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it&#x27;s 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
