Description::
+
--
CSIDriver captures information about a Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume driver deployed on the cluster. Kubernetes attach detach controller uses this object to determine whether attach is required. Kubelet uses this object to determine whether pod information needs to be passed on mount. CSIDriver objects are non-namespaced.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object metadata. metadata.Name indicates the name of the CSI driver that this object refers to; it MUST be the same name returned by the CSI GetPluginName() call for that driver. The driver name must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), dots (.), and alphanumerics between. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| CSIDriverSpec is the specification of a CSIDriver.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `attachRequired`
| `boolean`
| attachRequired indicates this CSI volume driver requires an attach operation (because it implements the CSI ControllerPublishVolume() method), and that the Kubernetes attach detach controller should call the attach volume interface which checks the volumeattachment status and waits until the volume is attached before proceeding to mounting. The CSI external-attacher coordinates with CSI volume driver and updates the volumeattachment status when the attach operation is complete. If the CSIDriverRegistry feature gate is enabled and the value is specified to false, the attach operation will be skipped. Otherwise the attach operation will be called.

This field is immutable.

| `fsGroupPolicy`
| `string`
| Defines if the underlying volume supports changing ownership and permission of the volume before being mounted. Refer to the specific FSGroupPolicy values for additional details. This field is beta, and is only honored by servers that enable the CSIVolumeFSGroupPolicy feature gate.

This field is immutable.

Defaults to ReadWriteOnceWithFSType, which will examine each volume to determine if Kubernetes should modify ownership and permissions of the volume. With the default policy the defined fsGroup will only be applied if a fstype is defined and the volume's access mode contains ReadWriteOnce.

| `podInfoOnMount`
| `boolean`
| If set to true, podInfoOnMount indicates this CSI volume driver requires additional pod information (like podName, podUID, etc.) during mount operations. If set to false, pod information will not be passed on mount. Default is false. The CSI driver specifies podInfoOnMount as part of driver deployment. If true, Kubelet will pass pod information as VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume() calls. The CSI driver is responsible for parsing and validating the information passed in as VolumeContext. The following VolumeConext will be passed if podInfoOnMount is set to true. This list might grow, but the prefix will be used. "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.name": pod.Name "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.namespace": pod.Namespace "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.uid": string(pod.UID) "csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral": "true" if the volume is an ephemeral inline volume
                                defined by a CSIVolumeSource, otherwise "false"

"csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral" is a new feature in Kubernetes 1.16. It is only required for drivers which support both the "Persistent" and "Ephemeral" VolumeLifecycleMode. Other drivers can leave pod info disabled and/or ignore this field. As Kubernetes 1.15 doesn't support this field, drivers can only support one mode when deployed on such a cluster and the deployment determines which mode that is, for example via a command line parameter of the driver.

This field is immutable.

| `requiresRepublish`
| `boolean`
| RequiresRepublish indicates the CSI driver wants `NodePublishVolume` being periodically called to reflect any possible change in the mounted volume. This field defaults to false.

Note: After a successful initial NodePublishVolume call, subsequent calls to NodePublishVolume should only update the contents of the volume. New mount points will not be seen by a running container.

| `storageCapacity`
| `boolean`
| If set to true, storageCapacity indicates that the CSI volume driver wants pod scheduling to consider the storage capacity that the driver deployment will report by creating CSIStorageCapacity objects with capacity information.

The check can be enabled immediately when deploying a driver. In that case, provisioning new volumes with late binding will pause until the driver deployment has published some suitable CSIStorageCapacity object.

Alternatively, the driver can be deployed with the field unset or false and it can be flipped later when storage capacity information has been published.

This field is immutable.

This is a beta field and only available when the CSIStorageCapacity feature is enabled. The default is false.

| `tokenRequests`
| `array`
| TokenRequests indicates the CSI driver needs pods' service account tokens it is mounting volume for to do necessary authentication. Kubelet will pass the tokens in VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume calls. The CSI driver should parse and validate the following VolumeContext: "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens": {
  "<audience>": {
    "token": <token>,
    "expirationTimestamp": <expiration timestamp in RFC3339>,
  },
  ...
}

Note: Audience in each TokenRequest should be different and at most one token is empty string. To receive a new token after expiry, RequiresRepublish can be used to trigger NodePublishVolume periodically.

| `tokenRequests[]`
| `object`
| TokenRequest contains parameters of a service account token.

| `volumeLifecycleModes`
| `array (string)`
| volumeLifecycleModes defines what kind of volumes this CSI volume driver supports. The default if the list is empty is "Persistent", which is the usage defined by the CSI specification and implemented in Kubernetes via the usual PV/PVC mechanism. The other mode is "Ephemeral". In this mode, volumes are defined inline inside the pod spec with CSIVolumeSource and their lifecycle is tied to the lifecycle of that pod. A driver has to be aware of this because it is only going to get a NodePublishVolume call for such a volume. For more information about implementing this mode, see https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ephemeral-local-volumes.html A driver can support one or more of these modes and more modes may be added in the future. This field is beta.

This field is immutable.

|===

HTTP method::
  `DELETE`

Description::
  delete collection of CSIDriver


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `gracePeriodSeconds`
| `integer`
| The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `orphanDependents`
| `boolean`
| Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the &quot;orphan&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object&#x27;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
| `propagationPolicy`
| `string`
| Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: &#x27;Orphan&#x27; - orphan the dependents; &#x27;Background&#x27; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; &#x27;Foreground&#x27; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

.Global path parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `name`
| `string`
| name of the CSIDriver
|===

.Global query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If &#x27;true&#x27;, then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

HTTP method::
  `GET`

Description::
  watch changes to an object of kind CSIDriver. deprecated: use the &#x27;watch&#x27; parameter with a list operation instead, filtered to a single item with the &#x27;fieldSelector&#x27; parameter.
