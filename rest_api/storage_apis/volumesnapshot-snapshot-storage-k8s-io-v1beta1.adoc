Description::
  VolumeSnapshot is a user&#x27;s request for either creating a point-in-time snapshot of a persistent volume, or binding to a pre-existing snapshot.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| spec defines the desired characteristics of a snapshot requested by a user. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots#volumesnapshots Required.

| `.status`
| `object`
| status represents the current information of a snapshot. NOTE: status can be modified by sources other than system controllers, and must not be depended upon for accuracy. Controllers should only use information from the VolumeSnapshotContent object after verifying that the binding is accurate and complete.

|===
..spec
Description::
  spec defines the desired characteristics of a snapshot requested by a user. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots#volumesnapshots Required.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `source`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `source`
| `object`
| source specifies where a snapshot will be created from. This field is immutable after creation. Required.

| `volumeSnapshotClassName`
| `string`
| volumeSnapshotClassName is the name of the VolumeSnapshotClass requested by the VolumeSnapshot. If not specified, the default snapshot class will be used if one exists. If not specified, and there is no default snapshot class, dynamic snapshot creation will fail. Empty string is not allowed for this field. TODO(xiangqian): a webhook validation on empty string. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshot-classes

|===
..spec.source
Description::
  source specifies where a snapshot will be created from. This field is immutable after creation. Required.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `persistentVolumeClaimName`
| `string`
| persistentVolumeClaimName specifies the name of the PersistentVolumeClaim object in the same namespace as the VolumeSnapshot object where the snapshot should be dynamically taken from. This field is immutable.

| `volumeSnapshotContentName`
| `string`
| volumeSnapshotContentName specifies the name of a pre-existing VolumeSnapshotContent object. This field is immutable.

|===
..status
Description::
  status represents the current information of a snapshot. NOTE: status can be modified by sources other than system controllers, and must not be depended upon for accuracy. Controllers should only use information from the VolumeSnapshotContent object after verifying that the binding is accurate and complete.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `boundVolumeSnapshotContentName`
| `string`
| boundVolumeSnapshotContentName represents the name of the VolumeSnapshotContent object to which the VolumeSnapshot object is bound. If not specified, it indicates that the VolumeSnapshot object has not been successfully bound to a VolumeSnapshotContent object yet. NOTE: Specified boundVolumeSnapshotContentName alone does not mean binding       is valid. Controllers MUST always verify bidirectional binding between       VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent to avoid possible security issues.

| `creationTime`
| `string`
| creationTime is the timestamp when the point-in-time snapshot is taken by the underlying storage system. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in with the "creation_time" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshotRequest" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "creation_time" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it. If not specified, it indicates that the creation time of the snapshot is unknown.

| `error`
| `object`
| error is the last observed error during snapshot creation, if any. This field could be helpful to upper level controllers(i.e., application controller) to decide whether they should continue on waiting for the snapshot to be created based on the type of error reported.

| `readyToUse`
| `boolean`
| readyToUse indicates if a snapshot is ready to be used to restore a volume. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in with the "ready_to_use" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshotRequest" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "ready_to_use" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it, otherwise, this field will be set to "True". If not specified, it means the readiness of a snapshot is unknown.

| `restoreSize`
| `integer-or-string`
| restoreSize represents the complete size of the snapshot in bytes. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in with the "size_bytes" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshotRequest" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "size_bytes" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it. When restoring a volume from this snapshot, the size of the volume MUST NOT be smaller than the restoreSize if it is specified, otherwise the restoration will fail. If not specified, it indicates that the size is unknown.

|===
..status.error
Description::
  error is the last observed error during snapshot creation, if any. This field could be helpful to upper level controllers(i.e., application controller) to decide whether they should continue on waiting for the snapshot to be created based on the type of error reported.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a string detailing the encountered error during snapshot creation if specified. NOTE: message may be logged, and it should not contain sensitive information.

| `time`
| `string`
| time is the timestamp when the error was encountered.

.Global guery parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If &#x27;true&#x27;, then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it&#x27;s 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
