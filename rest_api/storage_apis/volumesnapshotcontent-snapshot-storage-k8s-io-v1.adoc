== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `deletionPolicy`
| `string`
| deletionPolicy determines whether this VolumeSnapshotContent and its physical snapshot on
the underlying storage system should be deleted when its bound VolumeSnapshot is deleted.
Supported values are "Retain" and "Delete".
"Retain" means that the VolumeSnapshotContent and its physical snapshot on underlying storage system are kept.
"Delete" means that the VolumeSnapshotContent and its physical snapshot on underlying storage system are deleted.
For dynamically provisioned snapshots, this field will automatically be filled in by the
CSI snapshotter sidecar with the "DeletionPolicy" field defined in the corresponding
VolumeSnapshotClass.
For pre-existing snapshots, users MUST specify this field when creating the
 VolumeSnapshotContent object.
Required.

| `driver`
| `string`
| driver is the name of the CSI driver used to create the physical snapshot on
the underlying storage system.
This MUST be the same as the name returned by the CSI GetPluginName() call for
that driver.
Required.

| `source`
| `object`
| source specifies whether the snapshot is (or should be) dynamically provisioned
or already exists, and just requires a Kubernetes object representation.
This field is immutable after creation.
Required.

| `sourceVolumeMode`
| `string`
| SourceVolumeMode is the mode of the volume whose snapshot is taken.
Can be either “Filesystem” or “Block”.
If not specified, it indicates the source volume's mode is unknown.
This field is immutable.
This field is an alpha field.

| `volumeSnapshotClassName`
| `string`
| name of the VolumeSnapshotClass from which this snapshot was (or will be)
created.
Note that after provisioning, the VolumeSnapshotClass may be deleted or
recreated with different set of values, and as such, should not be referenced
post-snapshot creation.

| `volumeSnapshotRef`
| `object`
| volumeSnapshotRef specifies the VolumeSnapshot object to which this
VolumeSnapshotContent object is bound.
VolumeSnapshot.Spec.VolumeSnapshotContentName field must reference to
this VolumeSnapshotContent's name for the bidirectional binding to be valid.
For a pre-existing VolumeSnapshotContent object, name and namespace of the
VolumeSnapshot object MUST be provided for binding to happen.
This field is immutable after creation.
Required.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| API version of the referent.

| `fieldPath`
| `string`
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
"spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
referencing a part of an object.
TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind of the referent.
More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `name`
| `string`
| Name of the referent.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace of the referent.

| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any.
More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

| `uid`
| `string`
| UID of the referent.

|===
=== .status
Description::
+
--
status represents the current information of a snapshot.
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `creationTime`
| `integer`
| creationTime is the timestamp when the point-in-time snapshot is taken
by the underlying storage system.
In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in by the
CSI snapshotter sidecar with the "creation_time" value returned from CSI
"CreateSnapshot" gRPC call.
For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "creation_time"
value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it.
If not specified, it indicates the creation time is unknown.
The format of this field is a Unix nanoseconds time encoded as an int64.
On Unix, the command `date +%s%N` returns the current time in nanoseconds
since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.

| `error`
| `object`
| error is the last observed error during snapshot creation, if any.
Upon success after retry, this error field will be cleared.

| `readyToUse`
| `boolean`
| readyToUse indicates if a snapshot is ready to be used to restore a volume.
In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in by the
CSI snapshotter sidecar with the "ready_to_use" value returned from CSI
"CreateSnapshot" gRPC call.
For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "ready_to_use"
value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it,
otherwise, this field will be set to "True".
If not specified, it means the readiness of a snapshot is unknown.

| `restoreSize`
| `integer`
| restoreSize represents the complete size of the snapshot in bytes.
In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in by the
CSI snapshotter sidecar with the "size_bytes" value returned from CSI
"CreateSnapshot" gRPC call.
For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "size_bytes"
value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it.
When restoring a volume from this snapshot, the size of the volume MUST NOT
be smaller than the restoreSize if it is specified, otherwise the restoration will fail.
If not specified, it indicates that the size is unknown.

| `snapshotHandle`
| `string`
| snapshotHandle is the CSI "snapshot_id" of a snapshot on the underlying storage system.
If not specified, it indicates that dynamic snapshot creation has either failed
or it is still in progress.

| `volumeGroupSnapshotHandle`
| `string`
| VolumeGroupSnapshotHandle is the CSI "group_snapshot_id" of a group snapshot
on the underlying storage system.

|===
=== .status.error

| Property | Type | Description

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a string detailing the encountered error during snapshot

| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
