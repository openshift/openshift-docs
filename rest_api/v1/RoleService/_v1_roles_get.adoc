[id="ProtobufAny_{context}"]
=== _ProtobufAny_
 

`Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

    Foo foo = ...;
    Any any;
    any.PackFrom(foo);
    ...
    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
      ...
    }

Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

    Foo foo = ...;
    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
    ...
    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
    }
    // or ...
    if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
      foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
    }

 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

    foo = Foo(...)
    any = Any()
    any.Pack(foo)
    ...
    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
      any.Unpack(foo)
      ...

 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
     if err != nil {
       ...
     }
     ...
     foo := &pb.Foo{}
     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
       ...
     }

The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
name "y.z".

==== JSON representation
The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

    package google.profile;
    message Person {
      string first_name = 1;
      string last_name = 2;
    }

    {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
      "firstName": <string>,
      "lastName": <string>
    }

If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

    {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
      "value": "1.212s"
    }

| Field Name| Required| Nullable | Type| Description | Format

| @type
| 
| 
|   String  
| A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least one \"/\" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted).  In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]   value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the   URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any   lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage   breaking changes.)  Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely used type server implementations and no plans to implement one.  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.

A role specifies which actions are allowed for which subset of cluster
objects. Permissions be can either specified directly via setting
resource_to_access together with global_access or by referencing a
permission set by its id in permission_set_name.

EXPERIMENTAL.
NOTE: Please refer from using MutabilityMode for the time being. It will be replaced in the future (ROX-14276).
MutabilityMode specifies whether and how an object can be modified. Default
is ALLOW_MUTATE and means there are no modification restrictions; this is equivalent
to the absence of MutabilityMode specification. ALLOW_MUTATE_FORCED forbids all
modifying operations except object removal with force bit on.

Be careful when changing the state of this field. For example, modifying an
object from ALLOW_MUTATE to ALLOW_MUTATE_FORCED is allowed but will prohibit any further
changes to it, including modifying it back to ALLOW_MUTATE.

[id="TraitsOrigin_{context}"]
=== _TraitsOrigin_
 

Origin specifies the origin of an object.
Objects can have four different origins:
- IMPERATIVE: the object was created via the API. This is assumed by default.
- DEFAULT: the object is a default object, such as default roles, access scopes etc.
- DECLARATIVE: the object is created via declarative configuration.
- DECLARATIVE_ORPHANED: the object is created via declarative configuration and then unsuccessfully deleted(for example, because it is referenced by another object)
Based on the origin, different rules apply to the objects.
Objects with the DECLARATIVE origin are not allowed to be modified via API, only via declarative configuration.
Additionally, they may not reference objects with the IMPERATIVE origin.
Objects with the DEFAULT origin are not allowed to be modified via either API or declarative configuration.
They may be referenced by all other objects.
Objects with the IMPERATIVE origin are allowed to be modified via API, not via declarative configuration.
They may reference all other objects.
Objects with the DECLARATIVE_ORPHANED origin are not allowed to be modified via either API or declarative configuration.
DECLARATIVE_ORPHANED resource can become DECLARATIVE again if it is redefined in declarative configuration.
Objects with this origin will be cleaned up from the system immediately after they are not referenced by other resources anymore.
They may be referenced by all other objects.
