Description::
  DNS manages the CoreDNS component to provide a name resolution service for pods and services in the cluster. 
 This supports the DNS-based service discovery specification: https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/blob/master/docs/specification.md 
 More details: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/coredns

Type::
  `object`

| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]

| `.spec`
| `object`
| spec is the specification of the desired behavior of the DNS.

| `.status`

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `servers`
| `array`
| servers is a list of DNS resolvers that provide name query delegation for one or more subdomains outside the scope of the cluster domain. If servers consists of more than one Server, longest suffix match will be used to determine the Server. 
 For example, if there are two Servers, one for "foo.com" and another for "a.foo.com", and the name query is for "www.a.foo.com", it will be routed to the Server with Zone "a.foo.com". 
 If this field is nil, no servers are created.

| `servers[]`
| `object`
| Server defines the schema for a server that runs per instance of CoreDNS.

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `forwardPlugin`
| `object`
| forwardPlugin defines a schema for configuring CoreDNS to proxy DNS messages to upstream resolvers.

| `name`
| `string`
| name is required and specifies a unique name for the server. Name must comply with the Service Name Syntax of rfc6335.

| `zones`
| `array (string)`
| zones is required and specifies the subdomains that Server is authoritative for. Zones must conform to the rfc1123 definition of a subdomain. Specifying the cluster domain (i.e., "cluster.local") is invalid.

Description::
  forwardPlugin defines a schema for configuring CoreDNS to proxy DNS messages to upstream resolvers.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `upstreams`
| `array (string)`
| upstreams is a list of resolvers to forward name queries for subdomains of Zones. Upstreams are randomized when more than 1 upstream is specified. Each instance of CoreDNS performs health checking of Upstreams. When a healthy upstream returns an error during the exchange, another resolver is tried from Upstreams. Each upstream is represented by an IP address or IP:port if the upstream listens on a port other than 53. 
 A maximum of 15 upstreams is allowed per ForwardPlugin.

|===
..status
Description::
  status is the most recently observed status of the DNS.

  - `clusterIP`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `clusterDomain`
| `string`
| clusterDomain is the local cluster DNS domain suffix for DNS services. This will be a subdomain as defined in RFC 1034, section 3.5: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034#section-3.5 Example: "cluster.local" 
 More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service

| `clusterIP`
| `string`
| clusterIP is the service IP through which this DNS is made available. 
 In the case of the default DNS, this will be a well known IP that is used as the default nameserver for pods that are using the default ClusterFirst DNS policy. 
 In general, this IP can be specified in a pod's spec.dnsConfig.nameservers list or used explicitly when performing name resolution from within the cluster. Example: dig foo.com @<service IP> 
 More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies

| `conditions`
| `array`
| conditions provide information about the state of the DNS on the cluster. 
 These are the supported DNS conditions: 
   * Available   - True if the following conditions are met:     * DNS controller daemonset is available.   - False if any of those conditions are unsatisfied.

HTTP method::
  `DELETE`

Description::
  delete collection of DNS


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it&#x27;s 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
