| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `customization`
| `object`
| customization is used to optionally provide a small set of
customization options to the web console.

| `ingress`
| `object`
| ingress allows to configure the alternative ingress for the console.
This field is intended for clusters without ingress capability,
where access to routes is not possible.

| `logLevel`
| `string`
| logLevel is an intent based logging for an overall component.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a
simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for their operands.

Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace", "TraceAll".
Defaults to "Normal".

| `managementState`
| `string`
| managementState indicates whether and how the operator should manage the component

| `observedConfig`
| ``
| observedConfig holds a sparse config that controller has observed from the cluster state.  It exists in spec because
it is an input to the level for the operator

| `operatorLogLevel`
| `string`
| operatorLogLevel is an intent based logging for the operator itself.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a
simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for themselves.

Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace", "TraceAll".
Defaults to "Normal".

| `plugins`
| `array (string)`
| plugins defines a list of enabled console plugin names.

| `providers`
| `object`
| providers contains configuration for using specific service providers.

| `route`
| `object`
| route contains hostname and secret reference that contains the serving certificate.
If a custom route is specified, a new route will be created with the
provided hostname, under which console will be available.
In case of custom hostname uses the default routing suffix of the cluster,
the Secret specification for a serving certificate will not be needed.
In case of custom hostname points to an arbitrary domain, manual DNS configurations steps are necessary.
The default console route will be maintained to reserve the default hostname
for console if the custom route is removed.
If not specified, default route will be used.
DEPRECATED

| `unsupportedConfigOverrides`
| ``
| unsupportedConfigOverrides overrides the final configuration that was computed by the operator.
Red Hat does not support the use of this field.
Misuse of this field could lead to unexpected behavior or conflict with other configuration options.
Seek guidance from the Red Hat support before using this field.
Use of this property blocks cluster upgrades, it must be removed before upgrading your cluster.

| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
