[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `additionalNetworks`
| `array`
| additionalNetworks is a list of extra networks to make available to pods when multiple networks are enabled.

| `additionalNetworks[]`
| `object`
| AdditionalNetworkDefinition configures an extra network that is available but not created by default. Instead, pods must request them by name. type must be specified, along with exactly one "Config" that matches the type.

| `clusterNetwork`
| `array`
| clusterNetwork is the IP address pool to use for pod IPs. Some network providers, e.g. OpenShift SDN, support multiple ClusterNetworks. Others only support one. This is equivalent to the cluster-cidr.

| `clusterNetwork[]`
| `object`
| ClusterNetworkEntry is a subnet from which to allocate PodIPs. A network of size HostPrefix (in CIDR notation) will be allocated when nodes join the cluster. If the HostPrefix field is not used by the plugin, it can be left unset. Not all network providers support multiple ClusterNetworks

| `defaultNetwork`
| `object`
| defaultNetwork is the "default" network that all pods will receive

| `deployKubeProxy`
| `boolean`
| deployKubeProxy specifies whether or not a standalone kube-proxy should be deployed by the operator. Some network providers include kube-proxy or similar functionality. If unset, the plugin will attempt to select the correct value, which is false when OpenShift SDN and ovn-kubernetes are used and true otherwise.

| `disableMultiNetwork`
| `boolean`
| disableMultiNetwork specifies whether or not multiple pod network support should be disabled. If unset, this property defaults to 'false' and multiple network support is enabled.

| `disableNetworkDiagnostics`
| `boolean`
| disableNetworkDiagnostics specifies whether or not PodNetworkConnectivityCheck CRs from a test pod to every node, apiserver and LB should be disabled or not. If unset, this property defaults to 'false' and network diagnostics is enabled. Setting this to 'true' would reduce the additional load of the pods performing the checks.

| `exportNetworkFlows`
| `object`
| exportNetworkFlows enables and configures the export of network flow metadata from the pod network by using protocols NetFlow, SFlow or IPFIX. Currently only supported on OVN-Kubernetes plugin. If unset, flows will not be exported to any collector.

| `kubeProxyConfig`
| `object`
| kubeProxyConfig lets us configure desired proxy configuration. If not specified, sensible defaults will be chosen by OpenShift directly. Not consumed by all network providers - currently only openshift-sdn.

| `logLevel`
| `string`
| logLevel is an intent based logging for an overall component.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for their operands.
 Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace", "TraceAll". Defaults to "Normal".

| `managementState`
| `string`
| managementState indicates whether and how the operator should manage the component

| `migration`
| `object`
| migration enables and configures the cluster network migration. The migration procedure allows to change the network type and the MTU.

| `observedConfig`
| ``
| observedConfig holds a sparse config that controller has observed from the cluster state.  It exists in spec because it is an input to the level for the operator

| `operatorLogLevel`
| `string`
| operatorLogLevel is an intent based logging for the operator itself.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for themselves.
 Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace", "TraceAll". Defaults to "Normal".

| `serviceNetwork`
| `array (string)`
| serviceNetwork is the ip address pool to use for Service IPs Currently, all existing network providers only support a single value here, but this is an array to allow for growth.

| `unsupportedConfigOverrides`
| ``
| unsupportedConfigOverrides overrides the final configuration that was computed by the operator. Red Hat does not support the use of this field. Misuse of this field could lead to unexpected behavior or conflict with other configuration options. Seek guidance from the Red Hat support before using this field. Use of this property blocks cluster upgrades, it must be removed before upgrading your cluster.

| `useMultiNetworkPolicy`
| `boolean`
| useMultiNetworkPolicy enables a controller which allows for MultiNetworkPolicy objects to be used on additional networks as created by Multus CNI. MultiNetworkPolicy are similar to NetworkPolicy objects, but NetworkPolicy objects only apply to the primary interface. With MultiNetworkPolicy, you can control the traffic that a pod can receive over the secondary interfaces. If unset, this property defaults to 'false' and MultiNetworkPolicy objects are ignored. If 'disableMultiNetwork' is 'true' then the value of this field is ignored.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `controllerProbesPort`
| `integer`
| The port kuryr-controller will listen for readiness and liveness requests.

| `daemonProbesPort`
| `integer`
| The port kuryr-daemon will listen for readiness and liveness requests.

| `enablePortPoolsPrepopulation`
| `boolean`
| enablePortPoolsPrepopulation when true will make Kuryr prepopulate each newly created port pool with a minimum number of ports. Kuryr uses Neutron port pooling to fight the fact that it takes a significant amount of time to create one. It creates a number of ports when the first pod that is configured to use the dedicated network for pods is created in a namespace, and keeps them ready to be attached to pods. Port prepopulation is disabled by default.

| `mtu`
| `integer`
| mtu is the MTU that Kuryr should use when creating pod networks in Neutron. The value has to be lower or equal to the MTU of the nodes network and Neutron has to allow creation of tenant networks with such MTU. If unset Pod networks will be created with the same MTU as the nodes network has. This also affects the services network created by cluster-network-operator.

| `openStackServiceNetwork`
| `string`
| openStackServiceNetwork contains the CIDR of network from which to allocate IPs for OpenStack Octavia's Amphora VMs. Please note that with Amphora driver Octavia uses two IPs from that network for each loadbalancer - one given by OpenShift and second for VRRP connections. As the first one is managed by OpenShift's and second by Neutron's IPAMs, those need to come from different pools. Therefore `openStackServiceNetwork` needs to be at least twice the size of `serviceNetwork`, and whole `serviceNetwork` must be overlapping with `openStackServiceNetwork`. cluster-network-operator will then make sure VRRP IPs are taken from the ranges inside `openStackServiceNetwork` that are not overlapping with `serviceNetwork`, effectivly preventing conflicts. If not set cluster-network-operator will use `serviceNetwork` expanded by decrementing the prefix size by 1.

| `poolBatchPorts`
| `integer`
| poolBatchPorts sets a number of ports that should be created in a single batch request to extend the port pool. The default is 3. For more information about port pools see enablePortPoolsPrepopulation setting.

| `poolMaxPorts`
| `integer`
| poolMaxPorts sets a maximum number of free ports that are being kept in a port pool. If the number of ports exceeds this setting, free ports will get deleted. Setting 0 will disable this upper bound, effectively preventing pools from shrinking and this is the default value. For more information about port pools see enablePortPoolsPrepopulation setting.

| `poolMinPorts`
| `integer`
| poolMinPorts sets a minimum number of free ports that should be kept in a port pool. If the number of ports is lower than this setting, new ports will get created and added to pool. The default is 1. For more information about port pools see enablePortPoolsPrepopulation setting.

| Property | Type | Description

| `reachabilityTotalTimeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| reachabilityTotalTimeout configures the EgressIP node reachability check total timeout in seconds. If the EgressIP node cannot be reached within this timeout, the node is declared down. Setting a large value may cause the EgressIP feature to react slowly to node changes. In particular, it may react slowly for EgressIP nodes that really have a genuine problem and are unreachable. When omitted, this means the user has no opinion and the platform is left to choose a reasonable default, which is subject to change over time. The current default is 1 second. A value of 0 disables the EgressIP node's reachability check.

By default this is set to Restricted, and Kubernetes related traffic is still forwarded appropriately, but other IP traffic will not be routed by the OCP node. If there is a desire to allow the host to forward traffic across OVN-Kubernetes managed interfaces, then set this field to "Global". The supported values are "Restricted" and "Global".

| `routingViaHost`
| `boolean`
| RoutingViaHost allows pod egress traffic to exit via the ovn-k8s-mp0 management port into the host before sending it out. If this is not set, traffic will always egress directly from OVN to outside without touching the host stack. Setting this to true means hardware offload will not be supported. Default is false if GatewayConfig is specified.

|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
|===

HTTP method::
  `DELETE`

Description::
  delete collection of Network


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `sendInitialEvents`
| `boolean`
| `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
  when request started being processed.
- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
  Invalid error is returned.

Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
