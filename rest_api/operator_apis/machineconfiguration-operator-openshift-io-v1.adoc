== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec is the specification of the desired behavior of the Machine Config Operator

| `status`
| `object`
| status is the most recently observed status of the Machine Config Operator

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `failedRevisionLimit`
| `integer`
| failedRevisionLimit is the number of failed static pod installer revisions to keep on disk and in the api -1 = unlimited, 0 or unset = 5 (default)

| `forceRedeploymentReason`
| `string`
| forceRedeploymentReason can be used to force the redeployment of the operand by providing a unique string. This provides a mechanism to kick a previously failed deployment and provide a reason why you think it will work this time instead of failing again on the same config.

| `logLevel`
| `string`
| logLevel is an intent based logging for an overall component.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for their operands. 
 Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace", "TraceAll". Defaults to "Normal".

| `managedBootImages`
| `object`
| managedBootImages allows configuration for the management of boot images for machine resources within the cluster. This configuration allows users to select resources that should be updated to the latest boot images during cluster upgrades, ensuring that new machines always boot with the current cluster version's boot image. When omitted, no boot images will be updated.

| `managementState`
| `string`
| managementState indicates whether and how the operator should manage the component

| `nodeDisruptionPolicy`
| `object`
| nodeDisruptionPolicy allows an admin to set granular node disruption actions for MachineConfig-based updates, such as drains, service reloads, etc. Specifying this will allow for less downtime when doing small configuration updates to the cluster. This configuration has no effect on cluster upgrades which will still incur node disruption where required.

| `observedConfig`
| ``
| observedConfig holds a sparse config that controller has observed from the cluster state.  It exists in spec because it is an input to the level for the operator

| `operatorLogLevel`
| `string`
| operatorLogLevel is an intent based logging for the operator itself.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for themselves. 
 Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace", "TraceAll". Defaults to "Normal".

| `succeededRevisionLimit`
| `integer`
| succeededRevisionLimit is the number of successful static pod installer revisions to keep on disk and in the api -1 = unlimited, 0 or unset = 5 (default)

| `unsupportedConfigOverrides`
| ``
| unsupportedConfigOverrides overrides the final configuration that was computed by the operator. Red Hat does not support the use of this field. Misuse of this field could lead to unexpected behavior or conflict with other configuration options. Seek guidance from the Red Hat support before using this field. Use of this property blocks cluster upgrades, it must be removed before upgrading your cluster.

Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present.
