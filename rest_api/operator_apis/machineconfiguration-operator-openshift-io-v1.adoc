| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `bootImageSkewEnforcement`
| `object`
| bootImageSkewEnforcement allows an admin to configure how boot image version skew is
enforced on the cluster.
When omitted, this will default to Automatic for clusters that support automatic boot image updates.
For clusters that do not support automatic boot image updates, cluster upgrades will be disabled until
a skew enforcement mode has been specified.
When version skew is being enforced, cluster upgrades will be disabled until the version skew is deemed
acceptable for the current release payload.

| `failedRevisionLimit`
| `integer`
| failedRevisionLimit is the number of failed static pod installer revisions to keep on disk and in the api
-1 = unlimited, 0 or unset = 5 (default)

| `forceRedeploymentReason`
| `string`
| forceRedeploymentReason can be used to force the redeployment of the operand by providing a unique string.
This provides a mechanism to kick a previously failed deployment and provide a reason why you think it will work
this time instead of failing again on the same config.

| `irreconcilableValidationOverrides`
| `object`
| irreconcilableValidationOverrides is an optional field that can used to make changes to a MachineConfig that
cannot be applied to existing nodes.
When specified, the fields configured with validation overrides will no longer reject changes to those
respective fields due to them not being able to be applied to existing nodes.
Only newly provisioned nodes will have these configurations applied.
Existing nodes will report observed configuration differences in their MachineConfigNode status.

| `logLevel`
| `string`
| logLevel is an intent based logging for an overall component.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a
simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for their operands.

Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace", "TraceAll".
Defaults to "Normal".

| `managedBootImages`
| `object`
| managedBootImages allows configuration for the management of boot images for machine
resources within the cluster. This configuration allows users to select resources that should
be updated to the latest boot images during cluster upgrades, ensuring that new machines
always boot with the current cluster version's boot image. When omitted, this means no opinion
and the platform is left to choose a reasonable default, which is subject to change over time.
The default for each machine manager mode is All for GCP and AWS platforms, and None for all
other platforms.

| `managementState`
| `string`
| managementState indicates whether and how the operator should manage the component

| `nodeDisruptionPolicy`
| `object`
| nodeDisruptionPolicy allows an admin to set granular node disruption actions for
MachineConfig-based updates, such as drains, service reloads, etc. Specifying this will allow
for less downtime when doing small configuration updates to the cluster. This configuration
has no effect on cluster upgrades which will still incur node disruption where required.

| `observedConfig`
| ``
| observedConfig holds a sparse config that controller has observed from the cluster state.  It exists in spec because
it is an input to the level for the operator

| `operatorLogLevel`
| `string`
| operatorLogLevel is an intent based logging for the operator itself.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a
simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for themselves.

Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace", "TraceAll".
Defaults to "Normal".

| `succeededRevisionLimit`
| `integer`
| succeededRevisionLimit is the number of successful static pod installer revisions to keep on disk and in the api
-1 = unlimited, 0 or unset = 5 (default)

| `unsupportedConfigOverrides`
| ``
| unsupportedConfigOverrides overrides the final configuration that was computed by the operator.
Red Hat does not support the use of this field.
Misuse of this field could lead to unexpected behavior or conflict with other configuration options.
Seek guidance from the Red Hat support before using this field.
Use of this property blocks cluster upgrades, it must be removed before upgrading your cluster.

|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
