| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec holds user settable values for configuration

| `status`

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `driverConfig`
| `object`
| driverConfig can be used to specify platform specific driver configuration. When omitted, this means no opinion and the platform is left to choose reasonable defaults. These defaults are subject to change over time.

| `logLevel`
| `string`
| logLevel is an intent based logging for an overall component.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for their operands. 
 Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace", "TraceAll". Defaults to "Normal".

| `managementState`
| `string`
| managementState indicates whether and how the operator should manage the component

| `observedConfig`
| ``
| observedConfig holds a sparse config that controller has observed from the cluster state.  It exists in spec because it is an input to the level for the operator

| `operatorLogLevel`
| `string`
| operatorLogLevel is an intent based logging for the operator itself.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for themselves. 
 Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace", "TraceAll". Defaults to "Normal".

| `storageClassState`
| `string`
| StorageClassState determines if CSI operator should create and manage storage classes. If this field value is empty or Managed - CSI operator will continuously reconcile storage class and create if necessary. If this field value is Unmanaged - CSI operator will not reconcile any previously created storage class. If this field value is Removed - CSI operator will delete the storage class it created previously. When omitted, this means the user has no opinion and the platform chooses a reasonable default, which is subject to change over time. The current default behaviour is Managed.

| `unsupportedConfigOverrides`
| ``
| unsupportedConfigOverrides overrides the final configuration that was computed by the operator. Red Hat does not support the use of this field. Misuse of this field could lead to unexpected behavior or conflict with other configuration options. Seek guidance from the Red Hat support before using this field. Use of this property blocks cluster upgrades, it must be removed before upgrading your cluster.

Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
