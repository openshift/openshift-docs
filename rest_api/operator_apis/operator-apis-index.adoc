a certificate signed by that CA. The certificate has both ClientAuth
and ServerAuth extended usages enabled.


	More specifically, given an OperatorPKI with <name>, the CNO will manage:


- A Secret called <name>-ca with two data keys:
  - tls.key - the private key
  - tls.crt - the CA certificate


- A ConfigMap called <name>-ca with a single data key:
  - cabundle.crt - the CA certificate(s)


- A Secret called <name>-cert with two data keys:
  - tls.key - the private key
  - tls.crt - the certificate, signed by the CA


The CA certificate will have a validity of 10 years, rotated after 9.
The target certificate will have a validity of 6 months, rotated after 3


The CA certificate will have a CommonName of "<namespace>_<name>-ca@<timestamp>", where
<timestamp> is the last rotation time.
