 More specifically, given an OperatorPKI with <name>, the CNO will manage:
 - A Secret called <name>-ca with two data keys: - tls.key - the private key - tls.crt - the CA certificate
 - A ConfigMap called <name>-ca with a single data key: - cabundle.crt - the CA certificate(s)
 - A Secret called <name>-cert with two data keys: - tls.key - the private key - tls.crt - the certificate, signed by the CA
 The CA certificate will have a validity of 10 years, rotated after 9. The target certificate will have a validity of 6 months, rotated after 3
 The CA certificate will have a CommonName of "<namespace>_<name>-ca@<timestamp>", where <timestamp> is the last rotation time.
