Description::
  IngressController describes a managed ingress controller for the cluster. The controller can service OpenShift Route and Kubernetes Ingress resources. 
 When an IngressController is created, a new ingress controller deployment is created to allow external traffic to reach the services that expose Ingress or Route resources. Updating this resource may lead to disruption for public facing network connections as a new ingress controller revision may be rolled out. 
 https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers 
 Whenever possible, sensible defaults for the platform are used. See each field for more details.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `defaultCertificate`
| `object`
| defaultCertificate is a reference to a secret containing the default certificate served by the ingress controller. When Routes don't specify their own certificate, defaultCertificate is used. 
 The secret must contain the following keys and data: 
   tls.crt: certificate file contents   tls.key: key file contents 
 If unset, a wildcard certificate is automatically generated and used. The certificate is valid for the ingress controller domain (and subdomains) and the generated certificate's CA will be automatically integrated with the cluster's trust store. 
 The in-use certificate (whether generated or user-specified) will be automatically integrated with OpenShift's built-in OAuth server.

| `domain`
| `string`
| domain is a DNS name serviced by the ingress controller and is used to configure multiple features: 
 * For the LoadBalancerService endpoint publishing strategy, domain is   used to configure DNS records. See endpointPublishingStrategy. 
 * When using a generated default certificate, the certificate will be valid   for domain and its subdomains. See defaultCertificate. 
 * The value is published to individual Route statuses so that end-users   know where to target external DNS records. 
 domain must be unique among all IngressControllers, and cannot be updated. 
 If empty, defaults to ingress.config.openshift.io/cluster .spec.domain.

| `endpointPublishingStrategy`
| `object`
| endpointPublishingStrategy is used to publish the ingress controller endpoints to other networks, enable load balancer integrations, etc. 
 If unset, the default is based on infrastructure.config.openshift.io/cluster .status.platform: 
   AWS:      LoadBalancerService (with External scope)   Azure:    LoadBalancerService (with External scope)   GCP:      LoadBalancerService (with External scope)   IBMCloud: LoadBalancerService (with External scope)   Libvirt:  HostNetwork 
 Any other platform types (including None) default to HostNetwork. 
 endpointPublishingStrategy cannot be updated.

| `logging`
| `object`
| logging defines parameters for what should be logged where.  If this field is empty, operational logs are enabled but access logs are disabled.

| `namespaceSelector`
| `object`
| namespaceSelector is used to filter the set of namespaces serviced by the ingress controller. This is useful for implementing shards. 
 If unset, the default is no filtering.

| `nodePlacement`
| `object`
| nodePlacement enables explicit control over the scheduling of the ingress controller. 
 If unset, defaults are used. See NodePlacement for more details.

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| replicas is the desired number of ingress controller replicas. If unset, defaults to 2.

| `routeAdmission`
| `object`
| routeAdmission defines a policy for handling new route claims (for example, to allow or deny claims across namespaces). 
 If empty, defaults will be applied. See specific routeAdmission fields for details about their defaults.

| `routeSelector`
| `object`
| routeSelector is used to filter the set of Routes serviced by the ingress controller. This is useful for implementing shards. 
 If unset, the default is no filtering.

| `tlsSecurityProfile`
| `object`
| tlsSecurityProfile specifies settings for TLS connections for ingresscontrollers. 
 If unset, the default is based on the apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster resource. 
 Note that when using the Old, Intermediate, and Modern profile types, the effective profile configuration is subject to change between releases. For example, given a specification to use the Intermediate profile deployed on release X.Y.Z, an upgrade to release X.Y.Z+1 may cause a new profile configuration to be applied to the ingress controller, resulting in a rollout. 
 Note that the minimum TLS version for ingress controllers is 1.1, and the maximum TLS version is 1.2.  An implication of this restriction is that the Modern TLS profile type cannot be used because it requires TLS 1.3.

| `type`
| `string`
| type is the publishing strategy to use. Valid values are: 
 * LoadBalancerService 
 Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking. A LoadBalancer Service is created to publish the deployment. 
 See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer 
 If domain is set, a wildcard DNS record will be managed to point at the LoadBalancer Service's external name. DNS records are managed only in DNS zones defined by dns.config.openshift.io/cluster .spec.publicZone and .spec.privateZone. 
 Wildcard DNS management is currently supported only on the AWS, Azure, and GCP platforms. 
 * HostNetwork 
 Publishes the ingress controller on node ports where the ingress controller is deployed. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses host networking, bound to node ports 80 and 443. The user is responsible for configuring an external load balancer to publish the ingress controller via the node ports. 
 * Private 
 Does not publish the ingress controller. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking, and is not explicitly published. The user must manually publish the ingress controller. 
 * NodePortService 
 Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes NodePort Service. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking. A NodePort Service is created to publish the deployment. The specific node ports are dynamically allocated by OpenShift; however, to support static port allocations, user changes to the node port field of the managed NodePort Service will preserved.

 * LoadBalancerService 
 Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking. A LoadBalancer Service is created to publish the deployment. 
 See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer 
 If domain is set, a wildcard DNS record will be managed to point at the LoadBalancer Service's external name. DNS records are managed only in DNS zones defined by dns.config.openshift.io/cluster .spec.publicZone and .spec.privateZone. 
 Wildcard DNS management is currently supported only on the AWS, Azure, and GCP platforms. 
 * HostNetwork 
 Publishes the ingress controller on node ports where the ingress controller is deployed. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses host networking, bound to node ports 80 and 443. The user is responsible for configuring an external load balancer to publish the ingress controller via the node ports. 
 * Private 
 Does not publish the ingress controller. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking, and is not explicitly published. The user must manually publish the ingress controller. 
 * NodePortService 
 Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes NodePort Service. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking. A NodePort Service is created to publish the deployment. The specific node ports are dynamically allocated by OpenShift; however, to support static port allocations, user changes to the node port field of the managed NodePort Service will preserved.

.Global guery parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If &#x27;true&#x27;, then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it&#x27;s 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
