Description::
+
--
IngressController describes a managed ingress controller for the cluster. The controller can service OpenShift Route and Kubernetes Ingress resources.
 When an IngressController is created, a new ingress controller deployment is created to allow external traffic to reach the services that expose Ingress or Route resources. Updating this resource may lead to disruption for public facing network connections as a new ingress controller revision may be rolled out.
 https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers
 Whenever possible, sensible defaults for the platform are used. See each field for more details.
 Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `clientTLS`
| `object`
| clientTLS specifies settings for requesting and verifying client certificates, which can be used to enable mutual TLS for edge-terminated and reencrypt routes.

| `defaultCertificate`
| `object`
| defaultCertificate is a reference to a secret containing the default certificate served by the ingress controller. When Routes don't specify their own certificate, defaultCertificate is used.
 The secret must contain the following keys and data:
 tls.crt: certificate file contents tls.key: key file contents
 If unset, a wildcard certificate is automatically generated and used. The certificate is valid for the ingress controller domain (and subdomains) and the generated certificate's CA will be automatically integrated with the cluster's trust store.
 If a wildcard certificate is used and shared by multiple HTTP/2 enabled routes (which implies ALPN) then clients (i.e., notably browsers) are at liberty to reuse open connections. This means a client can reuse a connection to another route and that is likely to fail. This behaviour is generally known as connection coalescing.
 The in-use certificate (whether generated or user-specified) will be automatically integrated with OpenShift's built-in OAuth server.

| `domain`
| `string`
| domain is a DNS name serviced by the ingress controller and is used to configure multiple features:
 * For the LoadBalancerService endpoint publishing strategy, domain is used to configure DNS records. See endpointPublishingStrategy.
 * When using a generated default certificate, the certificate will be valid for domain and its subdomains. See defaultCertificate.
 * The value is published to individual Route statuses so that end-users know where to target external DNS records.
 domain must be unique among all IngressControllers, and cannot be updated.
 If empty, defaults to ingress.config.openshift.io/cluster .spec.domain.

| `endpointPublishingStrategy`
| `object`
| endpointPublishingStrategy is used to publish the ingress controller endpoints to other networks, enable load balancer integrations, etc.
 If unset, the default is based on infrastructure.config.openshift.io/cluster .status.platform:
 AWS:          LoadBalancerService (with External scope) Azure:        LoadBalancerService (with External scope) GCP:          LoadBalancerService (with External scope) IBMCloud:     LoadBalancerService (with External scope) AlibabaCloud: LoadBalancerService (with External scope) Libvirt:      HostNetwork
 Any other platform types (including None) default to HostNetwork.
 endpointPublishingStrategy cannot be updated.

| `httpCompression`
| `object`
| httpCompression defines a policy for HTTP traffic compression. By default, there is no HTTP compression.

| `httpEmptyRequestsPolicy`
| `string`
| httpEmptyRequestsPolicy describes how HTTP connections should be handled if the connection times out before a request is received. Allowed values for this field are "Respond" and "Ignore".  If the field is set to "Respond", the ingress controller sends an HTTP 400 or 408 response, logs the connection (if access logging is enabled), and counts the connection in the appropriate metrics.  If the field is set to "Ignore", the ingress controller closes the connection without sending a response, logging the connection, or incrementing metrics.  The default value is "Respond".
 Typically, these connections come from load balancers' health probes or Web browsers' speculative connections ("preconnect") and can be safely ignored.  However, these requests may also be caused by network errors, and so setting this field to "Ignore" may impede detection and diagnosis of problems.  In addition, these requests may be caused by port scans, in which case logging empty requests may aid in detecting intrusion attempts.

| `httpErrorCodePages`
| `object`
| httpErrorCodePages specifies a configmap with custom error pages. The administrator must create this configmap in the openshift-config namespace. This configmap should have keys in the format "error-page-<error code>.http", where <error code> is an HTTP error code. For example, "error-page-503.http" defines an error page for HTTP 503 responses. Currently only error pages for 503 and 404 responses can be customized. Each value in the configmap should be the full response, including HTTP headers. Eg- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/router/fadab45747a9b30cc3f0a4b41ad2871f95827a93/images/router/haproxy/conf/error-page-503.http If this field is empty, the ingress controller uses the default error pages.

| `httpHeaders`
| `object`
| httpHeaders defines policy for HTTP headers.
 If this field is empty, the default values are used.

| `logging`
| `object`
| logging defines parameters for what should be logged where.  If this field is empty, operational logs are enabled but access logs are disabled.

| `namespaceSelector`
| `object`
| namespaceSelector is used to filter the set of namespaces serviced by the ingress controller. This is useful for implementing shards.
 If unset, the default is no filtering.

| `nodePlacement`
| `object`
| nodePlacement enables explicit control over the scheduling of the ingress controller.
 If unset, defaults are used. See NodePlacement for more details.

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| replicas is the desired number of ingress controller replicas. If unset, the default depends on the value of the defaultPlacement field in the cluster config.openshift.io/v1/ingresses status.
 The value of replicas is set based on the value of a chosen field in the Infrastructure CR. If defaultPlacement is set to ControlPlane, the chosen field will be controlPlaneTopology. If it is set to Workers the chosen field will be infrastructureTopology. Replicas will then be set to 1 or 2 based whether the chosen field's value is SingleReplica or HighlyAvailable, respectively.
 These defaults are subject to change.

| `routeAdmission`
| `object`
| routeAdmission defines a policy for handling new route claims (for example, to allow or deny claims across namespaces).
 If empty, defaults will be applied. See specific routeAdmission fields for details about their defaults.

| `routeSelector`
| `object`
| routeSelector is used to filter the set of Routes serviced by the ingress controller. This is useful for implementing shards.
 If unset, the default is no filtering.

| `tlsSecurityProfile`
| `object`
| tlsSecurityProfile specifies settings for TLS connections for ingresscontrollers.
 If unset, the default is based on the apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster resource.
 Note that when using the Old, Intermediate, and Modern profile types, the effective profile configuration is subject to change between releases. For example, given a specification to use the Intermediate profile deployed on release X.Y.Z, an upgrade to release X.Y.Z+1 may cause a new profile configuration to be applied to the ingress controller, resulting in a rollout.

| `tuningOptions`
| `object`
| tuningOptions defines parameters for adjusting the performance of ingress controller pods. All fields are optional and will use their respective defaults if not set. See specific tuningOptions fields for more details.
 Setting fields within tuningOptions is generally not recommended. The default values are suitable for most configurations.

| `unsupportedConfigOverrides`
| ``
| unsupportedConfigOverrides allows specifying unsupported configuration options.  Its use is unsupported.

| `private`
| `object`
| private holds parameters for the Private endpoint publishing strategy. Present only if type is Private.

| `type`
| `string`
| type is the publishing strategy to use. Valid values are:
 * LoadBalancerService
 Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service.
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking. A LoadBalancer Service is created to publish the deployment.
 See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer
 If domain is set, a wildcard DNS record will be managed to point at the LoadBalancer Service's external name. DNS records are managed only in DNS zones defined by dns.config.openshift.io/cluster .spec.publicZone and .spec.privateZone.
 Wildcard DNS management is currently supported only on the AWS, Azure, and GCP platforms.
 * HostNetwork
 Publishes the ingress controller on node ports where the ingress controller is deployed.
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses host networking, bound to node ports 80 and 443. The user is responsible for configuring an external load balancer to publish the ingress controller via the node ports.
 * Private
 Does not publish the ingress controller.
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking, and is not explicitly published. The user must manually publish the ingress controller.
 * NodePortService
 Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes NodePort Service.
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking. A NodePort Service is created to publish the deployment. The specific node ports are dynamically allocated by OpenShift; however, to support static port allocations, user changes to the node port field of the managed NodePort Service will preserved.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `httpPort`
| `integer`
| httpPort is the port on the host which should be used to listen for HTTP requests. This field should be set when port 80 is already in use. The value should not coincide with the NodePort range of the cluster. When the value is 0 or is not specified it defaults to 80.

| `httpsPort`
| `integer`
| httpsPort is the port on the host which should be used to listen for HTTPS requests. This field should be set when port 443 is already in use. The value should not coincide with the NodePort range of the cluster. When the value is 0 or is not specified it defaults to 443.

| `protocol`
| `string`
| protocol specifies whether the IngressController expects incoming connections to use plain TCP or whether the IngressController expects PROXY protocol.
 PROXY protocol can be used with load balancers that support it to communicate the source addresses of client connections when forwarding those connections to the IngressController.  Using PROXY protocol enables the IngressController to report those source addresses instead of reporting the load balancer's address in HTTP headers and logs.  Note that enabling PROXY protocol on the IngressController will cause connections to fail if you are not using a load balancer that uses PROXY protocol to forward connections to the IngressController.  See http://www.haproxy.org/download/2.2/doc/proxy-protocol.txt for information about PROXY protocol.
 The following values are valid for this field:
 * The empty string. * "TCP". * "PROXY".
 The empty string specifies the default, which is TCP without PROXY protocol.  Note that the default is subject to change.

| `statsPort`
| `integer`
| statsPort is the port on the host where the stats from the router are published. The value should not coincide with the NodePort range of the cluster. If an external load balancer is configured to forward connections to this IngressController, the load balancer should use this port for health checks. The load balancer can send HTTP probes on this port on a given node, with the path /healthz/ready to determine if the ingress controller is ready to receive traffic on the node. For proper operation the load balancer must not forward traffic to a node until the health check reports ready. The load balancer should also stop forwarding requests within a maximum of 45 seconds after /healthz/ready starts reporting not-ready. Probing every 5 to 10 seconds, with a 5-second timeout and with a threshold of two successful or failed requests to become healthy or unhealthy respectively, are well-tested values. When the value is 0 or is not specified it defaults to 1936.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `allowedSourceRanges`
| ``
| allowedSourceRanges specifies an allowlist of IP address ranges to which access to the load balancer should be restricted.  Each range must be specified using CIDR notation (e.g. "10.0.0.0/8" or "fd00::/8"). If no range is specified, "0.0.0.0/0" for IPv4 and "::/0" for IPv6 are used by default, which allows all source addresses.
 To facilitate migration from earlier versions of OpenShift that did not have the allowedSourceRanges field, you may set the service.beta.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-source-ranges annotation on the "router-<ingresscontroller name>" service in the "openshift-ingress" namespace, and this annotation will take effect if allowedSourceRanges is empty on OpenShift 4.12.

Setting the HSTS (`Strict-Transport-Security`) header is not supported via actions. `Strict-Transport-Security` may only be configured using the "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header" route annotation, and only in accordance with the policy specified in Ingress.Spec.RequiredHSTSPolicies. Any actions defined here are applied after any actions related to the following other fields: cache-control, spec.clientTLS, spec.httpHeaders.forwardedHeaderPolicy, spec.httpHeaders.uniqueId, and spec.httpHeaders.headerNameCaseAdjustments. In case of HTTP request headers, the actions specified in spec.httpHeaders.actions on the Route will be executed after the actions specified in the IngressController's spec.httpHeaders.actions field. In case of HTTP response headers, the actions specified in spec.httpHeaders.actions on the IngressController will be executed after the actions specified in the Route's spec.httpHeaders.actions field. Headers set using this API cannot be captured for use in access logs. The following header names are reserved and may not be modified via this API: Strict-Transport-Security, Proxy, Host, Cookie, Set-Cookie. Note that the total size of all net added headers *after* interpolating dynamic values must not exceed the value of spec.tuningOptions.headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes on the IngressController. Please refer to the documentation for that API field for more details.

| `forwardedHeaderPolicy`
| `string`
| forwardedHeaderPolicy specifies when and how the IngressController sets the Forwarded, X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Port, X-Forwarded-Proto, and X-Forwarded-Proto-Version HTTP headers.  The value may be one of the following:
 * "Append", which specifies that the IngressController appends the headers, preserving existing headers.
 * "Replace", which specifies that the IngressController sets the headers, replacing any existing Forwarded or X-Forwarded-* headers.
 * "IfNone", which specifies that the IngressController sets the headers if they are not already set.
 * "Never", which specifies that the IngressController never sets the headers, preserving any existing headers.
 By default, the policy is "Append".

| `headerNameCaseAdjustments`
| ``
| headerNameCaseAdjustments specifies case adjustments that can be applied to HTTP header names.  Each adjustment is specified as an HTTP header name with the desired capitalization.  For example, specifying "X-Forwarded-For" indicates that the "x-forwarded-for" HTTP header should be adjusted to have the specified capitalization.
 These adjustments are only applied to cleartext, edge-terminated, and re-encrypt routes, and only when using HTTP/1.
 For request headers, these adjustments are applied only for routes that have the haproxy.router.openshift.io/h1-adjust-case=true annotation.  For response headers, these adjustments are applied to all HTTP responses.
 If this field is empty, no request headers are adjusted.

| `uniqueId`
| `object`
| uniqueId describes configuration for a custom HTTP header that the ingress controller should inject into incoming HTTP requests. Typically, this header is configured to have a value that is unique to the HTTP request.  The header can be used by applications or included in access logs to facilitate tracing individual HTTP requests.
 If this field is empty, no such header is injected into requests.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `clientFinTimeout`
| `string`
| clientFinTimeout defines how long a connection will be held open while waiting for the client response to the server/backend closing the connection.
 If unset, the default timeout is 1s

| `clientTimeout`
| `string`
| clientTimeout defines how long a connection will be held open while waiting for a client response.
 If unset, the default timeout is 30s

| `headerBufferBytes`
| `integer`
| headerBufferBytes describes how much memory should be reserved (in bytes) for IngressController connection sessions. Note that this value must be at least 16384 if HTTP/2 is enabled for the IngressController (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540). If this field is empty, the IngressController will use a default value of 32768 bytes.
 Setting this field is generally not recommended as headerBufferBytes values that are too small may break the IngressController and headerBufferBytes values that are too large could cause the IngressController to use significantly more memory than necessary.

| `headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes`
| `integer`
| headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes describes how much memory should be reserved (in bytes) from headerBufferBytes for HTTP header rewriting and appending for IngressController connection sessions. Note that incoming HTTP requests will be limited to (headerBufferBytes - headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes) bytes, meaning headerBufferBytes must be greater than headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes. If this field is empty, the IngressController will use a default value of 8192 bytes.
 Setting this field is generally not recommended as headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes values that are too small may break the IngressController and headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes values that are too large could cause the IngressController to use significantly more memory than necessary.

| `healthCheckInterval`
| `string`
| healthCheckInterval defines how long the router waits between two consecutive health checks on its configured backends.  This value is applied globally as a default for all routes, but may be overridden per-route by the route annotation "router.openshift.io/haproxy.health.check.interval".
 Expects an unsigned duration string of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, eg "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs" U+00B5 or "μs" U+03BC), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
 Setting this to less than 5s can cause excess traffic due to too frequent TCP health checks and accompanying SYN packet storms.  Alternatively, setting this too high can result in increased latency, due to backend servers that are no longer available, but haven't yet been detected as such.
 An empty or zero healthCheckInterval means no opinion and IngressController chooses a default, which is subject to change over time. Currently the default healthCheckInterval value is 5s.
 Currently the minimum allowed value is 1s and the maximum allowed value is 2147483647ms (24.85 days).  Both are subject to change over time.

| `maxConnections`
| `integer`
| maxConnections defines the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be established per HAProxy process. Increasing this value allows each ingress controller pod to handle more connections but at the cost of additional system resources being consumed.
 Permitted values are: empty, 0, -1, and the range 2000-2000000.
 If this field is empty or 0, the IngressController will use the default value of 50000, but the default is subject to change in future releases.
 If the value is -1 then HAProxy will dynamically compute a maximum value based on the available ulimits in the running container. Selecting -1 (i.e., auto) will result in a large value being computed (~520000 on OpenShift >=4.10 clusters) and therefore each HAProxy process will incur significant memory usage compared to the current default of 50000.
 Setting a value that is greater than the current operating system limit will prevent the HAProxy process from starting.
 If you choose a discrete value (e.g., 750000) and the router pod is migrated to a new node, there's no guarantee that that new node has identical ulimits configured. In such a scenario the pod would fail to start. If you have nodes with different ulimits configured (e.g., different tuned profiles) and you choose a discrete value then the guidance is to use -1 and let the value be computed dynamically at runtime.
 You can monitor memory usage for router containers with the following metric: 'container_memory_working_set_bytes{container="router",namespace="openshift-ingress"}'.
 You can monitor memory usage of individual HAProxy processes in router containers with the following metric: 'container_memory_working_set_bytes{container="router",namespace="openshift-ingress"}/container_processes{container="router",namespace="openshift-ingress"}'.

| `reloadInterval`
| `string`
| reloadInterval defines the minimum interval at which the router is allowed to reload to accept new changes. Increasing this value can prevent the accumulation of HAProxy processes, depending on the scenario. Increasing this interval can also lessen load imbalance on a backend's servers when using the roundrobin balancing algorithm. Alternatively, decreasing this value may decrease latency since updates to HAProxy's configuration can take effect more quickly.
 The value must be a time duration value; see <https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration>. Currently, the minimum value allowed is 1s, and the maximum allowed value is 120s. Minimum and maximum allowed values may change in future versions of OpenShift. Note that if a duration outside of these bounds is provided, the value of reloadInterval will be capped/floored and not rejected (e.g. a duration of over 120s will be capped to 120s; the IngressController will not reject and replace this disallowed value with the default).
 A zero value for reloadInterval tells the IngressController to choose the default, which is currently 5s and subject to change without notice.
 This field expects an unsigned duration string of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, e.g. "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs" U+00B5 or "μs" U+03BC), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
 Note: Setting a value significantly larger than the default of 5s can cause latency in observing updates to routes and their endpoints. HAProxy's configuration will be reloaded less frequently, and newly created routes will not be served until the subsequent reload.

| `serverFinTimeout`
| `string`
| serverFinTimeout defines how long a connection will be held open while waiting for the server/backend response to the client closing the connection.
 If unset, the default timeout is 1s

| `serverTimeout`
| `string`
| serverTimeout defines how long a connection will be held open while waiting for a server/backend response.
 If unset, the default timeout is 30s

| `threadCount`
| `integer`
| threadCount defines the number of threads created per HAProxy process. Creating more threads allows each ingress controller pod to handle more connections, at the cost of more system resources being used. HAProxy currently supports up to 64 threads. If this field is empty, the IngressController will use the default value.  The current default is 4 threads, but this may change in future releases.
 Setting this field is generally not recommended. Increasing the number of HAProxy threads allows ingress controller pods to utilize more CPU time under load, potentially starving other pods if set too high. Reducing the number of threads may cause the ingress controller to perform poorly.

| `tlsInspectDelay`
| `string`
| tlsInspectDelay defines how long the router can hold data to find a matching route.
 Setting this too short can cause the router to fall back to the default certificate for edge-terminated or reencrypt routes even when a better matching certificate could be used.
 If unset, the default inspect delay is 5s

| `tunnelTimeout`
| `string`
| tunnelTimeout defines how long a tunnel connection (including websockets) will be held open while the tunnel is idle.
 If unset, the default timeout is 1h

 * LoadBalancerService
 Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service.
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking. A LoadBalancer Service is created to publish the deployment.
 See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer
 If domain is set, a wildcard DNS record will be managed to point at the LoadBalancer Service's external name. DNS records are managed only in DNS zones defined by dns.config.openshift.io/cluster .spec.publicZone and .spec.privateZone.
 Wildcard DNS management is currently supported only on the AWS, Azure, and GCP platforms.
 * HostNetwork
 Publishes the ingress controller on node ports where the ingress controller is deployed.
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses host networking, bound to node ports 80 and 443. The user is responsible for configuring an external load balancer to publish the ingress controller via the node ports.
 * Private
 Does not publish the ingress controller.
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking, and is not explicitly published. The user must manually publish the ingress controller.
 * NodePortService
 Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes NodePort Service.
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking. A NodePort Service is created to publish the deployment. The specific node ports are dynamically allocated by OpenShift; however, to support static port allocations, user changes to the node port field of the managed NodePort Service will preserved.

| Property | Type | Description

| `httpPort`
| `integer`
| httpPort is the port on the host which should be used to listen for HTTP requests. This field should be set when port 80 is already in use. The value should not coincide with the NodePort range of the cluster. When the value is 0 or is not specified it defaults to 80.

| `httpsPort`
| `integer`
| httpsPort is the port on the host which should be used to listen for HTTPS requests. This field should be set when port 443 is already in use. The value should not coincide with the NodePort range of the cluster. When the value is 0 or is not specified it defaults to 443.

| `protocol`
| `string`
| protocol specifies whether the IngressController expects incoming connections to use plain TCP or whether the IngressController expects PROXY protocol.
 PROXY protocol can be used with load balancers that support it to communicate the source addresses of client connections when forwarding those connections to the IngressController.  Using PROXY protocol enables the IngressController to report those source addresses instead of reporting the load balancer's address in HTTP headers and logs.  Note that enabling PROXY protocol on the IngressController will cause connections to fail if you are not using a load balancer that uses PROXY protocol to forward connections to the IngressController.  See http://www.haproxy.org/download/2.2/doc/proxy-protocol.txt for information about PROXY protocol.
 The following values are valid for this field:
 * The empty string. * "TCP". * "PROXY".
 The empty string specifies the default, which is TCP without PROXY protocol.  Note that the default is subject to change.

| `statsPort`
| `integer`
| statsPort is the port on the host where the stats from the router are published. The value should not coincide with the NodePort range of the cluster. If an external load balancer is configured to forward connections to this IngressController, the load balancer should use this port for health checks. The load balancer can send HTTP probes on this port on a given node, with the path /healthz/ready to determine if the ingress controller is ready to receive traffic on the node. For proper operation the load balancer must not forward traffic to a node until the health check reports ready. The load balancer should also stop forwarding requests within a maximum of 45 seconds after /healthz/ready starts reporting not-ready. Probing every 5 to 10 seconds, with a 5-second timeout and with a threshold of two successful or failed requests to become healthy or unhealthy respectively, are well-tested values. When the value is 0 or is not specified it defaults to 1936.

Using PROXY protocol enables the IngressController to report those source addresses instead of reporting the load balancer's address in HTTP headers and logs.  Note that enabling PROXY protocol on the IngressController will cause connections to fail if you are not using a load balancer that uses PROXY protocol to forward connections to the IngressController.  See http://www.haproxy.org/download/2.2/doc/proxy-protocol.txt for information about PROXY protocol.
 Valid values for protocol are TCP, PROXY and omitted. When omitted, this means no opinion and the platform is left to choose a reasonable default, which is subject to change over time. The current default is TCP, without the proxy protocol enabled.

.Global query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `sendInitialEvents`
| `boolean`
| `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
  when request started being processed.
- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
  Invalid error is returned.

Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldManager`
| `string`
| fieldManager is a name associated with the actor or entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or 128 characters long, and only contain printable characters, as defined by https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsPrint. This field is required for apply requests (application/apply-patch) but optional for non-apply patch types (JsonPatch, MergePatch, StrategicMergePatch).
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
| `force`
| `boolean`
| Force is going to "force" Apply requests. It means user will re-acquire conflicting fields owned by other people. Force flag must be unset for non-apply patch requests.
