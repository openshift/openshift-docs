== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta_v2-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta_v2 meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| ConfigSpec contains the desired configuration and state for the Samples Operator, controlling various behavior around the imagestreams and templates it creates/updates in the openshift namespace.

| `status`
| `object`
| ConfigStatus contains the actual configuration in effect, as well as various details that describe the state of the Samples Operator.

ConfigSpec contains the desired configuration and state for the Samples Operator, controlling various behavior around the imagestreams and templates it creates/updates in the openshift namespace.
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `architectures`
| `array (string)`
| architectures determine which hardware architecture(s) to install, where x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x are the only supported choices currently.

| `managementState`
| `string`
| managementState is top level on/off type of switch for all operators. When "Managed", this operator processes config and manipulates the samples accordingly. When "Unmanaged", this operator ignores any updates to the resources it watches. When "Removed", it reacts that same wasy as it does if the Config object is deleted, meaning any ImageStreams or Templates it manages (i.e. it honors the skipped lists) and the registry secret are deleted, along with the ConfigMap in the operator's namespace that represents the last config used to manipulate the samples,

| `samplesRegistry`
| `string`
| samplesRegistry allows for the specification of which registry is accessed by the ImageStreams for their image content.  Defaults on the content in https://github.com/openshift/library that are pulled into this github repository, but based on our pulling only ocp content it typically defaults to registry.redhat.io.

| `skippedImagestreams`
| `array (string)`
| skippedImagestreams specifies names of image streams that should NOT be created/updated.  Admins can use this to allow them to delete content they don’t want.  They will still have to manually delete the content but the operator will not recreate(or update) anything listed here.

| `skippedTemplates`
| `array (string)`
| skippedTemplates specifies names of templates that should NOT be created/updated.  Admins can use this to allow them to delete content they don’t want.  They will still have to manually delete the content but the operator will not recreate(or update) anything listed here.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| ConfigCondition captures various conditions of the Config as entries are processed.

| `managementState`
| `string`
| managementState reflects the current operational status of the on/off switch for the operator.  This operator compares the ManagementState as part of determining that we are turning the operator back on (i.e. "Managed") when it was previously "Unmanaged".

| `samplesRegistry`
| `string`
| samplesRegistry allows for the specification of which registry is accessed by the ImageStreams for their image content.  Defaults on the content in https://github.com/openshift/library that are pulled into this github repository, but based on our pulling only ocp content it typically defaults to registry.redhat.io.

.Global query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If &#x27;true&#x27;, then the output is pretty printed.
|===

HTTP method::
  `DELETE`

Description::
  delete collection of Config


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
