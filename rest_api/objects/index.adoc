| `continue`
| `string`
| continue may be set if the user set a limit on the number of items returned, and indicates that the server has more data available. The value is opaque and may be used to issue another request to the endpoint that served this list to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing a consistent list may not be possible if the server configuration has changed or more than a few minutes have passed.

| `remainingItemCount`
| `integer`
| remainingItemCount is the number of subsequent items in the list which are not included in this list response. If the list request contained label or field selectors, then the number of remaining items is unknown and the field will be left unset and omitted during serialization. If the list is complete (either because it is not chunking or because this is the last chunk), then there are no more remaining items and this field will be left unset and omitted during serialization. Servers older than v1.15 do not set this field. The intended use of the remainingItemCount is *estimating* the size of a collection. Clients should not rely on the remainingItemCount to be set or to be exact.

| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| String that identifies the server's internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and passed unmodified back to the server. Populated by the system. Read-only.

Description::
  A single application container that you want to run within a pod.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `name`

[discrete]
=== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.args`
| `array (string)`
| Arguments to the entrypoint. The docker image's CMD is used if this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell

| `.command`
| `array (string)`
| Entrypoint array. Not executed within a shell. The docker image's ENTRYPOINT is used if this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell

| `.env`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#envvar-core-v1[`array (EnvVar core/v1)`]
| List of environment variables to set in the container. Cannot be updated.

| `.envFrom`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#envfromsource-core-v1[`array (EnvFromSource core/v1)`]
| List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated.

| `.image`
| `string`
| Docker image name. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.

| `.imagePullPolicy`
| `string`
| Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images

| `.lifecycle`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#lifecycle-core-v1[`Lifecycle core/v1`]
| Actions that the management system should take in response to container lifecycle events. Cannot be updated.

| `.livenessProbe`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#probe-core-v1[`Probe core/v1`]
| Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

| `.name`
| `string`
| Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL. Each container in a pod must have a unique name (DNS_LABEL). Cannot be updated.

| `.ports`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#containerport-core-v1[`array (ContainerPort core/v1)`]
| List of ports to expose from the container. Exposing a port here gives the system additional information about the network connections a container uses, but is primarily informational. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from the network. Cannot be updated.

| `.readinessProbe`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#probe-core-v1[`Probe core/v1`]
| Periodic probe of container service readiness. Container will be removed from service endpoints if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

| `.resources`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#resourcerequirements-core-v1[`ResourceRequirements core/v1`]
| Compute Resources required by this container. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/

| `.securityContext`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#securitycontext-core-v1[`SecurityContext core/v1`]
| Security options the pod should run with. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/security-context/ More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/

| `.startupProbe`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#probe-core-v1[`Probe core/v1`]
| StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. This is a beta feature enabled by the StartupProbe feature flag. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

| `.stdin`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false.

| `.stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

| `.terminationMessagePath`
| `string`
| Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.

| `.terminationMessagePolicy`
| `string`
| Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.

| `.tty`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.

| `.volumeDevices`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#volumedevice-core-v1[`array (VolumeDevice core/v1)`]
| volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.

| `.volumeMounts`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#volumemount-core-v1[`array (VolumeMount core/v1)`]
| Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated.

| `.workingDir`
| `string`
| Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot be updated.

| Property | Type | Description

| `continue`
| `string`
| continue may be set if the user set a limit on the number of items returned, and indicates that the server has more data available. The value is opaque and may be used to issue another request to the endpoint that served this list to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing a consistent list may not be possible if the server configuration has changed or more than a few minutes have passed. The resourceVersion field returned when using this continue value will be identical to the value in the first response, unless you have received this token from an error message.

| `remainingItemCount`
| `integer`
| remainingItemCount is the number of subsequent items in the list which are not included in this list response. If the list request contained label or field selectors, then the number of remaining items is unknown and the field will be left unset and omitted during serialization. If the list is complete (either because it is not chunking or because this is the last chunk), then there are no more remaining items and this field will be left unset and omitted during serialization. Servers older than v1.15 do not set this field. The intended use of the remainingItemCount is *estimating* the size of a collection. Clients should not rely on the remainingItemCount to be set or to be exact.

| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| String that identifies the server's internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and passed unmodified back to the server. Populated by the system. Read-only.

| `.stdin`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false.

| `.stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

| `.terminationMessagePath`
| `string`
| Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.

| `.terminationMessagePolicy`
| `string`
| Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.

| `.tty`
| `boolean`

Description::
  ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.

Type::
  `object`


[discrete]
=== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.annotations`
| `object (string)`
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

| `.clusterName`
| `string`
| The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.

| `.creationTimestamp`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#time-meta-v1[`Time meta/v1`]
| CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.deletionGracePeriodSeconds`
| `integer`
| Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.

| `.deletionTimestamp`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#time-meta-v1[`Time meta/v1`]
| DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.finalizers`
| `array (string)`
| Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

| `.generateName`
| `string`
| GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency

| `.generation`

| `.managedFields`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#managedfieldsentry-meta-v1[`array (ManagedFieldsEntry meta/v1)`]
| ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

| `.name`
| `string`
| Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

| `.namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

| `.ownerReferences`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#ownerreference-meta-v1[`array (OwnerReference meta/v1)`]
| List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

| `.resourceVersion`
| `string`
| An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

=== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| API version of the referent.

| `.fieldPath`
| `string`
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.name`
| `string`

| Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

The name for an init container or normal container must be unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers in a similar fashion. Init containers cannot currently be added or removed. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/

If the RuntimeClass admission controller is enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests. The RuntimeClass admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec, Overhead will be set to the value defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass, otherwise it will remain unset and treated as zero. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/20190226-pod-overhead.md This field is alpha-level as of Kubernetes v1.16, and is only honored by servers that enable the PodOverhead feature.

| `.priority`
| `integer`
| The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the priority.

| `.priorityClassName`
| `string`
| If specified, indicates the pod's priority. "system-node-critical" and "system-cluster-critical" are two special keywords which indicate the highest priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.

| `.readinessGates`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#podreadinessgate-core-v1[`array (PodReadinessGate core/v1)`]

| `.runtimeClassName`
| `string`
| RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group, which should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass resource matches the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the "legacy" RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition that uses the default runtime handler.

| `.shareProcessNamespace`
| `boolean`
| Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set. Optional: Default to false.

| `.subdomain`
| `string`
| If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be "<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>". If not specified, the pod will not have a domainname at all.

| `.terminationGracePeriodSeconds`
| `integer`
| Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.

[id="quantity-api-resource"]
== Quantity [api/resource]


Description::
  Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

&lt;quantity&gt;        ::&#x3D; &lt;signedNumber&gt;&lt;suffix&gt;
  (Note that &lt;suffix&gt; may be empty, from the &quot;&quot; case in &lt;decimalSI&gt;.)
&lt;digit&gt;           ::&#x3D; 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 &lt;digits&gt;          ::&#x3D; &lt;digit&gt; \| &lt;digit&gt;&lt;digits&gt; &lt;number&gt;          ::&#x3D; &lt;digits&gt; \| &lt;digits&gt;.&lt;digits&gt; \| &lt;digits&gt;. \| .&lt;digits&gt; &lt;sign&gt;            ::&#x3D; &quot;+&quot; \| &quot;-&quot; &lt;signedNumber&gt;    ::&#x3D; &lt;number&gt; \| &lt;sign&gt;&lt;number&gt; &lt;suffix&gt;          ::&#x3D; &lt;binarySI&gt; \| &lt;decimalExponent&gt; \| &lt;decimalSI&gt; &lt;binarySI&gt;        ::&#x3D; Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
&lt;decimalSI&gt;       ::&#x3D; m \| &quot;&quot; \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 &#x3D; 1Ki but 1000 &#x3D; 1k; I didn&#x27;t choose the capitalization.)
&lt;decimalExponent&gt; ::&#x3D; &quot;e&quot; &lt;signedNumber&gt; \| &quot;E&quot; &lt;signedNumber&gt;

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in &quot;canonical form&quot;. This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as &quot;1500m&quot;
  1.5Gi will be serialized as &quot;1536Mi&quot;

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don&#x27;t diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

[id="rawextension-pkg-runtime"]
== RawExtension [pkg/runtime]


Description::
  RawExtension is used to hold extensions in external versions.

To use this, make a field which has RawExtension as its type in your external, versioned struct, and Object in your internal struct. You also need to register your various plugin types.

// Internal package: type MyAPIObject struct {
	runtime.TypeMeta &#x60;json:&quot;,inline&quot;&#x60;
	MyPlugin runtime.Object &#x60;json:&quot;myPlugin&quot;&#x60;
} type PluginA struct {
	AOption string &#x60;json:&quot;aOption&quot;&#x60;
}

// External package: type MyAPIObject struct {
	runtime.TypeMeta &#x60;json:&quot;,inline&quot;&#x60;
	MyPlugin runtime.RawExtension &#x60;json:&quot;myPlugin&quot;&#x60;
} type PluginA struct {
	AOption string &#x60;json:&quot;aOption&quot;&#x60;
}

// On the wire, the JSON will look something like this: {
	&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;MyAPIObject&quot;,
	&quot;apiVersion&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,
	&quot;myPlugin&quot;: {
		&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;PluginA&quot;,
		&quot;aOption&quot;:&quot;foo&quot;,
	},
}

So what happens? Decode first uses json or yaml to unmarshal the serialized data into your external MyAPIObject. That causes the raw JSON to be stored, but not unpacked. The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion) into the internal struct. The runtime package&#x27;s DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing it in the Object. (TODO: In the case where the object is of an unknown type, a runtime.Unknown object will be created and stored.)

| If unspecified, each key-value pair in the Data field of the referenced Secret will be projected into the volume as a file whose name is the key and content is the value. If specified, the listed keys will be projected into the specified paths, and unlisted keys will not be present. If a key is specified which is not present in the Secret, the volume setup will error unless it is marked optional. Paths must be relative and may not contain the '..' path or start with '..'.

| Property | Type | Description

| `.allowPrivilegeEscalation`
| `boolean`
| AllowPrivilegeEscalation controls whether a process can gain more privileges than its parent process. This bool directly controls if the no_new_privs flag will be set on the container process. AllowPrivilegeEscalation is true always when the container is: 1) run as Privileged 2) has CAP_SYS_ADMIN

| `.capabilities`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#capabilities-core-v1[`Capabilities core/v1`]
| The capabilities to add/drop when running containers. Defaults to the default set of capabilities granted by the container runtime.

| `.privileged`
| `boolean`
| Run container in privileged mode. Processes in privileged containers are essentially equivalent to root on the host. Defaults to false.

| `.procMount`
| `string`
| procMount denotes the type of proc mount to use for the containers. The default is DefaultProcMount which uses the container runtime defaults for readonly paths and masked paths. This requires the ProcMountType feature flag to be enabled.

| `.runAsNonRoot`
| `boolean`
| Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

| `.runAsUser`
| `integer`
| The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

| `.seLinuxOptions`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#selinuxoptions-core-v1[`SELinuxOptions core/v1`]
| The SELinux context to be applied to the container. If unspecified, the container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each container.  May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

| `.windowsOptions`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#windowssecuritycontextoptions-core-v1[`WindowsSecurityContextOptions core/v1`]
| The Windows specific settings applied to all containers. If unspecified, the options from the PodSecurityContext will be used. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

[discrete]
=== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.fsType`
| `string`
| Filesystem type to mount. Must be a filesystem type supported by the host operating system. Ex. "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

| `.readOnly`
| `boolean`
| Defaults to false (read/write). ReadOnly here will force the ReadOnly setting in VolumeMounts.

| `.secretRef`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectreference-core-v1[`ObjectReference core/v1`]
| SecretRef specifies the secret to use for obtaining the StorageOS API credentials.  If not specified, default values will be attempted.

| `.volumeName`
| `string`
| VolumeName is the human-readable name of the StorageOS volume.  Volume names are only unique within a namespace.

| `.volumeNamespace`
| `string`
| VolumeNamespace specifies the scope of the volume within StorageOS.  If no namespace is specified then the Pod's namespace will be used.  This allows the Kubernetes name scoping to be mirrored within StorageOS for tighter integration. Set VolumeName to any name to override the default behaviour. Set to "default" if you are not using namespaces within StorageOS. Namespaces that do not pre-exist within StorageOS will be created.

| Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

| `.key`
| `string`
| Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

| `.operator`
| `string`
| Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

| `.tolerationSeconds`
| `integer`
| TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `maxSkew`
  - `topologyKey`
  - `whenUnsatisfiable`

[discrete]
=== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.labelSelector`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#labelselector-meta-v1[`LabelSelector meta/v1`]
| LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain.

| `.maxSkew`
| `integer`
| MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. It's the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in any two topology domains of a given topology type. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 1/1/0: \| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \| \|   P   \|   P   \|       \| - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

| `.topologyKey`
| `string`
| TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. It's a required field.

| `.whenUnsatisfiable`
| `string`
| WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to still schedule it It's considered as "Unsatisfiable" if and only if placing incoming pod on any topology violates "MaxSkew". For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: \| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \| \| P P P \|   P   \|   P   \| If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.
