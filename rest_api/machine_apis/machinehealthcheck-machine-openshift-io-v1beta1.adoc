== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| Specification of machine health check policy

| `status`
| `object`
| Most recently observed status of MachineHealthCheck resource

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `maxUnhealthy`
| `integer-or-string`
| Any farther remediation is only allowed if at most "MaxUnhealthy" machines selected by "selector" are not healthy. Expects either a postive integer value or a percentage value. Percentage values must be positive whole numbers and are capped at 100%. Both 0 and 0% are valid and will block all remediation.

| `nodeStartupTimeout`
| `string`
| Machines older than this duration without a node will be considered to have failed and will be remediated. To prevent Machines without Nodes from being removed, disable startup checks by setting this value explicitly to "0". Expects an unsigned duration string of decimal numbers each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, eg "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

| `remediationTemplate`
| `object`
| RemediationTemplate is a reference to a remediation template provided by an infrastructure provider. 
 This field is completely optional, when filled, the MachineHealthCheck controller creates a new object from the template referenced and hands off remediation of the machine to a controller that lives outside of Machine API Operator.

| `selector`
| `object`
| Label selector to match machines whose health will be exercised. Note: An empty selector will match all machines.

| `unhealthyConditions`
| `array`
| UnhealthyConditions contains a list of the conditions that determine whether a node is considered unhealthy.  The conditions are combined in a logical OR, i.e. if any of the conditions is met, the node is unhealthy.

| `unhealthyConditions[]`
| `object`
| UnhealthyCondition represents a Node condition type and value with a timeout specified as a duration.  When the named condition has been in the given status for at least the timeout value, a node is considered unhealthy.

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| API version of the referent.

| `fieldPath`
| `string`
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/

| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

| `uid`
| `string`
| UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids

| A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.

| `matchLabels`
| `object (string)`
| matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

|===
=== .spec.unhealthyConditions

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| Last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| A human readable message indicating details about the transition. This field may be empty.

| The reason for the condition's last transition in CamelCase. The specific API may choose whether or not this field is considered a guaranteed API. This field may not be empty.

| Severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately understand the current situation and act accordingly. The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False.

| `status`
| `string`
| Status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| Type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`

| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
