This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete. This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `conditions`
| `array`
| Conditions represents the observations of the ControlPlaneMachineSet's current state. Known .status.conditions.type are: Available, Degraded and Progressing.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource. --- This struct is intended for direct use as an array at the field path .status.conditions.  For example,
 type FooStatus struct{ // Represents the observations of a foo's current state. // Known .status.conditions.type are: "Available", "Progressing", and "Degraded" // +patchMergeKey=type // +patchStrategy=merge // +listType=map // +listMapKey=type Conditions []metav1.Condition `json:"conditions,omitempty" patchStrategy:"merge" patchMergeKey:"type" protobuf:"bytes,1,rep,name=conditions"`
 // other fields }

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| ObservedGeneration is the most recent generation observed for this ControlPlaneMachineSet. It corresponds to the ControlPlaneMachineSets's generation, which is updated on mutation by the API Server.

| `readyReplicas`
| `integer`
| ReadyReplicas is the number of Control Plane Machines created by the ControlPlaneMachineSet controller which are ready. Note that this value may be higher than the desired number of replicas while rolling updates are in-progress.

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| Replicas is the number of Control Plane Machines created by the ControlPlaneMachineSet controller. Note that during update operations this value may differ from the desired replica count.

| `unavailableReplicas`
| `integer`
| UnavailableReplicas is the number of Control Plane Machines that are still required before the ControlPlaneMachineSet reaches the desired available capacity. When this value is non-zero, the number of ReadyReplicas is less than the desired Replicas.

| `updatedReplicas`
| `integer`
| UpdatedReplicas is the number of non-terminated Control Plane Machines created by the ControlPlaneMachineSet controller that have the desired provider spec and are ready. This value is set to 0 when a change is detected to the desired spec. When the update strategy is RollingUpdate, this will also coincide with starting the process of updating the Machines. When the update strategy is OnDelete, this value will remain at 0 until a user deletes an existing replica and its replacement has become ready.

  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This may be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field may not be empty.

| `status`
| `string`
| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. --- Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important. The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)

.Global query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `sendInitialEvents`
| `boolean`
| `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
  when request started being processed.
- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
  Invalid error is returned.

Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

| fieldManager is a name associated with the actor or entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or 128 characters long, and only contain printable characters, as defined by https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsPrint. This field is required for apply requests (application/apply-patch) but optional for non-apply patch types (JsonPatch, MergePatch, StrategicMergePatch).
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
| `force`
| `boolean`
| Force is going to "force" Apply requests. It means user will re-acquire conflicting fields owned by other people. Force flag must be unset for non-apply patch requests.
