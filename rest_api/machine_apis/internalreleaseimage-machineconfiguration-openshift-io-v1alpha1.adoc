Description::
+
--
InternalReleaseImage is used to keep track and manage a set
of release bundles (OCP and OLM operators images) that are stored
into the control planes nodes.

Compatibility level 4: No compatibility is provided, the API can change at any point for any reason. These capabilities should not be used by applications needing long term support.

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

This may be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
The value should be a CamelCase string.
This field may not be empty.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `conditions`
| `array`
| conditions represent the observations of an internal release image current state. Valid types are:
Mounted, Installing, Available, Removing and Degraded.

If Mounted is true, that means that a valid ISO has been discovered and mounted on one of the cluster nodes.
If Installing is true, that means that a new release bundle is currently being copied on one (or more) cluster nodes, and not yet completed.
If Available is true, it means that the release has been previously installed on all the cluster nodes, and it can be used.
If Removing is true, it means that a release deletion is in progress on one (or more) cluster nodes, and not yet completed.
If Degraded is true, that means something has gone wrong (possibly on one or more cluster nodes).

In general, after installing a new release bundle, it is required to wait for the Conditions "Available" to become "True" (and all
the other conditions to be equal to "False") before being able to pull its content.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource.

| `image`
| `string`
| image is an OCP release image referenced by digest.
The format of the image pull spec is: host[:port][/namespace]/name@sha256:<digest>,
where the digest must be 64 characters long, and consist only of lowercase hexadecimal characters, a-f and 0-9.
The length of the whole spec must be between 1 to 447 characters.
The field is optional, and it will be provided after a release will be successfully installed.

| `name`
| `string`
| name indicates the desired release bundle identifier. This field is required and must be between 1 and 64 characters long.
The expected name format is ocp-release-bundle-<version>-<arch\|stream>.

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`

| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
