Type::
  `object`



== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| MachineSpec defines the desired state of Machine

| `status`
| `object`
| MachineStatus defines the observed state of Machine

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lifecycleHooks`
| `object`
| LifecycleHooks allow users to pause operations on the machine at certain predefined points within the machine lifecycle.

| `metadata`
| `object`
| ObjectMeta will autopopulate the Node created. Use this to indicate what labels, annotations, name prefix, etc., should be used when creating the Node.

| `providerID`
| `string`
| ProviderID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider. This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine. This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete. This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

| `providerSpec`
| `object`
| ProviderSpec details Provider-specific configuration to use during node creation.

| `taints`
| `array`
| The list of the taints to be applied to the corresponding Node in additive manner. This list will not overwrite any other taints added to the Node on an ongoing basis by other entities. These taints should be actively reconciled e.g. if you ask the machine controller to apply a taint and then manually remove the taint the machine controller will put it back) but not have the machine controller remove any taints

| `taints[]`
| `object`
| The node this Taint is attached to has the "effect" on any pod that does not tolerate the Taint.

--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `annotations`
| `object (string)`
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

| `generateName`
| `string`
| GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server. 
 If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header). 
 Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency

| `labels`
| `object (string)`

| `name`
| `string`
| Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. 
 Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

| `ownerReferences`
| `array`
| List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

| `ownerReferences[]`
| `object`
| OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an owning object. An owning object must be in the same namespace as the dependent, or be cluster-scoped, so there is no namespace field.

Examples of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported by the controller, or the responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured. 
 Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines can be added as events to the Machine object and/or logged in the controller's output.

| `errorReason`
| `string`
| ErrorReason will be set in the event that there is a terminal problem reconciling the Machine and will contain a succinct value suitable for machine interpretation.

| `message`
| `string`
| A human readable message indicating details about the transition. This field may be empty.

| `reason`
| `string`
| The reason for the condition's last transition in CamelCase. The specific API may choose whether or not this field is considered a guaranteed API. This field may not be empty.

| `fieldPath`
| `string`
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.

This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
