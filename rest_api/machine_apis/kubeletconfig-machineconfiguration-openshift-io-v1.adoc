| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta_v2-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta_v2 meta/v1`]

| `autoSizingReserved`
| `boolean`
| Automatically set optimal system reserved

| `kubeletConfig`
| ``
| The fields of the kubelet configuration are defined in kubernetes upstream. Please refer to the types defined in the version/commit used by OpenShift of the upstream kubernetes. It's important to note that, since the fields of the kubelet configuration are directly fetched from upstream the validation of those values is handled directly by the kubelet. Please refer to the upstream version of the relavent kubernetes for the valid values of these fields. Invalid values of the kubelet configuration fields may render cluster nodes unusable.

| `logLevel`
| `integer`
| logLevel defines the log level of the Kubelet

| `machineConfigPoolSelector`
| `object`
| A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.

| `tlsSecurityProfile`
| `object`
| tlsSecurityProfile specifies settings for TLS connections for ingresscontrollers. 
 If unset, the default is based on the apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster resource. 
 Note that when using the Old, Intermediate, and Modern profile types, the effective profile configuration is subject to change between releases. For example, given a specification to use the Intermediate profile deployed on release X.Y.Z, an upgrade to release X.Y.Z+1 may cause a new profile configuration to be applied to the ingress controller, resulting in a rollout. 
 Note that the minimum TLS version for ingress controllers is 1.1, and the maximum TLS version is 1.2.  An implication of this restriction is that the Modern TLS profile type cannot be used because it requires TLS 1.3.

| Property | Type | Description

| `matchExpressions`

| matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

| `matchExpressions[]`
| `object`
| A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.

| `matchLabels`
| `object (string)`
| matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

| `type`
| `string`
| type is one of Old, Intermediate, Modern or Custom. Custom provides the ability to specify individual TLS security profile parameters. Old, Intermediate and Modern are TLS security profiles based on: 
 https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations 
 The profiles are intent based, so they may change over time as new ciphers are developed and existing ciphers are found to be insecure.  Depending on precisely which ciphers are available to a process, the list may be reduced. 
 Note that the Modern profile is currently not supported because it is not yet well adopted by common software libraries.

  delete collection of KubeletConfig


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
