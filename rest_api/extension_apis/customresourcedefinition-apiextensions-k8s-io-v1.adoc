== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`

Required::
  - `group`
  - `names`
  - `scope`
  - `versions`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `conversion`
| `object`
| CustomResourceConversion describes how to convert different versions of a CR.

| `group`
| `string`
| group is the API group of the defined custom resource. The custom resources are served under `/apis/<group>/...`. Must match the name of the CustomResourceDefinition (in the form `<names.plural>.<group>`).

| `names`
| `object`
| CustomResourceDefinitionNames indicates the names to serve this CustomResourceDefinition

| `preserveUnknownFields`
| `boolean`
| preserveUnknownFields indicates that object fields which are not specified in the OpenAPI schema should be preserved when persisting to storage. apiVersion, kind, metadata and known fields inside metadata are always preserved. This field is deprecated in favor of setting `x-preserve-unknown-fields` to true in `spec.versions[*].schema.openAPIV3Schema`. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#field-pruning for details.

| `scope`
| `string`
| scope indicates whether the defined custom resource is cluster- or namespace-scoped. Allowed values are `Cluster` and `Namespaced`.

| `versions`
| `array`
| versions is the list of all API versions of the defined custom resource. Version names are used to compute the order in which served versions are listed in API discovery. If the version string is "kube-like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions start with a "v", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string "alpha" or "beta" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1, foo10.

| `versions[]`
| `object`
| CustomResourceDefinitionVersion describes a version for CRD.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `strategy`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `strategy`
| `string`
| strategy specifies how custom resources are converted between versions. Allowed values are: - `"None"`: The converter only change the apiVersion and would not touch any other field in the custom resource. - `"Webhook"`: API Server will call to an external webhook to do the conversion. Additional information
  is needed for this option. This requires spec.preserveUnknownFields to be false, and spec.conversion.webhook to be set.

| `webhook`
| `object`
| WebhookConversion describes how to call a conversion webhook

|===
=== .spec.conversion.webhook
Description::
+

Type::

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `clientConfig`
| `object`
| WebhookClientConfig contains the information to make a TLS connection with the webhook.

| `conversionReviewVersions`
| `array (string)`
| conversionReviewVersions is an ordered list of preferred `ConversionReview` versions the Webhook expects. The API server will use the first version in the list which it supports. If none of the versions specified in this list are supported by API server, conversion will fail for the custom resource. If a persisted Webhook configuration specifies allowed versions and does not include any versions known to the API Server, calls to the webhook will fail.

|===

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `caBundle`
| `string`
| caBundle is a PEM encoded CA bundle which will be used to validate the webhook's server certificate. If unspecified, system trust roots on the apiserver are used.

| `service`
| `object`
| ServiceReference holds a reference to Service.legacy.k8s.io

| `url`
| `string`
| url gives the location of the webhook, in standard URL form (`scheme://host:port/path`). Exactly one of `url` or `service` must be specified.

The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may also be an IP address.

Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy to turn up in a new cluster.

The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".

A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.

Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not allowed, either.

The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
