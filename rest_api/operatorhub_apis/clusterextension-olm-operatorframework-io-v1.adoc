|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `channels`
| `array (string)`
| channels is an optional reference to a set of channels belonging to
the package specified in the packageName field.

A "channel" is a package-author-defined stream of updates for an extension.

Each channel in the list must follow the DNS subdomain standard
as defined in [RFC 1123]. It must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters,
hyphens (-) or periods (.), start and end with an alphanumeric character,
and be no longer than 253 characters. No more than 256 channels can be specified.

When specified, it is used to constrain the set of installable bundles and
the automated upgrade path. This constraint is an AND operation with the
version field. For example:
  - Given channel is set to "foo"
  - Given version is set to ">=1.0.0, <1.5.0"
  - Only bundles that exist in channel "foo" AND satisfy the version range comparison will be considered installable
  - Automatic upgrades will be constrained to upgrade edges defined by the selected channel

When unspecified, upgrade edges across all channels will be used to identify valid automatic upgrade paths.

Some examples of valid values are:
  - 1.1.x
  - alpha
  - stable
  - stable-v1
  - v1-stable
  - dev-preview
  - preview
  - community

Some examples of invalid values are:
  - -some-channel
  - some-channel-

  - --default-channel

[RFC 1123]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123

| `packageName`
| `string`
| packageName is a reference to the name of the package to be installed
and is used to filter the content from catalogs.

packageName is required, immutable, and follows the DNS subdomain standard
as defined in [RFC 1123]. It must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters,
hyphens (-) or periods (.), start and end with an alphanumeric character,
and be no longer than 253 characters.

Some examples of valid values are:
  - some-package
  - 123-package
  - 1-package-2
  - somepackage

Some examples of invalid values are:
  - -some-package
  - some-package-
  - thisisareallylongpackagenamethatisgreaterthanthemaximumlength
  - some.package

[RFC 1123]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123

| `selector`
| `object`
| selector is an optional field that can be used
to filter the set of ClusterCatalogs used in the bundle
selection process.

When unspecified, all ClusterCatalogs will be used in
the bundle selection process.

| `upgradeConstraintPolicy`
| `string`
| upgradeConstraintPolicy is an optional field that controls whether
the upgrade path(s) defined in the catalog are enforced for the package
referenced in the packageName field.

Allowed values are: "CatalogProvided" or "SelfCertified", or omitted.

When this field is set to "CatalogProvided", automatic upgrades will only occur
when upgrade constraints specified by the package author are met.

When this field is set to "SelfCertified", the upgrade constraints specified by
the package author are ignored. This allows for upgrades and downgrades to
any version of the package. This is considered a dangerous operation as it
can lead to unknown and potentially disastrous outcomes, such as data
loss. It is assumed that users have independently verified changes when
using this option.

When this field is omitted, the default value is "CatalogProvided".

| `version`
| `string`
| version is an optional semver constraint (a specific version or range of versions). When unspecified, the latest version available will be installed.

Acceptable version ranges are no longer than 64 characters.
Version ranges are composed of comma- or space-delimited values and one or
more comparison operators, known as comparison strings. Additional
comparison strings can be added using the OR operator (\|\|).

# Range Comparisons

To specify a version range, you can use a comparison string like ">=3.0,
<3.6". When specifying a range, automatic updates will occur within that
range. The example comparison string means "install any version greater than
or equal to 3.0.0 but less than 3.6.0.". It also states intent that if any
upgrades are available within the version range after initial installation,
those upgrades should be automatically performed.

# Pinned Versions

To specify an exact version to install you can use a version range that
"pins" to a specific version. When pinning to a specific version, no
automatic updates will occur. An example of a pinned version range is
"0.6.0", which means "only install version 0.6.0 and never
upgrade from this version".

# Basic Comparison Operators

The basic comparison operators and their meanings are:
  - "=", equal (not aliased to an operator)
  - "!=", not equal
  - "<", less than
  - ">", greater than
  - ">=", greater than OR equal to
  - "<=", less than OR equal to

# Wildcard Comparisons

You can use the "x", "X", and "*" characters as wildcard characters in all
comparison operations. Some examples of using the wildcard characters:
  - "1.2.x", "1.2.X", and "1.2.*" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, < 1.3.0"
  - ">= 1.2.x", ">= 1.2.X", and ">= 1.2.*" is equivalent to ">= 1.2.0"
  - "<= 2.x", "<= 2.X", and "<= 2.*" is equivalent to "< 3"
  - "x", "X", and "*" is equivalent to ">= 0.0.0"

# Patch Release Comparisons

When you want to specify a minor version up to the next major version you
can use the "~" character to perform patch comparisons. Some examples:
  - "~1.2.3" is equivalent to ">=1.2.3, <1.3.0"
  - "~1" and "~1.x" is equivalent to ">=1, <2"
  - "~2.3" is equivalent to ">=2.3, <2.4"
  - "~1.2.x" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, <1.3.0"

# Major Release Comparisons

You can use the "^" character to make major release comparisons after a
stable 1.0.0 version is published. If there is no stable version published, // minor versions define the stability level. Some examples:
  - "^1.2.3" is equivalent to ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0"
  - "^1.2.x" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, <2.0.0"
  - "^2.3" is equivalent to ">=2.3, <3"
  - "^2.x" is equivalent to ">=2.0.0, <3"
  - "^0.2.3" is equivalent to ">=0.2.3, <0.3.0"
  - "^0.2" is equivalent to ">=0.2.0, <0.3.0"
  - "^0.0.3" is equvalent to ">=0.0.3, <0.0.4"
  - "^0.0" is equivalent to ">=0.0.0, <0.1.0"
  - "^0" is equivalent to ">=0.0.0, <1.0.0"

# OR Comparisons
You can use the "\|\|" character to represent an OR operation in the version
range. Some examples:
  - ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0 \|\| >3.0.0"
  - "^0 \|\| ^3 \|\| ^5"

[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
