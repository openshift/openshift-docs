== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec is the desired state of the ClusterCatalog.
spec is required.
The controller will work to ensure that the desired
catalog is unpacked and served over the catalog content HTTP server.

| `status`
| `object`
| status contains information about the state of the ClusterCatalog such as:
  - Whether or not the catalog contents are being served via the catalog content HTTP server
  - Whether or not the ClusterCatalog is progressing to a new state
  - A reference to the source from which the catalog contents were retrieved

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `availabilityMode`
| `string`
| availabilityMode allows users to define how the ClusterCatalog is made available to clients on the cluster.
availabilityMode is optional.

Allowed values are "Available" and "Unavailable" and omitted.

When omitted, the default value is "Available".

When set to "Available", the catalog contents will be unpacked and served over the catalog content HTTP server.
Setting the availabilityMode to "Available" tells clients that they should consider this ClusterCatalog
and its contents as usable.

When set to "Unavailable", the catalog contents will no longer be served over the catalog content HTTP server.
When set to this availabilityMode it should be interpreted the same as the ClusterCatalog not existing.
Setting the availabilityMode to "Unavailable" can be useful in scenarios where a user may not want
to delete the ClusterCatalog all together, but would still like it to be treated as if it doesn't exist.

| `priority`
| `integer`
| priority allows the user to define a priority for a ClusterCatalog.
priority is optional.

A ClusterCatalog's priority is used by clients as a tie-breaker between ClusterCatalogs that meet the client's requirements.
A higher number means higher priority.

It is up to clients to decide how to handle scenarios where multiple ClusterCatalogs with the same priority meet their requirements.
When deciding how to break the tie in this scenario, it is recommended that clients prompt their users for additional input.

When omitted, the default priority is 0 because that is the zero value of integers.

Negative numbers can be used to specify a priority lower than the default.
Positive numbers can be used to specify a priority higher than the default.

The lowest possible value is -2147483648.
The highest possible value is 2147483647.

| `source`
| `object`
| source allows a user to define the source of a catalog.
A "catalog" contains information on content that can be installed on a cluster.
Providing a catalog source makes the contents of the catalog discoverable and usable by
other on-cluster components.
These on-cluster components may do a variety of things with this information, such as
presenting the content in a GUI dashboard or installing content from the catalog on the cluster.
The catalog source must contain catalog metadata in the File-Based Catalog (FBC) format.
For more information on FBC, see https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/reference/file-based-catalogs/#docs.
source is a required field.

Below is a minimal example of a ClusterCatalogSpec that sources a catalog from an image:

 source:
   type: Image
   image:
     ref: quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog:latest

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `ref`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `pollIntervalMinutes`
| `integer`
| pollIntervalMinutes allows the user to set the interval, in minutes, at which the image source should be polled for new content.
pollIntervalMinutes is optional.
pollIntervalMinutes can not be specified when ref is a digest-based reference.

When omitted, the image will not be polled for new content.

| `ref`
| `string`
| ref allows users to define the reference to a container image containing Catalog contents.
ref is required.
ref can not be more than 1000 characters.

A reference can be broken down into 3 parts - the domain, name, and identifier.

The domain is typically the registry where an image is located.
It must be alphanumeric characters (lowercase and uppercase) separated by the "." character.
Hyphenation is allowed, but the domain must start and end with alphanumeric characters.
Specifying a port to use is also allowed by adding the ":" character followed by numeric values.
The port must be the last value in the domain.
Some examples of valid domain values are "registry.mydomain.io", "quay.io", "my-registry.io:8080".

The name is typically the repository in the registry where an image is located.
It must contain lowercase alphanumeric characters separated only by the ".", "\_", "\__", "-" characters.
Multiple names can be concatenated with the "/" character.
The domain and name are combined using the "/" character.
Some examples of valid name values are "operatorhubio/catalog", "catalog", "my-catalog.prod".
An example of the domain and name parts of a reference being combined is "quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog".

The identifier is typically the tag or digest for an image reference and is present at the end of the reference.
It starts with a separator character used to distinguish the end of the name and beginning of the identifier.
For a digest-based reference, the "@" character is the separator.
For a tag-based reference, the ":" character is the separator.
An identifier is required in the reference.

Digest-based references must contain an algorithm reference immediately after the "@" separator.
The algorithm reference must be followed by the ":" character and an encoded string.
The algorithm must start with an uppercase or lowercase alpha character followed by alphanumeric characters and may contain the "-", "\_", "+", and "." characters.
Some examples of valid algorithm values are "sha256", "sha256+b64u", "multihash+base58".
The encoded string following the algorithm must be hex digits (a-f, A-F, 0-9) and must be a minimum of 32 characters.

Tag-based references must begin with a word character (alphanumeric + "\_") followed by word characters or ".", and "-" characters.
The tag must not be longer than 127 characters.

An example of a valid digest-based image reference is "quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog@sha256:200d4ddb2a73594b91358fe6397424e975205bfbe44614f5846033cad64b3f05"
An example of a valid tag-based image reference is "quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog:latest"

=== .status
Description::
+
--
status contains information about the state of the ClusterCatalog such as:
  - Whether or not the catalog contents are being served via the catalog content HTTP server
  - Whether or not the ClusterCatalog is progressing to a new state
  - A reference to the source from which the catalog contents were retrieved
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `conditions`
| `array`
| conditions is a representation of the current state for this ClusterCatalog.

The current condition types are Serving and Progressing.

The Serving condition is used to represent whether or not the contents of the catalog is being served via the HTTP(S) web server.
When it has a status of True and a reason of Available, the contents of the catalog are being served.
When it has a status of False and a reason of Unavailable, the contents of the catalog are not being served because the contents are not yet available.
When it has a status of False and a reason of UserSpecifiedUnavailable, the contents of the catalog are not being served because the catalog has been intentionally marked as unavailable.

The Progressing condition is used to represent whether or not the ClusterCatalog is progressing or is ready to progress towards a new state.
When it has a status of True and a reason of Retrying, there was an error in the progression of the ClusterCatalog that may be resolved on subsequent reconciliation attempts.
When it has a status of True and a reason of Succeeded, the ClusterCatalog has successfully progressed to a new state and is ready to continue progressing.
When it has a status of False and a reason of Blocked, there was an error in the progression of the ClusterCatalog that requires manual intervention for recovery.

In the case that the Serving condition is True with reason Available and Progressing is True with reason Retrying, the previously fetched
catalog contents are still being served via the HTTP(S) web server while we are progressing towards serving a new version of the catalog
contents. This could occur when we've initially fetched the latest contents from the source for this catalog and when polling for changes
to the contents we identify that there are updates to the contents.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource.

| `lastUnpacked`
| `string`
| lastUnpacked represents the last time the contents of the
catalog were extracted from their source format. As an example,
when using an Image source, the OCI image will be pulled and the
image layers written to a file-system backed cache. We refer to the
act of this extraction from the source format as "unpacking".

| `resolvedSource`
| `object`
| resolvedSource contains information about the resolved source based on the source type.

| `urls`
| `object`
| urls contains the URLs that can be used to access the catalog.

| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
The value should be a CamelCase string.
This field may not be empty.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `base`
| `string`
| base is a cluster-internal URL that provides endpoints for
accessing the content of the catalog.

It is expected that clients append the path for the endpoint they wish
to access.

Currently, only a single endpoint is served and is accessible at the path
/api/v1.

The endpoints served for the v1 API are:
  - /all - this endpoint returns the entirety of the catalog contents in the FBC format

As the needs of users and clients of the evolve, new endpoints may be added.

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
