pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
The same key is forbidden to exist in both matchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
Also, matchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

| Property | Type | Description

| Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

| `key`

Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
tolerate all taints of a particular category.

| TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,

| `boolean`
| Mounted read-only if true, read-write otherwise (false or unspecified).
Defaults to false.

| `recursiveReadOnly`
| `string`
| RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
recursively.


If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.


If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
an error will be generated to indicate the reason.


If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).


If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

| `subPath`

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#emptydir

| `ephemeral`
| `object`
| ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
and deleted when the pod is removed.


Use this if:
a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
   tracking are needed,
c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
   information on the connection between this volume type
   and PersistentVolumeClaim).


Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
of an individual pod.


Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
more information.


A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
persistent volumes at the same time.

=== .spec.config.volumes[].ephemeral
Description::
+
--
ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
and deleted when the pod is removed.


Use this if:
a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
   tracking are needed,
c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
   information on the connection between this volume type
   and PersistentVolumeClaim).


Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
of an individual pod.


Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
more information.


A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
persistent volumes at the same time.

| `volumeClaimTemplate`
| `object`
| Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
`<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1

| `dataSource`
| `object`
| dataSource field can be used to specify either:
* An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)
* An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.
If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.

| `dataSourceRef`
| `object`
| dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.
(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1

| `volumeAttributesClassName`
| `string`
| volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.
If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined
in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,
it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
exists.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-attributes-classes/
(Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.

| `volumeMode`
| `string`
| volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim.
Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec.

This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
