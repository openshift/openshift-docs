== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `address`
| `string`
| Address is a host that OLM can use to connect to a pre-existing registry. Format: <registry-host or ip>:<port> Only used when SourceType = SourceTypeGrpc. Ignored when the Image field is set.

| `configMap`
| `string`
| ConfigMap is the name of the ConfigMap to be used to back a configmap-server registry. Only used when SourceType = SourceTypeConfigmap or SourceTypeInternal.

| `description`
| `string`
|

| `displayName`
| `string`
| Metadata

| `grpcPodConfig`
| `object`
| GrpcPodConfig exposes different overrides for the pod spec of the CatalogSource Pod. Only used when SourceType = SourceTypeGrpc and Image is set.

| `icon`
| `object`
|

| `image`
| `string`
| Image is an operator-registry container image to instantiate a registry-server with. Only used when SourceType = SourceTypeGrpc. If present, the address field is ignored.

| `priority`
| `integer`
| Priority field assigns a weight to the catalog source to prioritize them so that it can be consumed by the dependency resolver. Usage: Higher weight indicates that this catalog source is preferred over lower weighted catalog sources during dependency resolution. The range of the priority value can go from positive to negative in the range of int32. The default value to a catalog source with unassigned priority would be 0. The catalog source with the same priority values will be ranked lexicographically based on its name.

| `publisher`
| `string`
|

| `runAsRoot`
| `boolean`
| RunAsRoot allows admins to indicate that they wish to run the CatalogSource pod in a privileged pod as root.  This should only be enabled when running older catalog images which could not be run as non-root.

| `secrets`
| `array (string)`
| Secrets represent set of secrets that can be used to access the contents of the catalog. It is best to keep this list small, since each will need to be tried for every catalog entry.

| `sourceType`
| `string`
| SourceType is the type of source

| `updateStrategy`
| `object`
| UpdateStrategy defines how updated catalog source images can be discovered Consists of an interval that defines polling duration and an embedded strategy type

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `affinity`
| `object`
| Affinity is the catalog source's pod's affinity.

| `memoryTarget`
| `integer-or-string`
| MemoryTarget configures the $GOMEMLIMIT value for the gRPC catalog Pod. This is a soft memory limit for the server, which the runtime will attempt to meet but makes no guarantees that it will do so. If this value is set, the Pod will have the following modifications made to the container running the server: - the $GOMEMLIMIT environment variable will be set to this value in bytes - the memory request will be set to this value - the memory limit will be set to 200% of this value
 This field should be set if it's desired to reduce the footprint of a catalog server as much as possible, or if a catalog being served is very large and needs more than the default allocation. If your index image has a file- system cache, determine a good approximation for this value by doubling the size of the package cache at /tmp/cache/cache/packages.json in the index image.
 This field is best-effort; if unset, no default will be used and no Pod memory limit or $GOMEMLIMIT value will be set.

| `nodeSelector`
| `object (string)`
| NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a node. Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on that node.

| `priorityClassName`
| `string`
| If specified, indicates the pod's priority. If not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.

| `securityContextConfig`
| `string`
| SecurityContextConfig can be one of `legacy` or `restricted`. The CatalogSource's pod is either injected with the right pod.spec.securityContext and pod.spec.container[*].securityContext values to allow the pod to run in Pod Security Admission (PSA) `restricted` mode, or doesn't set these values at all, in which case the pod can only be run in PSA `baseline` or `privileged` namespaces. Currently if the SecurityContextConfig is unspecified, the default value of `legacy` is used. Specifying a value other than `legacy` or `restricted` result in a validation error. When using older catalog images, which could not be run in `restricted` mode, the SecurityContextConfig should be set to `legacy`.
 In a future version will the default will be set to `restricted`, catalog maintainers should rebuild their catalogs with a version of opm that supports running catalogSource pods in `restricted` mode to prepare for these changes.
 More information about PSA can be found here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/'

| `tolerations`
| `array`
| Tolerations are the catalog source's pod's tolerations.

| `tolerations[]`
| `object`
| The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.

| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `sendInitialEvents`
| `boolean`
| `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
  when request started being processed.
- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
  Invalid error is returned.

Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
| `force`
| `boolean`
| Force is going to "force" Apply requests. It means user will re-acquire conflicting fields owned by other people. Force flag must be unset for non-apply patch requests.
