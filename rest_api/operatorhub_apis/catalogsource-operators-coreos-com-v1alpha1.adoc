== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `address`
| `string`
| Address is a host that OLM can use to connect to a pre-existing registry.
Format: <registry-host or ip>:<port>
Only used when SourceType = SourceTypeGrpc.
Ignored when the Image field is set.

| `configMap`
| `string`
| ConfigMap is the name of the ConfigMap to be used to back a configmap-server registry.
Only used when SourceType = SourceTypeConfigmap or SourceTypeInternal.

| `description`
| `string`
| 

| `displayName`
| `string`
| Metadata

| `grpcPodConfig`
| `object`
| GrpcPodConfig exposes different overrides for the pod spec of the CatalogSource Pod.
Only used when SourceType = SourceTypeGrpc and Image is set.

| `icon`
| `object`
| 

| `image`
| `string`
| Image is an operator-registry container image to instantiate a registry-server with.
Only used when SourceType = SourceTypeGrpc.
If present, the address field is ignored.

| `priority`
| `integer`
| Priority field assigns a weight to the catalog source to prioritize them so that it can be consumed by the dependency resolver.
Usage:
Higher weight indicates that this catalog source is preferred over lower weighted catalog sources during dependency resolution.
The range of the priority value can go from positive to negative in the range of int32.
The default value to a catalog source with unassigned priority would be 0.
The catalog source with the same priority values will be ranked lexicographically based on its name.

| `publisher`
| `string`
| 

| `runAsRoot`
| `boolean`
| RunAsRoot allows admins to indicate that they wish to run the CatalogSource pod in a privileged
pod as root.  This should only be enabled when running older catalog images which could not be run as non-root.

| `secrets`
| `array (string)`
| Secrets represent set of secrets that can be used to access the contents of the catalog.
It is best to keep this list small, since each will need to be tried for every catalog entry.

| `sourceType`
| `string`
| SourceType is the type of source

| `updateStrategy`
| `object`
| UpdateStrategy defines how updated catalog source images can be discovered
Consists of an interval that defines polling duration and an embedded strategy type

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `affinity`
| `object`
| Affinity is the catalog source's pod's affinity.

| `extractContent`
| `object`
| ExtractContent configures the gRPC catalog Pod to extract catalog metadata from the provided index image and
use a well-known version of the `opm` server to expose it. The catalog index image that this CatalogSource is
configured to use *must* be using the file-based catalogs in order to utilize this feature.

| `memoryTarget`
| `integer-or-string`
| MemoryTarget configures the $GOMEMLIMIT value for the gRPC catalog Pod. This is a soft memory limit for the server,
which the runtime will attempt to meet but makes no guarantees that it will do so. If this value is set, the Pod
will have the following modifications made to the container running the server:
- the $GOMEMLIMIT environment variable will be set to this value in bytes
- the memory request will be set to this value


This field should be set if it's desired to reduce the footprint of a catalog server as much as possible, or if
a catalog being served is very large and needs more than the default allocation. If your index image has a file-
system cache, determine a good approximation for this value by doubling the size of the package cache at
/tmp/cache/cache/packages.json in the index image.


This field is best-effort; if unset, no default will be used and no Pod memory limit or $GOMEMLIMIT value will be set.

| `nodeSelector`
| `object (string)`
| NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a node.
Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on that node.

| `priorityClassName`
| `string`
| If specified, indicates the pod's priority.
If not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no
default.

| `securityContextConfig`
| `string`
| SecurityContextConfig can be one of `legacy` or `restricted`. The CatalogSource's pod is either injected with the
right pod.spec.securityContext and pod.spec.container[*].securityContext values to allow the pod to run in Pod
Security Admission (PSA) `restricted` mode, or doesn't set these values at all, in which case the pod can only be
run in PSA `baseline` or `privileged` namespaces. If the SecurityContextConfig is unspecified, the mode will be
determined by the namespace's PSA configuration. If the namespace is enforcing `restricted` mode, then the pod
will be configured as if `restricted` was specified. Otherwise, it will be configured as if `legacy` was
specified. Specifying a value other than `legacy` or `restricted` result in a validation error. When using older
catalog images, which can not run in `restricted` mode, the SecurityContextConfig should be set to `legacy`.


More information about PSA can be found here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/'

| `tolerations`
| `array`
| Tolerations are the catalog source's pod's tolerations.

| `tolerations[]`
| `object`
| The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches
the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.

Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
tolerate all taints of a particular category.

| `tolerationSeconds`
| `integer`
| TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

| `value`
| `string`
| Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

Required::
  - `lastTransitionTime`
  - `message`
  - `reason`
  - `status`
  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.
This may be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
The value should be a CamelCase string.
This field may not be empty.

| `status`
| `string`
| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.
---
Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)

| UID is a type that holds unique ID values, including UUIDs.  Because we
don't ONLY use UUIDs, this is an alias to string.  Being a type captures
intent and helps make sure that UIDs and names do not get conflated.

| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
