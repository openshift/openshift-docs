Description::
  ImageStreamImage represents an Image that is retrieved by image name from an ImageStream. User interfaces and regular users can use this resource to access the metadata details of a tagged image in the image stream history for viewing, since Image resources are not directly accessible to end users. A not found error will be returned if no such image is referenced by a tag within the ImageStream. Images are created when spec tags are set on an image stream that represent an image in an external registry, when pushing to the integrated registry, or when tagging an existing image from one image stream to another. The name of an image stream image is in the form "<STREAM>@<DIGEST>", where the digest is the content addressible identifier for the image (sha256:xxxxx...). You can use ImageStreamImages as the from.kind of an image stream spec tag to reference an image exactly. The only operations supported on the imagestreamimage endpoint are retrieving the image.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `image`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.image`
| `object`
| Image is an immutable representation of a container image and metadata at a point in time. Images are named by taking a hash of their contents (metadata and content) and any change in format, content, or metadata results in a new name. The images resource is primarily for use by cluster administrators and integrations like the cluster image registry - end users instead access images via the imagestreamtags or imagestreamimages resources. While image metadata is stored in the API, any integration that implements the container image registry API must provide its own storage for the raw manifest data, image config, and layer contents.

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `string`
| DockerImageConfig is a JSON blob that the runtime uses to set up the container. This is a part of manifest schema v2.

| `array`
| DockerImageLayers represents the layers in the image. May not be set if the image does not define that data.

| `dockerImageLayers[]`
| `object`
| ImageLayer represents a single layer of the image. Some images may have multiple layers. Some may have none.

| `dockerImageManifest`
| `string`
| DockerImageManifest is the raw JSON of the manifest

| `dockerImageManifestMediaType`
| `string`
| DockerImageManifestMediaType specifies the mediaType of manifest. This is a part of manifest schema v2.

| `dockerImageMetadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#rawextension-pkg-runtime[`RawExtension pkg/runtime`]
| DockerImageMetadata contains metadata about this image

| `dockerImageMetadataVersion`
| `string`
| DockerImageMetadataVersion conveys the version of the object, which if empty defaults to "1.0"

| `dockerImageReference`
| `string`
| DockerImageReference is the string that can be used to pull this image.

| `dockerImageSignatures`
| `array (string)`
| DockerImageSignatures provides the signatures as opaque blobs. This is a part of manifest schema v1.

| `kind`
| `string`

| `signatures`
| `array`
| Signatures holds all signatures of the image.

| `signatures[]`
| `object`
| ImageSignature holds a signature of an image. It allows to verify image identity and possibly other claims as long as the signature is trusted. Based on this information it is possible to restrict runnable images to those matching cluster-wide policy. Mandatory fields should be parsed by clients doing image verification. The others are parsed from signature's content by the server. They serve just an informative purpose.
