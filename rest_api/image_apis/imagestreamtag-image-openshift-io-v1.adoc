Description::
+
--
ImageStreamTag represents an Image that is retrieved by tag name from an ImageStream. Use this resource to interact with the tags and images in an image stream by tag, or to see the image details for a particular tag. The image associated with this resource is the most recently successfully tagged, imported, or pushed image (as described in the image stream status.tags.items list for this tag). If an import is in progress or has failed the previous image will be shown. Deleting an image stream tag clears both the status and spec fields of an image stream. If no image can be retrieved for a given tag, a not found error will be returned.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `local`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `local`
| `boolean`
| local will change the docker short image references (like "mysql" or "php:latest") on objects in this namespace to the image ID whenever they match this image stream, instead of reaching out to a remote registry. The name will be fully qualified to an image ID if found. The tag's referencePolicy is taken into account on the replaced value. Only works within the current namespace.

|===
..tag
Description::
+
--
TagReference specifies optional annotations for images using this tag and an optional reference to an ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage, or DockerImage this tag should track.

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `annotations`
| `object (string)`
| Optional; if specified, annotations that are applied to images retrieved via ImageStreamTags.

| `from`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectreference-core-v1[`ObjectReference core/v1`]
| Optional; if specified, a reference to another image that this tag should point to. Valid values are ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage, and DockerImage.  ImageStreamTag references can only reference a tag within this same ImageStream.

| `generation`
| `integer`
| Generation is a counter that tracks mutations to the spec tag (user intent). When a tag reference is changed the generation is set to match the current stream generation (which is incremented every time spec is changed). Other processes in the system like the image importer observe that the generation of spec tag is newer than the generation recorded in the status and use that as a trigger to import the newest remote tag. To trigger a new import, clients may set this value to zero which will reset the generation to the latest stream generation. Legacy clients will send this value as nil which will be merged with the current tag generation.

| `importPolicy`
| `object`
| TagImportPolicy controls how images related to this tag will be imported.

| `name`
| `string`
| Name of the tag

| `reference`
| `boolean`
| Reference states if the tag will be imported. Default value is false, which means the tag will be imported.

| `referencePolicy`
| `object`
| TagReferencePolicy describes how pull-specs for images in this image stream tag are generated when image change triggers in deployment configs or builds are resolved. This allows the image stream author to control how images are accessed.

| Property | Type | Description

| `insecure`
| `boolean`
| Insecure is true if the server may bypass certificate verification or connect directly over HTTP during image import.

| `scheduled`
| `boolean`
| Scheduled indicates to the server that this tag should be periodically checked to ensure it is up to date, and imported

|===
..tag.referencePolicy
Description::
+
--
TagReferencePolicy describes how pull-specs for images in this image stream tag are generated when image change triggers in deployment configs or builds are resolved. This allows the image stream author to control how images are accessed.
--

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `type`
| `string`
| Type determines how the image pull spec should be transformed when the image stream tag is used in deployment config triggers or new builds. The default value is `Source`, indicating the original location of the image should be used (if imported). The user may also specify `Local`, indicating that the pull spec should point to the integrated container image registry and leverage the registry's ability to proxy the pull to an upstream registry. `Local` allows the credentials used to pull this image to be managed from the image stream's namespace, so others on the platform can access a remote image but have no access to the remote secret. It also allows the image layers to be mirrored into the local registry which the images can still be pulled even if the upstream registry is unavailable.

.Global query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If &#x27;true&#x27;, then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
