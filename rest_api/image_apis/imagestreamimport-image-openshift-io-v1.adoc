Description::
+
--
The image stream import resource provides an easy way for a user to find and import container images from other container image registries into the server. Individual images or an entire image repository may be imported, and users may choose to see the results of the import prior to tagging the resulting images into the specified image stream.

This API is intended for end-user tools that need to see the metadata of the image prior to import (for instance, to generate an application from it). Clients that know the desired image can continue to create spec.tags directly into their image streams.

Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

| `images[]`
| `object`
| ImageImportStatus describes the result of an image import.

| `import`
| `object`
| An ImageStream stores a mapping of tags to images, metadata overrides that are applied when images are tagged in a stream, and an optional reference to a container image repository on a registry. Users typically update the spec.tags field to point to external images which are imported from container registries using credentials in your namespace with the pull secret type, or to existing image stream tags and images which are immediately accessible for tagging or pulling. The history of images applied to a tag is visible in the status.tags field and any user who can view an image stream is allowed to tag that image into their own image streams. Access to pull images from the integrated registry is granted by having the "get imagestreams/layers" permission on a given image stream. Users may remove a tag by deleting the imagestreamtag resource, which causes both spec and status for that tag to be removed. Image stream history is retained until an administrator runs the prune operation, which removes references that are no longer in use. To preserve a historical image, ensure there is a tag in spec pointing to that image by its digest.

=== .status.import
Description::
+
--
An ImageStream stores a mapping of tags to images, metadata overrides that are applied when images are tagged in a stream, and an optional reference to a container image repository on a registry. Users typically update the spec.tags field to point to external images which are imported from container registries using credentials in your namespace with the pull secret type, or to existing image stream tags and images which are immediately accessible for tagging or pulling. The history of images applied to a tag is visible in the status.tags field and any user who can view an image stream is allowed to tag that image into their own image streams. Access to pull images from the integrated registry is granted by having the "get imagestreams/layers" permission on a given image stream. Users may remove a tag by deleting the imagestreamtag resource, which causes both spec and status for that tag to be removed. Image stream history is retained until an administrator runs the prune operation, which removes references that are no longer in use. To preserve a historical image, ensure there is a tag in spec pointing to that image by its digest.

Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

| `generation`
| `integer`
| Generation is a counter that tracks mutations to the spec tag (user intent). When a tag reference is changed the generation is set to match the current stream generation (which is incremented every time spec is changed). Other processes in the system like the image importer observe that the generation of spec tag is newer than the generation recorded in the status and use that as a trigger to import the newest remote tag. To trigger a new import, clients may set this value to zero which will reset the generation to the latest stream generation. Legacy clients will send this value as nil which will be merged with the current tag generation.

The default value is `Source`, indicating the original location of the image should be used (if imported). The user may also specify `Local`, indicating that the pull spec should point to the integrated container image registry and leverage the registry's ability to proxy the pull to an upstream registry. `Local` allows the credentials used to pull this image to be managed from the image stream's namespace, so others on the platform can access a remote image but have no access to the remote secret. It also allows the image layers to be mirrored into the local registry which the images can still be pulled even if the upstream registry is unavailable.

Type::
  `array`




=== .status.repository.images[].manifests[]
Description::
+
--
Image is an immutable representation of a container image and metadata at a point in time. Images are named by taking a hash of their contents (metadata and content) and any change in format, content, or metadata results in a new name. The images resource is primarily for use by cluster administrators and integrations like the cluster image registry - end users instead access images via the imagestreamtags or imagestreamimages resources. While image metadata is stored in the API, any integration that implements the container image registry API must provide its own storage for the raw manifest data, image config, and layer contents.

Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldManager`

| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
