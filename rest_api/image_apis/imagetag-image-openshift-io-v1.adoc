Description::
+
--
ImageTag represents a single tag within an image stream and includes the spec, the status history, and the currently referenced image (if any) of the provided tag. This type replaces the ImageStreamTag by providing a full view of the tag. ImageTags are returned for every spec or status tag present on the image stream. If no tag exists in either form a not found error will be returned by the API. A create operation will succeed if no spec tag has already been defined and the spec field is set. Delete will remove both spec and status elements from the image stream.

Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `image`
| `object`
| Image is an immutable representation of a container image and metadata at a point in time. Images are named by taking a hash of their contents (metadata and content) and any change in format, content, or metadata results in a new name. The images resource is primarily for use by cluster administrators and integrations like the cluster image registry - end users instead access images via the imagestreamtags or imagestreamimages resources. While image metadata is stored in the API, any integration that implements the container image registry API must provide its own storage for the raw manifest data, image config, and layer contents.

Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| Optional; if specified, annotations that are applied to images retrieved via ImageStreamTags.

| `from`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-api-core-v1-ObjectReference[`ObjectReference`]
| Optional; if specified, a reference to another image that this tag should point to. Valid values are ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage, and DockerImage.  ImageStreamTag references can only reference a tag within this same ImageStream.

| `generation`
| `integer`
| Generation is a counter that tracks mutations to the spec tag (user intent). When a tag reference is changed the generation is set to match the current stream generation (which is incremented every time spec is changed). Other processes in the system like the image importer observe that the generation of spec tag is newer than the generation recorded in the status and use that as a trigger to import the newest remote tag. To trigger a new import, clients may set this value to zero which will reset the generation to the latest stream generation. Legacy clients will send this value as nil which will be merged with the current tag generation.

| `importPolicy`
| `object`
| TagImportPolicy controls how images related to this tag will be imported.

| `name`
| `string`
| Name of the tag

| `reference`
| `boolean`

| `referencePolicy`
| `object`
| TagReferencePolicy describes how pull-specs for images in this image stream tag are generated when image change triggers in deployment configs or builds are resolved. This allows the image stream author to control how images are accessed.

| `boolean`
| Insecure is true if the server may bypass certificate verification or connect directly over HTTP during image import.

|===
=== .spec.referencePolicy
Description::

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `type`
| `string`
| Type determines how the image pull spec should be transformed when the image stream tag is used in deployment config triggers or new builds. The default value is `Source`, indicating the original location of the image should be used (if imported). The user may also specify `Local`, indicating that the pull spec should point to the integrated container image registry and leverage the registry's ability to proxy the pull to an upstream registry. `Local` allows the credentials used to pull this image to be managed from the image stream's namespace, so others on the platform can access a remote image but have no access to the remote secret. It also allows the image layers to be mirrored into the local registry which the images can still be pulled even if the upstream registry is unavailable.

| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
