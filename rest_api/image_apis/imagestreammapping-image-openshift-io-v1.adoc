Description::
  ImageStreamMapping represents a mapping from a single image stream tag to a container image as well as the reference to the container image stream the image came from. This resource is used by privileged integrators to create an image resource and to associate it with an image stream in the status tags field. Creating an ImageStreamMapping will allow any user who can view the image stream to tag or pull that image, so only create mappings where the user has proven they have access to the image contents directly. The only operation supported for this resource is create and the metadata name and namespace should be set to the image stream containing the tag that should be updated.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `image`
  - `tag`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.image`
| `object`
| Image is an immutable representation of a container image and metadata at a point in time. Images are named by taking a hash of their contents (metadata and content) and any change in format, content, or metadata results in a new name. The images resource is primarily for use by cluster administrators and integrations like the cluster image registry - end users instead access images via the imagestreamtags or imagestreamimages resources. While image metadata is stored in the API, any integration that implements the container image registry API must provide its own storage for the raw manifest data, image config, and layer contents.

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| 

| `.tag`
| `string`
| Tag is a string value this image can be located with inside the stream.

| `dockerImageManifest`
| `string`
| DockerImageManifest is the raw JSON of the manifest

| `dockerImageManifestMediaType`

| xref:../objects/index.adoc#rawextension-pkg-runtime[`RawExtension pkg/runtime`]
| DockerImageMetadata contains metadata about this image

| `dockerImageMetadataVersion`
| `string`
| DockerImageMetadataVersion conveys the version of the object, which if empty defaults to "1.0"

| `dockerImageReference`
| `string`
| DockerImageReference is the string that can be used to pull this image.

| `dockerImageSignatures`
| `array (string)`
| DockerImageSignatures provides the signatures as opaque blobs. This is a part of manifest schema v1.

| `signatures[]`
| `object`
| ImageSignature holds a signature of an image. It allows to verify image identity and possibly other claims as long as the signature is trusted. Based on this information it is possible to restrict runnable images to those matching cluster-wide policy. Mandatory fields should be parsed by clients doing image verification. The others are parsed from signature's content by the server. They serve just an informative purpose.
