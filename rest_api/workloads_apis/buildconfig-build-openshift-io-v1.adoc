Description::
+
--
Build configurations define a build process for new container images. There are three types of builds possible - a container image build using a Dockerfile, a Source-to-Image build that uses a specially prepared base image that accepts source code that it can make runnable, and a custom build that can run // arbitrary container images as a base and accept the build parameters. Builds run on the cluster and on completion are pushed to the container image registry specified in the "output" section. A build can be triggered via a webhook, when the base image changes, or when a user manually requests a new build be // created.

Each build created by a build configuration is numbered and refers back to its parent configuration. Multiple builds can be triggered at once. Builds that do not have "output" set can be used to test code or run a verification build.

Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta_v2[`ObjectMeta_v2`]
| metadata is the standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| BuildConfigSpec describes when and how builds are created

| `status`

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `completionDeadlineSeconds`
| `integer`
| completionDeadlineSeconds is an optional duration in seconds, counted from the time when a build pod gets scheduled in the system, that the build may be active on a node before the system actively tries to terminate the build; value must be positive integer

| `failedBuildsHistoryLimit`
| `integer`
| failedBuildsHistoryLimit is the number of old failed builds to retain. When a BuildConfig is created, the 5 most recent failed builds are retained unless this value is set. If removed after the BuildConfig has been created, all failed builds are retained.

| `mountTrustedCA`
| `boolean`
| mountTrustedCA bind mounts the cluster's trusted certificate authorities, as defined in the cluster's proxy configuration, into the build. This lets processes within a build trust components signed by custom PKI certificate authorities, such as private artifact repositories and HTTPS proxies.

When this field is set to true, the contents of `/etc/pki/ca-trust` within the build are managed by the build container, and any changes to this directory or its subdirectories (for example - within a Dockerfile `RUN` instruction) are not persisted in the build's output image.

| `nodeSelector`
| `object (string)`
| nodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the build pod to fit on a node If nil, it can be overridden by default build nodeselector values for the cluster. If set to an empty map or a map with any values, default build nodeselector values are ignored.

| `output`
| `object`
| BuildOutput is input to a build strategy and describes the container image that the strategy should produce.

| `postCommit`
| `object`
| A BuildPostCommitSpec holds a build post commit hook specification. The hook executes a command in a temporary container running the build output image, immediately after the last layer of the image is committed and before the image is pushed to a registry. The command is executed with the current working directory ($PWD) set to the image's WORKDIR.

The build will be marked as failed if the hook execution fails. It will fail if the script or command return a non-zero exit code, or if there is any other error related to starting the temporary container.

There are five different ways to configure the hook. As an example, all forms below are equivalent and will execute `rake test --verbose`.

1. Shell script:

	   "postCommit": {
	     "script": "rake test --verbose",
	   }

	The above is a convenient form which is equivalent to:

	   "postCommit": {
	     "command": ["/bin/sh", "-ic"],
	     "args":    ["rake test --verbose"]
	   }

2. A command as the image entrypoint:

	   "postCommit": {
	     "commit": ["rake", "test", "--verbose"]
	   }

	Command overrides the image entrypoint in the exec form, as documented in
	Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint.

3. Pass arguments to the default entrypoint:

	       "postCommit": {
			      "args": ["rake", "test", "--verbose"]
		      }

	    This form is only useful if the image entrypoint can handle arguments.

4. Shell script with arguments:

	   "postCommit": {
	     "script": "rake test $1",
	     "args":   ["--verbose"]
	   }

	This form is useful if you need to pass arguments that would otherwise be
	hard to quote properly in the shell script. In the script, $0 will be
	"/bin/sh" and $1, $2, etc, are the positional arguments from Args.

5. Command with arguments:

	   "postCommit": {
	     "command": ["rake", "test"],
	     "args":    ["--verbose"]
	   }

	This form is equivalent to appending the arguments to the Command slice.

It is invalid to provide both Script and Command simultaneously. If none of the fields are specified, the hook is not executed.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `args`
| `array (string)`
| args is a list of arguments that are provided to either Command, Script or the container image's default entrypoint. The arguments are placed immediately after the command to be run.

| `command`
| `array (string)`
| command is the command to run. It may not be specified with Script. This might be needed if the image doesn't have `/bin/sh`, or if you do not want to use a shell. In all other cases, using Script might be more convenient.

| `script`
| `string`
| script is a shell script to be run with `/bin/sh -ic`. It may not be specified with Command. Use Script when a shell script is appropriate to execute the post build hook, for example for running unit tests with `rake test`. If you need control over the image entrypoint, or if the image does not have `/bin/sh`, use Command and/or Args. The `-i` flag is needed to support CentOS and RHEL images that use Software Collections (SCL), in order to have the appropriate collections enabled in the shell. E.g., in the Ruby image, this is necessary to make `ruby`, `bundle` and other binaries available in the PATH.

| buildArgs contains build arguments that will be resolved in the Dockerfile.  See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/arg for more details. NOTE: Only the 'name' and 'value' fields are supported. Any settings on the 'valueFrom' field are ignored.

| `dockerfilePath`
| `string`
| dockerfilePath is the path of the Dockerfile that will be used to build the container image, relative to the root of the context (contextDir). Defaults to `Dockerfile` if unset.

| `env`

| forcePull describes if the builder should pull the images from registry prior to building.

| `from`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-api-core-v1-ObjectReference[`ObjectReference`]
| from is a reference to an DockerImage, ImageStreamTag, or ImageStreamImage which overrides the FROM image in the Dockerfile for the build. If the Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds, this will replace the image in the last FROM directive of the file.

| `imageOptimizationPolicy`
| `string`
| imageOptimizationPolicy describes what optimizations the system can use when building images to reduce the final size or time spent building the image. The default policy is 'None' which means the final build image will be equivalent to an image created by the container image build API. The experimental policy 'SkipLayers' will avoid commiting new layers in between each image step, and will fail if the Dockerfile cannot provide compatibility with the 'None' policy. An additional experimental policy 'SkipLayersAndWarn' is the same as 'SkipLayers' but simply warns if compatibility cannot be preserved.

| `noCache`
| `boolean`
| noCache if set to true indicates that the container image build must be executed with the --no-cache=true flag

| `pullSecret`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-api-core-v1-LocalObjectReference_v2[`LocalObjectReference_v2`]

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
