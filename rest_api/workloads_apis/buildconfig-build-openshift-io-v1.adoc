Description::
  Build configurations define a build process for new container images. There are three types of builds possible - a container image build using a Dockerfile, a Source-to-Image build that uses a specially prepared base image that accepts source code that it can make runnable, and a custom build that can run // arbitrary container images as a base and accept the build parameters. Builds run on the cluster and on completion are pushed to the container image registry specified in the &quot;output&quot; section. A build can be triggered via a webhook, when the base image changes, or when a user manually requests a new build be // created.

Each build created by a build configuration is numbered and refers back to its parent configuration. Multiple builds can be triggered at once. Builds that do not have &quot;output&quot; set can be used to test code or run a verification build.

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.spec`
| `object`
| BuildConfigSpec describes when and how builds are created

| `.status`
| `object`
| BuildConfigStatus contains current state of the build config object.

|===
..spec
Description::
  BuildConfigSpec describes when and how builds are created

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `strategy`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `completionDeadlineSeconds`
| `integer`
| completionDeadlineSeconds is an optional duration in seconds, counted from the time when a build pod gets scheduled in the system, that the build may be active on a node before the system actively tries to terminate the build; value must be positive integer

| `failedBuildsHistoryLimit`
| `integer`
| failedBuildsHistoryLimit is the number of old failed builds to retain. When a BuildConfig is created, the 5 most recent failed builds are retained unless this value is set. If removed after the BuildConfig has been created, all failed builds are retained.

| `nodeSelector`
| `object (string)`
| nodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the build pod to fit on a node If nil, it can be overridden by default build nodeselector values for the cluster. If set to an empty map or a map with any values, default build nodeselector values are ignored.

| `output`
| `object`
| BuildOutput is input to a build strategy and describes the container image that the strategy should produce.

| `postCommit`
| `object`
| A BuildPostCommitSpec holds a build post commit hook specification. The hook executes a command in a temporary container running the build output image, immediately after the last layer of the image is committed and before the image is pushed to a registry. The command is executed with the current working directory ($PWD) set to the image's WORKDIR.

The build will be marked as failed if the hook execution fails. It will fail if the script or command return a non-zero exit code, or if there is any other error related to starting the temporary container.

There are five different ways to configure the hook. As an example, all forms below are equivalent and will execute `rake test --verbose`.

1. Shell script:

       "postCommit": {
         "script": "rake test --verbose",
       }

    The above is a convenient form which is equivalent to:

       "postCommit": {
         "command": ["/bin/sh", "-ic"],
         "args":    ["rake test --verbose"]
       }

2. A command as the image entrypoint:

       "postCommit": {
         "commit": ["rake", "test", "--verbose"]
       }

    Command overrides the image entrypoint in the exec form, as documented in
    Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint.

3. Pass arguments to the default entrypoint:

       "postCommit": {
		      "args": ["rake", "test", "--verbose"]
	      }

    This form is only useful if the image entrypoint can handle arguments.

4. Shell script with arguments:

       "postCommit": {
         "script": "rake test $1",
         "args":   ["--verbose"]
       }

    This form is useful if you need to pass arguments that would otherwise be
    hard to quote properly in the shell script. In the script, $0 will be
    "/bin/sh" and $1, $2, etc, are the positional arguments from Args.

5. Command with arguments:

       "postCommit": {
         "command": ["rake", "test"],
         "args":    ["--verbose"]
       }

    This form is equivalent to appending the arguments to the Command slice.

It is invalid to provide both Script and Command simultaneously. If none of the fields are specified, the hook is not executed.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `args`
| `array (string)`
| args is a list of arguments that are provided to either Command, Script or the container image's default entrypoint. The arguments are placed immediately after the command to be run.

| `command`
| `array (string)`
| command is the command to run. It may not be specified with Script. This might be needed if the image doesn't have `/bin/sh`, or if you do not want to use a shell. In all other cases, using Script might be more convenient.

| `script`
| `string`
| script is a shell script to be run with `/bin/sh -ic`. It may not be specified with Command. Use Script when a shell script is appropriate to execute the post build hook, for example for running unit tests with `rake test`. If you need control over the image entrypoint, or if the image does not have `/bin/sh`, use Command and/or Args. The `-i` flag is needed to support CentOS and RHEL images that use Software Collections (SCL), in order to have the appropriate collections enabled in the shell. E.g., in the Ruby image, this is necessary to make `ruby`, `bundle` and other binaries available in the PATH.

| from is a reference to an DockerImage, ImageStreamTag, or ImageStreamImage which overrides the FROM image in the Dockerfile for the build. If the Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds, this will replace the image in the last FROM directive of the file.

| `imageOptimizationPolicy`
| `string`
| imageOptimizationPolicy describes what optimizations the system can use when building images to reduce the final size or time spent building the image. The default policy is 'None' which means the final build image will be equivalent to an image created by the container image build API. The experimental policy 'SkipLayers' will avoid commiting new layers in between each image step, and will fail if the Dockerfile cannot provide compatibility with the 'None' policy. An additional experimental policy 'SkipLayersAndWarn' is the same as 'SkipLayers' but simply warns if compatibility cannot be preserved.

| `noCache`
| `boolean`
| noCache if set to true indicates that the container image build must be executed with the --no-cache=true flag

| `pullSecret`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#localobjectreference-core-v1[`LocalObjectReference core/v1`]

.Global guery parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If &#x27;true&#x27;, then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it&#x27;s 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
