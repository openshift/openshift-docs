Description::
+
--
Deployment Configs define the template for a pod and manages deploying new images or configuration changes. A single deployment configuration is usually analogous to a single micro-service. Can support many different deployment patterns, including full restart, customizable rolling updates, and  fully custom behaviors, as well as pre- and post- deployment hooks. Each individual deployment is represented as a replication controller.

A deployment is "triggered" when its configuration is changed or a tag in an Image Stream is changed. Triggers can be disabled to allow manual control over a deployment. The "strategy" determines how the deployment is carried out and may be changed at any time. The `latestVersion` field is updated when a new deployment is triggered by any means.

Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer). Deprecated: Use deployments or other means for declarative updates for pods instead.

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta_v2[`ObjectMeta_v2`]
| metadata is the standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `minReadySeconds`
| `integer`
| MinReadySeconds is the minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)

| `paused`
| `boolean`
| Paused indicates that the deployment config is paused resulting in no new deployments on template changes or changes in the template caused by other triggers.

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| Replicas is the number of desired replicas.

| `revisionHistoryLimit`
| `integer`
| RevisionHistoryLimit is the number of old ReplicationControllers to retain to allow for rollbacks. This field is a pointer to allow for differentiation between an explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 10. (This only applies to DeploymentConfigs created via the new group API resource, not the legacy resource.)

| `selector`
| `object (string)`
| Selector is a label query over pods that should match the Replicas count.

| `strategy`
| `object`
| DeploymentStrategy describes how to perform a deployment.

| `template`

| Template is the object that describes the pod that will be created if insufficient replicas are detected.

| `test`
| `boolean`
| Test ensures that this deployment config will have zero replicas except while a deployment is running. This allows the deployment config to be used as a continuous deployment test - triggering on images, running the deployment, and then succeeding or failing. Post strategy hooks and After actions can be used to integrate successful deployment with an action.

| `triggers`
| `array`
| Triggers determine how updates to a DeploymentConfig result in new deployments. If no triggers are defined, a new deployment can only occur as a result of an explicit client update to the DeploymentConfig with a new LatestVersion. If null, defaults to having a config change trigger.

| `triggers[]`
| `object`
| DeploymentTriggerPolicy describes a policy for a single trigger that results in a new deployment.

| `maxSurge`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-util-intstr-IntOrString[`IntOrString`]

This cannot be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0. By default, 25% is used.

Example: when this is set to 30%, the new RC can be scaled up by 30% immediately when the rolling update starts. Once old pods have been killed, new RC can be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of pods running at any time during the update is atmost 130% of original pods.

| `maxUnavailable`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-util-intstr-IntOrString[`IntOrString`]
| MaxUnavailable is the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of total pods at the start of update (ex: 10%). Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.

This cannot be 0 if MaxSurge is 0. By default, 25% is used.

Example: when this is set to 30%, the old RC can be scaled down by 30% immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old RC can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new RC, ensuring that at least 70% of original number of pods are available at all times during the update.
