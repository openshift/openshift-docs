Description::
+
--
MachineSet is the Schema for the machinesets API.

Type::
  `object`



== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| MachineSetSpec defines the desired state of MachineSet.

| `status`
| `object`
| MachineSetStatus defines the observed state of MachineSet.

|===
=== .spec
Description::
+
--
MachineSetSpec defines the desired state of MachineSet.
--

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `clusterName`
  - `selector`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `clusterName`
| `string`
| ClusterName is the name of the Cluster this object belongs to.

| `deletePolicy`
| `string`
| DeletePolicy defines the policy used to identify nodes to delete when downscaling.
Defaults to "Random".  Valid values are "Random, "Newest", "Oldest"

| `minReadySeconds`
| `integer`
| MinReadySeconds is the minimum number of seconds for which a Node for a newly created machine should be ready before considering the replica available.
Defaults to 0 (machine will be considered available as soon as the Node is ready)

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| Replicas is the number of desired replicas.
This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and unspecified.


Defaults to:
* if the Kubernetes autoscaler min size and max size annotations are set:
  - if it's a new MachineSet, use min size
  - if the replicas field of the old MachineSet is < min size, use min size
  - if the replicas field of the old MachineSet is > max size, use max size
  - if the replicas field of the old MachineSet is in the (min size, max size) range, keep the value from the oldMS
* otherwise use 1
Note: Defaulting will be run whenever the replicas field is not set:
* A new MachineSet is created with replicas not set.
* On an existing MachineSet the replicas field was first set and is now unset.
Those cases are especially relevant for the following Kubernetes autoscaler use cases:
* A new MachineSet is created and replicas should be managed by the autoscaler
* An existing MachineSet which initially wasn't controlled by the autoscaler
  should be later controlled by the autoscaler

| `selector`
| `object`
| Selector is a label query over machines that should match the replica count.
Label keys and values that must match in order to be controlled by this MachineSet.
It must match the machine template's labels.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors

| `template`
| `object`

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `bootstrap`
  - `clusterName`
  - `infrastructureRef`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `bootstrap`
| `object`
| Bootstrap is a reference to a local struct which encapsulates
fields to configure the Machine’s bootstrapping mechanism.

| `clusterName`
| `string`
| ClusterName is the name of the Cluster this object belongs to.

| `failureDomain`
| `string`
| FailureDomain is the failure domain the machine will be created in.
Must match a key in the FailureDomains map stored on the cluster object.

| `infrastructureRef`
| `object`
| InfrastructureRef is a required reference to a custom resource
offered by an infrastructure provider.

| `nodeDeletionTimeout`
| `string`
| NodeDeletionTimeout defines how long the controller will attempt to delete the Node that the Machine
hosts after the Machine is marked for deletion. A duration of 0 will retry deletion indefinitely.
Defaults to 10 seconds.

| `nodeDrainTimeout`
| `string`
| NodeDrainTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on draining a node.
The default value is 0, meaning that the node can be drained without any time limitations.
NOTE: NodeDrainTimeout is different from `kubectl drain --timeout`

| `nodeVolumeDetachTimeout`
| `string`
| NodeVolumeDetachTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on waiting for all volumes
to be detached. The default value is 0, meaning that the volumes can be detached without any time limitations.

| `providerID`
| `string`
| ProviderID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider.
This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.
This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

| `version`
| `string`
| Version defines the desired Kubernetes version.
This field is meant to be optionally used by bootstrap providers.

|===
=== .spec.template.spec.bootstrap
Description::
+
--
Bootstrap is a reference to a local struct which encapsulates
fields to configure the Machine’s bootstrapping mechanism.
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `configRef`
| `object`
| ConfigRef is a reference to a bootstrap provider-specific resource
that holds configuration details. The reference is optional to
allow users/operators to specify Bootstrap.DataSecretName without
the need of a controller.

| `dataSecretName`
| `string`
| DataSecretName is the name of the secret that stores the bootstrap data script.
If nil, the Machine should remain in the Pending state.

|===
=== .spec.template.spec.bootstrap.configRef
Description::
+
--
ConfigRef is a reference to a bootstrap provider-specific resource
that holds configuration details. The reference is optional to
allow users/operators to specify Bootstrap.DataSecretName without
the need of a controller.
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| API version of the referent.

| `fieldPath`
| `string`
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
"spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
referencing a part of an object.
TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.

|===
=== .status
Description::
+
--
MachineSetStatus defines the observed state of MachineSet.
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `availableReplicas`
| `integer`
| The number of available replicas (ready for at least minReadySeconds) for this MachineSet.

| `conditions`
| `array`
| Conditions defines current service state of the MachineSet.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| Condition defines an observation of a Cluster API resource operational state.

| `failureMessage`
| `string`
| 

| `failureReason`
| `string`
| In the event that there is a terminal problem reconciling the
replicas, both FailureReason and FailureMessage will be set. FailureReason
will be populated with a succinct value suitable for machine
interpretation, while FailureMessage will contain a more verbose
string suitable for logging and human consumption.


These fields should not be set for transitive errors that a
controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of
the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the
responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.


Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the
controller's output.

| `fullyLabeledReplicas`
| `integer`
| The number of replicas that have labels matching the labels of the machine template of the MachineSet.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| ObservedGeneration reflects the generation of the most recently observed MachineSet.

| `readyReplicas`
| `integer`
| The number of ready replicas for this MachineSet. A machine is considered ready when the node has been created and is "Ready".

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| Replicas is the most recently observed number of replicas.

| `selector`
| `string`
| Selector is the same as the label selector but in the string format to avoid introspection
by clients. The string will be in the same format as the query-param syntax.
More info about label selectors: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels#label-selectors

|===
=== .status.conditions
Description::
+
--
Conditions defines current service state of the MachineSet.
--

Type::
  `array`




=== .status.conditions[]
Description::
+
--
Condition defines an observation of a Cluster API resource operational state.
--

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `lastTransitionTime`
  - `status`
  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| Last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| A human readable message indicating details about the transition.
This field may be empty.

| `reason`
| `string`
| The reason for the condition's last transition in CamelCase.
The specific API may choose whether or not this field is considered a guaranteed API.
This field may not be empty.

| `severity`
| `string`
| Severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately
understand the current situation and act accordingly.
The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False.

| `status`
| `string`
| Status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| Type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.
Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions
can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.

|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
