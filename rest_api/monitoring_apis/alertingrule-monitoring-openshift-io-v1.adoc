Description::
+
--
AlertingRule represents a set of user-defined Prometheus rule groups containing alerting rules.  This resource is the supported method for cluster admins to create alerts based on metrics recorded by the platform monitoring stack in OpenShift, i.e. the Prometheus instance deployed to the openshift-monitoring namespace.  You might use this to create custom alerting rules not shipped with OpenShift based on metrics from components such as the node_exporter, which provides machine-level metrics such as CPU usage, or kube-state-metrics, which provides metrics on Kubernetes usage.
 The API is mostly compatible with the upstream PrometheusRule type from the prometheus-operator.  The primary difference being that recording rules are not allowed here -- only alerting rules.  For each AlertingRule resource created, a corresponding PrometheusRule will be created in the openshift-monitoring namespace.  OpenShift requires admins to use the AlertingRule resource rather than the upstream type in order to allow better OpenShift specific defaulting and validation, while not modifying the upstream APIs directly.
 You can find upstream API documentation for PrometheusRule resources here:
 https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md
 Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `groups`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `groups`
| `array`
| groups is a list of grouped alerting rules.  Rule groups are the unit at which Prometheus parallelizes rule processing.  All rules in a single group share a configured evaluation interval.  All rules in the group will be processed together on this interval, sequentially, and all rules will be processed.
 It's common to group related alerting rules into a single AlertingRule resources, and within that resource, closely related alerts, or simply alerts with the same interval, into individual groups.  You are also free to create AlertingRule resources with only a single rule group, but be aware that this can have a performance impact on Prometheus if the group is extremely large or has very complex query expressions to evaluate. Spreading very complex rules across multiple groups to allow them to be processed in parallel is also a common use-case.

| `groups[]`
| `object`
| RuleGroup is a list of sequentially evaluated alerting rules.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `interval`
| `string`
| interval is how often rules in the group are evaluated.  If not specified, it defaults to the global.evaluation_interval configured in Prometheus, which itself defaults to 30 seconds.  You can check if this value has been modified from the default on your cluster by inspecting the platform Prometheus configuration: The relevant field in that resource is: spec.evaluationInterval

| `name`
| `string`
| name is the name of the group.

| `rules`
| `array`
| rules is a list of sequentially evaluated alerting rules.  Prometheus may process rule groups in parallel, but rules within a single group are always processed sequentially, and all rules are processed.

| `rules[]`

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `alert`
  - `expr`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `alert`
| `string`
| alert is the name of the alert. Must be a valid label value, i.e. may contain any Unicode character.

| `annotations`
| `object (string)`
| annotations to add to each alert.  These are values that can be used to store longer additional information that you won't query on, such as alert descriptions or runbook links.

| `expr`
| `integer-or-string`
| expr is the PromQL expression to evaluate. Every evaluation cycle this is evaluated at the current time, and all resultant time series become pending or firing alerts.  This is most often a string representing a PromQL expression, e.g.: mapi_current_pending_csr > mapi_max_pending_csr In rare cases this could be a simple integer, e.g. a simple "1" if the intent is to create an alert that is always firing.  This is sometimes used to create an always-firing "Watchdog" alert in order to ensure the alerting pipeline is functional.

| `for`
| `string`
| for is the time period after which alerts are considered firing after first returning results.  Alerts which have not yet fired for long enough are considered pending.

| `labels`
| `object (string)`
| labels to add or overwrite for each alert.  The results of the PromQL expression for the alert will result in an existing set of labels for the alert, after evaluating the expression, for any label specified here with the same name as a label in that set, the label here wins and overwrites the previous value.  These should typically be short identifying values that may be useful to query against.  A common example is the alert severity, where one sets `severity: warning` under the `labels` key:

.Global query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `sendInitialEvents`
| `boolean`
| `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
  when request started being processed.
- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
  Invalid error is returned.

Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

| The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
| `orphanDependents`
| `boolean`
| Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
| `propagationPolicy`
| `string`
| Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldManager`
| `string`
| fieldManager is a name associated with the actor or entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or 128 characters long, and only contain printable characters, as defined by https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsPrint. This field is required for apply requests (application/apply-patch) but optional for non-apply patch types (JsonPatch, MergePatch, StrategicMergePatch).
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
| `force`
| `boolean`
| Force is going to "force" Apply requests. It means user will re-acquire conflicting fields owned by other people. Force flag must be unset for non-apply patch requests.
