Description::
+
--
The `Probe` custom resource definition (CRD) defines how to scrape metrics from prober exporters such as the [blackbox exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter).

The `Probe` resource needs 2 pieces of information:
* The list of probed addresses which can be defined statically or by discovering Kubernetes Ingress objects.
* The prober which exposes the availability of probed endpoints (over various protocols such HTTP, TCP, ICMP, ...) as Prometheus metrics.

`Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` objects select `Probe` objects using label and namespace selectors.

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
