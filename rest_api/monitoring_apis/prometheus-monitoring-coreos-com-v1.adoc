Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| Specification of the desired behavior of the Prometheus cluster. More info:
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

| `status`
| `object`
| Most recent observed status of the Prometheus cluster. Read-only.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `additionalAlertManagerConfigs`
| `object`
| AdditionalAlertManagerConfigs specifies a key of a Secret containing
additional Prometheus Alertmanager configurations. The Alertmanager
configurations are appended to the configuration generated by the
Prometheus Operator. They must be formatted according to the official
Prometheus documentation:


https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#alertmanager_config


The user is responsible for making sure that the configurations are valid


Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to break
upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes
to ensure that no incompatible AlertManager configs are going to break
Prometheus after the upgrade.

| `additionalAlertRelabelConfigs`
| `object`
| AdditionalAlertRelabelConfigs specifies a key of a Secret containing
additional Prometheus alert relabel configurations. The alert relabel
configurations are appended to the configuration generated by the
Prometheus Operator. They must be formatted according to the official
Prometheus documentation:


https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#alert_relabel_configs


The user is responsible for making sure that the configurations are valid


Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to break
upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes
to ensure that no incompatible alert relabel configs are going to break
Prometheus after the upgrade.

| `additionalArgs`
| `array`
| AdditionalArgs allows setting additional arguments for the 'prometheus' container.


It is intended for e.g. activating hidden flags which are not supported by
the dedicated configuration options yet. The arguments are passed as-is to the
Prometheus container which may cause issues if they are invalid or not supported
by the given Prometheus version.


In case of an argument conflict (e.g. an argument which is already set by the
operator itself) or when providing an invalid argument, the reconciliation will
fail and an error will be logged.

| `additionalArgs[]`
| `object`
| Argument as part of the AdditionalArgs list.

| `additionalScrapeConfigs`
| `object`
| AdditionalScrapeConfigs allows specifying a key of a Secret containing
additional Prometheus scrape configurations. Scrape configurations
specified are appended to the configurations generated by the Prometheus
Operator. Job configurations specified must have the form as specified
in the official Prometheus documentation:
https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config.
As scrape configs are appended, the user is responsible to make sure it
is valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to
break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release
notes to ensure that no incompatible scrape configs are going to break
Prometheus after the upgrade.

| `affinity`
| `object`
| Defines the Pods' affinity scheduling rules if specified.

| `alerting`
| `object`
| Defines the settings related to Alertmanager.

| `allowOverlappingBlocks`
| `boolean`
| AllowOverlappingBlocks enables vertical compaction and vertical query
merge in Prometheus.


Deprecated: this flag has no effect for Prometheus >= 2.39.0 where overlapping blocks are enabled by default.

| `apiserverConfig`
| `object`
| APIServerConfig allows specifying a host and auth methods to access the
Kuberntees API server.
If null, Prometheus is assumed to run inside of the cluster: it will
discover the API servers automatically and use the Pod's CA certificate
and bearer token file at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/.

| `arbitraryFSAccessThroughSMs`
| `object`
| When true, ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor and Probe object are forbidden to
reference arbitrary files on the file system of the 'prometheus'
container.
When a ServiceMonitor's endpoint specifies a `bearerTokenFile` value
(e.g.  '/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token'), a
malicious target can get access to the Prometheus service account's
token in the Prometheus' scrape request. Setting
`spec.arbitraryFSAccessThroughSM` to 'true' would prevent the attack.
Users should instead provide the credentials using the
`spec.bearerTokenSecret` field.

| `automountServiceAccountToken`
| `boolean`
| AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether a service account token should be automatically mounted in the pod.
If the field isn't set, the operator mounts the service account token by default.


**Warning:** be aware that by default, Prometheus requires the service account token for Kubernetes service discovery.
It is possible to use strategic merge patch to project the service account token into the 'prometheus' container.

| `baseImage`
| `string`
| Deprecated: use 'spec.image' instead.

| `bodySizeLimit`
| `string`
| BodySizeLimit defines per-scrape on response body size.
Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.45.0 and newer.


Note that the global limit only applies to scrape objects that don't specify an explicit limit value.
If you want to enforce a maximum limit for all scrape objects, refer to enforcedBodySizeLimit.

| `configMaps`
| `array (string)`
| ConfigMaps is a list of ConfigMaps in the same namespace as the Prometheus
object, which shall be mounted into the Prometheus Pods.
Each ConfigMap is added to the StatefulSet definition as a volume named `configmap-<configmap-name>`.
The ConfigMaps are mounted into /etc/prometheus/configmaps/<configmap-name> in the 'prometheus' container.

| `containers`
| `array`
| Containers allows injecting additional containers or modifying operator
generated containers. This can be used to allow adding an authentication
proxy to the Pods or to change the behavior of an operator generated
container. Containers described here modify an operator generated
container if they share the same name and modifications are done via a
strategic merge patch.


The names of containers managed by the operator are:
* `prometheus`
* `config-reloader`
* `thanos-sidecar`


Overriding containers is entirely outside the scope of what the
maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour
may break at any time without notice.

| `containers[]`
| `object`
| A single application container that you want to run within a pod.

| `disableCompaction`
| `boolean`
| When true, the Prometheus compaction is disabled.

| `enableAdminAPI`
| `boolean`
| Enables access to the Prometheus web admin API.


WARNING: Enabling the admin APIs enables mutating endpoints, to delete data,
shutdown Prometheus, and more. Enabling this should be done with care and the
user is advised to add additional authentication authorization via a proxy to
ensure only clients authorized to perform these actions can do so.


For more information:
https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#tsdb-admin-apis

| `enableFeatures`
| `array (string)`
| Enable access to Prometheus feature flags. By default, no features are enabled.


Enabling features which are disabled by default is entirely outside the
scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept
that this behaviour may break at any time without notice.


For more information see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/

| `enableRemoteWriteReceiver`
| `boolean`
| Enable Prometheus to be used as a receiver for the Prometheus remote
write protocol.


WARNING: This is not considered an efficient way of ingesting samples.
Use it with caution for specific low-volume use cases.
It is not suitable for replacing the ingestion via scraping and turning
Prometheus into a push-based metrics collection system.
For more information see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#remote-write-receiver

* Scrape objects with a labelValueLengthLimit value greater than enforcedLabelValueLengthLimit are set to enforcedLabelValueLengthLimit.

| `enforcedNamespaceLabel`
| `string`
| When not empty, a label will be added to:


1. All metrics scraped from `ServiceMonitor`, `PodMonitor`, `Probe` and `ScrapeConfig` objects.
2. All metrics generated from recording rules defined in `PrometheusRule` objects.
3. All alerts generated from alerting rules defined in `PrometheusRule` objects.
4. All vector selectors of PromQL expressions defined in `PrometheusRule` objects.


The label will not added for objects referenced in `spec.excludedFromEnforcement`.


The label's name is this field's value.
The label's value is the namespace of the `ServiceMonitor`,
`PodMonitor`, `Probe`, `PrometheusRule` or `ScrapeConfig` object.

| `enforcedSampleLimit`
| `integer`
| When defined, enforcedSampleLimit specifies a global limit on the number
of scraped samples that will be accepted. This overrides any
`spec.sampleLimit` set by ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, Probe objects
unless `spec.sampleLimit` is greater than zero and less than

It is meant to be used by admins to keep the overall number of
samples/series under a desired limit.


When both `enforcedSampleLimit` and `sampleLimit` are defined and greater than zero, the following rules apply:
* Scrape objects without a defined sampleLimit value will inherit the global sampleLimit value (Prometheus >= 2.45.0) or the enforcedSampleLimit value (Prometheus < v2.45.0).

* Scrape objects with a targetLimit value greater than enforcedTargetLimit are set to enforcedTargetLimit.

| `evaluationInterval`
| `string`
| Interval between rule evaluations.
Default: "30s"

| `excludedFromEnforcement`
| `array`
| List of references to PodMonitor, ServiceMonitor, Probe and PrometheusRule objects
to be excluded from enforcing a namespace label of origin.


It is only applicable if `spec.enforcedNamespaceLabel` set to true.

| `excludedFromEnforcement[]`

It requires to enable the `exemplar-storage` feature flag to be effective.

| `externalLabels`
| `object (string)`
| The labels to add to any time series or alerts when communicating with
external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
Labels defined by `spec.replicaExternalLabelName` and
`spec.prometheusExternalLabelName` take precedence over this list.

| `externalUrl`
| `string`
| The external URL under which the Prometheus service is externally
available. This is necessary to generate correct URLs (for instance if
Prometheus is accessible behind an Ingress resource).

| `hostAliases`
| `array`
| Optional list of hosts and IPs that will be injected into the Pod's
hosts file if specified.

| `hostAliases[]`
| `object`
| HostAlias holds the mapping between IP and hostnames that will be injected as an entry in the
pod's hosts file.

| `hostNetwork`
| `boolean`
| Use the host's network namespace if true.


Make sure to understand the security implications if you want to enable
it (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/).


When hostNetwork is enabled, this will set the DNS policy to
`ClusterFirstWithHostNet` automatically.

| `ignoreNamespaceSelectors`
| `boolean`
| When true, `spec.namespaceSelector` from all PodMonitor, ServiceMonitor
and Probe objects will be ignored. They will only discover targets
within the namespace of the PodMonitor, ServiceMonitor and Probe
object.

| `image`
| `string`
| Container image name for Prometheus. If specified, it takes precedence
over the `spec.baseImage`, `spec.tag` and `spec.sha` fields.


Specifying `spec.version` is still necessary to ensure the Prometheus
Operator knows which version of Prometheus is being configured.


If neither `spec.image` nor `spec.baseImage` are defined, the operator
will use the latest upstream version of Prometheus available at the time
when the operator was released.

| `imagePullPolicy`
| `string`
| Image pull policy for the 'prometheus', 'init-config-reloader' and 'config-reloader' containers.
See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#image-pull-policy for more details.

| `imagePullSecrets[]`
| `object`
| LocalObjectReference contains enough information to let you locate the
referenced object inside the same namespace.

| `initContainers`
| `array`
| InitContainers allows injecting initContainers to the Pod definition. Those
can be used to e.g.  fetch secrets for injection into the Prometheus
configuration from external sources. Any errors during the execution of
an initContainer will lead to a restart of the Pod. More info:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/
InitContainers described here modify an operator generated init
containers if they share the same name and modifications are done via a
strategic merge patch.


The names of init container name managed by the operator are:
* `init-config-reloader`.


Overriding init containers is entirely outside the scope of what the
maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour
may break at any time without notice.

| `initContainers[]`
| `object`
| A single application container that you want to run within a pod.

| `keepDroppedTargets`
| `integer`
| Per-scrape limit on the number of targets dropped by relabeling
that will be kept in memory. 0 means no limit.


It requires Prometheus >= v2.47.0.


Note that the global limit only applies to scrape objects that don't specify an explicit limit value.
If you want to enforce a maximum limit for all scrape objects, refer to enforcedKeepDroppedTargets.

| `labelLimit`
| `integer`
| Per-scrape limit on number of labels that will be accepted for a sample.
Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.45.0 and newer.


Note that the global limit only applies to scrape objects that don't specify an explicit limit value.

Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.45.0 and newer.


Note that the global limit only applies to scrape objects that don't specify an explicit limit value.
If you want to enforce a maximum limit for all scrape objects, refer to enforcedLabelNameLengthLimit.

| `labelValueLengthLimit`
| `integer`
| Per-scrape limit on length of labels value that will be accepted for a sample.
Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.45.0 and newer.


Note that the global limit only applies to scrape objects that don't specify an explicit limit value.
If you want to enforce a maximum limit for all scrape objects, refer to enforcedLabelValueLengthLimit.

| `listenLocal`
| `boolean`
| When true, the Prometheus server listens on the loopback address
instead of the Pod IP's address.

| `logFormat`
| `string`
| Log format for Log level for Prometheus and the config-reloader sidecar.

| `logLevel`
| `string`
| Log level for Prometheus and the config-reloader sidecar.

| `maximumStartupDurationSeconds`
| `integer`
| Defines the maximum time that the `prometheus` container's startup probe will wait before being considered failed. The startup probe will return success after the WAL replay is complete.
If set, the value should be greater than 60 (seconds). Otherwise it will be equal to 600 seconds (15 minutes).

| `minReadySeconds`
| `integer`
| Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created Pod should be ready
without any of its container crashing for it to be considered available.
Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)


This is an alpha field from kubernetes 1.22 until 1.24 which requires
enabling the StatefulSetMinReadySeconds feature gate.

| `nodeSelector`
| `object (string)`
| Defines on which Nodes the Pods are scheduled.

| `overrideHonorLabels`
| `boolean`
| When true, Prometheus resolves label conflicts by renaming the labels in the scraped data
 to “exported_” for all targets created from ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor and
ScrapeConfig objects. Otherwise the HonorLabels field of the service or pod monitor applies.
In practice,`overrideHonorLaels:true` enforces `honorLabels:false`
for all ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor and ScrapeConfig objects.

| `overrideHonorTimestamps`
| `boolean`
| When true, Prometheus ignores the timestamps for all the targets created
from service and pod monitors.
Otherwise the HonorTimestamps field of the service or pod monitor applies.

| `paused`
| `boolean`
| When a Prometheus deployment is paused, no actions except for deletion
will be performed on the underlying objects.

| `persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy`
| `object`
| The field controls if and how PVCs are deleted during the lifecycle of a StatefulSet.
The default behavior is all PVCs are retained.
This is an alpha field from kubernetes 1.23 until 1.26 and a beta field from 1.26.
It requires enabling the StatefulSetAutoDeletePVC feature gate.

| `podMetadata`
| `object`
| PodMetadata configures labels and annotations which are propagated to the Prometheus pods.


The following items are reserved and cannot be overridden:
* "prometheus" label, set to the name of the Prometheus object.
* "app.kubernetes.io/instance" label, set to the name of the Prometheus object.
* "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by" label, set to "prometheus-operator".
* "app.kubernetes.io/name" label, set to "prometheus".
* "app.kubernetes.io/version" label, set to the Prometheus version.
* "operator.prometheus.io/name" label, set to the name of the Prometheus object.
* "operator.prometheus.io/shard" label, set to the shard number of the Prometheus object.
* "kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container" annotation, set to "prometheus".

| `podMonitorNamespaceSelector`
| `object`
| Namespaces to match for PodMonitors discovery. An empty label selector
matches all namespaces. A null label selector (default value) matches the current
namespace only.

| `podMonitorSelector`
| `object`
| PodMonitors to be selected for target discovery. An empty label selector
matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.


If `spec.serviceMonitorSelector`, `spec.podMonitorSelector`, `spec.probeSelector`
and `spec.scrapeConfigSelector` are null, the Prometheus configuration is unmanaged.
The Prometheus operator will ensure that the Prometheus configuration's
Secret exists, but it is the responsibility of the user to provide the raw
gzipped Prometheus configuration under the `prometheus.yaml.gz` key.
This behavior is *deprecated* and will be removed in the next major version
of the custom resource definition. It is recommended to use
`spec.additionalScrapeConfigs` instead.

| `podTargetLabels`
| `array (string)`
| PodTargetLabels are appended to the `spec.podTargetLabels` field of all
PodMonitor and ServiceMonitor objects.

| `portName`
| `string`
| Port name used for the pods and governing service.
Default: "web"

| `priorityClassName`
| `string`
| Priority class assigned to the Pods.

| `probeNamespaceSelector`
| `object`
| Namespaces to match for Probe discovery. An empty label
selector matches all namespaces. A null label selector matches the
current namespace only.

| `probeSelector`
| `object`
| Probes to be selected for target discovery. An empty label selector
matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.


If `spec.serviceMonitorSelector`, `spec.podMonitorSelector`, `spec.probeSelector`
and `spec.scrapeConfigSelector` are null, the Prometheus configuration is unmanaged.
The Prometheus operator will ensure that the Prometheus configuration's
Secret exists, but it is the responsibility of the user to provide the raw
gzipped Prometheus configuration under the `prometheus.yaml.gz` key.
This behavior is *deprecated* and will be removed in the next major version
of the custom resource definition. It is recommended to use
`spec.additionalScrapeConfigs` instead.

| `prometheusExternalLabelName`
| `string`
| Name of Prometheus external label used to denote the Prometheus instance
name. The external label will _not_ be added when the field is set to
the empty string (`""`).


Default: "prometheus"

| `prometheusRulesExcludedFromEnforce`
| `array`
| Defines the list of PrometheusRule objects to which the namespace label
enforcement doesn't apply.
This is only relevant when `spec.enforcedNamespaceLabel` is set to true.
Deprecated: use `spec.excludedFromEnforcement` instead.

| `prometheusRulesExcludedFromEnforce[]`
| `object`
| PrometheusRuleExcludeConfig enables users to configure excluded
PrometheusRule names and their namespaces to be ignored while enforcing
namespace label for alerts and metrics.

| `query`
| `object`
| QuerySpec defines the configuration of the Promethus query service.

| `queryLogFile`
| `string`
| queryLogFile specifies where the file to which PromQL queries are logged.


If the filename has an empty path, e.g. 'query.log', The Prometheus Pods
will mount the file into an emptyDir volume at `/var/log/prometheus`.
If a full path is provided, e.g. '/var/log/prometheus/query.log', you
must mount a volume in the specified directory and it must be writable.
This is because the prometheus container runs with a read-only root
filesystem for security reasons.
Alternatively, the location can be set to a standard I/O stream, e.g.
`/dev/stdout`, to log query information to the default Prometheus log
stream.

| `reloadStrategy`
| `string`
| Defines the strategy used to reload the Prometheus configuration.
If not specified, the configuration is reloaded using the /-/reload HTTP endpoint.

| `remoteRead`
| `array`

| `remoteRead[]`
| `object`
| RemoteReadSpec defines the configuration for Prometheus to read back samples
from a remote endpoint.

| `remoteWrite`
| `array`
| Defines the list of remote write configurations.

| `remoteWrite[]`
| `object`
| RemoteWriteSpec defines the configuration to write samples from Prometheus
to a remote endpoint.

| `replicaExternalLabelName`
| `string`
| Name of Prometheus external label used to denote the replica name.
The external label will _not_ be added when the field is set to the
empty string (`""`).


Default: "prometheus_replica"

data either but it will continue to be available from the same
instances. To query globally, use Thanos sidecar and Thanos querier or
remote write data to a central location.

Description::

--
Containers allows injecting additional containers or modifying operator
generated containers. This can be used to allow adding an authentication
proxy to the Pods or to change the behavior of an operator generated
container. Containers described here modify an operator generated
container if they share the same name and modifications are done via a
strategic merge patch.


The names of containers managed by the operator are:
* `prometheus`
* `config-reloader`
* `thanos-sidecar`


Overriding containers is entirely outside the scope of what the
maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour
may break at any time without notice.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `args`
| `array (string)`
| Arguments to the entrypoint.
The container image's CMD is used if this is not provided.
Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless
of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell

| `command`
| `array (string)`
| Entrypoint array. Not executed within a shell.
The container image's ENTRYPOINT is used if this is not provided.
Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless

| `env`
| `array`
| List of environment variables to set in the container.
Cannot be updated.

| `env[]`
| `object`
| EnvVar represents an environment variable present in a Container.

| `envFrom`
| `array`
| List of sources to populate environment variables in the container.
The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys
will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple
sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence.
Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence.
Cannot be updated.

| `envFrom[]`
| `object`
| EnvFromSource represents the source of a set of ConfigMaps

| `image`
| `string`
| Container image name.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images
This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override
container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.

| `imagePullPolicy`
| `string`
| Image pull policy.
One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent.
Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.
Cannot be updated.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images

| `lifecycle`
| `object`
| Actions that the management system should take in response to container lifecycle events.
Cannot be updated.

| `livenessProbe`
| `object`
| Periodic probe of container liveness.
Container will be restarted if the probe fails.
Cannot be updated.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

| `name`
| `string`
| Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL.
Each container in a pod must have a unique name (DNS_LABEL).
Cannot be updated.

| `ports`
| `array`
| List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here
DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is
listening on the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be
accessible from the network.
Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the data.
For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255.
Cannot be updated.

| `ports[]`
| `object`
| ContainerPort represents a network port in a single container.

| `readinessProbe`
| `object`
| Periodic probe of container service readiness.
Container will be removed from service endpoints if the probe fails.
Cannot be updated.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

| `resizePolicy`
| `array`
| Resources resize policy for the container.

| `resizePolicy[]`
| `object`
| ContainerResizePolicy represents resource resize policy for the container.

| `resources`
| `object`
| Compute Resources required by this container.
Cannot be updated.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

| `restartPolicy`
| `string`
| RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
this init container will be continually restarted on
exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
completed.

| `securityContext`
| `object`
| SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with.
If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/

| `startupProbe`
| `object`
| StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized.
If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully.
If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed.
This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle,
when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.
This cannot be updated.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

| `stdin`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this
is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF.
Default is false.

| `stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by
a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach
sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the
first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects,
at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this
flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.
Default is false

| `terminationMessagePath`
| `string`
| Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message
will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.
Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message.
Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across
all containers will be limited to 12kb.
Defaults to /dev/termination-log.
Cannot be updated.

| `terminationMessagePolicy`
| `string`
| Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of
terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure.
FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination
message file is empty and the container exited with an error.
The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller.
Defaults to File.
Cannot be updated.

| `tty`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true.
Default is false.

| `volumeDevices`
| `array`
| volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.

| `volumeDevices[]`
| `object`
| volumeDevice describes a mapping of a raw block device within a container.

| `volumeMounts`
| `array`
| Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem.
Cannot be updated.

| `volumeMounts[]`
| `object`
| VolumeMount describes a mounting of a Volume within a container.

| `workingDir`
| `string`
| Container's working directory.
If not specified, the container runtime's default will be used, which
might be configured in the container image.
Cannot be updated.

Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks

| `preStop`
| `object`
| PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace

InitContainers described here modify an operator generated init
containers if they share the same name and modifications are done via a
strategic merge patch.


The names of init container name managed by the operator are:
* `init-config-reloader`.


Overriding init containers is entirely outside the scope of what the
maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour
may break at any time without notice.

| `restartPolicy`
| `string`
| RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
this init container will be continually restarted on
exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
completed.

| `securityContext`

| `startupProbe`
| `object`
| StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized.
If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully.
If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed.
This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle,
when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.
This cannot be updated.

Default is false.

| `stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by
a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach
sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the
first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects,
at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this
flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.
Default is false

| `terminationMessagePath`
| `string`
| Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message
will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.
Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message.
Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across
all containers will be limited to 12kb.
Defaults to /dev/termination-log.
Cannot be updated.

message file is empty and the container exited with an error.
The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller.
Defaults to File.

| dataSource field can be used to specify either:
* An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)
* An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.
If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.

| `dataSourceRef`
| `object`
| dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.

it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass

=== .spec.storage.ephemeral.volumeClaimTemplate.spec.dataSourceRef
Description::
+
--
dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.
(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
(Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

| `allocatedResourceStatuses`
| `object (string)`
| allocatedResourceStatuses stores status of resource being resized for the given PVC.
Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:
	* Un-prefixed keys:
		- storage - the capacity of the volume.
	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered
reserved and hence may not be used.


ClaimResourceStatus can be in any of following states:
	- ControllerResizeInProgress:
		State set when resize controller starts resizing the volume in control-plane.
	- ControllerResizeFailed:
		State set when resize has failed in resize controller with a terminal error.
	- NodeResizePending:
		State set when resize controller has finished resizing the volume but further resizing of
		volume is needed on the node.
	- NodeResizeInProgress:
		State set when kubelet starts resizing the volume.
	- NodeResizeFailed:
		State set when resizing has failed in kubelet with a terminal error. Transient errors don't set
		NodeResizeFailed.
For example: if expanding a PVC for more capacity - this field can be one of the following states:
	- pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeInProgress"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeFailed"

     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeInProgress"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeFailed"
When this field is not set, it means that no resize operation is in progress for the given PVC.


A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName or ClaimResourceStatus
should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller that
only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid
resources associated with PVC.


This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature.

| `allocatedResources`
| `integer-or-string`
| allocatedResources tracks the resources allocated to a PVC including its capacity.
Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:

	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered
reserved and hence may not be used.


Capacity reported here may be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion operation
is requested.
For storage quota, the larger value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used.
If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation.
If a volume expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only
lowered if there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume capacity
is equal or lower than the requested capacity.


A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName
should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller that
only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid
resources associated with PVC.

| Path within the container at which the volume should be mounted.  Must
not contain ':'.

| `mountPropagation`
| `string`
| mountPropagation determines how mounts are propagated from the host
to container and the other way around.
When not set, MountPropagationNone is used.
This field is beta in 1.10.
When RecursiveReadOnly is set to IfPossible or to Enabled, MountPropagation must be None or unspecified
(which defaults to None).

| `name`

| This must match the Name of a Volume.

| `readOnly`
| `boolean`
| Mounted read-only if true, read-write otherwise (false or unspecified).
Defaults to false.

| `recursiveReadOnly`
| `string`
| RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
recursively.


If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.


If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
an error will be generated to indicate the reason.


If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).


If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `effect`
| `string`
| Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

| `key`
| `string`
| Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

| `operator`
| `string`
| Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
tolerate all taints of a particular category.

| `tolerationSeconds`
| `integer`
| TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `maxSkew`
  - `topologyKey`
  - `whenUnsatisfiable`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `additionalLabelSelectors`
| `string`
| Defines what Prometheus Operator managed labels should be added to labelSelector on the topologySpreadConstraint.

| `labelSelector`
| `object`
| LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.
Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods
in their corresponding topology domain.

| `matchLabelKeys`
| `array (string)`
| MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.


This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

| `maxSkew`
| `integer`
| MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
In this case, the global minimum is 1.
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\|  P P  \|  P P  \|   P   \|
- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
violate MaxSkew(1).
- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
to topologies that satisfy it.
It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

| `minDomains`
| `integer`
| MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
this value has no effect on scheduling.
As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
Valid values are integers greater than 0.
When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\|  P P  \|  P P  \|  P P  \|
The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
it will violate MaxSkew.

| `nodeAffinityPolicy`
| `string`
| NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.
- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.


If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.
This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

| `nodeTaintsPolicy`
| `string`
| NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating
pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod
has a toleration, are included.
- Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.


If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.
This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

| `topologyKey`
| `string`
| TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
of pods into each bucket.
We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.
It's a required field.

| `whenUnsatisfiable`
| `string`
| WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
the spread constraint.
- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
  skew.
A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
"MaxSkew" on some topology.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\| P P P \|   P   \|   P   \|
If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
won't make it *more* imbalanced.
It's a required field.

| RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
recursively.


If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.


If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
an error will be generated to indicate the reason.


If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).


If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

| `ephemeral`
| `object`
| ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
and deleted when the pod is removed.


Use this if:
a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
   tracking are needed,
c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
   information on the connection between this volume type
   and PersistentVolumeClaim).


Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
of an individual pod.


Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
more information.


A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
persistent volumes at the same time.

=== .spec.volumes[].ephemeral
Description::
+
--
ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
and deleted when the pod is removed.


Use this if:
a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
   tracking are needed,
c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
   information on the connection between this volume type
   and PersistentVolumeClaim).


Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
of an individual pod.


Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
more information.


A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
persistent volumes at the same time.

| `volumeClaimTemplate`
| `object`
| Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
`<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an

| `dataSource`
| `object`
| dataSource field can be used to specify either:
* An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)
* An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.
If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.

| `dataSourceRef`
| `object`
| dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1

| `volumeAttributesClassName`

| volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.
If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined
in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,
it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
exists.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-attributes-classes/
(Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.

Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
