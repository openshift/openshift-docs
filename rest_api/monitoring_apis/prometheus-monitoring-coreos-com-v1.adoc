Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `additionalAlertManagerConfigs`
| `object`
| AdditionalAlertManagerConfigs specifies a key of a Secret containing additional Prometheus Alertmanager configurations. The Alertmanager configurations are appended to the configuration generated by the Prometheus Operator. They must be formatted according to the official Prometheus documentation:
 https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#alertmanager_config
 The user is responsible for making sure that the configurations are valid
 Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes to ensure that no incompatible AlertManager configs are going to break Prometheus after the upgrade.

| `additionalAlertRelabelConfigs`
| `object`
| AdditionalAlertRelabelConfigs specifies a key of a Secret containing additional Prometheus alert relabel configurations. The alert relabel configurations are appended to the configuration generated by the Prometheus Operator. They must be formatted according to the official Prometheus documentation:
 https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#alert_relabel_configs
 The user is responsible for making sure that the configurations are valid
 Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes to ensure that no incompatible alert relabel configs are going to break Prometheus after the upgrade.

| `additionalArgs`
| `array`
| AdditionalArgs allows setting additional arguments for the 'prometheus' container.
 It is intended for e.g. activating hidden flags which are not supported by the dedicated configuration options yet. The arguments are passed as-is to the Prometheus container which may cause issues if they are invalid or not supported by the given Prometheus version.
 In case of an argument conflict (e.g. an argument which is already set by the operator itself) or when providing an invalid argument, the reconciliation will fail and an error will be logged.

| `additionalArgs[]`
| `object`
| Argument as part of the AdditionalArgs list.

| `additionalScrapeConfigs`
| `object`
| AdditionalScrapeConfigs allows specifying a key of a Secret containing additional Prometheus scrape configurations. Scrape configurations specified are appended to the configurations generated by the Prometheus Operator. Job configurations specified must have the form as specified in the official Prometheus documentation: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config. As scrape configs are appended, the user is responsible to make sure it is valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes to ensure that no incompatible scrape configs are going to break Prometheus after the upgrade.

| `affinity`
| `object`
| Defines the Pods' affinity scheduling rules if specified.

| `alerting`
| `object`
| Defines the settings related to Alertmanager.

| `allowOverlappingBlocks`
| `boolean`
| AllowOverlappingBlocks enables vertical compaction and vertical query merge in Prometheus.
 *Deprecated: this flag has no effect for Prometheus >= 2.39.0 where overlapping blocks are enabled by default.*

| `apiserverConfig`
| `object`
| APIServerConfig allows specifying a host and auth methods to access the Kuberntees API server. If null, Prometheus is assumed to run inside of the cluster: it will discover the API servers automatically and use the Pod's CA certificate and bearer token file at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/.

| `arbitraryFSAccessThroughSMs`
| `object`
| When true, ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor and Probe object are forbidden to reference arbitrary files on the file system of the 'prometheus' container. When a ServiceMonitor's endpoint specifies a `bearerTokenFile` value (e.g.  '/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token'), a malicious target can get access to the Prometheus service account's token in the Prometheus' scrape request. Setting `spec.arbitraryFSAccessThroughSM` to 'true' would prevent the attack. Users should instead provide the credentials using the `spec.bearerTokenSecret` field.

| `baseImage`
| `string`
| *Deprecated: use 'spec.image' instead.*

| `bodySizeLimit`
| `string`
| BodySizeLimit defines per-scrape on response body size. Only valid in Prometheus versions 2.45.0 and newer.

| `configMaps`
| `array (string)`
| ConfigMaps is a list of ConfigMaps in the same namespace as the Prometheus object, which shall be mounted into the Prometheus Pods. Each ConfigMap is added to the StatefulSet definition as a volume named `configmap-<configmap-name>`. The ConfigMaps are mounted into /etc/prometheus/configmaps/<configmap-name> in the 'prometheus' container.

| `containers`
| `array`
| Containers allows injecting additional containers or modifying operator generated containers. This can be used to allow adding an authentication proxy to the Pods or to change the behavior of an operator generated container. Containers described here modify an operator generated container if they share the same name and modifications are done via a strategic merge patch.
 The names of containers managed by the operator are: * `prometheus` * `config-reloader` * `thanos-sidecar`
 Overriding containers is entirely outside the scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour may break at any time without notice.

| `containers[]`
| `object`
| A single application container that you want to run within a pod.

| `disableCompaction`
| `boolean`
| When true, the Prometheus compaction is disabled.

| `enableAdminAPI`
| `boolean`
| Enables access to the Prometheus web admin API.
 WARNING: Enabling the admin APIs enables mutating endpoints, to delete data, shutdown Prometheus, and more. Enabling this should be done with care and the user is advised to add additional authentication authorization via a proxy to ensure only clients authorized to perform these actions can do so.
 For more information: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#tsdb-admin-apis

| `enableFeatures`
| `array (string)`
| Enable access to Prometheus feature flags. By default, no features are enabled.
 Enabling features which are disabled by default is entirely outside the scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour may break at any time without notice.
 For more information see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/

| `enableRemoteWriteReceiver`
| `boolean`
| Enable Prometheus to be used as a receiver for the Prometheus remote write protocol.
 WARNING: This is not considered an efficient way of ingesting samples. Use it with caution for specific low-volume use cases. It is not suitable for replacing the ingestion via scraping and turning Prometheus into a push-based metrics collection system. For more information see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#remote-write-receiver
 It requires Prometheus >= v2.33.0.

| `enforcedBodySizeLimit`
| `string`
| When defined, enforcedBodySizeLimit specifies a global limit on the size of uncompressed response body that will be accepted by Prometheus. Targets responding with a body larger than this many bytes will cause the scrape to fail.
 It requires Prometheus >= v2.28.0.

| `enforcedLabelLimit`
| `integer`
| When defined, enforcedLabelLimit specifies a global limit on the number of labels per sample. The value overrides any `spec.labelLimit` set by ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, Probe objects unless `spec.labelLimit` is greater than zero and less than `spec.enforcedLabelLimit`.

| `string`
| When not empty, a label will be added to
 1. All metrics scraped from `ServiceMonitor`, `PodMonitor`, `Probe` and `ScrapeConfig` objects. 2. All metrics generated from recording rules defined in `PrometheusRule` objects. 3. All alerts generated from alerting rules defined in `PrometheusRule` objects. 4. All vector selectors of PromQL expressions defined in `PrometheusRule` objects.
 The label will not added for objects referenced in `spec.excludedFromEnforcement`.
 The label's name is this field's value. The label's value is the namespace of the `ServiceMonitor`, `PodMonitor`, `Probe` or `PrometheusRule` object.

| `enforcedSampleLimit`
| `integer`
| When defined, enforcedSampleLimit specifies a global limit on the number of scraped samples that will be accepted. This overrides any `spec.sampleLimit` set by ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, Probe objects unless `spec.sampleLimit` is greater than zero and less than than `spec.enforcedSampleLimit`.
 It is meant to be used by admins to keep the overall number of samples/series under a desired limit.

| `enforcedTargetLimit`
| `integer`
| When defined, enforcedTargetLimit specifies a global limit on the number of scraped targets. The value overrides any `spec.targetLimit` set by ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, Probe objects unless `spec.targetLimit` is greater than zero and less than `spec.enforcedTargetLimit`.

| `object (string)`
| The labels to add to any time series or alerts when communicating with external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager). Labels defined by `spec.replicaExternalLabelName` and `spec.prometheusExternalLabelName` take precedence over this list.

| `externalUrl`
| `string`
| The external URL under which the Prometheus service is externally available. This is necessary to generate correct URLs (for instance if Prometheus is accessible behind an Ingress resource).

| `hostAliases`
| `array`
| Optional list of hosts and IPs that will be injected into the Pod's hosts file if specified.

| `hostAliases[]`
| `object`
| HostAlias holds the mapping between IP and hostnames that will be injected as an entry in the pod's hosts file.

| `hostNetwork`
| `boolean`
| Use the host's network namespace if true.
 Make sure to understand the security implications if you want to enable it (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/).
 When hostNetwork is enabled, this will set the DNS policy to `ClusterFirstWithHostNet` automatically.

| `ignoreNamespaceSelectors`
| `boolean`
| When true, `spec.namespaceSelector` from all PodMonitor, ServiceMonitor and Probe objects will be ignored. They will only discover targets within the namespace of the PodMonitor, ServiceMonitor and Probe objec.

| `image`
| `string`
| Container image name for Prometheus. If specified, it takes precedence over the `spec.baseImage`, `spec.tag` and `spec.sha` fields.
 Specifying `spec.version` is still necessary to ensure the Prometheus Operator knows which version of Prometheus is being configured.
 If neither `spec.image` nor `spec.baseImage` are defined, the operator will use the latest upstream version of Prometheus available at the time when the operator was released.

| `imagePullPolicy`
| `string`

| `object`
| LocalObjectReference contains enough information to let you locate the referenced object inside the same namespace.

| `initContainers`
| `array`
| InitContainers allows injecting initContainers to the Pod definition. Those can be used to e.g.  fetch secrets for injection into the Prometheus configuration from external sources. Any errors during the execution of an initContainer will lead to a restart of the Pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/ InitContainers described here modify an operator generated init containers if they share the same name and modifications are done via a strategic merge patch.
 The names of init container name managed by the operator are: * `init-config-reloader`.
 Overriding init containers is entirely outside the scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour may break at any time without notice.

 This is an alpha field from kubernetes 1.22 until 1.24 which requires enabling the StatefulSetMinReadySeconds feature gate.

| `nodeSelector`
| `object (string)`
| Defines on which Nodes the Pods are scheduled.

| `overrideHonorLabels`
| `boolean`
| When true, Prometheus resolves label conflicts by renaming the labels in the scraped data to "exported_<label value>" for all targets created from service and pod monitors. Otherwise the HonorLabels field of the service or pod monitor applies.

| `overrideHonorTimestamps`
| `boolean`
| When true, Prometheus ignores the timestamps for all the targets created from service and pod monitors. Otherwise the HonorTimestamps field of the service or pod monitor applies.

| `paused`
| `boolean`
| When a Prometheus deployment is paused, no actions except for deletion will be performed on the underlying objects.

| `podMetadata`
| `object`

| `podMonitorSelector`
| `object`
| *Experimental* PodMonitors to be selected for target discovery. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.
 If `spec.serviceMonitorSelector`, `spec.podMonitorSelector`, `spec.probeSelector` and `spec.scrapeConfigSelector` are null, the Prometheus configuration is unmanaged. The Prometheus operator will ensure that the Prometheus configuration's Secret exists, but it is the responsibility of the user to provide the raw gzipped Prometheus configuration under the `prometheus.yaml.gz` key. This behavior is *deprecated* and will be removed in the next major version of the custom resource definition. It is recommended to use `spec.additionalScrapeConfigs` instead.

| `podTargetLabels`
| `array (string)`
| PodTargetLabels are appended to the `spec.podTargetLabels` field of all PodMonitor and ServiceMonitor objects.

| `portName`

| *Experimental* Probes to be selected for target discovery. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.
 If `spec.serviceMonitorSelector`, `spec.podMonitorSelector`, `spec.probeSelector` and `spec.scrapeConfigSelector` are null, the Prometheus configuration is unmanaged. The Prometheus operator will ensure that the Prometheus configuration's Secret exists, but it is the responsibility of the user to provide the raw gzipped Prometheus configuration under the `prometheus.yaml.gz` key. This behavior is *deprecated* and will be removed in the next major version of the custom resource definition. It is recommended to use `spec.additionalScrapeConfigs` instead.

| `string`
| queryLogFile specifies where the file to which PromQL queries are logged.
 If the filename has an empty path, e.g. 'query.log', The Prometheus Pods will mount the file into an emptyDir volume at `/var/log/prometheus`. If a full path is provided, e.g. '/var/log/prometheus/query.log', you must mount a volume in the specified directory and it must be writable. This is because the prometheus container runs with a read-only root filesystem for security reasons. Alternatively, the location can be set to a standard I/O stream, e.g. `/dev/stdout`, to log query information to the default Prometheus log stream.

| `retentionSize`
| `string`
| Maximum number of bytes used by the Prometheus data.

| `routePrefix`
| `string`
| The route prefix Prometheus registers HTTP handlers for.
 This is useful when using `spec.externalURL`, and a proxy is rewriting HTTP routes of a request, and the actual ExternalURL is still true, but the server serves requests under a different route prefix. For example for use with `kubectl proxy`.

| `ruleNamespaceSelector`
| `object`
| Namespaces to match for PrometheusRule discovery. An empty label selector matches all namespaces. A null label selector matches the current namespace only.

| Interval between consecutive scrapes.
 Default: "30s"

| `scrapeTimeout`
| `string`
| Number of seconds to wait until a scrape request times out.

| `secrets`
| `array (string)`
| Secrets is a list of Secrets in the same namespace as the Prometheus object, which shall be mounted into the Prometheus Pods. Each Secret is added to the StatefulSet definition as a volume named `secret-<secret-name>`. The Secrets are mounted into /etc/prometheus/secrets/<secret-name> in the 'prometheus' container.

This behavior is *deprecated* and will be removed in the next major version of the custom resource definition. It is recommended to use `spec.additionalScrapeConfigs` instead.

| `sha`
| `string`
| *Deprecated: use 'spec.image' instead. The image's digest can be specified as part of the image name.*

| `shards`
| `integer`
| EXPERIMENTAL: Number of shards to distribute targets onto. `spec.replicas` multiplied by `spec.shards` is the total number of Pods created.
 Note that scaling down shards will not reshard data onto remaining instances, it must be manually moved. Increasing shards will not reshard data either but it will continue to be available from the same instances. To query globally, use Thanos sidecar and Thanos querier or remote write data to a central location.
 Sharding is performed on the content of the `__address__` target meta-label for PodMonitors and ServiceMonitors and `__param_target__` for Probes.
 Default: 1

| `storage`

Description::
+
--
AdditionalArgs allows setting additional arguments for the 'prometheus' container.
 It is intended for e.g. activating hidden flags which are not supported by the dedicated configuration options yet. The arguments are passed as-is to the Prometheus container which may cause issues if they are invalid or not supported by the given Prometheus version.
 In case of an argument conflict (e.g. an argument which is already set by the operator itself) or when providing an invalid argument, the reconciliation will fail and an error will be logged.

=== .spec.additionalScrapeConfigs
Description::

AdditionalScrapeConfigs allows specifying a key of a Secret containing additional Prometheus scrape configurations. Scrape configurations specified are appended to the configurations generated by the Prometheus Operator. Job configurations specified must have the form as specified in the official Prometheus documentation: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config. As scrape configs are appended, the user is responsible to make sure it is valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes to ensure that no incompatible scrape configs are going to break Prometheus after the upgrade.

Containers allows injecting additional containers or modifying operator generated containers.

Containers described here modify an operator generated container if they share the same name and modifications are done via a strategic merge patch.
 The names of containers managed by the operator are: * `prometheus` * `config-reloader` * `thanos-sidecar`
 Overriding containers is entirely outside the scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour may break at any time without notice.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `args`
| `array (string)`
| Arguments to the entrypoint. The container image's CMD is used if this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell

| `command`
| `array (string)`
| Entrypoint array. Not executed within a shell. The container image's ENTRYPOINT is used if this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell

| `env`

| `env[]`
| `object`
| EnvVar represents an environment variable present in a Container.

| `envFrom`
| `array`
| List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated.

| `envFrom[]`
| `object`
| EnvFromSource represents the source of a set of ConfigMaps

| `image`
| `string`
| Container image name. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.

| `imagePullPolicy`
| `string`
| Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images

| `lifecycle`
| `object`
| Actions that the management system should take in response to container lifecycle events. Cannot be updated.

| `livenessProbe`
| `object`

| `name`
| `string`
| Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL. Each container in a pod must have a unique name (DNS_LABEL). Cannot be updated.

| `ports`
| `array`
| List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from the network. Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the data. For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255. Cannot be updated.

| `ports[]`
| `object`
| ContainerPort represents a network port in a single container.

| `readinessProbe`
| `object`

| `resizePolicy`
| `array`
| Resources resize policy for the container.

| `resizePolicy[]`
| `object`

| `object`
| SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/

| `startupProbe`
| `object`
| StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

| `stdin`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false.

| `stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

| `terminationMessagePath`
| `string`
| Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.

| `terminationMessagePolicy`
| `string`
| Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.

| `tty`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.

| `volumeDevices`
| `array`
| volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.

| `volumeDevices[]`
| `object`
| volumeDevice describes a mapping of a raw block device within a container.

| `volumeMounts`
| `array`
| Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated.

| `volumeMounts[]`
| `object`
| VolumeMount describes a mounting of a Volume within a container.

| `workingDir`
| `string`
| Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot be updated.

PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes or until the termination grace period is reached.

| `stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted.

=== .spec.initContainers[].lifecycle.preStop
Description::
+
--
PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes or until the termination grace period is reached.

Setting this field without the feature flag will result in errors when validating the Pod. All of a Pod's containers must have the same effective HostProcess value (it is not allowed to have a mix of HostProcess containers and non-HostProcess containers).  In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true.

| `volumeClaimTemplate`
| `object`
| Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume. The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).
 An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster.
 This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created.
 Required, must not be nil.

The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).
 An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster.
 This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created.
 Required, must not be nil.

| `dataSource`
| `object`
| dataSource field can be used to specify either: * An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source. When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef, and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified. If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.

| `dataSourceRef`
| `object`
| dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `effect`
| `string`
| Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

| `key`
| `string`
| Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

| `operator`
| `string`
| Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

| `tolerationSeconds`
| `integer`
| TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `maxSkew`

  - `whenUnsatisfiable`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `labelSelector`
| `object`
| LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain.

| `matchLabelKeys`
| `array (string)`
| MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.
 This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

| `maxSkew`
| `integer`
| MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. \| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \| \|  P P  \|  P P  \|   P   \| - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

| `minDomains`
| `integer`
| MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
 For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: \| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \| \|  P P  \|  P P  \|  P P  \| The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.
 This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

| `nodeAffinityPolicy`
| `string`
| NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.
 If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

| `nodeTaintsPolicy`
| `string`
| NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.
 If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

| `topologyKey`
| `string`
| TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.

| `whenUnsatisfiable`
| `string`
| WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: \| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \| \| P P P \|   P   \|   P   \| If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

=== .spec.volumes[].ephemeral
Description::
+
--
ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver. The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts, and deleted when the pod is removed.
 Use this if: a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs, b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity tracking are needed, c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more information on the connection between this volume type and PersistentVolumeClaim).
 Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle of an individual pod.
 Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for more information.
 A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and persistent volumes at the same time.

| Property | Type | Description

| `volumeClaimTemplate`
| `object`
| Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume. The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).
 An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster.
 This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created.
 Required, must not be nil.

.Global query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `sendInitialEvents`
| `boolean`
| `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
  is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
  when request started being processed.
- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
  Invalid error is returned.

Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

HTTP method::
  `PATCH`

Description::
  partially update the specified Prometheus


.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldManager`
| `string`
| fieldManager is a name associated with the actor or entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or 128 characters long, and only contain printable characters, as defined by https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsPrint. This field is required for apply requests (application/apply-patch) but optional for non-apply patch types (JsonPatch, MergePatch, StrategicMergePatch).
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
| `force`
| `boolean`
| Force is going to "force" Apply requests. It means user will re-acquire conflicting fields owned by other people. Force flag must be unset for non-apply patch requests.
