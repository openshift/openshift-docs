| AlertDropLabels configure the label names which should be dropped in ThanosRuler alerts. If `labels` field is not provided, `thanos_ruler_replica` will be dropped in alerts by default.

| `alertQueryUrl`
| `string`
| The external Query URL the Thanos Ruler will set in the 'Source' field of all alerts. Maps to the '--alert.query-url' CLI arg.

| `alertmanagersConfig`
| `object`
| Define configuration for connecting to alertmanager.  Only available with thanos v0.10.0 and higher.  Maps to the `alertmanagers.config` arg.

| `alertmanagersUrl`
| `array (string)`

| `containers`
| `array`
| Containers allows injecting additional containers or modifying operator generated containers. This can be used to allow adding an authentication proxy to a ThanosRuler pod or to change the behavior of an operator generated container. Containers described here modify an operator generated container if they share the same name and modifications are done via a strategic merge patch. The current container names are: `thanos-ruler` and `rules-configmap-reloader`. Overriding containers is entirely outside the scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour may break at any time without notice.

| `containers[]`
| `object`
| A single application container that you want to run within a pod.

| `enforcedNamespaceLabel`
| `string`
| EnforcedNamespaceLabel enforces adding a namespace label of origin for each alert and metric that is user created. The label value will always be the namespace of the object that is being created.

| `evaluationInterval`
| `string`
| Interval between consecutive evaluations.

| `externalPrefix`
| `string`
| The external URL the Thanos Ruler instances will be available under. This is necessary to generate correct URLs. This is necessary if Thanos Ruler is not served from root of a DNS name.

| `grpcServerTlsConfig`
| `object`
| GRPCServerTLSConfig configures the gRPC server from which Thanos Querier reads recorded rule data. Note: Currently only the CAFile, CertFile, and KeyFile fields are supported. Maps to the '--grpc-server-tls-*' CLI args.

| Thanos container image URL.

| `imagePullSecrets`
| `array`
| An optional list of references to secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling thanos images from registries see http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod

| `imagePullSecrets[]`
| `object`
| LocalObjectReference contains enough information to let you locate the referenced object inside the same namespace.

| `initContainers`
| `array`
| InitContainers allows adding initContainers to the pod definition. Those can be used to e.g. fetch secrets for injection into the ThanosRuler configuration from external sources. Any errors during the execution of an initContainer will lead to a restart of the Pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/ Using initContainers for any use case other then secret fetching is entirely outside the scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour may break at any time without notice.

| `initContainers[]`
| `object`
| A single application container that you want to run within a pod.

| `labels`
| `object (string)`
| Labels configure the external label pairs to ThanosRuler. If not provided, default replica label `thanos_ruler_replica` will be added as a label and be dropped in alerts.

| `prometheusRulesExcludedFromEnforce[]`
| `object`
| PrometheusRuleExcludeConfig enables users to configure excluded PrometheusRule names and their namespaces to be ignored while enforcing namespace label for alerts and metrics.

| `queryConfig`
| `object`
| Define configuration for connecting to thanos query instances. If this is defined, the QueryEndpoints field will be ignored. Maps to the `query.config` CLI argument. Only available with thanos v0.11.0 and higher.

| `stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

| `array`
| volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.

| `volumeDevices[]`
| `object`

..spec.containers[].lifecycle.preStop
Description::
  PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container crashes or exits. The reason for termination is passed to the handler. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hooked is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace period. Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes or until the termination grace period is reached.

| `envFrom`
| `array`
| List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated.

| `envFrom[]`
| `object`
| EnvFromSource represents the source of a set of ConfigMaps

| `image`

| Docker image name. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.

| `imagePullPolicy`
| `string`
| Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images

| Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL. Each container in a pod must have a unique name (DNS_LABEL). Cannot be updated.

| `ports`
| `array`
| List of ports to expose from the container. Exposing a port here gives the system additional information about the network connections a container uses, but is primarily informational. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from the network. Cannot be updated.

| `startupProbe`
| `object`
| StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. This is a beta feature enabled by the StartupProbe feature flag. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

| `stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

| `terminationMessagePath`
| `string`
| Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.

| `array`
| volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.

| `volumeDevices[]`
| `object`

.Global guery parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If &#x27;true&#x27;, then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `allowWatchBookmarks`
| `boolean`
| allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type &quot;BOOKMARK&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server&#x27;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field is ignored.
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the &quot;next key&quot;.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `resourceVersionMatch`
| `string`
| resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.

Defaults to unset
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
