Description::
+
--
The `ThanosRuler` custom resource definition (CRD) defines a desired [Thanos Ruler](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/blob/main/docs/components/rule.md) setup to run in a Kubernetes cluster.

A `ThanosRuler` instance requires at least one compatible Prometheus API endpoint (either Thanos Querier or Prometheus services).

The resource defines via label and namespace selectors which `PrometheusRule` objects should be associated to the deployed Thanos Ruler instances.

The container image's CMD is used if this is not provided.
Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will

The keys defined within a source may consist of any printable ASCII characters except '='.
When a key exists in multiple
sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence.
Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence.
Cannot be updated.

| EnvFromSource represents the source of a set of ConfigMaps or Secrets

| `image`
| `string`
| Container image name.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images
This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override
container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.

| Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL.
Each container in a pod must have a unique name (DNS_LABEL).
Cannot be updated.

| `ports`
| `array`
| List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here
DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is
listening on the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be
accessible from the network.
Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the data.
For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255.

| `object`
| Compute Resources required by this container.
Cannot be updated.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

| `restartPolicy`
| `string`
| RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
have the following effect:
this init container will be continually restarted on
exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
completed.

| `restartPolicyRules`
| `array`
| Represents a list of rules to be checked to determine if the
container should be restarted on exit. The rules are evaluated in
order. Once a rule matches a container exit condition, the remaining
rules are ignored. If no rule matches the container exit condition,
the Container-level restart policy determines the whether the container
is restarted or not. Constraints on the rules:
- At most 20 rules are allowed.
- Rules can have the same action.
- Identical rules are not forbidden in validations.
When rules are specified, container MUST set RestartPolicy explicitly
even it if matches the Pod's RestartPolicy.

| `restartPolicyRules[]`
| `object`
| ContainerRestartRule describes how a container exit is handled.

| `securityContext`
| `object`
| SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with.
If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/

| `startupProbe`
| `object`
| StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized.
If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully.
If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed.
This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle,
when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.
This cannot be updated.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

| `stdin`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this
is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF.
Default is false.

| `stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by
a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach
sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the
first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects,
at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this
flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.
Default is false

| `terminationMessagePath`
| `string`
| Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message
will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.
Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message.
Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across
all containers will be limited to 12kb.
Defaults to /dev/termination-log.
Cannot be updated.

| `terminationMessagePolicy`
| `string`
| Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of
terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure.
FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination
message file is empty and the container exited with an error.
The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller.
Defaults to File.
Cannot be updated.

| `tty`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true.
Default is false.

| `volumeDevices`
| `array`
| volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.

| `volumeDevices[]`
| `object`
| volumeDevice describes a mapping of a raw block device within a container.

| `volumeMounts`
| `array`
| Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem.
Cannot be updated.

| `volumeMounts[]`
| `object`
| VolumeMount describes a mounting of a Volume within a container.

| `workingDir`
| `string`
| Container's working directory.
If not specified, the container runtime's default will be used, which

The container image's CMD is used if this is not provided.
Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless

Cannot be updated.

| `env[]`
| `object`
| EnvVar represents an environment variable present in a Container.

| `envFrom`
| `array`
| List of sources to populate environment variables in the container.
The keys defined within a source may consist of any printable ASCII characters except '='.
When a key exists in multiple
sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence.
Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence.
Cannot be updated.

| `envFrom[]`
| `object`
| EnvFromSource represents the source of a set of ConfigMaps or Secrets

| `image`
| `string`
| Container image name.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images
This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override
container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.

| `imagePullPolicy`
| `string`
| Image pull policy.
One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent.
Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

| Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL.
Each container in a pod must have a unique name (DNS_LABEL).
Cannot be updated.

| `ports`
| `array`
| List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here
DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is
listening on the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be
accessible from the network.
Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the data.
For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255.
Cannot be updated.

| `ports[]`
| `object`
| ContainerPort represents a network port in a single container.

| `readinessProbe`

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

| `restartPolicy`
| `string`
| RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
have the following effect:
this init container will be continually restarted on
exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
completed.

| `restartPolicyRules`
| `array`
| Represents a list of rules to be checked to determine if the
container should be restarted on exit. The rules are evaluated in
order. Once a rule matches a container exit condition, the remaining
rules are ignored. If no rule matches the container exit condition,
the Container-level restart policy determines the whether the container
is restarted or not. Constraints on the rules:
- At most 20 rules are allowed.
- Rules can have the same action.
- Identical rules are not forbidden in validations.
When rules are specified, container MUST set RestartPolicy explicitly
even it if matches the Pod's RestartPolicy.

| `restartPolicyRules[]`
| `object`
| ContainerRestartRule describes how a container exit is handled.

| `securityContext`
| `object`
| SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with.
If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/

| `startupProbe`
| `object`
| StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized.
If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully.
If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed.
This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle,
when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.
This cannot be updated.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

| `stdin`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this
is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF.
Default is false.

| `stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by
a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach
sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the
first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects,
at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this
flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.
Default is false

| `terminationMessagePath`
| `string`
| Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message
will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.
Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message.
Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across
all containers will be limited to 12kb.
Defaults to /dev/termination-log.
Cannot be updated.

| `terminationMessagePolicy`
| `string`
| Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of
terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure.
FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination
message file is empty and the container exited with an error.
The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller.
Defaults to File.
Cannot be updated.

| `tty`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true.
Default is false.

| `volumeDevices`
| `array`
| volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.

| `volumeDevices[]`
| `object`
| volumeDevice describes a mapping of a raw block device within a container.

| `volumeMounts`
| `array`
| Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem.
Cannot be updated.

| `volumeMounts[]`
| `object`
| VolumeMount describes a mounting of a Volume within a container.

| `workingDir`
| `string`

| Property | Type | Description

| `appArmorProfile`
| `object`
| appArmorProfile is the AppArmor options to use by the containers in this pod.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

| `fsGroup`
| `integer`
| A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a pod.
Some volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume
to be owned by the pod:

1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup
2. The setgid bit is set (new files created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup)
3. The permission bits are OR'd with rw-rw----

If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

| `fsGroupChangePolicy`
| `string`
| fsGroupChangePolicy defines behavior of changing ownership and permission of the volume
before being exposed inside Pod. This field will only apply to
volume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions).
It will have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmaps
and emptydir.
Valid values are "OnRootMismatch" and "Always". If not specified, "Always" is used.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

| `runAsGroup`
| `integer`
| The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process.
Uses runtime default if unset.
May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence
for that container.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

| `runAsNonRoot`
| `boolean`
| Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user.
If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it
does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does.
If unset or false, no such validation will be performed.
May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

| `runAsUser`
| `integer`
| The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process.
Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified.
May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence

| `seLinuxChangePolicy`
| `string`
| seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

"Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

"MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
"MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

| `seLinuxOptions`
| `object`
| The SELinux context to be applied to all containers.
If unspecified, the container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each
container.  May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in
both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext
takes precedence for that container.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

| `seccompProfile`
| `object`
| The seccomp options to use by the containers in this pod.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

| `supplementalGroups`
| `array (integer)`
| A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in
addition to the container's primary GID and fsGroup (if specified).  If
the SupplementalGroupsPolicy feature is enabled, the
supplementalGroupsPolicy field determines whether these are in addition
to or instead of any group memberships defined in the container image.
If unspecified, no additional groups are added, though group memberships
defined in the container image may still be used, depending on the
supplementalGroupsPolicy field.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

| `supplementalGroupsPolicy`
| `string`
| Defines how supplemental groups of the first container processes are calculated.
Valid values are "Merge" and "Strict". If not specified, "Merge" is used.
(Alpha) Using the field requires the SupplementalGroupsPolicy feature gate to be enabled
and the container runtime must implement support for this feature.
Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

| `sysctls`
| `array`
| Sysctls hold a list of namespaced sysctls used for the pod. Pods with unsupported
sysctls (by the container runtime) might fail to launch.

| `dataSource`
| `object`
| dataSource field can be used to specify either:
* An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)
* An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.
If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.

| `dataSourceRef`
| `object`
| dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.

dataSource field can be used to specify either:
* An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)
* An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.

=== .spec.storage.ephemeral.volumeClaimTemplate.spec.dataSourceRef
Description::
+
--
dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.
(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
(Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1

| `allocatedResourceStatuses`
| `object (string)`
| allocatedResourceStatuses stores status of resource being resized for the given PVC.
Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:
	* Un-prefixed keys:
		- storage - the capacity of the volume.
	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered
reserved and hence may not be used.

ClaimResourceStatus can be in any of following states:
	- ControllerResizeInProgress:
		State set when resize controller starts resizing the volume in control-plane.
	- ControllerResizeFailed:
		State set when resize has failed in resize controller with a terminal error.
	- NodeResizePending:
		State set when resize controller has finished resizing the volume but further resizing of
		volume is needed on the node.
	- NodeResizeInProgress:
		State set when kubelet starts resizing the volume.
	- NodeResizeFailed:
		State set when resizing has failed in kubelet with a terminal error. Transient errors don't set
		NodeResizeFailed.
For example: if expanding a PVC for more capacity - this field can be one of the following states:
	- pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeInProgress"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeFailed"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizePending"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeInProgress"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeFailed"
When this field is not set, it means that no resize operation is in progress for the given PVC.

A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName or ClaimResourceStatus
should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller that
only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid
resources associated with PVC.

This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature.

| `allocatedResources`
| `integer-or-string`
| allocatedResources tracks the resources allocated to a PVC including its capacity.
Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:
	* Un-prefixed keys:
		- storage - the capacity of the volume.
	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered
reserved and hence may not be used.

Capacity reported here may be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion operation
is requested.
For storage quota, the larger value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used.
If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation.
If a volume expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only
lowered if there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume capacity
is equal or lower than the requested capacity.

A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName
should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller that
only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid
resources associated with PVC.

This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature.

  - `topologyKey`
  - `whenUnsatisfiable`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `labelSelector`
| `object`
| LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.
Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods
in their corresponding topology domain.

| `matchLabelKeys`
| `array (string)`
| MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

| `maxSkew`
| `integer`
| MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
In this case, the global minimum is 1.
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\|  P P  \|  P P  \|   P   \|
- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
violate MaxSkew(1).
- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
to topologies that satisfy it.
It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

| `minDomains`
| `integer`
| MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
this value has no effect on scheduling.
As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
Valid values are integers greater than 0.
When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\|  P P  \|  P P  \|  P P  \|
The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
it will violate MaxSkew.

| `nodeAffinityPolicy`
| `string`
| NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.
- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.

If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.

| `nodeTaintsPolicy`
| `string`
| NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating
pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod
has a toleration, are included.
- Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.

If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.

| `topologyKey`
| `string`
| TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
of pods into each bucket.
We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.
It's a required field.

| `whenUnsatisfiable`
| `string`
| WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
the spread constraint.
- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
  skew.
A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
"MaxSkew" on some topology.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\| P P P \|   P   \|   P   \|
If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
won't make it *more* imbalanced.
It's a required field.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#emptydir

| `ephemeral`
| `object`
| ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
and deleted when the pod is removed.

Use this if:
a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
   tracking are needed,
c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
   information on the connection between this volume type
   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
of an individual pod.

Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
more information.

A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
persistent volumes at the same time.

| `image`
| `object`
| image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

- Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
- Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
- IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.

=== .spec.volumes[].ephemeral
Description::
+
--
ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
and deleted when the pod is removed.

Use this if:
a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
   tracking are needed,
c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
   information on the connection between this volume type
   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
of an individual pod.

Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
more information.

A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
persistent volumes at the same time.

| Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
`<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

| `dataSource`
| `object`
| dataSource field can be used to specify either:
* An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)
* An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.
If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.

| `dataSourceRef`
| `object`
| dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects

If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined
in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,
it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string or nil value indicates that no
VolumeAttributesClass will be applied to the claim. If the claim enters an Infeasible error state,
this field can be reset to its previous value (including nil) to cancel the modification.
If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
exists.

=== .spec.volumes[].image
Description::
+
--
image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

- Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
- Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
- IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

| `clusterTrustBundle`
| `object`
| ClusterTrustBundle allows a pod to access the `.spec.trustBundle` field
of ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.

Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.

ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the
combination of signer name and a label selector.

Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written
into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
may change the order over time.

| `configMap`
| `object`
| configMap information about the configMap data to project

| `downwardAPI`
| `object`
| downwardAPI information about the downwardAPI data to project

| `podCertificate`
| `object`
| Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
source in its spec.

Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
timestamp.

Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
certificateChainPath fields.

The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
consistent.

The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
use the certificates it issues.

| `secret`
| `object`
| secret information about the secret data to project

| `serviceAccountToken`

--
Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate

request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
source in its spec.

Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
timestamp.

Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
certificateChainPath fields.

The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
consistent.

The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
use the certificates it issues.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `certificateChainPath`
| `string`
| Write the certificate chain at this path in the projected volume.

Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
files mid-rotation.

| `credentialBundlePath`
| `string`
| Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
key.

The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
project them to separate files, your application code will need to
additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

| `keyPath`
| `string`
| Write the key at this path in the projected volume.

Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
files mid-rotation.

| `keyType`
| `string`
| The type of keypair Kubelet will generate for the pod.

Valid values are "RSA3072", "RSA4096", "ECDSAP256", "ECDSAP384",
"ECDSAP521", and "ED25519".

| `maxExpirationSeconds`
| `integer`
| maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the
certificate.

Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
generates for this projection.

If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver
will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable
value is 7862400 (91 days).

The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600
seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.
`kubernetes.io` signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime
longer than 24 hours.

| `signerName`
| `string`
| Kubelet's generated CSRs will be addressed to this signer.
