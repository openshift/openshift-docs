| Property | Type | Description

| `additionalArgs`
| `array`
| AdditionalArgs allows setting additional arguments for the ThanosRuler container.
It is intended for e.g. activating hidden flags which are not supported by
the dedicated configuration options yet. The arguments are passed as-is to the
ThanosRuler container which may cause issues if they are invalid or not supported
by the given ThanosRuler version.
In case of an argument conflict (e.g. an argument which is already set by the
operator itself) or when providing an invalid argument the reconciliation will
fail and an error will be logged.

AlertManagersConfig should be used instead.  Note: this field will be ignored
if AlertManagersConfig is specified.
Maps to the `alertmanagers.url` arg.

| `containers`
| `array`
| Containers allows injecting additional containers or modifying operator generated
containers. This can be used to allow adding an authentication proxy to a ThanosRuler pod or
to change the behavior of an operator generated container. Containers described here modify
an operator generated container if they share the same name and modifications are done via a
strategic merge patch. The current container names are: `thanos-ruler` and `config-reloader`.

| LocalObjectReference contains enough information to let you locate the
referenced object inside the same namespace.

| `initContainers`
| `array`
| InitContainers allows adding initContainers to the pod definition. Those can be used to e.g.

errors during the execution of an initContainer will lead to a restart of the Pod.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/
Using initContainers for any use case other then secret fetching is entirely outside the scope
of what the maintainers will support and by doing so, you accept that this behaviour may break
at any time without notice.

| `initContainers[]`
| `object`
| A single application container that you want to run within a pod.

| `labels`
| `object (string)`
| Labels configure the external label pairs to ThanosRuler. A default replica label
`thanos_ruler_replica` will be always added  as a label with the value of the pod's name and it will be dropped in the alerts.

an operator generated container if they share the same name and modifications are done via a
strategic merge patch. The current container names are: `thanos-ruler` and `config-reloader`.
Overriding containers is entirely outside the scope of what the maintainers will support and by doing
so, you accept that this behaviour may break at any time without notice.

The container image's CMD is used if this is not provided.
Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless
of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.

Cannot be updated.

| `env[]`
| `object`
| EnvVar represents an environment variable present in a Container.

| `envFrom`
| `array`
| List of sources to populate environment variables in the container.
The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys
will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple
sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence.
Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence.
Cannot be updated.

| `envFrom[]`
| `object`
| EnvFromSource represents the source of a set of ConfigMaps

| `image`
| `string`
| Container image name.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images
This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override
container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.

| `imagePullPolicy`
| `string`
| Image pull policy.
One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent.
Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

| `name`
| `string`
| Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL.
Each container in a pod must have a unique name (DNS_LABEL).
Cannot be updated.

| `ports`
| `array`
| List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here
DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is
listening on the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be
accessible from the network.
Modifying this array with strategic merge patch may corrupt the data.
For more information See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108255.
Cannot be updated.

| `ports[]`
| `object`
| ContainerPort represents a network port in a single container.

| `readinessProbe`

| `resources`
| `object`
| Compute Resources required by this container.
Cannot be updated.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

| `restartPolicy`
| `string`
| RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
this init container will be continually restarted on
exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
completed.

| `securityContext`
| `object`
| SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with.
If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/

| `startupProbe`
| `object`
| StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized.
If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully.
If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed.
This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle,
when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.
This cannot be updated.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

| `stdin`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this
is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF.
Default is false.

| `stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by
a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach
sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the
first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects,
at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this
flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.
Default is false

| `terminationMessagePath`
| `string`
| Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message
will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.
Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message.
Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across
all containers will be limited to 12kb.
Defaults to /dev/termination-log.
Cannot be updated.

| `terminationMessagePolicy`
| `string`
| Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of
terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure.
FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination
message file is empty and the container exited with an error.
The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller.
Defaults to File.
Cannot be updated.

| `tty`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true.
Default is false.

| `volumeDevices`
| `array`
| volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.

| `volumeDevices[]`
| `object`
| volumeDevice describes a mapping of a raw block device within a container.

| `volumeMounts`
| `array`
| Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem.
Cannot be updated.

| `volumeMounts[]`
| `object`
| VolumeMount describes a mounting of a Volume within a container.

| `workingDir`
| `string`
| Container's working directory.
If not specified, the container runtime's default will be used, which
might be configured in the container image.
Cannot be updated.

=== .spec.containers[].lifecycle.preStop
Description::
+
--
PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
or until the termination grace period is reached.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

| `restartPolicy`
| `string`
| RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
this init container will be continually restarted on
exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
completed.

| `securityContext`
| `object`
| SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with.
If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/

| `startupProbe`
| `object`
| StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized.
If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully.
If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed.
This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle,
when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.
This cannot be updated.

| `stdin`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this
is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF.
Default is false.

| `stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by
a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach
sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the
first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects,
at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this
flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.
Default is false

| `terminationMessagePath`
| `string`
| Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message
will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.
Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message.
Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across
all containers will be limited to 12kb.
Defaults to /dev/termination-log.
Cannot be updated.

| `terminationMessagePolicy`
| `string`
| Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of
terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure.
FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination
message file is empty and the container exited with an error.
The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller.
Defaults to File.
Cannot be updated.

| `tty`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true.
Default is false.

| `volumeDevices`
| `array`
| volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.

| `volumeDevices[]`
| `object`
| volumeDevice describes a mapping of a raw block device within a container.

| `dataSource`
| `object`
| dataSource field can be used to specify either:
* An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)
* An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.
If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.

| `dataSourceRef`
| `object`
| dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.
(Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
(Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.

Description::

--
dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty

core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.

| `allocatedResourceStatuses`
| `object (string)`
| allocatedResourceStatuses stores status of resource being resized for the given PVC.
Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:
	* Un-prefixed keys:
		- storage - the capacity of the volume.
	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered
reserved and hence may not be used.


ClaimResourceStatus can be in any of following states:
	- ControllerResizeInProgress:
		State set when resize controller starts resizing the volume in control-plane.
	- ControllerResizeFailed:
		State set when resize has failed in resize controller with a terminal error.
	- NodeResizePending:
		State set when resize controller has finished resizing the volume but further resizing of
		volume is needed on the node.
	- NodeResizeInProgress:
		State set when kubelet starts resizing the volume.
	- NodeResizeFailed:
		State set when resizing has failed in kubelet with a terminal error. Transient errors don't set
		NodeResizeFailed.
For example: if expanding a PVC for more capacity - this field can be one of the following states:
	- pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeInProgress"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeFailed"

     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeInProgress"
     - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeFailed"
When this field is not set, it means that no resize operation is in progress for the given PVC.


A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName or ClaimResourceStatus
should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller that
only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid
resources associated with PVC.


This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature.

| `allocatedResources`
| `integer-or-string`
| allocatedResources tracks the resources allocated to a PVC including its capacity.
Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:
	* Un-prefixed keys:
		- storage - the capacity of the volume.
	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered
reserved and hence may not be used.


Capacity reported here may be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion operation
is requested.
For storage quota, the larger value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used.
If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation.
If a volume expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only
lowered if there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume capacity
is equal or lower than the requested capacity.


A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName
should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller that
only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid
resources associated with PVC.

Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
tolerate all taints of a particular category.

| `tolerationSeconds`
| `integer`
| TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

| `value`
| `string`
| Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

  - `whenUnsatisfiable`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `labelSelector`
| `object`
| LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.
Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods
in their corresponding topology domain.

| `matchLabelKeys`
| `array (string)`
| MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.


This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

| `maxSkew`
| `integer`
| MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
In this case, the global minimum is 1.
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\|  P P  \|  P P  \|   P   \|
- if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
violate MaxSkew(1).
- if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
to topologies that satisfy it.
It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

| `minDomains`
| `integer`
| MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
this value has no effect on scheduling.
As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
Valid values are integers greater than 0.
When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\|  P P  \|  P P  \|  P P  \|
The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
it will violate MaxSkew.

| `nodeAffinityPolicy`
| `string`
| NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations.
- Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.


If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy.
This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

| `nodeTaintsPolicy`
| `string`
| NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating
pod topology spread skew. Options are:
- Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod
has a toleration, are included.
- Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.


If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.
This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

| `topologyKey`
| `string`
| TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
of pods into each bucket.
We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.
It's a required field.

| `whenUnsatisfiable`
| `string`
| WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
the spread constraint.
- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
  skew.
A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
"MaxSkew" on some topology.
For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
\| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \|
\| P P P \|   P   \|   P   \|
If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
won't make it *more* imbalanced.
It's a required field.

| `ephemeral`
| `object`
| ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
and deleted when the pod is removed.


Use this if:
a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
   tracking are needed,
c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
   information on the connection between this volume type
   and PersistentVolumeClaim).


Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
of an individual pod.


Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
more information.

=== .spec.volumes[].ephemeral
Description::
+
--
ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
and deleted when the pod is removed.


Use this if:
a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
   tracking are needed,
c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
   information on the connection between this volume type
   and PersistentVolumeClaim).


Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
of an individual pod.


Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
more information.


A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
persistent volumes at the same time.

| `object`
| Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
`<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

| `dataSource`
| `object`
| dataSource field can be used to specify either:
* An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)
* An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.
If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.

| `dataSourceRef`
| `object`
| dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1

| `volumeAttributesClassName`
| `string`
| volumeAttributesClassName may be used to set the VolumeAttributesClass used by this claim.
If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined
in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,
it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
exists.
More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-attributes-classes/
(Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.

| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
