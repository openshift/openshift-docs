Description::
+
--
The `PodMonitor` custom resource definition (CRD) defines how `Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` can scrape metrics from a group of pods.
Among other things, it allows to specify:
* The pods to scrape via label selectors.
* The container ports to scrape.
* Authentication credentials to use.
* Target and metric relabeling.

`Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` objects select `PodMonitor` objects using label and namespace selectors.

`jobLabel` selects the label from the associated Kubernetes `Pod`
object which will be used as the `job` label for all metrics.

For example if `jobLabel` is set to `foo` and the Kubernetes `Pod`
object is labeled with `foo: bar`, then Prometheus adds the `job="bar"`
label to all ingested metrics.

If the value of this field is empty, the `job` label of the metrics
defaults to the namespace and name of the PodMonitor object (e.g. `<namespace>/<name>`).

| `keepDroppedTargets`
| `integer`
| keepDroppedTargets defines the per-scrape limit on the number of targets dropped by relabeling
that will be kept in memory. 0 means no limit.

By default, the pods are discovered in the same namespace as the `PodMonitor` object but it is possible to select pods across different/all namespaces.

| `nativeHistogramBucketLimit`
| `integer`

buckets will be merged to stay within the limit.
It requires Prometheus >= v2.45.0.

| `object`
| selector defines the label selector to select the Kubernetes `Pod` objects to scrape metrics from.

| `selectorMechanism`
| `string`
| selectorMechanism defines the mechanism used to select the endpoints to scrape.
By default, the selection process relies on relabel configurations to filter the discovered targets.
Alternatively, you can opt in for role selectors, which may offer better efficiency in large clusters.
Which strategy is best for your use case needs to be carefully evaluated.

It requires Prometheus >= v2.17.0.

| `targetLimit`

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `authorization`
| `object`
| authorization configures the Authorization header credentials used by
the client.

Cannot be set at the same time as `basicAuth`, `bearerTokenSecret` or `oauth2`.

| `basicAuth`
| `object`
| basicAuth defines the Basic Authentication credentials used by the
client.

Cannot be set at the same time as `authorization`, `bearerTokenSecret` or `oauth2`.

| `bearerTokenSecret`
| `object`
| bearerTokenSecret defines a key of a Secret containing the bearer token
used by the client for authentication. The secret needs to be in the
same namespace as the custom resource and readable by the Prometheus
Operator.

Cannot be set at the same time as `authorization`, `basicAuth` or `oauth2`.

Deprecated: use `authorization` instead.

| `enableHttp2`
| `boolean`
| enableHttp2 can be used to disable HTTP2.

| `filterRunning`
| `boolean`
| filterRunning when true, the pods which are not running (e.g. either in Failed or
Succeeded state) are dropped during the target discovery.

If unset, the filtering is enabled.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-phase

| `followRedirects`
| `boolean`
| followRedirects defines whether the client should follow HTTP 3xx
redirects.

| `honorLabels`
| `boolean`
| honorLabels when true preserves the metric's labels when they collide
with the target's labels.

| `honorTimestamps`
| `boolean`
| honorTimestamps defines whether Prometheus preserves the timestamps
when exposed by the target.

| `interval`
| `string`
| interval at which Prometheus scrapes the metrics from the target.

If empty, Prometheus uses the global scrape interval.

| `metricRelabelings`
| `array`
| metricRelabelings defines the relabeling rules to apply to the
samples before ingestion.

| `metricRelabelings[]`
| `object`
| RelabelConfig allows dynamic rewriting of the label set for targets, alerts,
scraped samples and remote write samples.

More info: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config

| `noProxy`
| `string`
| noProxy defines a comma-separated string that can contain IPs, CIDR notation, domain names
that should be excluded from proxying. IP and domain names can
contain port numbers.

It requires Prometheus >= v2.43.0, Alertmanager >= v0.25.0 or Thanos >= v0.32.0.

| `oauth2`
| `object`
| oauth2 defines the OAuth2 settings used by the client.

It requires Prometheus >= 2.27.0.

| `object`
| params define optional HTTP URL parameters.

| `params{}`
| `array (string)`
|

| `path`
| `string`
| path defines the HTTP path from which to scrape for metrics.

If empty, Prometheus uses the default value (e.g. `/metrics`).

| `port`
| `string`
| port defines the `Pod` port name which exposes the endpoint.

If the pod doesn't expose a port with the same name, it will result
in no targets being discovered.

If a `Pod` has multiple `Port` values with the same name (which is not
recommended), one target instance per unique port number will be
generated.

It takes precedence over the `portNumber` and `targetPort` fields.

| `portNumber`
| `integer`
| portNumber defines the `Pod` port number which exposes the endpoint.

The `Pod` must declare the specified `Port` in its spec or the
target will be dropped by Prometheus.

This cannot be used to enable scraping of an undeclared port.
To scrape targets on a port which isn't exposed, you need to use
relabeling to override the `__address__` label (but beware of
duplicate targets if the `Pod` has other declared ports).

In practice Prometheus will select targets for which the
matches the target's __meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_number.

| `proxyConnectHeader`
| `object`
| proxyConnectHeader optionally specifies headers to send to
proxies during CONNECT requests.

It requires Prometheus >= v2.43.0, Alertmanager >= v0.25.0 or Thanos >= v0.32.0.

It requires Prometheus >= v2.43.0, Alertmanager >= v0.25.0 or Thanos >= v0.32.0.

| `proxyUrl`
| `string`

More info: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config

| `relabelings[]`
| `object`
| RelabelConfig allows dynamic rewriting of the label set for targets, alerts,
scraped samples and remote write samples.

| `scheme`
| `string`
| scheme defines the HTTP scheme to use for scraping.

| `scrapeTimeout`
| `string`
| scrapeTimeout defines the timeout after which Prometheus considers the scrape to be failed.

If empty, Prometheus uses the global scrape timeout unless it is less
than the target's scrape interval value in which the latter is used.
The value cannot be greater than the scrape interval otherwise the operator will reject the resource.

| `targetPort`
| `integer-or-string`
| targetPort defines the name or number of the target port of the `Pod` object behind the Service, the
port must be specified with container port property.

Deprecated: use 'port' or 'portNumber' instead.

| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
