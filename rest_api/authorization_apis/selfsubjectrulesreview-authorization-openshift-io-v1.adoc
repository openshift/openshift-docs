| Property | Type | Description

| `apiGroups`
| `array (string)`
| APIGroups is the name of the APIGroup that contains the resources.  If this field is empty, then both kubernetes and origin API groups are assumed. That means that if an action is requested against one of the enumerated resources in either the kubernetes or the origin API group, the request will be allowed

| `attributeRestrictions`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.runtime.RawExtension[`RawExtension`]
| AttributeRestrictions will vary depending on what the Authorizer/AuthorizationAttributeBuilder pair supports. If the Authorizer does not recognize how to handle the AttributeRestrictions, the Authorizer should report an error.

| `nonResourceURLs`
| `array (string)`
| NonResourceURLsSlice is a set of partial urls that a user should have access to.  *s are allowed, but only as the full, final step in the path This name is intentionally different than the internal type so that the DefaultConvert works nicely and because the ordering may be different.

| `resourceNames`
| `array (string)`
| ResourceNames is an optional white list of names that the rule applies to.  An empty set means that everything is allowed.

| `resources`
| `array (string)`
| Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to.  ResourceAll represents all resources.

| `verbs`
| `array (string)`
| Verbs is a list of Verbs that apply to ALL the ResourceKinds and AttributeRestrictions contained in this rule.  VerbAll represents all kinds.

[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description

Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
