| `content`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#rawextension-pkg-none[`RawExtension pkg/none`]
| Content is the actual content of the request for create and update

| `groups`
| `array (string)`
| Groups is optional.  Groups is the list of groups to which the User belongs.

| `isNonResourceURL`
| `boolean`
| IsNonResourceURL is true if this is a request for a non-resource URL (outside of the resource hierarchy)

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `namespace`

| `resource`
| `string`
| Resource is one of the existing resource types

| Group is the API group of the resource Serialized as resourceAPIGroup to avoid confusion with the 'groups' field when inlined

| `resourceAPIVersion`
| `string`
| Version is the API version of the resource Serialized as resourceAPIVersion to avoid confusion with TypeMeta.apiVersion and ObjectMeta.resourceVersion when inlined

| `resourceName`

| `scopes`
| `array (string)`
| Scopes to use for the evaluation.  Empty means "use the unscoped (full) permissions of the user/groups". Nil for a self-SAR, means "use the scopes on this request". Nil for a regular SAR, means the same as empty.
