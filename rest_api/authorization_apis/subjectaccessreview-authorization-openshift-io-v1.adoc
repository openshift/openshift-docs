== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `content`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-runtime-RawExtension[`RawExtension`]
| Content is the actual content of the request for create and update

| `groups`
| `array (string)`
| GroupsSlice is optional. Groups is the list of groups to which the User belongs.

| `isNonResourceURL`
| `boolean`
| IsNonResourceURL is true if this is a request for a non-resource URL (outside of the resource hierarchy)

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace is the namespace of the action being requested.  Currently, there is no distinction between no namespace and all namespaces

| `path`
| `string`
| Path is the path of a non resource URL

| `resource`
| `string`
| Resource is one of the existing resource types

| `resourceAPIGroup`
| `string`
| Group is the API group of the resource Serialized as resourceAPIGroup to avoid confusion with the 'groups' field when inlined

| `resourceAPIVersion`
| `string`
| Version is the API version of the resource Serialized as resourceAPIVersion to avoid confusion with TypeMeta.apiVersion and ObjectMeta.resourceVersion when inlined

| `resourceName`
| `string`
| ResourceName is the name of the resource being requested for a "get" or deleted for a "delete"

| `scopes`
| `array (string)`
| Scopes to use for the evaluation.  Empty means "use the unscoped (full) permissions of the user/groups". Nil for a self-SAR, means "use the scopes on this request". Nil for a regular SAR, means the same as empty.

| `user`
| `string`
| User is optional. If both User and Groups are empty, the current authenticated user is used.

| `verb`
| `string`
| Verb is one of: get, list, watch, create, update, delete

.Global query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
