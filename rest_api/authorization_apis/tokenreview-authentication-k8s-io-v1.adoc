== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| TokenReviewSpec is a description of the token authentication request.

| `status`

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `audiences`
| `array (string)`
| Audiences is a list of the identifiers that the resource server presented with the token identifies as. Audience-aware token authenticators will verify that the token was intended for at least one of the audiences in this list. If no audiences are provided, the audience will default to the audience of the Kubernetes apiserver.

| `token`
| `string`
| Token is the opaque bearer token.

|===
=== .status
Description::
+
--
TokenReviewStatus is the result of the token authentication request.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `audiences`
| `array (string)`
| Audiences are audience identifiers chosen by the authenticator that are compatible with both the TokenReview and token. An identifier is any identifier in the intersection of the TokenReviewSpec audiences and the token's audiences. A client of the TokenReview API that sets the spec.audiences field should validate that a compatible audience identifier is returned in the status.audiences field to ensure that the TokenReview server is audience aware. If a TokenReview returns an empty status.audience field where status.authenticated is "true", the token is valid against the audience of the Kubernetes API server.

| `authenticated`
| `boolean`
| Authenticated indicates that the token was associated with a known user.

| `error`
| `string`
| Error indicates that the token couldn't be checked

| `user`
| `object`
| UserInfo holds the information about the user needed to implement the user.Info interface.

| `extra{}`
| `array (string)`
| 

| `groups`
| `array (string)`
| The names of groups this user is a part of.

| `uid`
| `string`
| A unique value that identifies this user across time. If this user is deleted and another user by the same name is added, they will have different UIDs.

| `username`
| `string`
| The name that uniquely identifies this user among all active users.

The following API endpoints are available:

.Global query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
