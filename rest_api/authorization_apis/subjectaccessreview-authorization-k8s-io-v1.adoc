| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| Property | Type | Description

| `fieldSelector`
| `object`
| FieldSelectorAttributes indicates a field limited access. Webhook authors are encouraged to * ensure rawSelector and requirements are not both set * consider the requirements field if set * not try to parse or consider the rawSelector field if set. This is to avoid another CVE-2022-2880 (i.e. getting different systems to agree on how exactly to parse a query is not something we want), see https://www.oxeye.io/resources/golang-parameter-smuggling-attack for more details. For the *SubjectAccessReview endpoints of the kube-apiserver: * If rawSelector is empty and requirements are empty, the request is not limited. * If rawSelector is present and requirements are empty, the rawSelector will be parsed and limited if the parsing succeeds. * If rawSelector is empty and requirements are present, the requirements should be honored * If rawSelector is present and requirements are present, the request is invalid.

| `group`

Webhook authors are encouraged to * ensure rawSelector and requirements are not both set * consider the requirements field if set * not try to parse or consider the rawSelector field if set.

| `name`
| `string`
| Name is the name of the resource being requested for a "get" or deleted for a "delete". "" (empty) means all.

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace is the namespace of the action being requested.  Currently, there is no distinction between no namespace and all namespaces "" (empty) is defaulted for LocalSubjectAccessReviews "" (empty) is empty for cluster-scoped resources "" (empty) means "all" for namespace scoped resources from a SubjectAccessReview or SelfSubjectAccessReview

| `resource`
| `string`
| Resource is one of the existing resource types.  "*" means all.

| `subresource`
| `string`
| Subresource is one of the existing resource types.  "" means none.

| Property | Type | Description

| `rawSelector`
| `string`
| rawSelector is the serialization of a field selector that would be included in a query parameter. Webhook implementations are encouraged to ignore rawSelector. The kube-apiserver's *SubjectAccessReview will parse the rawSelector as long as the requirements are not present.

| `requirements`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-FieldSelectorRequirement[`array (FieldSelectorRequirement)`]
| requirements is the parsed interpretation of a field selector. All requirements must be met for a resource instance to match the selector. Webhook implementations should handle requirements, but how to handle them is up to the webhook. Since requirements can only limit the request, it is safe to authorize as unlimited request if the requirements are not understood.

Type::

Required::
  - `allowed`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `allowed`
| `boolean`
| Allowed is required. True if the action would be allowed, false otherwise.

| `denied`
| `boolean`
| Denied is optional. True if the action would be denied, otherwise false. If both allowed is false and denied is false, then the authorizer has no opinion on whether to authorize the action. Denied may not be true if Allowed is true.

| `evaluationError`
| `string`
| EvaluationError is an indication that some error occurred during the authorization check. It is entirely possible to get an error and be able to continue determine authorization status in spite of it. For instance, RBAC can be missing a role, but enough roles are still present and bound to reason about the request.

| `reason`
| `string`
| Reason is optional.  It indicates why a request was allowed or denied.

== API endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

* `/apis/authorization.k8s.io/v1/subjectaccessreviews`
- `POST`: create a SubjectAccessReview


=== /apis/authorization.k8s.io/v1/subjectaccessreviews


.Global query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
