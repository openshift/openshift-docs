== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec contains the desired configuration for the console plugin.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `backend`
  - `displayName`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `backend`
| `object`
| backend holds the configuration of backend which is serving console's plugin .

| `contentSecurityPolicy`
| `array`
| contentSecurityPolicy is a list of Content-Security-Policy (CSP) directives for the plugin.
Each directive specifies a list of values, appropriate for the given directive type,
for example a list of remote endpoints for fetch directives such as ScriptSrc.
Console web application uses CSP to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks,
such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.
Dynamic plugins should specify this field if need to load assets from outside
the cluster or if violation reports are observed. Dynamic plugins should always prefer
loading their assets from within the cluster, either by vendoring them, or fetching
from a cluster service.
CSP violation reports can be viewed in the browser's console logs during development and
testing of the plugin in the OpenShift web console.
Available directive types are DefaultSrc, ScriptSrc, StyleSrc, ImgSrc, FontSrc and ConnectSrc.
Each of the available directives may be defined only once in the list.
The value 'self' is automatically included in all fetch directives by the OpenShift web
console's backend.
For more information about the CSP directives, see:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy

The OpenShift web console server aggregates the CSP directives and values across
its own default values and all enabled ConsolePlugin CRs, merging them into a single
policy string that is sent to the browser via `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP response header.

Example:
  ConsolePlugin A directives:
    script-src: https://script1.com/, https://script2.com/
    font-src: https://font1.com/

  ConsolePlugin B directives:
    script-src: https://script2.com/, https://script3.com/
    font-src: https://font2.com/
    img-src: https://img1.com/

  Unified set of CSP directives, passed to the OpenShift web console server:
    script-src: https://script1.com/, https://script2.com/, https://script3.com/
    font-src: https://font1.com/, https://font2.com/
    img-src: https://img1.com/

  OpenShift web console server CSP response header:
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; base-uri 'self'; script-src 'self' https://script1.com/ https://script2.com/ https://script3.com/; font-src 'self' https://font1.com/ https://font2.com/; img-src 'self' https://img1.com/; style-src 'self'; frame-src 'none'; object-src 'none'

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present.
