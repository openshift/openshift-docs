Description::
  Template contains the inputs needed to produce a Config.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `objects`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.labels`
| `object (string)`
| labels is a optional set of labels that are applied to every object during the Template to Config transformation.

| `.message`
| `string`
| message is an optional instructional message that will be displayed when this template is instantiated. This field should inform the user how to utilize the newly created resources. Parameter substitution will be performed on the message before being displayed so that generated credentials and other parameters can be included in the output.

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata.

| `.objects`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#rawextension-pkg-runtime[`array (RawExtension pkg/runtime)`]
| objects is an array of resources to include in this template. If a namespace value is hardcoded in the object, it will be removed during template instantiation, however if the namespace value is, or contains, a ${PARAMETER_REFERENCE}, the resolved value after parameter substitution will be respected and the object will be created in that namespace.

| `.parameters`
| `array`
| parameters is an optional array of Parameters used during the Template to Config transformation.

| `.parameters[]`
| `object`
| Parameter defines a name/value variable that is to be processed during the Template to Config transformation.

|===
..parameters
Description::
  parameters is an optional array of Parameters used during the Template to Config transformation.

Type::
  `array`




..parameters[]
Description::
  Parameter defines a name/value variable that is to be processed during the Template to Config transformation.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `name`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `description`
| `string`
| Description of a parameter. Optional.

| `displayName`
| `string`
| Optional: The name that will show in UI instead of parameter 'Name'

| `from`
| `string`
| From is an input value for the generator. Optional.

| `generate`
| `string`
| generate specifies the generator to be used to generate random string from an input value specified by From field. The result string is stored into Value field. If empty, no generator is being used, leaving the result Value untouched. Optional.

The only supported generator is "expression", which accepts a "from" value in the form of a simple regular expression containing the range expression "[a-zA-Z0-9]", and the length expression "a{length}".

Examples:

from             \| value ----------------------------- "test[0-9]{1}x"  \| "test7x" "[0-1]{8}"       \| "01001100" "0x[A-F0-9]{4}"  \| "0xB3AF" "[a-zA-Z0-9]{8}" \| "hW4yQU5i"

| `name`
| `string`
| Name must be set and it can be referenced in Template Items using ${PARAMETER_NAME}. Required.

| `required`
| `boolean`
| Optional: Indicates the parameter must have a value.  Defaults to false.

| `value`
| `string`
| Value holds the Parameter data. If specified, the generator will be ignored. The value replaces all occurrences of the Parameter ${Name} expression during the Template to Config transformation. Optional.

.Global guery parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `continue`
| `string`
| The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
| `fieldSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
| `includeUninitialized`
| `boolean`
| If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
| `labelSelector`
| `string`
| A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
| `limit`
| `integer`
| limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
| `pretty`
| `string`
| If &#x27;true&#x27;, then the output is pretty printed.
| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it&#x27;s 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
| `timeoutSeconds`
| `integer`
| Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
| `watch`
| `boolean`
| Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
