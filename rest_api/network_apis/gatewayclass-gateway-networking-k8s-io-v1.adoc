Description::
+
--
GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the user for creating
Gateway resources.

It is recommended that this resource be used as a template for Gateways. This
means that a Gateway is based on the state of the GatewayClass at the time it
was created and changes to the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not
propagated down to existing Gateways. This recommendation is intended to
limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters.
If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing
Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.

Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations SHOULD
add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer on the
associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated with a
Gateway is not deleted while in use.

GatewayClass is a Cluster level resource.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| Spec defines the desired state of GatewayClass.

| `status`
| `object`
| Status defines the current state of GatewayClass.

Implementations MUST populate status on all GatewayClass resources which
specify their controller name.

|===
=== .spec
Description::
+
--
Spec defines the desired state of GatewayClass.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `controllerName`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `controllerName`
| `string`
| ControllerName is the name of the controller that is managing Gateways of
this class. The value of this field MUST be a domain prefixed path.

Example: "example.net/gateway-controller".

This field is not mutable and cannot be empty.

Support: Core

| `description`
| `string`
| Description helps describe a GatewayClass with more details.

| `parametersRef`
| `object`
| ParametersRef is a reference to a resource that contains the configuration
parameters corresponding to the GatewayClass. This is optional if the
controller does not require any additional configuration.

ParametersRef can reference a standard Kubernetes resource, i.e. ConfigMap,
or an implementation-specific custom resource. The resource can be
cluster-scoped or namespace-scoped.

If the referent cannot be found, refers to an unsupported kind, or when
the data within that resource is malformed, the GatewayClass SHOULD be
rejected with the "Accepted" status condition set to "False" and an
"InvalidParameters" reason.

A Gateway for this GatewayClass may provide its own `parametersRef`. When both are specified,
the merging behavior is implementation specific.
It is generally recommended that GatewayClass provides defaults that can be overridden by a Gateway.

Support: Implementation-specific

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `group`
| `string`
| Group is the group of the referent.

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is kind of the referent.

| `name`
| `string`
| Name is the name of the referent.

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace is the namespace of the referent.
This field is required when referring to a Namespace-scoped resource and
MUST be unset when referring to a Cluster-scoped resource.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `conditions`
| `array`
| Conditions is the current status from the controller for
this GatewayClass.

Controllers should prefer to publish conditions using values
of GatewayClassConditionType for the type of each Condition.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource.

|===
=== .status.conditions

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `lastTransitionTime`
  - `message`
  - `reason`
  - `status`
  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.
This may be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
The value should be a CamelCase string.
This field may not be empty.

| `status`
| `string`
| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields.
