Description::
+
--
GRPCRoute provides a way to route gRPC requests. This includes the capability
to match requests by hostname, gRPC service, gRPC method, or HTTP/2 header.
Filters can be used to specify additional processing steps. Backends specify
where matching requests will be routed.

GRPCRoute falls under extended support within the Gateway API. Within the
following specification, the word "MUST" indicates that an implementation
supporting GRPCRoute must conform to the indicated requirement, but an
implementation not supporting this route type need not follow the requirement
unless explicitly indicated.

Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTPS` `ProtocolType` MUST
accept HTTP/2 connections without an initial upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. via
ALPN. If the implementation does not support this, then it MUST set the
"Accepted" condition to "False" for the affected listener with a reason of
"UnsupportedProtocol".  Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections
with an upgrade from HTTP/1.

Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTP` `ProtocolType` MUST
support HTTP/2 over cleartext TCP (h2c,
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.1) without an initial
upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. with prior knowledge
(https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.4). If the implementation
does not support this, then it MUST set the "Accepted" condition to "False"
for the affected listener with a reason of "UnsupportedProtocol".
Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections with an upgrade from
HTTP/1, i.e. without prior knowledge.

| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `hostnames`
| `array (string)`
| Hostnames defines a set of hostnames to match against the GRPC
Host header to select a GRPCRoute to process the request. This matches
the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:

1. IPs are not allowed.
2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`\*.`). The wildcard
   label MUST appear by itself as the first label.

If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and GRPCRoute, there
MUST be at least one intersecting hostname for the GRPCRoute to be
attached to the Listener. For example:

* A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes
  that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
  least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
* A Listener with `\*.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes
  that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
  one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
  `test.example.com` and `\*.example.com` would both match. On the other
  hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.

Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`\*.`) are interpreted
as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, any
GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
`test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered for a match.

If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, and none
match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute MUST NOT be accepted by
the implementation. The implementation MUST raise an 'Accepted' Condition
with a status of `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

If a Route (A) of type HTTPRoute or GRPCRoute is attached to a
Listener and that listener already has another Route (B) of the other
type attached and the intersection of the hostnames of A and B is
non-empty, then the implementation MUST accept exactly one of these two
routes, determined by the following criteria, in order:

* The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
* The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
  "{namespace}/{name}".

The rejected Route MUST raise an 'Accepted' condition with a status of
'False' in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

Support: Core

| `parentRefs`
| `array`
| ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
Route.

There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
* Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
resources.

ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

* They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
  entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
  multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
  be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
* They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
  each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
  optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
  combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.

Some examples:

* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
  same object must also set `sectionName`.
* If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
  object must also set `port`.
* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
  referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.

It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
merged.

Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.

| `parentRefs[]`
| `object`
| ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources
with "Core" support:

* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
* Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
resources.

The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

| `rules`
| `array`
| Rules are a list of GRPC matchers, filters and actions.

| `rules[]`
| `object`
| GRPCRouteRule defines the semantics for matching a gRPC request based on
conditions (matches), processing it (filters), and forwarding the request to
an API object (backendRefs).

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `group`
| `string`
| Group is the group of the referent.
When unspecified, "gateway.networking.k8s.io" is inferred.
To set the core API group (such as for a "Service" kind referent),
Group must be explicitly set to "" (empty string).

Support: Core

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is kind of the referent.

There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
* Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.

| `name`
| `string`
| Name is the name of the referent.

Support: Core

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
to the local namespace of the Route.

Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

Support: Core

| `port`
| `integer`
| Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
differently based on the type of parent resource.

When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
must match both specified values.

Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
document how/if Port is interpreted.

For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

Support: Extended

| `sectionName`
| `string`
| SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

* Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
both specified values.
* Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
both specified values.

Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
interpreted.

When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

| `backendRefs`
| `array`
| BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be

Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
how many are invalid.

If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.

See the GRPCBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
GRPCBackendRef invalid.

When a GRPCBackendRef is invalid, `UNAVAILABLE` statuses MUST be returned for
requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.

For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
invalid, 50 percent of traffic MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.
Implementations may choose how that 50 percent is determined.

| `backendRefs[]`
| `object`
| GRPCBackendRef defines how a GRPCRoute forwards a gRPC request.

Note that when a namespace different than the local namespace is specified, a
ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that
namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant
documentation for details.

| `filters`
| `array`
| Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
this rule.

The effects of ordering of multiple behaviors are currently unspecified.
This can change in the future based on feedback during the alpha stage.

Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:

- ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations that support
  GRPCRoute.
- Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
- Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
  implementations.

Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
indicated in the filter.

If an implementation cannot support a combination of filters, it must clearly
document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
`False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
this configuration error.

Support: Core

| `filters[]`
| `object`
| GRPCRouteFilter defines processing steps that must be completed during the
request or response lifecycle. GRPCRouteFilters are meant as an extension
point to express processing that may be done in Gateway implementations. Some
examples include request or response modification, implementing
authentication strategies, rate-limiting, and traffic shaping. API
guarantee/conformance is defined based on the type of the filter.

| `matches`
| `array`
| Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
gRPC requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.

For example, take the following matches configuration:


matches:
- method:
    service: foo.bar
  headers:
    values:
      version: 2
- method:
    service: foo.bar.v2


For a request to match against this rule, it MUST satisfy
EITHER of the two conditions:

- service of foo.bar AND contains the header `version: 2`
- service of foo.bar.v2

See the documentation for GRPCRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
match conditions to be ANDed together.

If no matches are specified, the implementation MUST match every gRPC request.

Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from GRPCRoutes
MUST prioritize rules based on the following criteria, continuing on
ties. Merging MUST not be done between GRPCRoutes and HTTPRoutes.
Precedence MUST be given to the rule with the largest number of:

* Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
* Characters in a matching hostname.
* Characters in a matching service.
* Characters in a matching method.
* Header matches.

If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:

* The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
* The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
  "{namespace}/{name}".

If ties still exist within the Route that has been given precedence,
matching precedence MUST be granted to the first matching rule meeting
the above criteria.

| `matches[]`
| `object`
| GRPCRouteMatch defines the predicate used to match requests to a given
action. Multiple match types are ANDed together, i.e. the match will
evaluate to true only if all conditions are satisfied.

For example, the match below will match a gRPC request only if its service
is `foo` AND it contains the `version: v1` header:


matches:
  - method:
    type: Exact
    service: "foo"
    headers:
  - name: "version"
    value "v1"

For other resources, destination port might be derived from the referent
resource or this field.

| `weight`
| `integer`
| Weight specifies the proportion of requests forwarded to the referenced
backend. This is computed as weight/(sum of all weights in this
BackendRefs list). For non-zero values, there may be some epsilon from
the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
weights does not need to equal 100.

If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight
defaults to 1.

Support for this field varies based on the context where used.

  are encouraged to support extended filters.

- Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
  In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple

Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

Description::

--
Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
this rule.

The effects of ordering of multiple behaviors are currently unspecified.
This can change in the future based on feedback during the alpha stage.

Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:

- ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations that support
  GRPCRoute.
- Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
- Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
  implementations.

Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
indicated in the filter.

If an implementation cannot support a combination of filters, it must clearly
document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
`False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
this configuration error.

point to express processing that may be done in Gateway implementations. Some
examples include request or response modification, implementing
authentication strategies, rate-limiting, and traffic shaping. API
guarantee/conformance is defined based on the type of the filter.

| `type`
| `string`
| Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
types are classified into three conformance levels:

- Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
  "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
  implementations supporting GRPCRoute MUST support core filters.

- Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
  "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
  are encouraged to support extended filters.

- Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
  In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
  implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
  conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
  is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` MUST be set to
  "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

=== .spec.rules[].matches
Description::
+
--
Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
gRPC requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.

For example, take the following matches configuration:


matches:
- method:
    service: foo.bar
  headers:
    values:
      version: 2
- method:
    service: foo.bar.v2


For a request to match against this rule, it MUST satisfy
EITHER of the two conditions:

- service of foo.bar AND contains the header `version: 2`
- service of foo.bar.v2

See the documentation for GRPCRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
match conditions to be ANDed together.

If no matches are specified, the implementation MUST match every gRPC request.

Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from GRPCRoutes
MUST prioritize rules based on the following criteria, continuing on
ties. Merging MUST not be done between GRPCRoutes and HTTPRoutes.
Precedence MUST be given to the rule with the largest number of:

* Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
* Characters in a matching hostname.
* Characters in a matching service.
* Characters in a matching method.
* Header matches.

If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:

* The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
* The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
  "{namespace}/{name}".

If ties still exist within the Route that has been given precedence,
matching precedence MUST be granted to the first matching rule meeting
the above criteria.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `conditions`
| `array`
| Conditions describes the status of the route with respect to the Gateway.
Note that the route's availability is also subject to the Gateway's own
status conditions and listener status.

If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports
Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,
then that Gateway's controller MUST set the "Accepted" condition on the
Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the
Gateway, and why.

A Route MUST be considered "Accepted" if at least one of the Route's
rules is implemented by the Gateway.

There are a number of cases where the "Accepted" condition may not be set
due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:

* The Route refers to a nonexistent parent.
* The Route is of a type that the controller does not support.
* The Route is in a namespace the controller does not have access to.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource.

| `controllerName`
| `string`
| ControllerName is a domain/path string that indicates the name of the
controller that wrote this status. This corresponds with the
controllerName field on GatewayClass.

Example: "example.net/gateway-controller".

The format of this field is DOMAIN "/" PATH, where DOMAIN and PATH are
valid Kubernetes names
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names).

Controllers MUST populate this field when writing status. Controllers should ensure that
entries to status populated with their ControllerName are cleaned up when they are no
longer necessary.

| `parentRef`
| `object`
| ParentRef corresponds with a ParentRef in the spec that this
RouteParentStatus struct describes the status of.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.
This may be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
The value should be a CamelCase string.
This field may not be empty.

Type::

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `group`
| `string`
| Group is the group of the referent.
When unspecified, "gateway.networking.k8s.io" is inferred.
To set the core API group (such as for a "Service" kind referent),
Group must be explicitly set to "" (empty string).

Support: Core

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is kind of the referent.

There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
* Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.

| `name`
| `string`
| Name is the name of the referent.

Support: Core

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
to the local namespace of the Route.

Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

Support: Core

| `port`
| `integer`
| Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
differently based on the type of parent resource.

When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
must match both specified values.

Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
document how/if Port is interpreted.

For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

Support: Extended

| `sectionName`
| `string`
| SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

* Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
both specified values.
* Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
both specified values.

Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
interpreted.

When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

Support: Core

.Query parameters
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
