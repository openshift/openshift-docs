Description::
+
--
DNSNameResolver stores the DNS name resolution information of a DNS name. It can be enabled by the TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature set.
It can also be enabled by the feature gate DNSNameResolver when using CustomNoUpgrade feature set.

Compatibility level 4: No compatibility is provided, the API can change at any point for any reason. These capabilities should not be used by applications needing long term support.

== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec is the specification of the desired behavior of the DNSNameResolver.

| `status`
| `object`
| status is the most recently observed status of the DNSNameResolver.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `name`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `name`
| `string`
| name is the DNS name for which the DNS name resolution information will be stored.
For a regular DNS name, only the DNS name resolution information of the regular DNS
name will be stored. For a wildcard DNS name, the DNS name resolution information
of all the DNS names that match the wildcard DNS name will be stored.
For a wildcard DNS name, the '*' will match only one label. Additionally, only a single
'*' can be used at the beginning of the wildcard DNS name. For example, '*.example.com.'
will match 'sub1.example.com.' but won't match 'sub2.sub1.example.com.'

| `array`
| resolvedNames contains a list of matching DNS names and their corresponding IP addresses
along with their TTL and last DNS lookup times.

| `resolvedNames[]`

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `dnsName`
  - `resolvedAddresses`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `conditions`
| `array`
| conditions provide information about the state of the DNS name.
Known .status.conditions.type is: "Degraded".
"Degraded" is true when the last resolution failed for the DNS name,
and false otherwise.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource.

| `dnsName`
| `string`
| dnsName is the resolved DNS name matching the name field of DNSNameResolverSpec. This field can
store both regular and wildcard DNS names which match the spec.name field. When the spec.name
field contains a regular DNS name, this field will store the same regular DNS name after it is
successfully resolved. When the spec.name field contains a wildcard DNS name, each resolvedName.dnsName
will store the regular DNS names which match the wildcard DNS name and have been successfully resolved.
If the wildcard DNS name can also be successfully resolved, then this field will store the wildcard
DNS name as well.

| `resolutionFailures`
| `integer`
| resolutionFailures keeps the count of how many consecutive times the DNS resolution failed
for the dnsName. If the DNS resolution succeeds then the field will be set to zero. Upon
every failure, the value of the field will be incremented by one. The details about the DNS
name will be removed, if the value of resolutionFailures reaches 5 and the TTL of all the
associated IP addresses have expired.

| `resolvedAddresses`
| `array`
| resolvedAddresses gives the list of associated IP addresses and their corresponding TTLs and last
lookup times for the dnsName.

| `resolvedAddresses[]`
| `object`
| DNSNameResolverResolvedAddress describes the details of an IP address for a resolved DNS name.

|===
=== .status.resolvedNames[].conditions

Required::
  - `lastTransitionTime`
  - `message`
  - `reason`
  - `status`
  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.
This may be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
The value should be a CamelCase string.
This field may not be empty.

| `status`
| `string`
| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.

--
DNSNameResolverResolvedAddress describes the details of an IP address for a resolved DNS name.
--

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `ip`
  - `lastLookupTime`
  - `ttlSeconds`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `ip`
| `string`
| ip is an IP address associated with the dnsName. The validity of the IP address expires after
lastLookupTime + ttlSeconds. To refresh the information, a DNS lookup will be performed upon
the expiration of the IP address's validity. If the information is not refreshed then it will
be removed with a grace period after the expiration of the IP address's validity.

| `lastLookupTime`
| `string`
| lastLookupTime is the timestamp when the last DNS lookup was completed successfully. The validity of
the IP address expires after lastLookupTime + ttlSeconds. The value of this field will be updated to
the current time on a successful DNS lookup. If the information is not refreshed then it will be
removed with a grace period after the expiration of the IP address's validity.

| `ttlSeconds`
| `integer`
| ttlSeconds is the time-to-live value of the IP address. The validity of the IP address expires after
lastLookupTime + ttlSeconds. On a successful DNS lookup the value of this field will be updated with
the current time-to-live value. If the information is not refreshed then it will be removed with a
grace period after the expiration of the IP address's validity.

| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
