| `egress`
| `array`
| Egress is the list of Egress rules to be applied to the selected pods if
they are not matched by any AdminNetworkPolicy or NetworkPolicy rules.
A total of 100 Egress rules will be allowed in each BANP instance.

will be determined by the order in which the rule is written.
Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the egress rules
would take the highest precedence.
BANPs with no egress rules do not affect egress traffic.

This is intended for representing entities that live outside the cluster,
which can't be selected by pods, namespaces and nodes peers, but note
that cluster-internal traffic will be checked against the rule as
well. So if you Allow or Deny traffic to `"0.0.0.0/0"`, that will allow
or deny all IPv4 pod-to-pod traffic as well. If you don't want that,
add a rule that Passes all pod traffic before the Networks rule.


Each item in Networks should be provided in the CIDR format and should be
IPv4 or IPv6, for example "10.0.0.0/8" or "fd00::/8".


Networks can have upto 25 CIDRs specified.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.
This may be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
The value should be a CamelCase string.
This field may not be empty.

| `status`
| `string`
| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.
---
Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)
