Description::

--
Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the endpoints defined by a backend. An Ingress can be configured to give services externally-reachable urls, load balance traffic, terminate SSL, offer name based virtual hosting etc.

  `object`



== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `defaultBackend`
| `object`
| IngressBackend describes all endpoints for a given service and port.

| `ingressClassName`
| `string`
| ingressClassName is the name of an IngressClass cluster resource. Ingress controller implementations use this field to know whether they should be serving this Ingress resource, by a transitive connection (controller -> IngressClass -> Ingress resource). Although the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation (simple constant name) was never formally defined, it was widely supported by Ingress controllers to create a direct binding between Ingress controller and Ingress resources. Newly created Ingress resources should prefer using the field. However, even though the annotation is officially deprecated, for backwards compatibility reasons, ingress controllers should still honor that annotation if present.

| `rules`
| `array`
| rules is a list of host rules used to configure the Ingress. If unspecified, or no rule matches, all traffic is sent to the default backend.

| `rules[]`
| `object`
| IngressRule represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching IngressRuleValue.

| `tls`
| `array`
| tls represents the TLS configuration. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI.

| `tls[]`
| `object`
| IngressTLS describes the transport layer security associated with an ingress.

Type::
  `array`




=== .spec.rules[]
Description::
+
--
IngressRule represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching IngressRuleValue.
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `host`
| `string`
| host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the "host" part of the URI as defined in RFC 3986: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to
   the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress.
2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.
	  Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and
	  :443 for https.
Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue.

host can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.bar.com") or "wildcard", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. "*.foo.com"). The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == "*"). Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following way: 1. If host is precise, the request matches this rule if the http host header is equal to Host. 2. If host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if the http host header is to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule.

| `http`
| `object`
| HTTPIngressRuleValue is a list of http selectors pointing to backends. In the example: http://<host>/<path>?<searchpart> -> backend where where parts of the url correspond to RFC 3986, this resource will be used to match against everything after the last '/' and before the first '?' or '#'.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `backend`
| `object`
| IngressBackend describes all endpoints for a given service and port.

| `path`
| `string`
| path is matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional "path" part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a '/' and must be present when using PathType with value "Exact" or "Prefix".

| `pathType`
| `string`
| pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can be one of the following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
  done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
  list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
  match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
  request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
  of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
  matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
* ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
  the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
  or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
Implementations are required to support all path types.

Possible enum values:
 - `"Exact"` matches the URL path exactly and with case sensitivity.
 - `"ImplementationSpecific"` matching is up to the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
 - `"Prefix"` matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is case sensitive and done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers to the list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz). If multiple matching paths exist in an Ingress spec, the longest matching path is given priority. Examples: - /foo/bar does not match requests to /foo/barbaz - /foo/bar matches request to /foo/bar and /foo/bar/baz - /foo and /foo/ both match requests to /foo and /foo/. If both paths are present in an Ingress spec, the longest matching path (/foo/) is given priority.

|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
