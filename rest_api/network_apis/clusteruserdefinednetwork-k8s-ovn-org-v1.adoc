This field is only allowed for "Primary" network.
It is not recommended to set this field without explicit need and understanding of the OVN network topology.
When omitted, the platform will choose a reasonable default which is subject to change over time.

|===
| Property | Type | Description

Only supported when mode is `Enabled`.

| `mode`
| `string`
| Mode controls how much of the IP configuration will be managed by OVN.
`Enabled` means OVN-Kubernetes will apply IP configuration to the SDN infrastructure and it will also assign IPs
from the selected subnet to the individual pods.
`Disabled` means OVN-Kubernetes will only assign MAC addresses and provide layer 2 communication, letting users
configure IP addresses for the pods.
`Disabled` is only available for Secondary networks.
By disabling IPAM, any Kubernetes features that rely on selecting pods by IP will no longer function
(such as network policy, services, etc). Additionally, IP port security will also be disabled for interfaces attached to this network.
Defaults to `Enabled`.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `excludeSubnets`
| `array (string)`
| excludeSubnets is a list of CIDRs to be removed from the specified CIDRs in `subnets`.
The CIDRs in this list must be in range of at least one subnet specified in `subnets`.
excludeSubnets is optional. When omitted no IP address is excluded and all IP addresses specified in `subnets`
are subject to assignment.
The format should match standard CIDR notation (for example, "10.128.0.0/16").
This field must be omitted if `subnets` is unset or `ipam.mode` is `Disabled`.
When `physicalNetworkName` points to OVS bridge mapping of a network with reserved IP addresses
(which shouldn't be assigned by OVN-Kubernetes), the specified CIDRs will not be assigned. For example:
Given: `subnets: "10.0.0.0/24"`, `excludeSubnets: "10.0.0.200/30", the following addresses will not be assigned
to pods: `10.0.0.201`, `10.0.0.202`.

| `ipam`
| `object`
| ipam configurations for the network.
ipam is optional. When omitted, `subnets` must be specified.
When `ipam.mode` is `Disabled`, `subnets` must be omitted.
`ipam.mode` controls how much of the IP configuration will be managed by OVN.
   When `Enabled`, OVN-Kubernetes will apply IP configuration to the SDN infra and assign IPs from the selected
   subnet to the pods.
   When `Disabled`, OVN-Kubernetes only assigns MAC addresses, and provides layer2 communication, and enables users
   to configure IP addresses on the pods.
`ipam.lifecycle` controls IP addresses management lifecycle.
   When set to 'Persistent', the assigned IP addresses will be persisted in `ipamclaims.k8s.cni.cncf.io` object.
	  Useful for VMs, IP address will be persistent after restarts and migrations. Supported when `ipam.mode` is `Enabled`.

| `mtu`
| `integer`
| mtu is the maximum transmission unit for a network.
mtu is optional. When omitted, the configured value in OVN-Kubernetes (defaults to 1500 for localnet topology)
is used for the network.
Minimum value for IPv4 subnet is 576, and for IPv6 subnet is 1280.
Maximum value is 65536.
In a scenario `physicalNetworkName` points to OVS bridge mapping of a network configured with certain MTU settings,
this field enables configuring the same MTU on pod interface, having the pod MTU aligned with the network MTU.
Misaligned MTU across the stack (e.g.: pod has MTU X, node NIC has MTU Y), could result in network disruptions
and bad performance.

| `physicalNetworkName`
| `string`
| physicalNetworkName points to the OVS bridge-mapping's network-name configured in the nodes, required.
Min length is 1, max length is 253, cannot contain `,` or `:` characters.
In case OVS bridge-mapping is defined by Kubernetes-nmstate with `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP),
this field should point to the NNCP `spec.desiredState.ovn.bridge-mappings` item's `localnet` value.

| `role`
| `string`
| role describes the network role in the pod, required.
Controls whether the pod interface will act as primary or secondary.
Localnet topology supports `Secondary` only.
The network will be assigned to pods that have the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks` annotation in place pointing
to subject.

| `subnets`
| `array (string)`
| subnets is a list of subnets used for pods in this localnet network across the cluster.
The list may be either 1 IPv4 subnet, 1 IPv6 subnet, or 1 of each IP family.
When set, OVN-Kubernetes assigns an IP address from the specified CIDRs to the connected pod,
eliminating the need for manual IP assignment or reliance on an external IPAM service (e.g., a DHCP server).
subnets is optional. When omitted OVN-Kubernetes won't assign IP address automatically.
Dual-stack clusters may set 2 subnets (one for each IP family), otherwise only 1 subnet is allowed.
The format should match standard CIDR notation (for example, "10.128.0.0/16").
This field must be omitted if `ipam.mode` is `Disabled`.
When physicalNetworkName points to the OVS bridge mapping of a network that provides IPAM services
(e.g., a DHCP server), ipam.mode should be set to Disabled. This turns off OVN-Kubernetes IPAM and avoids
conflicts with the existing IPAM services on this localnet network.

| `vlan`
| `object`
| vlan configuration for the network.
vlan.mode is the VLAN mode.
  When "Access" is set, OVN-Kubernetes configures the network logical switch port in access mode.
vlan.access is the access VLAN configuration.
vlan.access.id is the VLAN ID (VID) to be set on the network logical switch port.
vlan is optional, when omitted the underlying network default VLAN will be used (usually `1`).
When set, OVN-Kubernetes will apply VLAN configuration to the SDN infra and to the connected pods.

| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
