= Configuring your cluster to place pods on overcommitted nodes
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]






In an _overcommitted_ state, the sum of the container compute resource requests
and limits exceeds the resources available on the system. For example, you might
want to use overcommitment in development environments where a trade-off of
guaranteed performance for capacity is acceptable.

Containers can specify compute resource requests and limits. Requests are used
for scheduling your container and provide a minimum service guarantee. Limits
constrain the amount of compute resource that can be consumed on your node.

The scheduler attempts to optimize the compute resource use across all nodes
in your cluster. It places pods onto specific nodes, taking the pods' compute
resource requests and nodes' available capacity into consideration.

{product-title} administrators can control the level of overcommit and manage
container density on nodes. You can configure cluster-level overcommit using
the xref:#nodes-cluster-resource-override_nodes-cluster-overcommit[ClusterResourceOverride Operator]
to override the ratio between requests and limits set on developer containers.
In conjunction with xref:#nodes-cluster-node-overcommit_nodes-cluster-overcommit[node overcommit] and
xref:../../applications/deployments/managing-deployment-processes.adoc#deployments-setting-resources_deployment-operations[project memory and CPU limits and defaults], you can adjust the resource limit and request to achieve the desired level of overcommit.

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title}, you must enable cluster-level overcommit. Node overcommitment is enabled by default.
See xref:#nodes-cluster-overcommit-node-disable_nodes-cluster-overcommit[Disabling overcommitment for a node].
