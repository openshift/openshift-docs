toc::[]






In an _overcommited_ state, the sum of the container compute resource requests and limits exceeds the resources available on the system.
Overcommitment might be desirable in development environments where a tradeoff of guaranteed performance for capacity is acceptable.  

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} overcommittment is enabled by default. 
See xref:#nodes-cluster-overcommit-node-disable_nodes-cluster-overcommit[Disabling overcommitment for a node].
