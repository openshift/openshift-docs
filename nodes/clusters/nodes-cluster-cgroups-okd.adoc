By default, {product-title} uses link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html[Linux control group version 2] (cgroup v2) in your cluster. You can switch to link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1.html[Linux control group version 1] (cgroup v1), if needed.

cgroup v2 is the next version of the kernel link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/ch01[control group] and offers multiple improvements. However, it can have some unwanted effects on your nodes.
