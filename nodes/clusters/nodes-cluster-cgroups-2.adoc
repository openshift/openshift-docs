= Configuring the Linux cgroup version on your nodes
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

As of {product-title} 4.14, {product-title} uses link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html[Linux control group version 2] (cgroup v2) in your cluster. If you are using cgroup v1 on {product-title} 4.13 or earlier, migrating to {product-title} 4.14 will not automatically update your cgroup configuration to version 2. A fresh installation of {product-title} 4.14 will use cgroup v2 by default. However, you can enable link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/index.html[Linux control group version 1] (cgroup v1) upon installation. Enabling cgroup v1 in {product-title} disables all cgroup v2 controllers and hierarchies in your cluster.

cgroup v2 is the current version of the Linux cgroup API. cgroup v2 offers several improvements over cgroup v1, including a unified hierarchy, safer sub-tree delegation, new features such as link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html[Pressure Stall Information], and enhanced resource management and isolation.

[NOTE]
====
* If you run third-party monitoring and security agents that depend on the cgroup file system, update the agents to a version that supports cgroup v2.
* If you have configured cgroup v2 and run cAdvisor as a stand-alone daemon set for monitoring pods and containers, update cAdvisor to v0.43.0 or later.
* If you deploy Java applications, use versions that fully support cgroup v2, such as the following packages:
** OpenJDK / HotSpot: jdk8u372, 11.0.16, 15 and later
** NodeJs 20.3.0 or later
** IBM Semeru Runtimes: jdk8u345-b01, 11.0.16.0, 17.0.4.0, 18.0.2.0 and later
** IBM SDK Java Technology Edition Version (IBM Java): 8.0.7.15 and later
