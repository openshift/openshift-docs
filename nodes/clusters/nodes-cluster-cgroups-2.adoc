= Configuring the Linux cgroup version on your nodes
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

By default, {product-title} uses link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html[Linux control group version 2] (cgroup v2) in your cluster. You can switch to link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/index.html[Linux control group version 1] (cgroup v1), if needed, by editing the `node.config` object. Enabling cgroup v1 in {product-title} disables all cgroup version 2 controllers and hierarchies in your cluster. 

cgroup v2 offers several improvements over cgroup v1, including a unified hierarchy, safer sub-tree delegation, new features (such as link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html[Pressure Stall Information]), and enhanced resource management and isolation. 

[NOTE]
====
* If you run third-party monitoring and security agents that depend on the cgroup file system, update the agents to a version that supports cgroup v2.
* If you have configured cgroup v2 and run cAdvisor as a stand-alone daemon set for monitoring pods and containers, update cAdvisor to v0.43.0 or later.
* If you deploy Java applications, use versions that fully support cgroup v2, such as the following packages:
** OpenJDK / HotSpot: jdk8u372, 11.0.16, 15 and later
** IBM Semeru Runtimes: jdk8u345-b01, 11.0.16.0, 17.0.4.0, 18.0.2.0 and later
** IBM SDK Java Technology Edition Version (IBM Java): 8.0.7.15 and later
