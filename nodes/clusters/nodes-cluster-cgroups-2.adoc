= Enabling Linux control group version 2 (cgroup v2)
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

You can enable link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html[Linux control group version 2] (cgroup v2) in your cluster by editing the `node.config` object. Enabling cgroup v2 in {product-title} disables all cgroups version 1 controllers and hierarchies in your cluster. cgroup v1 is enabled by default.

cgroup v2 is the next version of the Linux cgroup API. cgroup v2 offers several improvements over cgroup v1, including a unified hierarchy, safer sub-tree delegation, new features such as link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html[Pressure Stall Information], and enhanced resource management and isolation.

[NOTE]
====
* If you run third-party monitoring and security agents that depend on the cgroup file system, update the agents to a version that supports cgroup v2.
* If you have configured cgroup v2 and run cAdvisor as a stand-alone daemon set for monitoring pods and containers, update cAdvisor to v0.43.0 or later.
* If you deploy Java applications, use versions that fully support cgroup v2, such as the following packages:
** OpenJDK / HotSpot: jdk8u372, 11.0.16, 15 and later
** IBM Semeru Runtimes: jdk8u345-b01, 11.0.16.0, 17.0.4.0, 18.0.2.0 and later
** IBM SDK Java Technology Edition Version (IBM Java): 8.0.7.15 and later
