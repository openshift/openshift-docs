You can enable link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html[Linux control group version 2] (cgroup v2) in your cluster by editing the `node.config` object. Enabling cgroup v2 in {product-title} disables all cgroups version 1 controllers and hierarchies in your cluster. cgroup v1 is enabled by default.

cgroup v2 is the next version of the Linux cgroup API. cgroup v2 offers several improvements over cgroup v1, including a unified hierarchy, safer sub-tree delegation, new features such as link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html[Pressure Stall Information], and enhanced resource management and isolation.
