= Setting global overcommit using Cluster Resource Override

toc::[]









Containers can specify compute resource requests and limits. Requests are 
used for scheduling your container and provide a minimum service guarantee. 
Limits constrain the amount of compute resource that may be consumed on your node.

The scheduler attempts to optimize the compute resource use across all nodes 
in your cluster. It places pods onto specific nodes, taking the pods' compute 
resource requests and nodes' available capacity into consideration.

Requests and limits enable administrators to allow and manage the overcommitment
of resources on a node, which may be desirable in development environments where
a tradeoff of guaranteed performance for capacity is acceptable.

If {product-title} administrators would like to control the level of overcommit and manage
container density on nodes, the ClusterResourceOverride Admission Webhook can be configured 
to override the ratio between requests and limits set on developer containers. 
In conjunction with a per-project LimitRange specifying limits and defaults, this adjusts 
the container limit and request to achieve the desired level of overcommit.
