= Setting limit ranges

toc::[]


By default, containers run with unbounded compute resources on an {product-title} 
cluster. With limit ranges, you can restrict resource consumption for specific 
objects in a project: 

* Pods and containers: You can set minimum and maximum requirements for CPU and
memory for Pods and their containers.
* Image streams: You can set limits on the number of images and tags in an 
ImageStream object.
* Images: You can limit the size of images that can be pushed to an internal 
registry.
* Persistent volume claims (PVC): You can restrict the size of the PVCs that can 
be requested.

If a Pod does not meet the constraints imposed by the limit 
range, the Pod cannot be created in the namespace.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise

// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.
