The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator scales your pods up and down based on custom, external metrics from specific applications. Your other applications continue to use other scaling methods. You configure _triggers_, also known as scalers, which are the source of events and metrics that the custom metrics autoscaler uses to determine how to scale. The custom metrics autoscaler uses a metrics API to convert the external metrics to a form that {product-title} can use. The custom metrics autoscaler creates a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) that performs the actual scaling.

To use the custom metrics autoscaler, you create a `ScaledObject` or `ScaledJob` object, which is a custom resource (CR) that defines the scaling metadata. You specify the deployment or job to scale, the source of the metrics to scale on (trigger), and other parameters such as the minimum and maximum replica counts allowed.

[NOTE]
====
You can create only one scaled object for each workload that you want to scale. Also, you cannot use a scaled object and the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) on the same workload.
====

The custom metrics autoscaler, unlike the HPA, can scale to zero. If you set the `minReplicaCount` value in the custom metrics autoscaler CR to `0`, the custom metrics autoscaler scales the workload down from 1 to 0 replicas to or up from 0 replicas to 1. This is known as the _activation phase_. After scaling up to 1 replica, the HPA takes control of the scaling. This is known as the _scaling phase_.

Some triggers allow you to change the number of replicas that are scaled by the cluster metrics autoscaler.  In all cases, the parameter to configure the activation phase always uses the same phrase, prefixed with _activation_. For example, if the `threshold` parameter configures scaling, `activationThreshold` would configure activation. Configuring the activation and scaling phases allows you more flexibility with your scaling policies. For example, you could configure a higher activation phase to prevent scaling up or down if the metric is particularly low.

The activation value has more priority than the scaling value in case of different decisions for each. For example, if the `threshold` is set to `10`, and the `activationThreshold` is `50`, if the metric reports `40`, the scaler is not active and the pods are scaled to zero even if the HPA requires 4 instances.

You can create only one scaled object or scaled job for each workload that you want to scale. Also, you cannot use a scaled object or scaled job and the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) on the same workload. If you want to scale based on a custom trigger and CPU/Memory, you can create multiple triggers in the scaled object or scaled job.
