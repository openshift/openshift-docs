toc::[]

The release notes for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift describe new features and enhancements, deprecated features, and known issues.

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator uses the Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler (KEDA) and is built on top of the {product-title} horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA).

[NOTE]
====
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is provided as an installable component, with a distinct release cycle from the core {product-title}. The link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#cma[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy] outlines release compatibility.

== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1 provides new features and bug fixes for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1 were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2023:3199[RHEA-2023:3199].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously-installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of KEDA.

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-ga_{context}"]
==== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator general availability 

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator is now generally available as of Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator version 2.10.1. 

:FeatureName: Scaling by using a scaled job
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

:FeatureName: Autoscaling based on Apache Kafka metrics
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+0]

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-metrics_{context}"]
==== Performance metrics

You can now use the Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) to query metrics on the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator. 

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-pause_{context}"]
==== Pausing the custom metrics autoscaling for scaled objects

You can now pause the autoscaling of a scaled object, as needed, and resume autoscaling when ready.

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-fall-back_{context}"]
==== Replica fall back for scaled objects

You can now specify the number of replicas to fall back to if a scaled object fails to get metrics from the source.

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-hpa-name_{context}"]
==== Customizable HPA naming for scaled objects

You can now specify a custom name for the horizontal pod autoscaler in scaled objects.

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-activation_{context}"]
==== Activation and scaling thresholds

Because the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) cannot scale to or from 0 replicas, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator does that scaling, after which the HPA performs the scaling. You can now specify when the  HPA takes over autoscaling, based on the number of replicas. This allows for more flexibility with your scaling policies.

== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.8.2-174 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.8.2-174 provides new features and bug fixes for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.8.2-174 were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2023:1683[RHEA-2023:1683].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator version 2.8.2-174 is a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview] feature.

[id="nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-rn-282-174-new_{context}"]
=== New features and enhancements

[id="autoscaling-custom-2-8-2-upgrade-operator"]
==== Operator upgrade support

You can now upgrade from a prior version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator. See "Changing the update channel for an Operator" in the "Additional resources" for information on upgrading an Operator.

[id="autoscaling-custom-2-8-2-must-gather"]
==== must-gather support

You can now collect data about the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator and its components by using the {product-title} `must-gather` tool. Currently, the process for using the `must-gather` tool with the Custom Metrics Autoscaler is different than for other operators. See "Gathering debugging data in the "Additional resources" for more information.
