toc::[]

The release notes for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift describe new features and enhancements, deprecated features, and known issues.

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator uses the Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler (KEDA) and is built on top of the {product-title} horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA).

[NOTE]
====
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is provided as an installable component, with a distinct release cycle from the core {product-title}. The link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#cma[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy] outlines release compatibility.

== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 provides new features and bug fixes for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2023:5981[RHBA-2023:5981].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of KEDA.

=== New features and enhancements

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2112-new-rosa-osd_{context}"]
==== Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) and OpenShift Dedicated are now supported

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 can be installed on OpenShift ROSA and OpenShift Dedicated managed clusters. Previous versions of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator could be installed only in the `openshift-keda` namespace. This prevented the Operator from being installed on OpenShift ROSA and OpenShift Dedicated clusters. This version of Custom Metrics Autoscaler allows installation to other namespaces such as `openshift-operators` or `keda`, enabling installation into ROSA and Dedicated clusters.

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2112-bugs_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, if the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator was installed and configured, but not in use, the OpenShift CLI reported the `couldn't get resource list for external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1: Got empty response for: external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1` error after any `oc` command was entered. The message, although harmless, could have caused confusion. With this fix, the `Got empty response for: external.metrics...` error no longer appears inappropriately. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15779[*OCPBUGS-15779*])

* Previously, any annotation or label change to objects managed by the Custom Metrics Autoscaler were reverted by Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator any time the Keda Controller was modified, for example after a configuration change. This caused continuous changing of labels in your objects. The Custom Metrics Autoscaler now uses its own annotation to manage labels and annotations, and annotation or label are no longer inappropriately reverted. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15590[*OCPBUGS-15590*])

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-267-bugs_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `custom-metrics-autoscaler` and `custom-metrics-autoscaler-adapter` images did not contain time zone information. Because of this, scaled objects with cron triggers failed to work because the controllers were unable to find time zone information. With this fix, the image builds now include time zone information. As a result, scaled objects containing cron triggers now function properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15264[*OCPBUGS-15264*])

* Previously, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator would attempt to take ownership of all managed objects, including objects in other namespaces and cluster-scoped objects. Because of this, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator was unable to create the role binding for reading the credentials necessary to be an API server. This caused errors in the `kube-system` namespace. With this fix, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator skips adding the `ownerReference` field to any object in another namespace or any cluster-scoped object. As a result, the role binding is now created without any errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15038[*OCPBUGS-15038*])

* Previously, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator added an `ownerReferences` field to the `openshift-keda` namespace. While this did not cause functionality problems, the presence of this field could have caused confusion for cluster administrators. With this fix, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator does not add the `ownerReference` field to the `openshift-keda` namespace. As a result, the `openshift-keda` namespace no longer has a superfluous `ownerReference` field. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15293[*OCPBUGS-15293*])

* Previously, if you used a Prometheus trigger configured with authentication method other than pod identity, and the `podIdentity` parameter was set to `none`, the trigger would fail to scale. With this fix, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler for OpenShift now properly handles the `none` pod identity provider type. As a result, a Prometheus trigger configured with authentication method other than pod identity, and the `podIdentity` parameter sset to `none` now properly scales. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15274[*OCPBUGS-15274*])

== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1 provides new features and bug fixes for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1 were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2023:3199[RHEA-2023:3199].

==== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator general availability

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator is now generally available as of Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator version 2.10.1.

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-metrics_{context}"]
==== Performance metrics

You can now use the Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) to query metrics on the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator.

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-pause_{context}"]
==== Pausing the custom metrics autoscaling for scaled objects

You can now pause the autoscaling of a scaled object, as needed, and resume autoscaling when ready.

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-fall-back_{context}"]
==== Replica fall back for scaled objects

You can now specify the number of replicas to fall back to if a scaled object fails to get metrics from the source.

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-hpa-name_{context}"]
==== Customizable HPA naming for scaled objects

You can now specify a custom name for the horizontal pod autoscaler in scaled objects.

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-activation_{context}"]
==== Activation and scaling thresholds

Because the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) cannot scale to or from 0 replicas, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator does that scaling, after which the HPA performs the scaling. You can now specify when the  HPA takes over autoscaling, based on the number of replicas. This allows for more flexibility with your scaling policies.
