=== Bug fixes

* Previously, if invalid values, such as nonexistent namespaces, were specified in scaled object metadata, the underlying scaler clients would not free, or close, their client descriptors, resulting in a slow memory leak. This fix properly closes the underlying client descriptors when there are errors, preventing memory from leaking. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30145[*OCPBUGS-30145*])

* Previously the `ServiceMonitor` custom resource (CR) for the `keda-metrics-apiserver` pod was not functioning, because the CR referenced an incorrect metrics port name of `http`. This fix corrects the `ServiceMonitor` CR to reference the proper port name of `metrics`. As a result, the Service Monitor functions properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25806[*OCPBUGS-25806*])
