=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `custom-metrics-autoscaler` and `custom-metrics-autoscaler-adapter` images were missing time zone information. As a consequence, scaled objects with `cron` triggers failed to work because the controllers were unable to find time zone information. With this fix, the image builds are updated to include time zone information. As a result, scaled objects containing `cron` triggers now function properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32395[*OCPBUGS-32395*])
