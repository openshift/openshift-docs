The release notes for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift describe new features and enhancements, deprecated features, and known issues.

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator uses the Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler (KEDA) and is built on top of the {product-title} horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA).

[NOTE]
====
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is provided as an installable component, with a distinct release cycle from the core {product-title}. The link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#cma[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy] outlines release compatibility.

== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.13.1 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.13.1-421 provides a new feature and a bug fix for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The following advisory is available for the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2024:4837[RHBA-2024:4837].

[IMPORTANT]

=== New features and enhancements

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2131-new-ca_{context}"]
==== Support for custom certificates with the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator can now use custom service CA certificates to connect securely to TLS-enabled metrics sources, such as an external Kafka cluster or an external Prometheus service. By default, the Operator uses automatically-generated service certificates to connect to on-cluster services only. There is a new field in the `KedaController` object that allows you to load custom server CA certificates for connecting to external services by using config maps. 

For more information, see xref:../../../nodes/cma/nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom.adoc#nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-ca_nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom[Custom CA certificates for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler].

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `custom-metrics-autoscaler` and `custom-metrics-autoscaler-adapter` images were missing time zone information. As a consequence, scaled objects with `cron` triggers failed to work because the controllers were unable to find time zone information. With this fix, the image builds are updated to include time zone information. As a result, scaled objects containing `cron` triggers now function properly. Scaled objects containing `cron` triggers are currently not supported for the custom metrics autoscaler. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34018[*OCPBUGS-34018*])
