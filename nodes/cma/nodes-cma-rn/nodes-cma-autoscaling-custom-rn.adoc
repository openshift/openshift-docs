=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the root file system of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator pod was writable, which is unnecessary and could present security issues. This update makes the pod root file system read-only, which addresses the potential security issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37989[*OCPBUGS-37989*])
