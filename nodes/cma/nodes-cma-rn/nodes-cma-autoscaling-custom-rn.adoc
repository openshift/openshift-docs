The release notes for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift describe new features and enhancements, deprecated features, and known issues.

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator uses the Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler (KEDA) and is built on top of the {product-title} horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA).

[NOTE]
====
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is provided as an installable component, with a distinct release cycle from the core {product-title}. The link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#cma[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy] outlines release compatibility.

=== New features and enhancements

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2172-new-controller_{context}"]
==== The KEDA controller is automatically created during installation

The KEDA controller is now automatically created when you install the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator. Previously, you needed to manually create the KEDA controller. You can edit the automatically-created KEDA controller, as needed. For more information, see xref:../../../nodes/cma/nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-install.adoc#nodes-cma-autoscaling-keda-controller-edit_nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-install[Editing the Keda Controller CR].

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2172-workload_{context}"]
==== Support for the Kubernetes workload trigger

The Cluster Metrics Autoscaler Operator now supports using the Kubernetes workload trigger to scale pods based on the number of pods matching a specific label selector. For more information, see xref:../../../nodes/cma/nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-trigger#nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-trigger-workload_nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-trigger[Understanding the Kubernetes workload trigger].

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2172-new-tokens_{context}"]
==== Support for bound service account tokens

The Cluster Metrics Autoscaler Operator now supports bound service account tokens. Previously, the Operator supported only legacy service account tokens, which are being phased out in favor of bound service account tokens for security reasons. For more information see xref:../../../nodes/cma/nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-trigger-auth.adoc#nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-trigger-auth[Understanding custom metrics autoscaler trigger authentications].

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2172-bugs_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the KEDA controller did not support volume mounts. As a result, you could not use Kerberos with the Kafka scaler. With this fix, the KEDA controller now supports volume mounts. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42559[*OCPBUGS-42559*])
* Previously, the KEDA version in the `keda-operator` deployment object log reported that the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator was based on an incorrect KEDA version. With this fix, the correct KEDA version is reported in the log. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-58129[*OCPBUGS-58129*])
