=== New features and enhancements

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2141-new-ca_{context}"]
==== Support for the Cron trigger with the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator can now use the Cron trigger to scale pods based on an hourly schedule. When your specified time frame starts, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator scales pods to your desired amount. When the time frame ends, the Operator scales back down to the previous level.

For more information, see xref:../../../nodes/cma/nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-trigger.adoc#nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-trigger-cron_nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-trigger[Understanding the Cron trigger].

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2141-bugs_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, if you made changes to audit configuration parameters in the `KedaController` custom resource, the `keda-metrics-server-audit-policy` config map would not get updated. As a consequence, you could not change the audit configuration parameters after the initial deployment of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler. With this fix, changes to the audit configuration now render properly in the config map, allowing you to change the audit configuration any time after installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32521[*OCPBUGS-32521*])

== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.13.1 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.13.1-421 provides a new feature and a bug fix for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The following advisory is available for the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2024:4837[RHBA-2024:4837].

[IMPORTANT]
====

=== New features and enhancements

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2131-new-ca_{context}"]
==== Support for custom certificates with the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator can now use custom service CA certificates to connect securely to TLS-enabled metrics sources, such as an external Kafka cluster or an external Prometheus service. By default, the Operator uses automatically-generated service certificates to connect to on-cluster services only. There is a new field in the `KedaController` object that allows you to load custom server CA certificates for connecting to external services by using config maps. 

For more information, see xref:../../../nodes/cma/nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom.adoc#nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-ca_nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom[Custom CA certificates for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler].

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2.13.1-bugs_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `custom-metrics-autoscaler` and `custom-metrics-autoscaler-adapter` images were missing time zone information. As a consequence, scaled objects with `cron` triggers failed to work because the controllers were unable to find time zone information. With this fix, the image builds are updated to include time zone information. As a result, scaled objects containing `cron` triggers now function properly. Scaled objects containing `cron` triggers are currently not supported for the custom metrics autoscaler. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34018[*OCPBUGS-34018*])

== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.12.1-394 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.12.1-394 provides a bug fix for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The following advisory is available for the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2901[RHSA-2024:2901].

[IMPORTANT]

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2121-394-bugs_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `protojson.Unmarshal` function entered into an infinite loop when unmarshaling certain forms of invalid JSON. This condition could occur when unmarshaling into a message that contains a `google.protobuf.Any` value or when the `UnmarshalOptions.DiscardUnknown` option is set. This release fixes this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30305[*OCPBUGS-30305*])

* Previously, when parsing a multipart form, either explicitly with the `Request.ParseMultipartForm` method or implicitly with the `Request.FormValue`, `Request.PostFormValue`, or `Request.FormFile` method, the limits on the total size of the parsed form were not applied to the memory consumed. This could cause memory exhaustion. With this fix, the parsing process now correctly limits the maximum size of form lines while reading a single form line. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30360[*OCPBUGS-30360*])

* Previously, when following an HTTP redirect to a domain that is not on a  matching subdomain or on an exact match of the initial domain, an HTTP client would not forward sensitive headers, such as `Authorization` or `Cookie`. For example, a redirect from `example.com` to `www.example.com` would forward the `Authorization` header, but a redirect to `www.example.org` would not forward the header. This release fixes this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30365[*OCPBUGS-30365*])

* Previously, verifying a certificate chain that contains a certificate with an unknown public key algorithm caused the certificate verification process to panic. This condition affected all crypto and  Transport Layer Security (TLS) clients and servers that set the `Config.ClientAuth` parameter to the `VerifyClientCertIfGiven` or `RequireAndVerifyClientCert` value. The default behavior is for TLS servers to not verify client certificates. This release fixes this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30370[*OCPBUGS-30370*])

* Previously, if errors returned from the `MarshalJSON` method contained user-controlled data, an attacker could have used the data to break the contextual auto-escaping behavior of the HTML template package. This condition would allow for subsequent actions to inject unexpected content into the templates. This release fixes this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30397[*OCPBUGS-30397*])

* Previously, the `net/http` and `golang.org/x/net/http2` Go packages did not limit the number of `CONTINUATION` frames for an HTTP/2 request. This condition could result in excessive CPU consumption. This release fixes this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30894[*OCPBUGS-30894*])

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2121-376-bugs_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, if invalid values such as nonexistent namespaces were specified in scaled object metadata, the underlying scaler clients would not free, or close, their client descriptors, resulting in a slow memory leak. This fix properly closes the underlying client descriptors when there are errors, preventing memory from leaking. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30145[*OCPBUGS-30145*])

* Previously the `ServiceMonitor` custom resource (CR) for the `keda-metrics-apiserver` pod was not functioning, because the CR referenced an incorrect metrics port name of `http`. This fix corrects the `ServiceMonitor` CR to reference the proper port name of `metrics`. As a result, the Service Monitor functions properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25806[*OCPBUGS-25806*])

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2112-332-bugs_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

* Because the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator version 3.11.2-311 was released without a required volume mount in the Operator deployment, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator pod would restart every 15 minutes. This fix adds the required volume mount to the Operator deployment. As a result, the Operator no longer restarts every 15 minutes.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22361[*OCPBUGS-22361*])

=== New features and enhancements

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2112-new-rosa-osd_{context}"]
==== Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) and OpenShift Dedicated are now supported

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 can be installed on OpenShift ROSA and OpenShift Dedicated managed clusters. Previous versions of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator could be installed only in the `openshift-keda` namespace. This prevented the Operator from being installed on OpenShift ROSA and OpenShift Dedicated clusters. This version of Custom Metrics Autoscaler allows installation to other namespaces such as `openshift-operators` or `keda`, enabling installation into ROSA and Dedicated clusters.

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2112-bugs_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, if the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator was installed and configured, but not in use, the OpenShift CLI reported the `couldn't get resource list for external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1: Got empty response for: external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1` error after any `oc` command was entered. The message, although harmless, could have caused confusion. With this fix, the `Got empty response for: external.metrics...` error no longer appears inappropriately. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15779[*OCPBUGS-15779*])

* Previously, any annotation or label change to objects managed by the Custom Metrics Autoscaler were reverted by Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator any time the Keda Controller was modified, for example after a configuration change. This caused continuous changing of labels in your objects. The Custom Metrics Autoscaler now uses its own annotation to manage labels and annotations, and annotation or label are no longer inappropriately reverted. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15590[*OCPBUGS-15590*])

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-267-bugs_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `custom-metrics-autoscaler` and `custom-metrics-autoscaler-adapter` images did not contain time zone information. Because of this, scaled objects with cron triggers failed to work because the controllers were unable to find time zone information. With this fix, the image builds now include time zone information. As a result, scaled objects containing cron triggers now function properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15264[*OCPBUGS-15264*])

* Previously, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator would attempt to take ownership of all managed objects, including objects in other namespaces and cluster-scoped objects. Because of this, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator was unable to create the role binding for reading the credentials necessary to be an API server. This caused errors in the `kube-system` namespace. With this fix, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator skips adding the `ownerReference` field to any object in another namespace or any cluster-scoped object. As a result, the role binding is now created without any errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15038[*OCPBUGS-15038*])

* Previously, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator added an `ownerReferences` field to the `openshift-keda` namespace. While this did not cause functionality problems, the presence of this field could have caused confusion for cluster administrators. With this fix, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator does not add the `ownerReference` field to the `openshift-keda` namespace. As a result, the `openshift-keda` namespace no longer has a superfluous `ownerReference` field. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15293[*OCPBUGS-15293*])

* Previously, if you used a Prometheus trigger configured with authentication method other than pod identity, and the `podIdentity` parameter was set to `none`, the trigger would fail to scale. With this fix, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler for OpenShift now properly handles the `none` pod identity provider type. As a result, a Prometheus trigger configured with authentication method other than pod identity, and the `podIdentity` parameter sset to `none` now properly scales. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15274[*OCPBUGS-15274*])

==== Customizable HPA naming for scaled objects

You can now specify a custom name for the horizontal pod autoscaler in scaled objects.

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-210-activation_{context}"]
==== Activation and scaling thresholds

Because the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) cannot scale to or from 0 replicas, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator does that scaling, after which the HPA performs the scaling. You can now specify when the  HPA takes over autoscaling, based on the number of replicas. This allows for more flexibility with your scaling policies.
