= Placing pods on specific nodes using node selectors
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]



A _node selector_ specifies a map of key-value pairs. The rules are defined using custom labels on nodes and selectors specified in pods.
You can use specific node selectors to place specific pods on specific nodes, project node selectors to place new pods in a project on specific nodes in that project, or default cluster-wide node selectors to place new pods on specific nodes anywhere in the cluster.

For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the pod must have the same key-value node selector as the label on the node. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using node selectors and node affinity in the same pod configuration, the following rules control pod placement onto nodes:

* If you configure both `nodeSelector` and `nodeAffinity`, both conditions must be satisfied for the pod to be scheduled onto a candidate node.

* If you specify multiple `nodeSelectorTerms` associated with `nodeAffinity` types, then the pod can be scheduled onto a node if one of the `nodeSelectorTerms` is satisfied.

* If you specify multiple `matchExpressions` associated with `nodeSelectorTerms`, then the pod can be scheduled onto a node only if all `matchExpressions` are satisfied.
