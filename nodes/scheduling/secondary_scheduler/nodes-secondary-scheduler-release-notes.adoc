[id="secondary-scheduler-operator-1.0.1-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* The maximum {product-title} version for {secondary-scheduler-operator-full} 1.0.1 is 4.11.

[id="secondary-scheduler-1.0.1-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the secondary scheduler deployment was not deleted after the secondary scheduler custom resource (CR) was deleted, which prevented the {secondary-scheduler-operator} and operand from being fully uninstalled. The secondary scheduler deployment is now deleted when the secondary scheduler CR is deleted, so that the {secondary-scheduler-operator} can now be fully uninstalled. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2100923[*BZ#2100923*])

[id="secondary-scheduler-operator-1.0.1-known-issues"]
=== Known issues

* Currently, you cannot deploy additional resources, such as config maps, CRDs, or RBAC policies through the {secondary-scheduler-operator}. Any resources other than roles and role bindings that are required by your custom secondary scheduler must be applied externally. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2071684[*BZ#2071684*])
