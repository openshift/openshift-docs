= Configuring the default scheduler to control pod placement
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]


toc::[]



The default {product-title} pod scheduler is responsible for determining placement of new
pods onto nodes within the cluster. It reads data from the pod and tries to find
a node that is a good fit based on configured policies. It is completely
independent and exists as a standalone/pluggable solution. It does not modify
the pod and just creates a binding for the pod that ties the pod to the
particular node.

A selection of predicates and priorities defines the policy for the scheduler. See xref:../../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-default.adoc#nodes-scheduler-default-modifying_nodes-scheduler-default[Modifying scheduler policy] for a list of predicates and priorities.
