= Configuring the default scheduler to control pod placement
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]



The default {product-title} pod scheduler is responsible for determining placement of new
pods onto nodes within the cluster. It reads data from the pod and tries to find
a node that is a good fit based on configured policies. It is completely
independent and exists as a standalone/pluggable solution. It does not modify
the pod and just creates a binding for the pod that ties the pod to the
particular node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Configuring a scheduler policy is deprecated and is planned for removal in a future release. For more information on the alternative, see xref:../../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-profiles.adoc#nodes-scheduler-profiles[Scheduling pods using a scheduler profile].
====

A selection of predicates and priorities defines the policy for the scheduler. See xref:../../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-default.adoc#nodes-scheduler-default-modifying_nodes-scheduler-default[Modifying scheduler policy] for a list of predicates and priorities.

----
<1> You can specify the name of a custom scheduler policy file.
<2> Optional: Specify a default node selector to restrict pod placement to specific nodes. The default node selector is applied to the pods created in all namespaces. Pods can be scheduled on nodes with labels that match the default node selector and any existing pod node selectors. Namespaces having project-wide node selectors are not impacted even if this field is set.
