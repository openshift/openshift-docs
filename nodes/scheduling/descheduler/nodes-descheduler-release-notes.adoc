* Previously, the `relatedImages` field was not set properly in the {descheduler-operator} cluster service version (CSV), so the images were not properly mirrored when using oc-mirror. With this release, the `relatedImages` field is now set properly and the {descheduler-operator} images are now mirrored properly when using oc-mirror.

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, when the `LifecycleAndUtilization` profile was enabled, pods from protected namespaces ([x-]`openshift-*`, `kube-system`, `hypershift`) could be evicted. Pods in these namespaces should never be evicted. With this release, these protected namespaces are now properly excluded from eviction when the `LifecycleAndUtilization` profile is enabled.

[id="descheduler-operator-5.1.0-new-features"]
=== New features and enhancements

* Two new descheduler profiles are now available:

** `CompactAndScale`: This profile attempts to evict pods from underutilized nodes to allow a workload to run on a smaller set of nodes.
** `LongLifecycle`: This profile balances resource usage between nodes and enables the `RemovePodsHavingTooManyRestarts` and `LowNodeUtilization` strategies.

* For the `CompactAndScale` profile, you can use the Technology Preview field `devHighNodeUtilizationThresholds` to adjust the underutilized threshold value.
