= Controlling pod placement using the scheduler
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

Pod scheduling is an internal process that determines placement of new
pods onto nodes within the cluster.

The scheduler code has a clean separation that watches new pods
as they get created and identifies the most suitable node to host them. It then
creates bindings (pod to node bindings) for the pods using the master API.

Default pod scheduling::
{product-title} comes with a default scheduler that serves the needs of most users. The default scheduler uses both inherent and customization tools to determine the best fit for a pod.

Advanced pod scheduling::
In situations where you might want more control over where new pods are placed, the {product-title} advanced scheduling features allow you to configure a pod so that the pod is required or has a preference to run on a particular node or alongside a specific pod.

You can control pod placement by using the following scheduling features:

== About the default scheduler

The default {product-title} pod scheduler is responsible for determining the placement of new pods onto nodes within the cluster. It reads data from the pod and finds a node that is a good fit based on configured profiles. It is completely independent and exists as a standalone solution. It does not modify the pod; it creates a binding for the pod that ties the pod to the particular node.

== Scheduler use cases

One of the important use cases for scheduling within {product-title} is to
support flexible affinity and anti-affinity policies.

[id="infrastructure-topological-levels_{context}"]
=== Infrastructure topological levels

Administrators can define multiple topological levels for their infrastructure
(nodes) by specifying labels on nodes. For example: `region=r1`, `zone=z1`, `rack=s1`.

These label names have no particular meaning and
administrators are free to name their infrastructure levels anything, such as
city/building/room. Also, administrators can define any number of levels
for their infrastructure topology, with three levels usually being adequate
(such as: `regions` -> `zones` -> `racks`).  Administrators can specify affinity
and anti-affinity rules at each of these levels in any combination.

[id="affinity_{context}"]
=== Affinity

Administrators should be able to configure the scheduler to specify affinity at
any topological level, or even at multiple levels. Affinity at a particular
level indicates that all pods that belong to the same service are scheduled
onto nodes that belong to the same level. This handles any latency requirements
of applications by allowing administrators to ensure that peer pods do not end
up being too geographically separated. If no node is available within the same
affinity group to host the pod, then the pod is not scheduled.

If you need greater control over where the pods are scheduled, see xref:../../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-node-affinity.adoc#nodes-scheduler-node-affinity[Controlling pod placement on nodes using node affinity rules] and
xref:../../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-pod-affinity.adoc#nodes-scheduler-pod-affinity[Placing pods relative to other pods using affinity and anti-affinity rules].

These advanced scheduling features allow administrators
to specify which node a pod can be scheduled on and to force or reject scheduling relative to other pods.


[id="anti-affinity_{context}"]
=== Anti-affinity

Administrators should be able to configure the scheduler to specify
anti-affinity at any topological level, or even at multiple levels.
Anti-affinity (or 'spread') at a particular level indicates that all pods that
belong to the same service are spread across nodes that belong to that
level. This ensures that the application is well spread for high availability
purposes. The scheduler tries to balance the service pods across all
applicable nodes as evenly as possible.

If you need greater control over where the pods are scheduled, see xref:../../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-node-affinity.adoc#nodes-scheduler-node-affinity[Controlling pod placement on nodes using node affinity rules] and
xref:../../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-pod-affinity.adoc#nodes-scheduler-pod-affinity[Placing pods relative to other pods using affinity and anti-affinity rules].

These advanced scheduling features allow administrators
to specify which node a pod can be scheduled on and to force or reject scheduling relative to other pods.
