Affinity is a property of pods that controls the nodes on which they prefer to be scheduled. Anti-affinity is a property of pods
that prevents a pod from being scheduled on a node.

In {product-title} _pod affinity_ and _pod anti-affinity_ allow you to constrain which nodes your pod is eligible to be scheduled on based on the key/value labels on other pods.
