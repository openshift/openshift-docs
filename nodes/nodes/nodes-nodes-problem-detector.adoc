The Node Problem Detector monitors the health of your nodes
by finding certain problems and reporting these problems to the API server.
The detector runs as a daemonset on each node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Node Problem Detector is a Technology Preview feature
only.

Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.
