{product-title} uses a KubeletConfig custom resource (CR) to manage the
configuration of nodes. By creating an instance of a `KubeletConfig` object, a managed machine config is created to override setting on the node.

[NOTE]
====
*Logging in to  remote machines for the purpose of changing their configuration is not supported.*
