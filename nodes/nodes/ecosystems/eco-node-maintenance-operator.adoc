[NOTE]
====
If {VirtProductName} version 4.10 or less is installed in your cluster, it includes an outdated version of the Node Maintenance Operator version.

The Node Maintenance Operator is supported in a restricted network environment. For more information, see xref:../../../disconnected/using-olm.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager in disconnected environments].

[id="setting-node-in-maintenance-mode"]
== Setting a node to maintenance mode
You can place a node into maintenance mode from the web console or from the CLI by using a `NodeMaintenance` CR.

[id="resuming-node-from-maintenance-mode"]
== Resuming a node from maintenance mode
You can resume a node from maintenance mode from the web console or from the CLI by using a `NodeMaintenance` CR. Resuming a node brings it out of maintenance mode and makes it schedulable again.

[id="working-with-bare-metal-nodes"]
== Working with bare-metal nodes
For clusters with bare-metal nodes, you can place a node into maintenance mode, and resume a node from maintenance mode, by using the web console *Actions* control.

[NOTE]
====
Clusters with bare-metal nodes can also place a node into maintenance mode, and resume a node from maintenance mode, by using the web console and CLI, as outlined. These methods, by using the web console *Actions* control, are applicable to bare-metal clusters only.
