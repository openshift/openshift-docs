= Managing the maximum number of pods per node
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]


In {product-title}, you can configure the number of pods that can run on a node based on the number of
processor cores on the node, a hard limit or both. If you use both options,
the lower of the two limits the number of pods on a node.

Exceeding these values can result in:

* Increased CPU utilization by {product-title}.
* Slow pod scheduling.
* Potential out-of-memory scenarios, depending on the amount of memory in the node.
* Exhausting the IP address pool.
* Resource overcommitting, leading to poor user application performance.

[NOTE]
====
A pod that is holding a single container actually uses two
containers. The second container sets up networking prior to the
actual container starting. As a result, a node running 10 pods actually
has 20 containers running.
====

The `podsPerCore` parameter limits the number of pods the node can run based on the number of
processor cores on the node. For example, if `podsPerCore` is set to `10` on
a node with 4 processor cores, the maximum number of pods allowed on the node is 40.

The `maxPods` parameter limits the number of pods the node can run to a fixed value, regardless
of the properties of the node.
