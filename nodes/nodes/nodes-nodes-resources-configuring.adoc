toc::[]

To provide more reliable scheduling and minimize node resource overcommitment, reserve a portion of the CPU and memory resources for use by the underlying node components, such as `kubelet` and `kube-proxy`, and the remaining system components, such as `sshd` and `NetworkManager`. By specifying the resources to reserve, you provide the scheduler with more information about the remaining CPU and memory resources that a node has available for use by pods.
