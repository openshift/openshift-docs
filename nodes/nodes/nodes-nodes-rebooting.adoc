There is no {product-title} command to reboot a node. However, if you need to manually reboot one of your {product-title} cluster nodes,
there are some issues you need to consider. 

In order to reboot a node without causing an outage for applications running 
on the platform, it is important to first evacuate the pods. For pods that are 
made highly available by the routing tier, nothing else needs to be done. 

For other pods needing storage, typically databases, it is critical to ensure 
that they can remain in operation with one pod temporarily going offline. 
While implementing resiliency for stateful pods is different for each application, 
in all cases it is important to configure the scheduler to use 
xref:../../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-rebooting.html#nodes-nodes-rebooting-affinity_nodes-nodes-rebooting[node anti-affinity] to
ensure that the pods are properly spread across available nodes.

Another challenge is how to handle xref:../../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-rebooting.html#nodes-nodes-rebooting-infrastructure_nodes-nodes-rebooting[rebooting master nodes], which running critical infrastructure such as a router or the registry. The same node evacuation process applies, though it is important to xref:../../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-rebooting.html#nodes-nodes-rebooting-router_nodes-nodes-rebooting[understand certain edge cases].
