When using the xref:../../scalability_and_performance/using-cpu-manager.adoc[static CPU Manager policy], you can reserve specific CPUs for use by specific nodes in your cluster. For example, on a system with 24 CPUs, you could reserve CPUs numbered 0 - 3 for the control plane allowing the compute nodes to use CPUs 4 - 23.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise
// the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference
// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.
