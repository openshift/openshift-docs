You can use infrastructure machine sets to create machines that host only infrastructure components, such as the default router, the integrated container image registry, and the components for cluster metrics and monitoring. These infrastructure machines are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment.

[NOTE]
====
After adding the `NoSchedule` taint on the infrastructure node, existing DNS pods running on that node are marked as `misscheduled`. You must either delete or link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6592171[add toleration on `misscheduled` DNS pods].

For information about infrastructure nodes and which components can run on infrastructure nodes, see the "Red Hat OpenShift control plane and infrastructure nodes" section in the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/openshift-subscription-sizing-guide[OpenShift sizing and subscription guide for enterprise Kubernetes] document.

To create an infrastructure node, you can xref:../../machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.adoc#machineset-creating_creating-infrastructure-machinesets[use a machine set], xref:../../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-creating-infrastructure-nodes.adoc#creating-an-infra-node_creating-infrastructure-nodes[label the node], or xref:../../machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.adoc#creating-infra-machines_creating-infrastructure-machinesets[use a machine config pool].
