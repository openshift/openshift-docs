toc::[]

Sysctl settings are exposed through Kubernetes, allowing users to modify certain kernel parameters at runtime. Only sysctls that are namespaced can be set independently on pods. If a sysctl is not namespaced, called _node-level_, you must use another method of setting the sysctl, such as by using the Node Tuning Operator.

Network sysctls are a special category of sysctl. Network sysctls include:

* System-wide sysctls, for example `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`, that are valid for all networking. You can set these independently for each pod on a node.
* Interface-specific sysctls, for example `net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.accept_local`, that only apply to a specific additional network interface for a given pod. You can set these independently for each additional network configuration. You set these by using a configuration in the `tuning-cni` after the network interfaces are created.

Moreover, only those sysctls considered _safe_ are whitelisted by default; you
can manually enable other _unsafe_ sysctls on the node to be available to the
user.
