= Using sysctls in containers
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]




Sysctl settings are exposed via Kubernetes, allowing users to modify certain
kernel parameters at runtime for namespaces within a container. Only sysctls
that are namespaced can be set independently on pods. If a sysctl is not
namespaced, called _node-level_, you must use another method of setting the sysctl, such as the
xref:../../scalability_and_performance/using-node-tuning-operator.adoc#using-node-tuning-operator[Node Tuning Operator].
Moreover, only those sysctls considered _safe_ are whitelisted by default; you
can manually enable other _unsafe_ sysctls on the node to be available to the
user.
