= Using sysctls in containers

toc::[]




Sysctl settings are exposed via Kubernetes, allowing users to modify certain
kernel parameters at runtime for namespaces within a container. Only sysctls
that are namespaced can be set independently on pods. If a sysctl is not
namespaced, called _node-level_, it cannot be set within {product-title}.
Moreover, only those sysctls considered _safe_ are whitelisted by default; you
can manually enable other _unsafe_ sysctls on the node to be available to the
user.
