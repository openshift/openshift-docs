== About nodes

A node is a virtual or bare-metal machine in a Kubernetes cluster. Worker nodes host your application containers, grouped as pods. The control plane nodes run services that are required to control the Kubernetes cluster. In {product-title}, the control plane nodes contain more than just the Kubernetes services for managing the {product-title} cluster.

Having stable and healthy nodes in a cluster is fundamental to the smooth functioning of your hosted application.
In {product-title}, you can access, manage, and monitor a node through the `Node` object representing the node.
Using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) or the web console, you can perform the following operations on a node.

The following components of a node are responsible for maintaining the running of pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.

Container runtime:: The container runtime is responsible for running containers. Kubernetes offers several runtimes such as containerd, cri-o, rktlet, and Docker.

Kubelet:: Kubelet runs on nodes and reads the container manifests. It ensures that the defined containers have started and are running. The kubelet process maintains the state of work and the node server. Kubelet manages network rules and port forwarding. The kubelet manages containers that are created by Kubernetes only.

Kube-proxy:: Kube-proxy runs on every node in the cluster and maintains the network traffic between the Kubernetes resources. A Kube-proxy ensures that the networking environment is isolated and accessible.

DNS:: Cluster DNS is a DNS server which serves DNS records for Kubernetes services. Containers started by Kubernetes automatically include this DNS server in their DNS searches.

=== Read operations

The read operations allow an administrator or a developer to get information about nodes in an {product-title} cluster.

=== Management operations

As an administrator, you can easily manage a node in an {product-title} cluster
through several tasks:

* xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-working.adoc#nodes-nodes-working-updating_nodes-nodes-working[Add or update node labels]. A label is a key-value pair applied to a `Node` object. You can control the scheduling of pods using labels.
* Change node configuration using a custom resource definition (CRD), or the `kubeletConfig` object.
* Configure nodes to allow or disallow the scheduling of pods. Healthy worker nodes with a `Ready` status allow pod placement by default while the control plane nodes do not; you can change this default behavior by xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-working.adoc#nodes-nodes-working-marking_nodes-nodes-working[configuring the worker nodes to be unschedulable] and xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-working.adoc#nodes-nodes-working-marking_nodes-nodes-working[the control plane nodes to be schedulable].
* xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-resources-configuring.adoc#nodes-nodes-resources-configuring[Allocate resources for nodes] using the `system-reserved` setting. You can allow {product-title} to automatically determine the optimal `system-reserved` CPU and memory resources for your nodes, or you can manually determine and set the best resources for your nodes.

* Reboot a node gracefully using xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-rebooting.adoc#nodes-nodes-rebooting-affinity_nodes-nodes-rebooting[pod anti-affinity].
* xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-working.adoc#deleting-nodes[Delete a node from a cluster] by scaling down the cluster using a compute machine set. To delete a node from a bare-metal cluster, you must first drain all pods on the node and then manually delete the node.

[id="pods-overview"]
== About pods

A pod is one or more containers deployed together on a node. As a cluster administrator, you can define a pod, assign it to run on a healthy node that is ready for scheduling, and manage. A pod runs as long as the containers are running. You cannot change a pod once it is defined and is running. Some operations you can perform when working with pods are:

== About containers

A container is the basic unit of an {product-title} application, which comprises the application code packaged along with its dependencies, libraries, and binaries. Containers provide consistency across environments and multiple deployment targets: physical servers, virtual machines (VMs), and private or public cloud.

Linux container technologies are lightweight mechanisms for isolating running processes and limiting access to only designated resources.
As an administrator, You can perform various tasks on a Linux container, such as:

[id="nodes-about-autoscaling-pod_{context}"]
== About autoscaling pods on a node

{product-title} offers three tools that you can use to automatically scale the number of pods on your nodes and the resources allocated to pods.

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler::
The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) can automatically increase or decrease the scale of a replication controller or deployment configuration, based on metrics collected from the pods that belong to that replication controller or deployment configuration.
+
For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-autoscaling.adoc#nodes-pods-autoscaling[Automatically scaling pods with the horizontal pod autoscaler].

Custom Metrics Autoscaler::
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler can automatically increase or decrease the number of pods for a deployment, stateful set, custom resource, or job based on custom metrics that are not based only on CPU or memory.
+
For more information, see xref:../nodes/cma/nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom.adoc#nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom[Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator overview].

Vertical Pod Autoscaler::
The Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) can automatically review the historic and current CPU and memory resources for containers in pods and can update the resource limits and requests based on the usage values it learns.
+
For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-vertical-autoscaler.adoc#nodes-pods-vpa[Automatically adjust pod resource levels with the vertical pod autoscaler].
