toc::[]



The {product-title} Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA) automatically reviews the historic and current CPU and memory resources for containers in pods and can update the resource limits and requests based on the usage values it learns. The VPA uses individual custom resources (CR) to update all of the pods associated with a workload object, such as a `Deployment`, `DeploymentConfig`, `StatefulSet`, `Job`, `DaemonSet`, `ReplicaSet`, or `ReplicationController`, in a project.

The VPA helps you to understand the optimal CPU and memory usage for your pods and can automatically maintain pod resources through the pod lifecycle.
