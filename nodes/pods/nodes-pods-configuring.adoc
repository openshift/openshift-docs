= Configuring an {product-title} cluster for pods
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

As an administrator, you can create and maintain an efficient cluster for pods.

By keeping your cluster efficient, you can provide a better environment for your developers using
such tools as what a pod does when it exits, ensuring that the required number of pods is always running,
when to restart pods designed to run only once, limit the bandwidth available to pods, and how to keep
pods running during disruptions.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise
// the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference
// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.
