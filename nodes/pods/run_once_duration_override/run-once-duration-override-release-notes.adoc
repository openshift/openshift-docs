Cluster administrators can use the {run-once-operator} to force a limit on the time that run-once pods can be active. After the time limit expires, the cluster tries to terminate the run-once pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to run for an excessive amount of time.

To apply the run-once duration override from the {run-once-operator} to run-once pods, you must enable it on each applicable namespace.

These release notes track the development of the {run-once-operator} for {product-title}.

For an overview of the {run-once-operator}, see xref:../../../nodes/pods/run_once_duration_override/index.adoc#run-once-about_run-once-duration-override-about[About the {run-once-operator}].

[IMPORTANT]
====
To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a {op-system-base-full} computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/assembly_installing-the-system-in-fips-mode_security-hardening[Installing the system in FIPS mode].
When you run {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
