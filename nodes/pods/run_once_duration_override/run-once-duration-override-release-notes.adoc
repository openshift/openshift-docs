Cluster administrators can use the {run-once-operator} to force a limit on the time that run-once pods can be active. After the time limit expires, the cluster tries to terminate the run-once pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to run for an excessive amount of time.

To apply the run-once duration override from the {run-once-operator} to run-once pods, you must enable it on each applicable namespace.

These release notes track the development of the {run-once-operator} for {product-title}.

For an overview of the {run-once-operator}, see xref:../../../nodes/pods/run_once_duration_override/index.adoc#run-once-about_run-once-duration-override-about[About the {run-once-operator}].
