= Running pods in Linux user namespaces
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

Linux user namespaces allow administrators to isolate the container user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs) so that a container can have a different set of permissions in the user namespace than on the host system where it is running. This allows containers to run processes with full privileges inside the user namespace, but the processes can be unprivileged for operations on the host machine.

By default, a container runs in the host user namespace. Running a container in the host user namespace can be useful when the container needs a feature that is available only in the host namespace. However, running pods in the host namespace introduces security concerns, such as the possibility of container breakouts, in which a process inside another container breaks out onto the host where the process can access or modify files on the host or in your containers. 
 
Running containers in individual user namespaces can mitigate container breakouts and several other vulnerabilities that a compromised container can pose to other pods and the node itself.
