= Authenticating pods with short-term credentials
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

Some {product-title} clusters use xref:../../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-short-term-creds.adoc#cco-short-term-creds[short-term security credentials for individual components] that are created and managed outside the cluster.
Applications in customer workloads on these clusters can authenticate by using the short-term authentication method that the cluster uses.

[id="nodes-pods-short-term-auth-configuring_{context}"]
== Configuring short-term authentication for workloads

To use this authentication method in your applications, you must complete the following steps:

. Create a federated identity service account in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) settings for your cloud provider.

. Create an {product-title} service account that can impersonate a service account for your cloud provider.

. Configure any workloads related to your application to use the {product-title} service account.

[id="nodes-pods-short-term-auth-prereqs_{context}"]
=== Environment and user access requirements

To configure this authentication method, you must meet the following requirements:

* Your cluster must use xref:../../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-short-term-creds.adoc#cco-short-term-creds[short-term security credentials].

* You must have access to the {oc-first} as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* In your cloud provider console, you must have access as a user with privileges to manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) and federated identity configurations.

[id="nodes-pods-short-term-auth-compatibility_{context}"]
=== Compatibility limitations

This authentication method is only supported for {aws-first}, {gcp-first}, and {azure-full} clusters. 
You can only authenticate workloads with short-term credentials by using the same authentication method as the cluster.

To use short-term authentication for applications on an {aws-short} cluster that uses {sts-short} authentication, you must complete the following steps:

. Configure access in {aws-short}.
. Create an {product-title} service account that can use this access.
. Deploy customer workloads that authenticate with {aws-short} {sts-short}.
