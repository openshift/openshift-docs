= Reducing pod timeouts when using persistent volumes with high file counts
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]


If a storage volume contains many files (~1,000,000 or greater), you may experience pod timeouts.

This can occur because, by default, {product-title} recursively changes ownership and permissions for the contents of each volume to match the `fsGroup` specified in a pod's `securityContext` when that volume is mounted. For large volumes, checking and changing ownership and permissions can be time consuming, slowing pod startup. 

There are two ways you can reduce this delay:

* You can use the `fsGroupChangePolicy` field inside a security context constraint (SCC) to control the way that {product-title} checks and manages ownership and permissions for a volume.

* You can skip the SELinux relabeling for a volume by using a SCC or by using a `RuntimeClass`.
