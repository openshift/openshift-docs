= Reducing pod timeouts when using persistent volumes with high file counts
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]


If a storage volume contains many files (~1,000,000 or greater), you may experience pod timeouts.

This can occur because, by default, {product-title} recursively changes ownership and permissions for the contents of each volume to match the `fsGroup` specified in a pod's `securityContext` when that volume is mounted. For large volumes, checking and changing ownership and permissions can be time consuming, slowing pod startup. 

You can reduce this delay by applying one of the following methods:

* Use an xref:../../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-reduce-timeouts.adoc#using_nodes-pods-reduce-timeouts-spec-t_nodes-pods-reduce-timeouts[SCC] to skip the SELinux relabeling for a volume.

* Use the xref:../../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-reduce-timeouts.adoc#using_nodes-pods-reduce-timeouts-auto_nodes-pods-reduce-timeouts[Cluster Resource Override Operator (CRO) to automatically apply an SCC] to skip the SELinux relabeling.

* Use the xref:../../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-reduce-timeouts.adoc#using_fsGroup_nodes-pods-reduce-timeouts[`fsGroupChangePolicy` field inside a security context constraint (SCC)] to control the way that {product-title} checks and manages ownership and permissions for a volume.

* Use a xref:../../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-reduce-timeouts.adoc#nodes-pods-reduce-timeouts-runtime_nodes-pods-reduce-timeouts[runtime class] to skip the SELinux relabeling for a volume.
