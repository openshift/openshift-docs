Every community can be strengthened by a diverse variety of viewpoints, insights, opinions, skillsets, and skill levels. However, with diversity comes the potential for disagreement and miscommunication. The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to ensure that disagreements and differences of opinion are conducted respectfully and on their own merits, without personal attacks or other behavior that might create an unsafe or unwelcoming environment.

These policies are not designed to be a comprehensive set of things you cannot do. We ask that you treat your fellow community members with respect and courtesy, and in general, Don’t Be A Jerk. This Code of Conduct is meant to be followed in spirit as much as in letter and is not exhaustive.

All {product-title} events and community members are governed by this Code of Conduct and anti-harassment policy. We expect <WHO> to enforce these guidelines throughout all events, and we expect attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers to help ensure a safe environment for our whole community. For the purposes of this Code of Conduct, the term _events_ refers to any in-person or on-line gathering, e-mail thread, chat room, code and documentation contribution, or any situation where {product-title} community members are invited to gather and communicate. A _community member_ is anyone who particiaptes in contributing or maintaining the {product-title} project.  

{product-title} community members are:

Considerate::
Contributions of every kind have far-ranging consequences. Just as your work depends on the work of others, decisions you make surrounding your contributions to the {product-title} community affect your fellow community members. You are strongly encouraged to take those consequences into account while making decisions.

Patient::
Asynchronous communication can come with its own frustrations, even in the most responsive of communities. Please remember that our community is largely built on volunteered time. It might take some time to receive a response to questions, contributions, and requests for support. Repeated _bumps_ or _reminders_ in rapid succession are not good displays of patience. Additionally, it is considered poor manners to ping a specific person with general questions. Pose your question to the community as a whole, and wait patiently for a response.

Respectful::
Every community inevitably has disagreements, but remember that it is possible to disagree respectfully and courteously. Disagreements are never an excuse for rudeness, hostility, threatening behavior, abuse (verbal or physical), or personal attacks.

Kind::
Everyone should feel welcome in the {product-title} community, regardless of their background. Please be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members. You are expected to follow the xref:okd-code-conduct-harrassment[Anti-harassment policy]. Additionally, you are encouraged not to make assumptions about the background or identity of your fellow community members.

Inquisitive::
The only stupid question is the one that does not get asked. We encourage our users to ask early and ask often. Rather than asking whether you can ask a question (the answer is always yes!), instead, simply ask your question. You are encouraged to provide as many specifics as possible. Code snippets in the form of Gists or other paste site links are almost always needed in order to get the most helpful answers. Refrain from pasting multiple lines of code directly into the Google Group channel or emails. Instead use gist.github.com or another paste site to provide code snippets.

Helpful::
The {product-title} community is committed to being a welcoming environment for all users, regardless of skill level. We were all beginners once upon a time, and our community cannot grow without an environment where new users feel safe and comfortable asking questions. It can become frustrating to answer the same questions repeatedly; however, community members are expected to remain courteous and helpful to all users equally, regardless of skill or knowledge level. Avoid providing responses that prioritize snideness and snark over useful information. At the same time, everyone is expected to read the provided documentation thoroughly. We are happy to answer questions, provide strategic guidance, and suggest effective workflows, but we are not here to do your job for you.

== Anti-harassment policy

Harassment includes (but is not limited to) the following behaviors:

* Offensive comments related to gender (including gender expression and identity), age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, and religion

* Derogatory terminology including words commonly known to be slurs

* Posting sexualized images or imagery in public spaces

* Deliberate intimidation

* Stalking

* Posting others’ personal information without explicit permission

* Sustained disruption of talks or other events

* Inappropriate physical contact

* Unwelcome sexual attention

Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. In particular, community members should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Community members should not use sexualized attire or otherwise create a sexualized environment at community events.

In addition to the behaviors outlined above, continuing to behave a certain way after you have been asked to stop also constitutes harassment, even if that behavior is not specifically outlined in this policy. It is considerate and respectful to stop doing something after you have been asked to stop, and all community members are expected to comply with such requests immediately.

[id="okd-code-conduct-violations"]
== Policy violations
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting <EMAIL/CONTACT REQUIRED>.

If a community member engages in harassing behavior, <WHO> may take any action deemed appropriate. These actions may include but are not limited to warning the offender, expelling the offender from the event, and barring the offender from participating in the community.

<WHO> will be happy to help community members contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts to an alternate location, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value the safety and well-being of our community members and want everyone to feel welcome at our events, both online and offline.

We expect all community members to follow these policies during all of our events.
