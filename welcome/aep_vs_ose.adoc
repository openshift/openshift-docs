== Overview
Atomic Enterprise Platform by Red Hat is a container infrastructure solution for deploying, running, and managing applications. OpenShift Enterprise is Red Hat's application platform, which is designed to build, deploy, and run applications on public and private cloud infrastructures.

Both products are similar, in that they are designed to manage applications. The main difference lies in OpenShift Enterprise providing the entire application lifecycle management, image updates, builds, and deployments. Atomic Enterprise Platform, however, simply provides you with the container infrastructure to use with your existing application lifecycle that you have built yourself.

As OpenShift Enterprise is a more robust product, built for starting applications from nothing, it has a number of features that are not available in Atomic Enterprise Platform, such as:

* Source-to-image (STI) builder
* Docker builder
* Web console

[IMPORTANT]
Atomic Enterprise Platform should not be confused with Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host, which is an operating system specifically designed for running Docker containers.
