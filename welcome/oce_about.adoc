[[about_oce_core_kubernetes_and_container_orchestration]]
=== Core Kubernetes and container orchestration
{oce} offers full access to an enterprise-ready Kubernetes
environment that is easy to install and offers an extensive compatibility test
matrix with many of the that software elements that you might use in your data
center.

{oce} offers the same service level agreements, bug fixes, and common
vulnerabilities and errors protection as {product-title}. {oce} includes a
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Virtual Datacenter and Red Hat CoreOS entitlement that
allows you to use an integrated Linux operating system with container runtime
from the same provider.

{oce} is compatible with Windows Containers from Microsoft.

[[about_oce_enterprise_ready_configurations]]
=== Enterprise-ready configurations
{oce} uses the same security options and default settings as the {product-title}.
Default security context constraints, pod security policies, best practice
network and storage settings, service account configuration, SELinux integration,
HAproxy edge routing configuration, and all other standard protections that
{product-title} offers are available in {oce}. {oce} offers full access to the
integrated monitoring solution that {product-title} uses, which is based on
Prometheus and offers deep coverage and alerting for common Kubernetes issues.

[[about_oce_standard_infrastructure_services]]
=== Standard infrastructure services
With an {oce} subscription, you receive support for all storage plug-ins that
{product-title} supports.

In terms of networking, {oce} offers full and
supported access to the Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) and
therefore allows you to use any third-party SDN that supports {product-title}.
It also allows you to use the included Open vSwitch to establish a flat,
non-project (Kubernetes namespace) segmented network for the Kubernetes cluster.
{oce} allows customers to use a Kubernetes Network Policy to create
microsegmentation between deployed application services on the cluster.

You can also use the route API objects that are found in {product-title},
including its sophisticated integration with the HAproxy edge routing layer.

[[about_oce_core_user_experience]]
=== Core user experience
{oce} users have full access to Kubernetes Operators, pod deployment strategies,
Helm, and {product-title} templates. {oce} users can use both the `oc` and
`kubectl` command line interfaces. {oce} also offers an administrator web-based
console that shows all aspects of the deployed container services and offers a
container-as-a service experience. {oce} grants access to the Operator Life
Cycle Manager that helps you control access to content on the cluster and life
cycle operator-enabled services that you use. With an {oce} subscription, you
receive access to the Kubernetes namespace, the OpenShift Project API object,
and both cluster-level and tenant-level Prometheus monitoring metrics and events.

=== Maintained and curated content
With an {oce} subscription, you receive access to the {product-title} entitled
content from the Red Hat Container Catalog and Red Hat Connect ISV marketplace.
You can access all maintained and curated content that the {product-title}
eco-system offers either for free, such as the Red Hat Software Collections,
or through additional purchases. The Kubernetes service broker, service catalog,
and all {product-title} service broker offerings are supported with an
{oce} subscription.

=== OpenShift Container Storage compatible
{oce} is compatible and supported with OpenShift Container Storage.

=== Red Hat Middleware compatible
{oce} is compatible and supported with Red Hat Middleware product solutions.

=== Serverless Cloud Functions compatible
{oce} is compatible and supported with future Red Hat Cloud Functions products,
such as function based and serverless container services.

=== Quay Integration compatible

CNV VM Virtualization Compatible
{oce} is compatible and supported with Red Hat product offerings derived from
the kubevirt.io open source project.

=== Advanced cluster management
A {oce} subscription does not offer a cluster-wide log aggregation
solution or support ElasticSearch, Fluentd, Kibana based logging solutions.
Similarly the chargeback features found in {product-title} and Red Hat Service
Mesh capabilities derived from the open source Istio.io and kiali.io projects
that offers OpenTracing observability for containerized services on
{product-title} are not supported.

=== Advanced networking
The standard networking solutions in {product-title} are not supported with an
{oce} subscription. {product-title}’s Kubernetes CNI plug-in for automation of
multi-tenant network segmentation between {product-title} projects is not
entitled for use with {oce}. {product-title} offers more granular control of the
source IP addresses that are used by application services on the cluster.
Those egress IP address controls are not entitled for use with {oce}.
{product-title} offers ingress routing to on cluster services that use
non-standard ports when no public cloud provider is in use via the VIP pods
found in {product-title}. That ingress solution is not supported in {oce}.
{oce} users are supported for the Kubernetes ingress control object, which
offers integrations with public cloud providers. Red Hat Service Mesh, which is
derived from the istio.io open source project, is not supported in {oce}.

* The developer experience utilities and tools.
* {product-title}’s pipeline feature that integrates a streamlined,
Kubernetes-enabled Jenkins experience in the user’s project space.
* The {product-title}’s source-to-image feature, which allows you to easily
deploy source code, dockerfiles, or container images across the cluster.
* Build strategies, builder pods, or imagestreams for end user container
deployments.
* The `odo` developer command line.
* The developer persona in the {product-title} web console.

== Subscription Limitations

{oce} is a subscription offering that provides {product-title} with a limited set
of supported features at a lower list price. {oce} and {product-title} are the
same product and, therefore, all software and features are delivered in both.
There is only one download, {product-title}. {oce} uses the {product-title}
documentation and support services and bug errata for this reason.
