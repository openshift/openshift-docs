- ** xref:../cli_reference/openshift_developer_cli/understanding-odo.adoc#understanding-odo[Use the developer CLI tool (odo)]**:
The odo CLI tool lets developers create single or multi-component applications
easily and automates deployment, build, and service route configurations.
It abstracts complex Kubernetes and {product-title} concepts, allowing developers to focus on developing their applications.

- **Deploy Helm Charts**:
xref:../cli_reference/helm-cli/getting-started-with-helm-on-openshift-container-platform.adoc#getting-started-with-helm-on-openshift[Helm 3]

services needed by complex middleware applications that require
encryption. At some point, you may need to change, add, and
rotate these certificates.

- **xref:../networking/understanding-networking.adoc#understanding-networking[Manage networking]**: Networking in {product-title} is managed by
the xref:../networking/cluster-network-operator.adoc#cluster-network-operator[Cluster Network Operator] (CNO).
The CNO uses iptables rules in xref:../networking/openshift-sdn/configuring-kube-proxy.adoc#configuring-kube-proxy[kube-proxy] to
direct traffic between nodes and pods running on those nodes.
The Multus Container Network Interface
adds the capability to attach xref:../networking/multiple-networks/understanding-multiple-networks.adoc#understanding-multiple-networks[multiple network interfaces] to a Pod. Using
xref:../networking/configuring-networkpolicy.adoc#configuring-networkpolicy-plugin[NetworkPolicy] features, you can isolate your networks or permit selected traffic.

- **Update a cluster**:
To upgrade your {product-title} to a later version, use the Cluster Version Operator (CVO).
If an update is available from the Container Platform update service, you apply that cluster update from either the xref:../updating/updating-cluster.adoc#updating-cluster[web console] or the xref:../updating/updating-cluster-cli.adoc#updating-cluster-cli[CLI].

////
There is a separate process for
