direct traffic between nodes and pods running on those nodes.
The Multus Container Network Interface
adds the capability to attach xref:../networking/multiple_networks/understanding-multiple-networks.adoc#understanding-multiple-networks[multiple network interfaces] to a Pod. Using
xref:../networking/configuring-networkpolicy.adoc#configuring-networkpolicy-plugin[NetworkPolicy] features, you can isolate your networks or permit selected traffic.
