How you approach {product-title} {product-version} documentation depends on your role and what you want to do in that role. For example:

* As a cluster administrator, you might want to learn about {product-title} architecture, understand choices of platforms and setting when deploying OpenShift, and learn how to maintain and improve your OpenShift cluster.

* As a software developer, you might want to understand about the different forms of applications you can create and manage through OpenShift, such as Operators, S2I images, or service broker applications.

To navigate the {product-title} {product-version} documentation set, you can either use the left navigation bar to browse the documentation or go through the content of this Welcome page to follow links to different {product-title} activities.

== Cluster Administrator Activities

As a cluster administrator, with tasks from deploying {product-title} {product-version} to managing the resulting cluster’s resources, this documentation will help you:

- **xref:../architecture/architecture.adoc#architecture-overview-architecture[Understand {product-title}]**: Learn how {product-title} {product-version} employs a foundation of Kubernetes that is installed and maintained through multiple levels of Operators. See how OpenShift masters and workers are managed and updated through xref:../machine_management/creating-machineset.adoc#machine-api-overview_creating-machineset[Machine API] and xref:../applications/operators/olm-what-operators-are.adoc#machine-api-overview-architecture[Operators].

- **xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc[Choose a deployment platform]**: Amazon AWS is the first supported platform for {product-title} {product-version}. However, you can expect support for other cloud and on-premise platforms to follow soon.

- **xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc[Deploy {product-title}]**: Choose between an xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-default.adoc[AWS quick cluster install] or xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.adoc[AWS install with customizations].

- **xref:../machine_management/creating-machineset.adoc[Manage machines]**: Manage machines in your OpenShift cluster by xref:../machine_management/deploying-machine-health-checks.adoc[deploying health checks] and xref:../machine_management/applying-autoscaling.adoc[applying autoscaling to machines].

- **xref:../registry/registry-options.adoc[Set up container registries]**: Each {product-title} cluster includes a built-in container registry for storing its images. You can also configure a separate link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/[Red Hat Quay] registry to use with OpenShift. The link:https://quay.io[Quay.io] site provides a public container registry that stores OpenShift containers and Operators.

- **xref:../authentication/understanding-authentication.adoc[Manage users and groups]**: Add users and groups that have different levels of permissions to use or modify clusters.

- **xref:../applications/operators/olm-what-operators-are.adoc[Install Operators]**: Lists of Red Hat, ISV, and community operators can be reviewed by cluster administrators and xref:../applications/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.adoc[installed on their clusters]. Once installed, xref:../applications/operators/olm-creating-apps-from-installed-operators.adoc[an operator can be run], upgraded, backed up or otherwise managed by users of that cluster (based on what the operator is designed to do).

- **xref:../applications/pruning-objects.adoc[Prune and reclaim resources]**: To clean out unneeded objects to reclaim space, you can prune operators, groups, deployments, builds, images, registries, and cron jobs.

- **xref:../logging/efk-logging.adoc#efk-logging[Work with cluster logging]**: Learn about cluster logging. Then configure different cluster logging types, such as Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana, and Curator.

- **Monitor clusters**: Use commands and Grafana dashboards to monitor clusters with Prometheus.

- **xref:../scalability_and_performance/scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator[Scale] and
xref:../scalability_and_performance/using-node-tuning-operator.adoc#using-node-tuning-operator[tune] clusters**: Set cluster limits, tune nodes, scale cluster monitoring, optimize networking, optimize storage, and optimize routes.

== Developer Activities
Ultimately, OpenShift is a platform for developing and deploying containerized applications. As an application developer, {product-title} documentation will help you:

* **xref:../web-console/working-with-projects.adoc[Work with projects]**: Create projects from the Web console or CLI to help you organize and share the software you develop.

* **xref:../builds/understanding-image-builds.adoc[Understanding image builds]**: Choose from different build strategies (Docker, Source-to-Image, custom and pipeline) that can include different kinds of source materials (from places like Git repositories, local binary inputs and external artifacts). Then follow examples of build types from basic builds to advanced builds.

* **xref:../openshift_images/images-understand.adoc[Create container images]**: A container image is the most basic building block in OpenShift (and Kubernetes) applications. Defining imagestreams lets you gather multiple versions of an image in one place as you continue its development. Source-to-Image containers let you insert your source code into a base container that is set up to run code of a particular type (such as Ruby, Node.js, and Python).

* **xref:../openshift_images/using-templates.adoc[Create templates]**: Use existing templates or create your own templates that describe how an application is built or deployed. A template can combine images with descriptions, parameters, replicas (how many pods are spun up at a time), exposed ports and other content that defines how an application can be run or built.

* **xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-getting-started.adoc[Create operators]**: Operators are the preferred form for creating on-cluster applications for {product-title} {product-version}. Learn the workflow for building, testing and deploying operators. Then create your own operators based on xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-ansible.adoc[Ansible] or
 xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-helm.adoc[Helm], or configure xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-monitoring-prometheus.adoc[built-in Prometheus monitoring] using the Operator SDK.

* **Use Service Broker applications**: Service Broker applications is a preferred mechanism for provisioning applications outside of an {product-title} environment. Service brokers in {product-title} are based on the Open Service Broker API.
