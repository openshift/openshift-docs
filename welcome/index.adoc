== Developer activities
Ultimately, OpenShift is a platform for developing and deploying containerized applications. As an application developer, {product-title} documentation will help you:

- **xref:../architecture/understanding-development.adoc[Understand {product-title} development]**: Learn the different types of
containerized applications, from simple containers to advanced Kubernetes deployments and Operators.

- **xref:../web-console/working-with-projects.adoc[Work with projects]**: Create projects from the web console or CLI to organize and share the software you develop.

- **xref:../builds/understanding-image-builds.adoc[Understand image builds]**: Choose from different build strategies (Docker, S2i, custom and pipeline) that can include different kinds of source materials (from places like Git repositories, local binary inputs and external artifacts). Then, follow examples of build types from basic builds to advanced builds.

- **xref:../openshift_images/images-understand.adoc[Create container images]**: A container image is the most basic building block in OpenShift (and Kubernetes) applications. Defining imagestreams lets you gather multiple versions of an image in one place as you continue its development. S2i containers let you insert your source code into a base container that is set up to run code of a particular type (such as Ruby, Node.js, or Python).

- **xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-getting-started.adoc[Create Deployments and DeploymentConfigs]**:  Use Deployments and DeploymentConfigs to exert fine-grained management over applications.
Use the Workloads page or `oc` CLI to xref:../applications/deployments/managing-deployment-processes.adoc[manage DeploymentConfigs]. Learn xref:../applications/deployments/deployment-strategise.adoc[Rolling, Recreate, and Custom] deployment strategies.

- **xref:../openshift_images/using-templates.adoc[Create templates]**: Use existing templates or create your own templates that describe how an application is built or deployed. A template can combine images with descriptions, parameters, replicas, exposed ports and other content that defines how an application can be run or built.

- **xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-getting-started.adoc[Create Operators]**: Operators are the preferred form for creating on-cluster applications for {product-title} {product-version}. Learn the workflow for building, testing and deploying operators. Then create your own operators based on xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-ansible.adoc[Ansible] or
 xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-helm.adoc[Helm], or configure xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-monitoring-prometheus.adoc[built-in Prometheus monitoring] using the Operator SDK.

- **Use xref:../applications/service_brokers/installing-template-service-broker.adoc#sb-about-template-service-broker-sb-installing-tsb[Template Service Broker] or xref:../applications/service_brokers/installing-ansible-service-broker.html#sb-about-ansible-service-broker-sb-installing-asb[OpenShift Ansible Broker] applications**: Service brokers are a preferred mechanism for provisioning applications outside of an {product-title} environment.
