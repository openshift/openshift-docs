As someone setting out to install an {product-title} {product-version} cluster, this documentation will help you:

- **xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[Install a cluster on AWS]**: You have the most installation options when you deploy a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can deploy clusters with xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-default.adoc#installing-aws-default[default settings], xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.adoc#installing-aws-customizations[custom AWS settings], or xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-network-customizations.adoc#installing-aws-network-customizations[custom networking settings]. You can also deploy a cluster on AWS infrastructure that you provisioned yourself. You can modify the provided xref:../installing/installing_aws_user_infra/installing-aws-user-infra.adoc#installing-aws-user-infra[AWS CloudFormation templates] to meet your needs.

- **xref:../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.adoc#installing-vsphere[Install a cluster on VMware vSphere]**: You can install {product-title} on supported versions of vSphere.

- **xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[Install a cluster on bare metal]**: If none of the available platform and cloud providers meet your needs, you can install {product-title} on bare metal.

- **xref:../installing/installing-gather-logs.adoc#[Check installation logs]**: Access installation logs to evaluate issues that occur during {product-title} {product-version} installation.

- **xref:../web-console/web-console.adoc[Access {product-title}]**: Use credentials output at the end of the installation process to log in to the {product-title} cluster from the command line or web console.

== Developer activities
Ultimately, OpenShift is a platform for developing and deploying containerized applications. As an application developer, {product-title} documentation will help you:

- **xref:../architecture/understanding-development.adoc[Understand {product-title} development]**: Learn the different types of
containerized applications, from simple containers to advanced Kubernetes deployments and Operators.

- **xref:../applications/projects/working-with-projects.adoc[Work with projects]**: Create projects from the web console or CLI to organize and share the software you develop.

- **xref:../applications/operators/olm-what-operators-are.adoc#olm-what-operators-are[Understand Operators]**: Operators are the preferred method for creating on-cluster applications for {product-title} {product-version}. Learn about the Operator Framework and how to deploy applications using installed Operators into your projects.

- **xref:../builds/understanding-image-builds.adoc[Understand image builds]**: Choose from different build strategies (Docker, S2I, custom, and pipeline) that can include different kinds of source materials (from places like Git repositories, local binary inputs, and external artifacts). Then, follow examples of build types from basic builds to advanced builds.

- **xref:../openshift_images/images-understand.adoc[Create container images]**: A container image is the most basic building block in OpenShift (and Kubernetes) applications. Defining imagestreams lets you gather multiple versions of an image in one place as you continue its development. S2I containers let you insert your source code into a base container that is set up to run code of a particular type (such as Ruby, Node.js, or Python).

- **xref:../applications/deployments/what-deployments-are.adoc[Create Deployments and DeploymentConfigs]**:  Use Deployments and DeploymentConfigs to exert fine-grained management over applications.
Use the Workloads page or `oc` CLI to xref:../applications/deployments/managing-deployment-processes.adoc[manage DeploymentConfigs]. Learn xref:../applications/deployments/deployment-strategies.adoc#deployment-strategies[Rolling, Recreate, and Custom] deployment strategies.

- **xref:../openshift_images/using-templates.adoc[Create templates]**: Use existing templates or create your own templates that describe how an application is built or deployed. A template can combine images with descriptions, parameters, replicas, exposed ports and other content that defines how an application can be run or built.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
- **xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-getting-started.adoc[Create Operators]**: Operators are the preferred method for creating on-cluster applications for {product-title} {product-version}. Learn the workflow for building, testing, and deploying Operators. Then create your own Operators based on xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-ansible.adoc[Ansible] or
xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-helm.adoc[Helm], or configure xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-monitoring-prometheus.adoc[built-in Prometheus monitoring] using the Operator SDK.

- **Use xref:../applications/service_brokers/installing-template-service-broker.adoc#sb-about-template-service-broker-sb-installing-tsb[Template Service Broker] or xref:../applications/service_brokers/installing-ansible-service-broker.html#sb-about-ansible-service-broker-sb-installing-asb[OpenShift Ansible Broker] applications**: Service brokers are a mechanism for provisioning applications outside of an {product-title} environment.

- **Manage xref:../authentication/certificates/replacing-default-ingress-certificate.adoc[Ingress], xref:../authentication/certificates/api-server.adoc[API server], and xref:../authentication/certificates/service-serving-certificate.adoc[service] certificates**: {product-title} creates certificates
by default for the Ingress Operator, the API server, and for
services needed by complex middleware applications that require
encryption. At some point, you may need to change, add, and
rotate these certificates.

- **xref:../networking/understanding-networking.adoc[Manage networking]**: Networking in {product-title} is managed by
the xref:../networking/cluster-network-operator.adoc[Cluster Network Operator] (CNO).
The CNO uses iptables rules in xref:../networking/openshift-sdn/configuring-kube-proxy.adoc[kube-proxy] to
direct traffic between nodes and pods running on those nodes.
The Multis Container Network interface
adds the capability to attach xref:../networking/managing-multinetworking.adoc#managing-multiple-networks[multiple network interfaces] to a Pod. Using
