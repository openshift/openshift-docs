== Cluster installation activities

As a someone setting out to install an {product-title} {product-version} cluster, this documentation will help you:

- **xref:../architecture/architecture.adoc#architecture-overview-architecture[Understand {product-title}]**: Learn how {product-title} {product-version} employs a foundation of Kubernetes that is installed and maintained through multiple levels of Operators. Then step through details on how
the {product-title} installation process works, from
the `openshift-installer` tool to deployments of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) to Terraform, Ignition,
and control plane Operators.

- **xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc[Choose a deployment platform]**: Amazon AWS is the first supported platform for {product-title} {product-version}. Other supported platforms include xref:../installing-bare-metal.adoc[bare metal] and xref:../installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.adoc[vSphere].

- **xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc[Deploy {product-title}]**: Choose between an xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-default.adoc[AWS quick cluster install], xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.adoc[AWS install with customizations], xref:../installing-bare-metal.adoc[bare metal] and xref:../installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.adoc[vSphere] installation.

- **xref:../web-console/web-console.adoc[Access {product-title}]**: Use credentials output at the end of the installation process to log into the {product-title} cluster from the command line or web console.{product-title}

== Developer activities
Ultimately, OpenShift is a platform for developing and deploying containerized applications. As an application developer, {product-title} documentation will help you:

* **xref:../web-console/working-with-projects.adoc[Work with projects]**: Create projects from the web console or CLI to organize and share the software you develop.

* **xref:../builds/understanding-image-builds.adoc[Understanding image builds]**: Choose from different build strategies (Docker, S2i, custom and pipeline) that can include different kinds of source materials (from places like Git repositories, local binary inputs, and external artifacts). Then, follow examples of build types from basic builds to advanced builds.

* **xref:../openshift_images/images-understand.adoc[Create container images]**: A container image is the most basic building block in OpenShift (and Kubernetes) applications. Defining image streams lets you gather multiple versions of an image in one place as you continue its development. S2i containers let you insert your source code into a base container that is set up to run code of a particular type (such as Ruby, Node.js, or Python).

* **xref:../openshift_images/using-templates.adoc[Create templates]**: With the xref:../service_brokers/installing-templae-service-broker.adoc[Template Service Broker] installed and running,
you can  xref:../service_brokers/provisioning-template-application.adoc[provision template applications] or xref:../service_brokers/provisioning-service-bundle[provision service bundles].
A template defines how a containerized application can be run or built. To use
templates, you must also install the xref:..//service_brokers/installing-service-catalog.adoc[service catalog].

* **xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-getting-started.adoc[Create operators]**: Operators are the preferred method for creating on-cluster applications for {product-title} {product-version}. Learn the workflow for building, testing and deploying Operators. Then create your own Operators based on xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-ansible.adoc[Ansible] or
 xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-helm.adoc[Helm], or configure xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-monitoring-prometheus.adoc[built-in Prometheus monitoring] using the Operator SDK.

**xref:../applications/operator_sdk/osdk-getting-started.adoc[Create Deployments and DeploymentConfigs]**:  Use Deployments and DeploymentConfigs to exert fine-grained management over applications.
Use the Workloads page or `oc` CLI to xref:../applications/deployments/managing-deployment-processes.adoc[manage DeploymentConfigs]. Learn xref:../applications/deployments/deployment-strategise.adoc[Rolling, Recreate, and Custom] deployment strategies.

* **Use Service Broker applications**: Service brokers are a preferred mechanism for provisioning applications outside of an {product-title} environment.

== Cluster administrator activities

Ongoing tasks on your {product-title} cluster include various activities for managing machines,
providing services to users, and following monitoring and logging features that watch over the cluster.
As a cluster administrator, this documentation will help you:

- **xref:../updating/updating-cluster.html
[Update a cluster]**: To upgrade your {product-title} to a later version, use the Cluster Version Operator (CVO). If an update is available from the Container Platform update service, you apply that cluster update from the web console.

- **xref:../machine_management/creating-machineset.adoc[Manage machines]**: Manage machines in your OpenShift cluster by xref:../machine_management/deploying-machine-health-checks.adoc[deploying health checks] and xref:../machine_management/deploying-machine-health-checks.adoc[applying autoscaling to machines].

- **xref:../registry/registry-options.adoc[Set up container registries]**: Each {product-title} cluster includes a built-in container registry for storing its images. You can also configure a separate link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/[Red Hat Quay] registry to use with OpenShift. The link:https://quay.io[Quay.io] site provides a public container registry that stores OpenShift containers and Operators.

- **xref:../authentication/understanding-authentication.adoc[Manage users and groups]**: Add users and groups that have different levels of permissions to use or modify clusters.

- **xref:../applications/operators/olm-what-operators-are.adoc[Install Operators]**: Lists of Red Hat, ISV, and community operators can be reviewed by cluster administrators and xref:../applications/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.adoc[installed on their clusters]. Once installed, users can xref:../applications/operators/olm-creating-apps-from-installed-operators.adoc[run], upgrade, back up or otherwise manage an Operator.

- **xref:../updating/updating-cluster.adoc[Updating a cluster]**: Using the {product-title} update service, provides over-the-air updates of both the
{product-title} itself as well as the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) operating system running on each node.

- **xref:../applications/crds/crd-extending-api-with-crds.adoc[Use Custom Resource Definition (CRDs) to modify the cluster]**: Cluster features that are implemented with Operators, can be modified with CRDs. Learn to xref:../applications/crds/crd-extending-api-with-crds.adoc#crd-creating-custom-resources-definition-crd-extending-api-with-crds[create a CRD] and xref:../applications/crds/crd-managing-resources-from-crds.adoc[manage resources from CRDs].

- **xref:../applications/quotas/quotas-setting-per-project.adoc[Set resource quotas]**: Choose from CPU, memory and other system resources to xref:../applications/quotas/quotas-setting-per-project.adoc#quotas-resources-managed-quotas-setting-per1project[set quotas].

- **xref:../applications/pruning-objects.adoc[Prune and reclaim resources]**: You can reclaim space by pruning unneeded Operators, groups, deployments, builds, images, registries, and cron jobs.

- **xref:../logging/efk-logging.adoc#efk-logging[Work with cluster logging]**: Learn about cluster logging and configure different cluster logging types, such as Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana, and Curator.

- **xref:../monitoring/cluster-monitoring/about-cluster-monitoring.adoc[Monitor clusters]**: Learn to  xref:../monitoring/cluster-monitoring/configure-the-monitoring.adoc[configure the monitoring]. With the Alertmanager user interface, learn to xref:../monitoring/cluster-monitoring/managing-alerts-using-alertmanager-ui.adoc[manage alerts]. Once your monitoring is configured, use the `oc` tool and Web UI to xref:../monitoring/cluster-monitoring/prometheus-alertmanager-and-grafana.adoc[access Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana].
To monitor applications, xref:../monitoring/application-monitoring/application-monitoring.adoc[configure custom metrics] for each selected namespace.

- **xref:../scalability_and_performance/scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator[Scale] and
xref:../scalability_and_performance/using-node-tuning-operator.adoc#using-node-tuning-operator[tune] clusters**: Set cluster limits, tune nodes, scale cluster monitoring,
and optimize networking, storage, and routes for your environment.
