This glossary defines common Kubernetes and {product-title} terms.

access policies::
A set of roles that dictate how users, applications, and entities within a cluster interact with one another. An access policy increases cluster security.

admission plugins::
Admission plugins enforce security policies, resource limitations, or configuration requirements.

authentication::
// The following variations have only minor differences, but are separated for maintainability.
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
To control access to an {product-title} cluster, a cluster administrator can configure user authentication to ensure only approved users access the cluster. To interact with an {product-title} cluster, you must authenticate with the {product-title} API. You can authenticate by providing an OAuth access token or an X.509 client certificate in your requests to the {product-title} API.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
To control access to a {product-title} cluster, an administrator with the `dedicated-admin` role can configure user authentication to ensure only approved users access the cluster. To interact with a {product-title} cluster, you must authenticate with the {product-title} API. You can authenticate by providing an OAuth access token or an X.509 client certificate in your requests to the {product-title} API.

bootstrap::
A temporary machine that runs minimal Kubernetes and deploys the {product-title} control plane.

build::
A build is the process of transforming input parameters, such as source code, into a runnable container image. This process is defined by a BuildConfig object, which specifies the entire build workflow. {product-title} utilizes Kubernetes to create containers from the build images and push them to the integrated container registry.

certificate signing requests (CSRs)::
A resource requests a denoted signer to sign a certificate. This request might get approved or denied.

Cluster Version Operator (CVO)::
An Operator that checks with the {product-title} Update Service to see the valid updates and update paths based on current component versions and information in the graph.

compute nodes::
Nodes that are responsible for executing workloads for cluster users.

configuration drift::
A situation where the configuration on a node does not match what the machine config specifies.

container::
Container is a lightweight, portable application instance that runs in OCI-compliant environments on compute nodes. Each container is a runtime instance of an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant image, which is a binary package containing the application and its dependencies. A single compute node can host multiple containers, with its capacity determined by the memory and CPU resources available, whether on cloud infrastructure, physical hardware, or virtualized environments.

container orchestration engine::
Software that automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers.

container workloads::
Applications that are packaged and deployed in containers.

control groups (cgroups)::
Partitions sets of processes into groups to manage and limit the resources processes consume.

control plane::
A container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the life cycle of containers. Control planes are also known as control plane machines.

CRI-O::
A Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates with the operating system to deliver an efficient Kubernetes experience.

Deployment and DeploymentConfig::
{product-title} supports both Kubernetes Deployment objects and {product-title} DeploymentConfig objects for managing application rollout and scaling.
+
A Deployment object defines how an application is deployed as pods. It specifies the container image to pull from the registry, the number of replicas to maintain, and the labels that guide scheduling onto compute nodes. The Deployment creates and manages a ReplicaSet, which ensures the specified number of pods are running. Additionally, Deployment objects support various rollout strategies to update pods while maintaining application availability.
+
A DeploymentConfig object extends Deployment functionality by introducing change triggers, which automatically create new deployment versions when a new container image version becomes available or when other defined changes occur. This enables automated rollout management within {product-title}.

Dockerfile::
A text file that contains the user commands to perform on a terminal to assemble the image.

ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
hosted control planes::
A {product-title} feature that enables hosting a control plane on the {product-title} cluster from its data plane and workers. This model performs the following actions:
+
* Optimize infrastructure costs required for the control planes.
* Improve the cluster creation time.
* Enable hosting the control plane using the Kubernetes native high level primitives. For example, deployments and stateful sets.
* Allow a strong network segmentation between the control plane and workloads.

{product-title} cluster. An Operator is a Kubernetes-native application designed to translate operational knowledge into a software that is packaged and shared with customers. Traditionally, tasks such as installation, configuration, scaling, updates, and failover were managed manually by administrators by using scripts or automation tools like Ansible. Operators bring these capabilities into Kubernetes, making them natively integrated and automated within the cluster.
+
Operators manage both Day 1 operations such as installation and configuration, and Day 2 operations such as scaling, updates, backups, failover and restores. By leveraging Kubernetes APIs and concepts, Operators provide an automated and consistent way to manage complex applications.

OperatorHub::
A platform that contains various {product-title} Operators to install.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)::
OLM helps you to install, update, and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes native applications. OLM is an open source toolkit designed to manage Operators in an effective, automated, and scalable way.

OSTree::
An upgrade system for Linux-based operating systems that performs atomic upgrades of complete file system trees. OSTree tracks meaningful changes to the file system tree using an addressable object store, and is designed to complement existing package management systems.

over-the-air (OTA) updates::
The {product-title} Update Service (OSUS) provides over-the-air updates to {product-title}, including {op-system-first}.

pod::
A pod is one or more containers deployed together on one host. It consists of a colocated group of containers with shared resources such as volumes and IP addresses. A pod is also the smallest compute unit defined, deployed, and managed.
In {product-title}, pods replace individual application containers as the smallest deployable unit.
Pods are the orchestrated unit in {product-title}. {product-title} schedules and runs all containers in a pod on the same node. Complex applications are made up of multiple pods, each with their own containers. They interact externally and also with another inside the {product-title} environment.

private registry::
{product-title} can use any server implementing the container image registry API as a source of the image which helps the developers to push and pull their private container images.

project::
{product-title} uses projects to enable groups of users or developers to work together. A project defines the scope of resources, manages user access, and enforces resource quotas and limits.
+
A project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations that provide role-based access control (RBAC) and management capabilities. It serves as the central mechanism for organizing resources, ensuring isolation between different user groups.

public registry::
{product-title} can use any server implementing the container image registry API as a source of the image which allows the developers to push and pull their public container images.

{op-system-base} {product-title} Cluster Manager::
A managed service where you can install, modify, operate, and upgrade your {product-title} clusters.

{op-system-base} Quay Container Registry::
A Quay.io container registry that serves most of the container images and Operators to {product-title} clusters.

replication controllers::
An asset that indicates how many pod replicas are required to run at a time.

ReplicaSet and ReplicationController::
The Kubernetes `ReplicaSet` and `ReplicationController` objects ensure that the desired number of pod replicas are running at all times. If a pod fails, exits, or is deleted, these controllers automatically create new pods to maintain the specified replica count. Conversely, if there are more pods than required, the ReplicaSet or ReplicationController scales down by terminating excess pods to match the defined replica count.

role-based access control (RBAC)::
A key security control to ensure that cluster users and workloads have only access to resources required to execute their roles.

route::
A route is a way to expose a service by giving it an externally reachable hostname, such as www.example.com. Each route consists of a route name, a service selector, and optionally, a security configuration.

router::
A router processes defined routes and their associated service endpoints, enabling external clients to access applications. While deploying a multi-tier application in {product-title} is straightforward, external traffic cannot reach the application without the routing layer.

scaling::
The increasing or decreasing of resource capacity.

service::
A service in {product-title} defines a logical set of pods and the access policies for reaching them. It provides a stable internal IP address and hostname, ensuring seamless communication between application components as pods are created and destroyed.

Source-to-Image (S2I) image::
An image created based on the programming language of the application source code in {product-title} to deploy applications.

storage::
// OSD and ROSA definitions are separated here due to different indefinite
// articles.
