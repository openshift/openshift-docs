As of 27 April 2020, Red Hat has decided to rename Red Hat OpenShift Container Engine to Red Hat {oke}
in order to better communicate what value the product offering delivers.

Red Hat {oke} is a product offering from Red Hat that lets
you use an enterprise class Kubernetes platform as a production platform for
launching containers. You download and install {oke} the same way as {product-title}
as they are the same binary distribution, but {oke} offers a subset of the
features that {product-title} offers.

[[about_oke_core_kubernetes_and_container_orchestration]]
=== Core Kubernetes and container orchestration
{oke} offers full access to an enterprise-ready Kubernetes environment that is
easy to install and offers an extensive compatibility test matrix with many of
the software elements that you might use in your data center.

{oke} offers the same service level agreements, bug fixes, and common
vulnerabilities and errors protection as {product-title}. {oke} includes a
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Virtual Datacenter and Red Hat CoreOS entitlement that
allows you to use an integrated Linux operating system with container runtime
from the same technology provider.

{oke} is subscription compatible with Windows Containers from Microsoft.

[[about_oke_enterprise_ready_configurations]]
=== Enterprise-ready configurations
{oke} uses the same security options and default settings as the {product-title}.
Default security context constraints, pod security policies, best practice
network and storage settings, service account configuration, SELinux integration,
HAproxy edge routing configuration, and all other standard protections that
{product-title} offers are available in {oke}. {oke} offers full access to the
integrated monitoring solution that {product-title} uses, which is based on
Prometheus and offers deep coverage and alerting for common Kubernetes issues.

{oke} uses the same installation and upgrade automation as {product-title}.

[[about_oke_standard_infrastructure_services]]
=== Standard infrastructure services
With an {oke} subscription, you receive support for all storage plug-ins that
{product-title} supports.

In terms of networking, {oke} offers full and
supported access to the Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) and
therefore allows you to use any third-party SDN that supports {product-title}.
It also allows you to use the included Open vSwitch software defined network to
its fullest extent. {oke} allows you to take full advantage of the OVN
Kubernetes overlay, Multus, and Multus plug-ins that are supported on
{product-title}. {oke} allows customers to use a Kubernetes Network Policy to
create microsegmentation between deployed application services on the cluster.

You can also use the `Route` API objects that are found in {product-title},
including its sophisticated integration with the HAproxy edge routing layer as an
out of the box Kubernetes ingress controller.

[[about_oke_core_user_experience]]
=== Core user experience
{oke} users have full access to Kubernetes Operators, pod deployment strategies,
Helm, and {product-title} templates. {oke} users can use both the `oc` and
`kubectl` command line interfaces. {oke} also offers an administrator web-based
console that shows all aspects of the deployed container services and offers a
container-as-a service experience. {oke} grants access to the Operator Life
Cycle Manager that helps you control access to content on the cluster and life
cycle operator-enabled services that you use. With an {oke} subscription, you
receive access to the Kubernetes namespace, the OpenShift `Project` API object,
and cluster-level Prometheus monitoring metrics and events.

=== Maintained and curated content
With an {oke} subscription, you receive access to the {product-title}
content from the Red Hat Container Catalog and Red Hat Connect ISV marketplace.
You can access all maintained and curated content that the {product-title}
eco-system offers.

=== OpenShift Data Foundation compatible
{oke} is compatible and supported with your purchase of {rh-storage}.

=== Red Hat Middleware compatible
{oke} is compatible and supported with individual Red Hat Middleware product solutions.
Red Hat Middleware Bundles that include OpenShift embedded in them only contain
{product-title}.

=== OpenShift Serverless
{oke} does not include OpenShift Serverless support. Please use {product-title}
for this support.

=== Quay Integration compatible
{oke} is compatible and supported with a Red Hat Quay purchase.

=== OpenShift Virtualization
{oke} includes support for the Red Hat product offerings derived from
the kubevirt.io open source project.

=== Advanced cluster management
{oke} is compatible with your additional purchase of Red Hat Advanced Cluster
Manager for Kubernetes. An {oke} subscription does not offer a cluster-wide log
aggregation solution or support Elasticsearch, Fluentd, or Kibana based logging solutions.
Similarly, the chargeback features found in {product-title} or the cloud.redhat.com
Cost Management SaaS service are not supported with {oke}. Red Hat Service Mesh
capabilities derived from the open source istio.io and kiali.io projects that
offer OpenTracing observability for containerized services on {product-title} are
not supported in {oke}.

=== Advanced networking
The standard networking solutions in {product-title} are supported with an
{oke} subscription. {product-title}’s Kubernetes CNI plug-in for automation of
multi-tenant network segmentation between {product-title} projects is
entitled for use with {oke}. {oke} offers all the granular control of the
source IP addresses that are used by application services on the cluster.
Those egress IP address controls are entitled for use with {oke}.
{product-title} offers ingress routing to on cluster services that use
non-standard ports when no public cloud provider is in use via the VIP pods
found in {product-title}. That ingress solution is supported in {oke}.
{oke} users are supported for the Kubernetes ingress control object, which
offers integrations with public cloud providers. Red Hat Service Mesh, which is
derived from the istio.io open source project, is not supported in {oke}. Also,
the Kourier ingress controller found in OpenShift Serverless is not supported
on {oke}.

=== Developer experience
With {oke}, the following capabilities are not supported:

* The CodeReady developer experience utilities and tools, such as CodeReady Workspaces.
* {product-title}’s pipeline feature that integrates a streamlined,
Kubernetes-enabled Jenkins and Tekton experience in the user’s project space.
* The {product-title}’s source-to-image feature, which allows you to easily
deploy source code, dockerfiles, or container images across the cluster.
* Build strategies, builder pods, or Tekton for end user container
deployments.
* The `odo` developer command line.
* The developer persona in the {product-title} web console.

== Subscription Limitations

{oke} is a subscription offering that provides {product-title} with a limited set
of supported features at a lower list price. {oke} and {product-title} are the
same product and, therefore, all software and features are delivered in both.
There is only one download, {product-title}. {oke} uses the {product-title}
documentation and support services and bug errata for this reason.
