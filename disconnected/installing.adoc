You can install an {product-title} cluster in a disconnected environment, choosing the installation method and infrastructure that best suits your requirements.
This includes installing {product-title} on either on-premise hardware or on a cloud hosting service such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The following sections outline all of the supported methods for installing a cluster in a disconnected environment.

[NOTE]
====
In order to learn about other requirements for installing a cluster using a particular method, be sure to review other content in the procedure's respective section of the documentation.

For example, if you plan to install a cluster on {aws-short} with installer-provisioned infrastructure, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[Configuring an AWS account] and xref:../installing/installing_aws/ipi/ipi-aws-preparing-to-install.adoc#ipi-aws-preparing-to-install[Preparing to install a cluster on {aws-short}]
