A disconnected environment is one in which your cluster nodes cannot access the internet or where you want to manage update recommendations and release images locally for policy or performance purposes.
This section covers mirroring {product-title} images, managing an OpenShift Update Service, and performing cluster updates in a disconnected environment.

== Mirroring {product-title} images

The following page has instructions for mirroring images onto a repository in your disconnected cluster:
