There might be some scenarios where you need to convert your {product-title} cluster from a connected cluster to a disconnected cluster.

A disconnected cluster, also known as a restricted cluster, does not have an active connection to the internet. As such, you must mirror the contents of your registries and installation media. You can create this mirror registry on a host that can access both the internet and your closed network, or copy images to a device that you can move across network boundaries.

This topic describes the general process for converting an existing, connected cluster into a disconnected cluster.

== Prerequisites

* The `oc` client is installed.

* A running cluster.

* An installed mirror registry, which is a container image registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2] in the location that will host the {product-title} cluster, such as one of the following registries:

If you have a subscription to Red{nbsp}Hat Quay, see the documentation on deploying Red{nbsp}Hat Quay link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploy_red_hat_quay_for_proof-of-concept_non-production_purposes/[for proof-of-concept purposes] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index[by using the Quay Operator].

* The mirror repository must be configured to share images. For example, a Red Hat Quay repository requires link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/index#user-org-intro_use-quay[Organizations] in order to share images.

* Access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.

[NOTE]
====
The Insights Operator is degraded when the cluster loses its Internet connection. You can avoid this problem by temporarily xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/opting-out-of-remote-health-reporting.adoc[disabling the Insights Operator] until you can restore it.
