toc::[]

You can run your cluster in a disconnected environment if you install the cluster from a mirrored set of {product-title} container images in a private registry. This registry must be running whenever your cluster is running.

You can use oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror images to a mirror registry in your fully or partially disconnected environments. To download the required images from the official Red{nbsp}Hat registries, you must run oc-mirror plugin v2 from a system with internet connectivity.

== Prerequisites

* You must have a container image registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2[Docker V2-2] in the location that hosts the {product-title} cluster, such as {quay}.
+
[NOTE]
====
* If you use {quay}, use version 3.6 or later with the oc-mirror plugin. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index[Deploying the Red{nbsp}Hat Quay Operator on {product-title} (Red{nbsp}Hat Quay documentation)]. If you need additional assistance selecting and installing a registry, contact your sales representative or Red{nbsp}Hat Support.

* If you do not have an existing solution for a container image registry, {product-title} subscribers receive a mirror registry for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift. This mirror registry is included with your subscription and serves as a small-scale container registry. You can use this registry to mirror the necessary container images of {product-title} for disconnected installations.
====

* Every machine in the provisioned clusters must have access to the mirror registry. If the registry is unreachable, tasks like installation, updating, or routine operations such as workload relocation, might fail. Mirror registries must be operated in a highly available manner, ensuring their availability aligns with the production availability of your {product-title} clusters.

== Mirroring an image set to a mirror registry

Mirroring an image set to a mirror registry ensures that the required images are available in a secure and controlled environment, facilitating smoother deployments, updates, and maintenance tasks.
