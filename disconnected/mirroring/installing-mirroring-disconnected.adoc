Running your cluster in a restricted network without direct internet connectivity is possible by installing the cluster from a mirrored set of {product-title} container images in a private registry. This registry must be running at all times as long as the cluster is running. See the xref:../../disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#prerequisites_installing-mirroring-disconnected[Prerequisites] section for more information.

You can use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin to mirror images to a mirror registry in your fully or partially disconnected environments. You must run oc-mirror from a system with internet connectivity in order to download the required images from the official Red Hat registries.

== Prerequisites

* You must have a container image registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2[Docker v2-2] in the location that will host the {product-title} cluster, such as Red Hat Quay.

[NOTE]
====
If you use Red Hat Quay, you must use version 3.6 or later with the oc-mirror plugin. If you have an entitlement to Red Hat Quay, see the documentation on deploying Red Hat Quay link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploy_red_hat_quay_for_proof-of-concept_non-production_purposes/[for proof-of-concept purposes] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index[by using the Red Hat Quay Operator]. If you need additional assistance selecting and installing a registry, contact your sales representative or Red Hat Support.
====
+
If you do not already have an existing solution for a container image registry, subscribers of {product-title} are provided a xref:../../disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-creating-registry.adoc#installing-mirroring-creating-registry[mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift]. The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is included with your subscription and is a small-scale container registry that can be used to mirror the required container images of {product-title} in disconnected installations.

== Preparing your mirror hosts

Before you can use the oc-mirror plugin to mirror images, you must install the plugin and create a container image registry credentials file to allow the mirroring from Red Hat to your mirror.

== Mirroring an image set to a mirror registry

You can use the oc-mirror CLI plugin to mirror images to a mirror registry in a xref:../../disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#mirroring-image-set-partial[partially disconnected environment] or in a xref:../../disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#mirroring-image-set-full[fully disconnected environment].

These procedures assume that you already have your mirror registry set up.

[id="mirroring-image-set-partial"]
=== Mirroring an image set in a partially disconnected environment

In a partially disconnected environment, you can mirror an image set directly to the target mirror registry.

// Mirroring from mirror to mirror
include::modules/oc-mirror-mirror-to-mirror.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

[id="mirroring-image-set-full"]
=== Mirroring an image set in a fully disconnected environment

To mirror an image set in a fully disconnected environment, you must first xref:../../disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#oc-mirror-mirror-to-disk_installing-mirroring-disconnected[mirror the image set to disk], then xref:../../disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#oc-mirror-disk-to-mirror_installing-mirroring-disconnected[mirror the image set file on disk to a mirror].
