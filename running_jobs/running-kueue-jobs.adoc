= Running jobs with quota limits

toc::[]

You can run Kubernetes jobs with {product-title} enabled to manage resource allocation within defined quota limits. This can help to ensure predictable resource availability, cluster stability, and optimized performance.

You can create jobs to be admitted to {product-title} by using the standard link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/[Kubernetes `Job` API].

You can create any supported `Job` object, and then add the `kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name` label to that object to connect it to a `LocalQueue` resource.
