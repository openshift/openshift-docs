You can use Operators with {microshift-short} to create applications that monitor the running services in your cluster. Operators can manage applications and their resources, such as deploying a database or message bus. As customized software running inside your cluster, Operators can be used to implement and automate common operations.

Operators offer a more localized configuration experience and integrate with Kubernetes APIs and CLI tools such as `kubectl` and `oc`. Operators are designed specifically for your applications. Operators enable you to configure components instead of modifying a global configuration file.

{microshift-short} applications are generally expected to be deployed in static environments. However, Operators are available if helpful in your use case. To determine the compatibility of an Operator with {microshift-short}, check the Operator documentation.

== How to use Operators with {microshift-short} clusters

There are two ways to use Operators for your {microshift-short} clusters:

[id="microshift-operators-paths-manifests_{context}"]
=== Manifests for Operators
Operators can be installed and managed directly by using manifests. You can use the `kustomize` configuration management tool with {microshift-short} to deploy an application. Use the same steps to install Operators with manifests.

* See xref:../../microshift_running_apps/microshift-applications.adoc#microshift-manifests-overview_applications-microshift[Using Kustomize manifests to deploy applications] and xref:../../microshift_running_apps/microshift-applications.adoc#microshift-applying-manifests-example_applications-microshift[Using manifests example] for details.

[id="microshift-operators-paths-olm_{context}"]
=== Operator Lifecycle Manager for Operators
You can also install add-on Operators to a {microshift-short} cluster using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). OLM can be used to manage both custom Operators and Operators that are widely available. Building catalogs is required to use OLM with {microshift-short}.

* For details, see xref:../../microshift_running_apps/microshift_operators/microshift-operators-olm.adoc#microshift-operators-olm[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager with {microshift-short}].
