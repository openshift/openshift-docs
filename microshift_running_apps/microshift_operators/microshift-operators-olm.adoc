= Using Operator Lifecycle Manager with {microshift-short}
include::_attributes/attributes-microshift.adoc[]
:context: microshift-operators-olm

toc::[]

The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) package manager is used in {microshift-short} for installing and running optional link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html/architecture/control-plane#olm-operators_control-plane[add-on Operators].

== Considerations for using OLM with {microshift-short}

* Cluster Operators as applied in {ocp} are not used in {microshift-short}.
* You must create your own catalogs for the add-on Operators you want to use with your applications. Catalogs are not provided by default.
** Each catalog must have an accessible `CatalogSource` added to a cluster, so that the OLM catalog Operator can use the catalog for content.
* You must use the CLI to conduct OLM activities with {microshift-short}. The console and OperatorHub GUIs are not available.
** Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html/cli_tools/opm-cli#cli-opm-install[Operator Package Manager `opm` CLI] with network-connected clusters, or for building catalogs for custom Operators that use an internal registry.
** To mirror your catalogs and Operators for disconnected or offline clusters, install link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-version}/installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.html#installation-oc-mirror-installing-plugin_installing-mirroring-disconnected[the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI plugin].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before using an Operator, verify with the provider that the Operator is supported on {product-title}.

== Determining your OLM installation type
You can install the OLM package manager for use with {microshift-short} 4.15 or newer versions. There are different ways to install OLM for {microshift-short} clusters, depending on your use case.

* You can install the `microshift-olm` RPM at the same time you install the {microshift-short} RPM on {op-system-base-full}.
* You can install the `microshift-olm` on an existing {microshift-short} {product-version}. Restart the {microshift-short} service after installing OLM for the changes to apply.
See xref:../../microshift_install_rpm/microshift-install-rpm.adoc#microshift-install-rpms-olm_microshift-install-rpm[Installing the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) from an RPM package].
* You can embed OLM in a {op-system-ostree-first} image. See xref:../../microshift_install_rpm_ostree/microshift-embed-in-rpm-ostree.adoc#microshift-adding-olm-to-blueprint_microshift-embed-in-rpm-ostree[Adding the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) service to a blueprint].
