toc::[]

You can create custom catalogs with widely available Operators and mirror them by using the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin.

== Using Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs and mirror registries
You can filter and prune catalogs to get specific Operators and mirror them by using the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin. You can also use Operators in disconnected settings or embedded in {op-system-ostree-first} images. To read more details about how to configure your systems for mirroring, use the links in the following "Additional resources" section. If you are ready to deploy Operators from Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs, mirror them, or to embed them in {op-system-ostree} images, start with the following section, "Inspecting catalog contents by using the oc-mirror plugin."
