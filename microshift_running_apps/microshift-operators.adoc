You can use Operators with {microshift-short} to create applications that monitor the running services in your cluster. Operators can manage applications and their resources, such as deploying a database or message bus. As customized software running inside your cluster, Operators can be used to implement and automate common operations.

Operators offer a more localized configuration experience and integrate with Kubernetes APIs and CLI tools such as `kubectl` and `oc`. Operators are designed specifically for your applications. Operators enable you to configure components instead of modifying a global configuration file.

{microshift-short} applications are generally expected to be deployed in static environments. However, Operators are available if helpful in your use case. To determine an Operator's compatibility with {microshift-short}, check the Operator's documentation.

== How to install Operators in {microshift-short}

To minimize the footprint of {microshift-short}, Operators are installed directly with manifests instead of using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). You can use the `kustomize` configuration management tool with {microshift-short} to deploy an application. Use the same steps to install Operators with manifests. Read xref:../microshift_running_apps/microshift-applications.adoc#microshift-manifests-overview_applications-microshift[Using Kustomize manifests to deploy applications] for more information about manifests.
