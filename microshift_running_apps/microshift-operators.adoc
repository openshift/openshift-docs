You can use Operators with {product-title} to create applications that monitor the running services in your cluster. Operators can manage applications and their resources, such as deploying a database or message bus. As customized software running inside your cluster, Operators can be used to implement and automate common operations.

Operators offer a more localized configuration experience and integrate with Kubernetes APIs and CLI tools such as `kubectl` and `oc`. Operators are designed specifically for your applications. Operators enable you to configure components instead of modifying a global configuration file.

{product-title} applications are generally expected to be deployed in static environments. However, Operators are available if helpful in your use case. To determine an Operator's compatibility with {product-title}, check the Operator's documentation.

To minimize the footprint of {product-title}, Operators are installed directly with manifests instead of using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). The following examples provide instructions on how you can use the `kustomize` configuration management tool with {product-title} to deploy an application. Use the same steps to install Operators with manifests.
