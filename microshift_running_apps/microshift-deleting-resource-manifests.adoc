toc::[]

{microshift-short} supports the deletion of manifest resources in the following situations:

* Manifest removal: Manifests can be removed when you need to completely remove a resource from the cluster.
* Manifest upgrade: During an application upgrade, some resources might need to be removed while others are retained to preserve data.

When creating new manifests, you can use manifest resource deletion to remove or update old objects, ensuring there are no conflicts or issues.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Manifest files placed in the `delete` subdirectories are not automatically removed and require manual deletion. Only the resources listed in the manifest files placed in the delete subdirectories are deleted.
