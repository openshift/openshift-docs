toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
The `buildah-ns` Tekton task builds Open Container Initiative (OCI) images without requiring a container runtime daemon, such as the Docker daemon. The task uses `buildah` and applies user namespace isolation to provide enhanced security.

After a successful build, the task produces the following results:

* The fully qualified image name
* The SHA256 digest of the image

The `buildah-ns` task is functionally identical to the standard `buildah` Tekton task, but applies additional security mechanisms to improve container isolation at the kernel level.
