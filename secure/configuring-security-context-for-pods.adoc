toc::[]

The default service account for pods that {pipelines-shortname} starts is `pipeline`. The security context constraint (SCC) associated with the `pipeline` service account is `pipelines-scc`. The `pipelines-scc` SCC is based the `anyuid` SCC, with minor differences as defined in the following YAML specification:

.Example `pipelines-scc.yaml` snippet
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
# ...
allowedCapabilities:
  - SETFCAP
# ...
fsGroup:
  type: MustRunAs
# ...
----

In addition, the `Buildah` task, shipped as part of {pipelines-shortname}, uses `vfs` as the default storage driver.

You can configure the security context for pods that {pipelines-shortname} creates for pipeline runs and task runs. You can make the following changes:

* Change the default and maximum SCC for all pods
* Change the default SCC for pods created for pipeline runs and task runs in a particular namespace
* Configure a particular pipeline run or task run to use a custom SCC and service account

[NOTE]
====
The simplest way to run `buildah` that ensures all images can build is to run it as root in a pod with the `privileged` SCC. For instructions about running `buildah` with more restrictive security settings, see xref:../secure/unprivileged-building-of-container-images-using-buildah.adoc#unprivileged-building-of-container-images-using-buildah[Building of container images using Buildah as a non-root user].
