== Overview
The Kubernetes pod scheduler is responsible for scheduling new pods onto nodes within the cluster. It reads data from the pod and tries to find a node that is a good fit based on configured policies. It is completely independent and exists as a standalone/pluggable solution. It does not modify the pod and just creates a binding for the pod that ties the pod to the particular node. 

== Generic Scheduler
The existing generic scheduler is the default platform-provided scheduler "engine" that selects a node to host the pod in a 3-step operation: 

=== Step 1: Filter the nodes 
The available nodes are filtered based on the constraints or requirements specified. This is done by running each of the nodes through the list of filter functions called 'predicates'.

=== Step 2: Prioritize the filtered list of nodes
This is achieved by passing each node through a series of 'priority' functions that assign it a score between 0 - 10, with 0 indicating a bad fit and 10 indicating a good fit to host the pod. The scheduler configuration can also take in a simple "weight" (positive numeric value) for each priority function. The node score provided by each priority function is multiplied by the "weight" (default weight is 1) and then combined by just adding the scores for each node provided by all the priority functions. This weight attribute can be used by administrators to give higher importance to some priority functions. 

=== Step 3: Select the best fit node
The nodes are sorted based on their scores and the node with the highest score is selected to host the pod. If multiple nodes have the same high score, then one of them is selected at random. 


== Scheduler Policy
The selection of the predicate and priority functions defines the policy for the scheduler.  Several predicate and priority functions are provided within Kubernetes.  There are two ways to define the scheduler policy.  Administrators can either specify an algorithm provider or they can provide a JSON configuration file that specifies the predicates and priority functions to configure the scheduler.  Both the algorithm provider and the configuration file can be specified using the command line for the scheduler executable.  


=== Algorithm Providers
'Providers' can be created to specify a pre-determined combination of the predicates and priority functions along with their weights. A few providers, including a default provider, have been created for providing the scheduler configuration.  Creating a provider is not something that a user/administrator can do.  However, administrators can select a particular algorithm provider for their scheduler configuration via the command line.


=== Available Predicates
A custom set of predicates can be specified to configure the scheduler.  There are several predicates provided out-of-the-box in Kubernetes.  Some of these predicates can be customized by providing certain parameters.  Multiple predicates can be combined to provide additional filtering of nodes.

==== Fixed Predicates

1. 'PodFitsPorts' deems a node to be fit for hosting a pod based on the absence of port conflicts
1. 'PodFitsResources' determines a fit baased resource availability.  The nodes can declare their resource capacities and then pods can specify what resources they require.  Fit is based on requested, rather than used resources.
1. 'NoDiskConflict' determines fit based on non-conflicting disk volumes.  It evaluates if a pod can fit due to the volumes it requests, and those that are already mounted.
1. 'MatchNodeSelector' determines fit based on node selector query that is defined in the pod.
1. 'HostName' determines fit based on the presence of the Host parameter and a string match with the name of the host

==== Configurable Predicates

1. 'ServiceAffinity' filters out nodes that do not belong to the specified topological level defined by the provided labels.  This predicate takes in a list of labels and ensures affinity within the nodes (that have the same label values) for pods belonging to the same service.  If the pod specifies a value for the labels in its NodeSelector, then the nodes matching those labels are the ones where the pod is scheduled.  If the pod does not specify the labels in its NodeSelector, then the first pod can be placed on any node based on availability and all subsequent pods of the service will be scheduled on nodes that have the same label values.
1. 'LabelsPresence' checks whether a particular node has a certain label defined or not, regardless of value


=== Available Priority Functions
A custom set of priority functionis can be specified to configure the scheduler.  There are several priority functions provided out-of-the-box in Kubernetes.  Some of these priority functions can be customized by providing certain parameters.  Multiple priority functions can be combined and weights can be given to each in order to impact the prioritization. The default weight is 1.

==== Fixed Priority Functions

1. 'LeastRequestedPriority' favors nodes with fewer requested resources.  It calculates the percentage of memory and CPU requested by pods scheduled on the node, and prioritizes nodes that have the highest available/remaining capacity.
1. 'ServiceSpreadingPriority' spreads pods by minimizing the number of pods belonging to the same service onto the same machine
1. 'EqualPriority' gives an equal weight of one to all nodes

==== Configurable Priority Functions

1. 'ServiceAntiAffinity' takes a label and ensures a good spread of the pods belonging to the same service across the group of nodes based on the label values.  It gives the same score to all nodes that have the same value for the specified label.  It gives a highter score to nodes within a group with the least concentration of pods.


== Affinity and Anti Affinity
One of the important use cases for scheduling within OpenShift is to support flexible affinity and anti-affinity policies.  Administrators can define multiple topological levels for their infrastructure (nodes).  This is done by specifying labels on nodes (eg: region = r1, zone = z1, rack = s1). These label names have no particular meaning and administrators are free to name their infrastructure levels anything (eg, city/building/room).  Also, administrators can define any number of nested levels for their infrastructure topology, with three levels being usually adequate (eg. regions --> zones --> racks).  Lastly, administrators can specify affinity and anti-affinity rules at each of these levels in any combination.
