== Overview
OpenShift builds can be triggered remotely using Webhooks. The following types of Webhooks are supported:

* https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[Github Webhooks]
* Generic Webhooks

== Displaying a build configuration's Webhook URLs

Use the `osc describe buildConfig [replaceable]#<name>#` command to display the Webhook URLs associated with a build configuration. If no Webhook URLs are displayed, it means that no Webhook trigger is defined for that build configuration.

== Using Github Webhooks

Instructions for creating a Github Webhook are https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/[here]. The payload URL is the URL returned as the Github Webhook URL by the `describe` command.

== Using Generic Webhooks

Generic Webhooks are used to trigger a build from a custom application. The Webhook endpoint expects a JSON payload with the following format:

----
{
     type: 'git',
     git: {
        uri: '<url to git repository>',
	ref: '<optional git reference>',
	commit: '<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>',
	author: {
		name: '<author name>',
		email: '<author e-mail>',
	},
	committer: {
		name: '<committer name>',
		email: '<committer e-mail>',
	},
	message: '<commit message>'
     }
}
----

In order to trigger a build, a POST request needs to be made to the Generic Webhook URL of a particular build configuration. The POST request can include the following headers:

* `User-Agent` - [required] must have a non-empty value
* `Content-Length` - [optional] If included, a Content-Type header must also be included
* `Content-Type` - [optional] If Content-Length specified, must have 'application/json' as its value
