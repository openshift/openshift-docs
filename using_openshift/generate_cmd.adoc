== Overview
generate is an experimental application generation utility for OpenShift v3. It is used to create the necessary configuration to build and deploy code from a source repository. 

== Usage Examples

Finds a git repository in the current directory and builds artifacts based on source detection
----
$ openshift ex generate
----

Finds a git repository in the specified directory and generates artifacts
----
$ openshift ex generate ./repo/dir
----

Use a remote git repository
----
$ openshift ex generate https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git
----

Use the source from the current directory, but force it to be an STI type of build with a specific
image
----
$ openshift ex generate --builder-image=openshift/ruby-20-centos7
----

== Output
The output of generate is a Kubernetes ```List``` resource in json format that contains at least the following:

* BuildConfig - a build configuration that builds the specified source repository
* ImageRepository - an image repository that points to the image built by the BuildConfig
* DeploymentConfig - a deployment config that listens to new images pushed to the image repository and deploys a pod with that image
* Service - service that exposes the first port exposed by the image from the built source.

The output of generate can be directly applied to an OpenShift server by using the create command. Following is an example flow for using generate:

----
# go to the directory that contains the application source
cd ruby-hello-world
# generate the application objects and create them on the openshift server
openshift ex generate | osc create -f -
# start a new build using the newly-created build configuration
osc start-build ruby-hello-world
----

== Source Repository
The input of generate is a source repository. This may be a local directory or a repository specified as a URL.

=== Local directory
If generate is executed with no parameters, the current working directory is used. Otherwise, the directory passed in will be used. The repository must be a git repository, however, the directory does not have to be the root of the git repository.

If generate determines that the directory is a git repository, it will determine the following using git:

* The root directory of the repository
* The remote URL of the git repository. For this, it will use the ```origin``` remote. OpenShift must be able to download the source from this URL in order to build the code. It does not use the content of the source directory directly. This has the following implications:
  ** The repository URL must be accessible from the OpenShift node executing the builds.
  ** The repository must be publicly accessible. This means that git repositories using the SSH protocol (for example: ```git@github.com:openshift/ruby-hello-world.git```) are not yet supported.
  ** Any code that is only available locally and not in the URL-accessible repository will not be picked up for the build.
* The currently checkedout branch name. It is assumed that the branch exists in the remote repository as well. If a different branch needs to be used, specify the *--ref* flag in the command line.

=== Repository URL
If a repository URL is specified, generate will use that URL to create the buildConfig. The URL may include a specific git reference to use by appending a hash with the reference name:
----
https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git#blog_part1
----

The following limitations apply to the repository URL:

* It must be publicly accessible and directly accessible by the OpenShift server node. This means that git repositories using the SSH protocol (for example: ```git@github.com:openshift/ruby-hello-world.git```) are not yet supported.
* If specified, the branch must exist in the remote repository
* The repository must be accessible to the machine running generate. The reason is that generate will download the source in a temporary directory and perform code detection on it.

== Code Detection
generate will attempt to detect the type of build to perform based on certain files present in the source code repository. It searches for files in the following order:

* Dockerfile - All files named Dockerfile are searched in the repository. If multiple files are found, generate will display a message saying that you must select one with the *--context* flag. If only one Dockerfile is found, then generate will assume this is a docker build. 
** Note: If Dockerfile(s) are present, but an  STI type of build is desired, the *--builder-image* flag must be specified.
* STI source files - In the root of the repository, the following files are searched to determine which STI builder to use:
  ** Gemfile, Rakefile, config.ru - **openshift/ruby-20-centos7**
  ** pom.xml - **openshift/wildfly-8-centos**
  ** config.json, package.json - **openshift/nodejs-0-10-centos**
  

Currently only the above builders are supported. However, the *--builder-image* flag can be used to specify an arbitrary builder image to use. 


== Exposed Ports and Services
generate will construct an output pod template that exposes the first detected port: 

* For Docker builds, ports are detected by looking for EXPOSE directives in the Dockerfile.
* For STI builds, ports are detected by looking at exposed ports in the builder image metadata. 

If the exposed port needs to be overriden, the *-p* flag can be used in the command line.

A service definition will be generated for the exposed port. In the service definition, both the container port and service port are set to be the same port.
