== Sending Logs to an External Elasticsearch Instance

Fluentd sends logs to the value of the `ES_HOST`, `ES_PORT`, `OPS_HOST`,
and `OPS_PORT` environment variables of the Elasticsearch deployment
configuration. The application logs are directed to the `ES_HOST` destination,
and operations logs to `OPS_HOST`.

[NOTE]
====
Sending logs directly to an AWS Elasticsearch instance is not supported. Use
xref:fluentd-external-log-aggregator[Fluentd Secure Forward] to direct logs to
an instance of Fluentd that you control and that is configured with the
`fluent-plugin-aws-elasticsearch-service` plug-in.
====

To direct logs to a specific Elasticsearch instance, edit the deployment
configuration and replace the value of the above variables with the desired
instance:

----
$ oc edit dc/<deployment_configuration>
----

For an external Elasticsearch instance to contain both application and
operations logs, you can set `ES_HOST` and `OPS_HOST` to the same destination,
while ensuring that `ES_PORT` and `OPS_PORT` also have the same value.

If your externally hosted Elasticsearch instance does not use TLS, update the
`_CLIENT_CERT`, `_CLIENT_KEY`, and `_CA` variables to be empty. If it does
use TLS, but not mutual TLS, update the `_CLIENT_CERT` and `_CLIENT_KEY`
variables to be empty and patch or recreate the *logging-fluentd* secret with
the appropriate `_CA` value for communicating with your Elasticsearch instance.
If it uses Mutual TLS as the provided Elasticsearch instance does, patch or
recreate the *logging-fluentd* secret with your client key, client cert, and CA.


[NOTE]
====
If you are not using the provided Kibana and Elasticsearch images, you will not
have the same multi-tenant capabilities and your data will not be restricted by
user access to a particular project.

== Sending Logs to an External Syslog Server

Use the `fluent-plugin-remote-syslog` plug-in on the host to send logs to an
external syslog server.

Set environment variables in the `logging-fluentd` or `logging-mux` deployment
configurations:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: REMOTE_SYSLOG_HOST <1>
  value: host1
- name: REMOTE_SYSLOG_HOST_BACKUP
  value: host2
- name: REMOTE_SYSLOG_PORT_BACKUP
  value: 5555
----
<1> The desired remote syslog host. Required for each host.

This will build two destinations. The syslog server on `host1` will be
receiving messages on the default port of `514`, while `host2` will be receiving
the same messages on port `5555`.

Alternatively, you can configure your own custom *_fluent.conf_* in the
`logging-fluentd` or `logging-mux` ConfigMaps.

**Fluentd Environment Variables**

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`USE_REMOTE_SYSLOG`
|Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` to enable use of the
`fluent-plugin-remote-syslog` gem

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_HOST`
|(Required) Hostname or IP address of the remote syslog server.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_PORT`
|Port number to connect on. Defaults to `514`.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_SEVERITY`
|Set the syslog severity level. Defaults to `debug`.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_FACILITY`
|Set the syslog facility. Defaults to `local0`.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_USE_RECORD`
|Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` to use the record's severity and facility fields to set on the syslog message.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_REMOVE_TAG_PREFIX`
|Removes the prefix from the tag, defaults to `''` (empty).

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_TAG_KEY`
|If specified, uses this field as the key to look on the record, to set the tag on the syslog message.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_PAYLOAD_KEY`
|If specified, uses this field as the key to look on the record, to set the payload on the syslog message.

[WARNING]
====
This implementation is insecure, and should only be used in environments
where you can guarantee no snooping on the connection.
