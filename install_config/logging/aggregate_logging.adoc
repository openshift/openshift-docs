As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can deploy the EFK stack to
aggregate logs for a range of {product-title} services. Application developers
can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access. The EFK stack
aggregates logs from hosts and applications, whether coming from multiple
containers or even deleted pods.

The EFK stack is a modified version of the
https://www.elastic.co/videos/introduction-to-the-elk-stack[ELK stack] and is
comprised of:

* https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch (ES)]: An object store where all logs are stored.
* http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd]: Gathers logs from nodes and feeds them to Elasticsearch.
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana]: A web UI for Elasticsearch.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/about.html[Curator]: Removes old logs from Elasticsearch.
endif::openshift-origin[]

Once deployed in a cluster, the stack aggregates logs from all nodes and
projects into Elasticsearch, and provides a Kibana UI to view any logs. Cluster
administrators can view all logs, but application developers can only view logs
for projects they have permission to view. The stack components communicate
securely.

[NOTE]
====
xref:../..install/host_preparation.adoc#managing-docker-container-logs[Managing
Docker Container Logs] discusses the use of `json-file` logging driver options
to manage container logs and prevent filling node disks.
