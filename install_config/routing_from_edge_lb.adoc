== Overview
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[Pods] inside of
an {product-title} cluster are only reachable via their IP addresses on the
cluster network. An edge load balancer can be used to accept traffic from
outside networks and proxy the traffic to pods inside the {product-title}
cluster. In cases where the load balancer is not part of the cluster network,
routing becomes a hurdle as the internal cluster network is not accessible to
the edge load balancer.

To solve this problem where the {product-title} cluster is using
xref:../architecture/networking/network_plugins.adoc#openshift-sdn[{product-title}
SDN] as the cluster networking solution, there are two ways to achieve network
access to the pods.

== Including the Load Balancer in the SDN [[including-lb-in-sdn]]
If possible, run an {product-title} node instance on the load balancer itself that
uses OpenShift SDN as the networking plug-in. This way, the edge machine gets
its own Open vSwitch bridge that the SDN automatically configures to provide
access to the pods and nodes that reside in the cluster. The _routing table_ is
dynamically configured by the SDN as pods are created and deleted, and thus the
routing software is able to reach the pods.

Mark the load balancer machine as an
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[unschedulable
node] so that no pods end up on the load balancer itself:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc adm manage-node <load_balancer_hostname> --schedulable=false
----

If the load balancer comes packaged as a container, then it is even easier to
integrate with {product-title}: Simply run the load balancer as a pod with the
host port exposed. The pre-packaged
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#routers[HAProxy router] in
{product-title} runs in precisely this fashion.

[[establishing-a-tunnel-using-a-ramp-node]]
== Establishing a Tunnel Using a Ramp Node
In some cases, the previous solution is not possible. For example, an *F5
BIG-IP®* host cannot run an {product-title} node instance or the {product-title}
SDN because *F5®* uses a custom, incompatible Linux kernel and distribution.

Instead, to enable *F5 BIG-IP®* to reach pods, you can choose an existing node
within the cluster network as a _ramp node_ and establish a tunnel between the
*F5 BIG-IP®* host and the designated ramp node. Because it is otherwise an
ordinary {product-title} node, the ramp node has the necessary configuration to
route traffic to any pod on any node in the cluster network.  The ramp node thus
assumes the role of a gateway through which the *F5 BIG-IP®* host has access to
the entire cluster network.

Following is an example of establishing an *ipip* tunnel between an *F5 BIG-IP®*
host and a designated ramp node.

**On the F5 BIG-IP® host:**

. Set the following variables:
+
====
----
# F5_IP=10.3.89.66 <1>
# RAMP_IP=10.3.89.89 <1>
# TUNNEL_IP1=10.3.91.216 <2>
# CLUSTER_NETWORK=10.128.0.0/14 <3>
----
<1> The `*F5_IP*` and `*RAMP_IP*` variables refer to the *F5 BIG-IP®* host's and
the ramp node's IP addresses, respectively, on a shared, internal network.
<2> An arbitrary, non-conflicting IP address for the *F5®* host's end of the
*ipip* tunnel.
<3> The overlay network CIDR that the OpenShift SDN uses to assign addresses to
pods.
====

. Delete any old route, self, tunnel and SNAT pool:
+
====
----
# tmsh delete net route $CLUSTER_NETWORK || true
# tmsh delete net self SDN || true
# tmsh delete net tunnels tunnel SDN || true
# tmsh delete ltm snatpool SDN_snatpool || true
----
====

. Create the new tunnel, self, route and SNAT pool and use the SNAT pool
  in the virtual servers:
+
====
[options="nowrap"]
----
# tmsh create net tunnels tunnel SDN \
    \{ description "OpenShift SDN" local-address \
    $F5_IP profile ipip remote-address $RAMP_IP \}
# tmsh create net self SDN \{ address \
    ${TUNNEL_IP1}/24 allow-service all vlan SDN \}
# tmsh create net route $CLUSTER_NETWORK interface SDN
# tmsh create ltm snatpool SDN_snatpool members add { $TUNNEL_IP1 }
# tmsh modify ltm virtual  ose-vserver source-address-translation { type snat pool SDN_snatpool }
# tmsh modify ltm virtual  https-ose-vserver source-address-translation { type snat pool SDN_snatpool }
----
====

**On the ramp node:**

. Set the following variables:
+
====
----
# F5_IP=10.3.89.66
# TUNNEL_IP1=10.3.91.216
# TUNNEL_IP2=10.3.91.217 <1>
# CLUSTER_NETWORK=10.128.0.0/1 <2>
----
<1> A second, arbitrary IP address for the ramp node's end of the *ipip*
tunnel.
<2> The overlay network CIDR that the OpenShift SDN uses to assign
    addresses to pods.
====

. Delete any old tunnel:
+
====
----
# ip tunnel del tun1 || true
----
====

. Create the *ipip* tunnel on the ramp node, using a suitable L2-connected
interface (e.g., *eth0*):
+
====
[options="nowrap"]
----
# ip tunnel add tun1 mode ipip \
    remote $F5_IP dev eth0
# ip addr add $TUNNEL_IP2 dev tun1
# ip link set tun1 up
# ip route add $TUNNEL_IP1 dev tun1
# ping -c 5 $TUNNEL_IP1
----
====

. SNAT the tunnel IP with an unused IP from the SDN subnet:
+
====
[options="nowrap"]
----
# source /run/openshift-sdn/config.env
# tap1=$(ip -o -4 addr list tun0 | awk '{print $4}' | cut -d/ -f1 | head -n 1)
# subaddr=$(echo ${OPENSHIFT_SDN_TAP1_ADDR:-"$tap1"} | cut -d "." -f 1,2,3)
# export RAMP_SDN_IP=${subaddr}.254
----
====

. Assign this `*RAMP_SDN_IP*` as an additional address to *tun0* (the local SDN's
gateway):
+
====
----
# ip addr add ${RAMP_SDN_IP} dev tun0
----
====

. Modify the OVS rules for SNAT:
+
====
[options="nowrap"]
----
# ipflowopts="cookie=0x999,ip"
# arpflowopts="cookie=0x999, table=0, arp"
#
# ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 add-flow br0 \
    "${ipflowopts},nw_src=${TUNNEL_IP1},actions=mod_nw_src:${RAMP_SDN_IP},resubmit(,0)"
# ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 add-flow br0 \
    "${ipflowopts},nw_dst=${RAMP_SDN_IP},actions=mod_nw_dst:${TUNNEL_IP1},resubmit(,0)"
# ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 add-flow br0 \
    "${arpflowopts}, arp_tpa=${RAMP_SDN_IP}, actions=output:2"
# ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 add-flow br0 \
    "${arpflowopts}, priority=200, in_port=2, arp_spa=${RAMP_SDN_IP}, arp_tpa=${CLUSTER_NETWORK}, actions=goto_table:30"
# ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 add-flow br0 \
    "arp, table=5, priority=300, arp_tpa=${RAMP_SDN_IP}, actions=output:2"
# ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 add-flow br0 \
    "ip,table=5,priority=300,nw_dst=${RAMP_SDN_IP},actions=output:2"
# ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 add-flow br0 "${ipflowopts},nw_dst=${TUNNEL_IP1},actions=output:2"

. Optionally, if you do not plan on configuring the ramp node to be
highly available, mark the ramp node as unschedulable. Skip this step if you do
plan to follow the next section and plan on creating a highly available ramp
node.

=== Configuring a Highly Available Ramp Node
You can use {product-title}'s *ipfailover* feature, which uses *keepalived*
internally, to make the ramp node highly available from *F5 BIG-IP®*'s point of
view. To do so, first bring up two nodes, for example called *ramp-node-1* and
*ramp-node-2*, on the same L2 subnet.

Then, choose some unassigned IP address from within the same subnet to use for
your virtual IP, or _VIP_. This will be set as the `*RAMP_IP*` variable with
which you will configure your tunnel on *F5 BIG-IP®*.

For example, suppose you are using the *10.20.30.0/24* subnet for your ramp
nodes, and you have assigned *10.20.30.2* to *ramp-node-1* and *10.20.30.3* to
*ramp-node-2*. For your VIP, choose some unassigned address from the same
*10.20.30.0/24* subnet, for example *10.20.30.4*. Then, to configure
*ipfailover*, mark both nodes with a label, such as *f5rampnode*:

====
----
$ oc label node ramp-node-1 f5rampnode=true
$ oc label node ramp-node-2 f5rampnode=true
----
====

Similar to instructions from the
xref:../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#ip-failover[*ipfailover*
documentation], you must now create a service account and add it to the
*privileged* SCC. First, create the *f5ipfailover* service account:

====
----
$ oc create serviceaccount f5ipfailover -n default
----
====

Next, you can add the *f5ipfailover* service to the *privileged* SCC.
To add the *f5ipfailover* in the *default* namespace to the *privileged* SCC, run:

====
----
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:default:f5ipfailover
----
====

Finally, configure *ipfailover* using your chosen VIP (the `*RAMP_IP*` variable)
and the *f5ipfailover* service account, assigning the VIP to your two nodes using
the *f5rampnode* label you set earlier:

====
----
# RAMP_IP=10.20.30.4
# IFNAME=eth0 <1>
# oc adm ipfailover <name-tag> \
    --virtual-ips=$RAMP_IP \
    --interface=$IFNAME \
    --watch-port=0 \
    --replicas=2 \
    --service-account=f5ipfailover  \
    --selector='f5rampnode=true'
----
<1> The interface where `*RAMP_IP*` should be configured.
====

With the above setup, the VIP (the `*RAMP_IP*` variable) is automatically
re-assigned when the ramp node host that currently has it assigned fails.
