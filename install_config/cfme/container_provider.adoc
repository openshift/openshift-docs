[[cfme-container-provider-single]]
== Adding a Single Container Provider

After deploying {mgmt-app} on {product-title} as described in
xref:installing.adoc#install-config-cfme-installing[Running the Installer],
there are two methods for enabling container provider integration. You can
manually add {product-title} as a container provider, or you can try the
playbooks included with this role.

[[cfme-container-provider-single-manually]]
=== Adding Manually

See the following {mgmt-app} documentation for steps on manually adding your
{product-title} cluster as a container provider:

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
- link:http://manageiq.org/docs/reference/latest/doc-Managing_Providers/miq/#containers-providers[Container Providers]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
- link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.5/html/integration_with_openshift_container_platform/[Integration with OpenShift Container Platform]
endif::[]

[[cfme-container-provider-single-automatically]]
=== Adding Automatically

Automated container provider integration can be accomplished using the
playbooks included with this role.

This playbook:

. Gathers the necessary authentication secrets.
. Finds the public routes to the {mgmt-app} application and the cluster API.
. Makes a REST call to add the {product-title} cluster as a container provider.

To run the container provider playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook -v [-i /path/to/inventory] \
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    playbooks/openshift-management/add_container_provider.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-management/add_container_provider.yml
endif::[]
----

[[cfme-container-provider-multiple]]
== Multiple Container Providers

As well as providing playbooks to integrate your current {product-title} cluster
into your {mgmt-app} deployment, this role includes a script which allows you
to add multiple container platforms as container providers in any arbitrary
{mgmt-app} server. The container platforms can be {product-title} or
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
OpenShift Origin.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
OpenShift Container Platform.
endif::[]

Using the multiple provider script requires manual configuration and setting an
`EXTRA_VARS` parameter on the CLI when running the playbook.

[[cfme-container-provider-multiple-preparing]]
=== Preparing the Script

To prepare the multiple provider script, complete the following manual
configuration:

. Copy the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*_files/examples/container_providers.yml_*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_management/files/examples/container_providers.yml_*
endif::[]
example somewhere, such as *_/tmp/cp.yml_*. You will be modifying this file.

. If you changed your {mgmt-app} name or password, update the `hostname`,
`user`, and `password` parameters in the `management_server` key in the
*_container_providers.yml_* file that you copied.

. Fill in an entry under the `container_providers` key for each container platform
cluster you want to add as container providers.

.. The following parameters must be configured:
+
--
* `auth_key` - This is the token of a service account that has `cluster-admin` privileges.
* `hostname` - This is the host name that points to the cluster API. Each container provider must have a unique host name.
* `name` - This is the name of the cluster to be displayed in the {mgmt-app} server container providers overview page. This must be unique.
--
+
[TIP]
====
To obtain the `auth_key` bearer token from your clusters:

----
$ oc serviceaccounts get-token -n management-infra management-admin
----
====

.. The following parameters may be optionally configured:
+
--
* `port` - Update this key if your container platform cluster runs the API on a port other than `8443`.
* `endpoint` - You may enable SSL verification (`verify_ssl`) or change the validation setting to `ssl-with-validation`. Support for custom trusted CA certificates is not currently available.
--

[[cfme-container-provider-multiple-preparing-example]]
==== Example

As an example, consider the following scenario:

- You copied the *_container_providers.yml_* file to *_/tmp/cp.yml_*.
- You want to add two OpenShift Container Platform clusters.
- Your {mgmt-app} server runs on `mgmt.example.com`

For this scenario, you would customize *_/tmp/cp.yml_* as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
container_providers:
  - connection_configurations:
      - authentication: {auth_key: "<token>", authtype: bearer, type: AuthToken} <1>
        endpoint: {role: default, security_protocol: ssl-without-validation, verify_ssl: 0}
    hostname: "<provider_hostname1>"
    name: <display_name1>
    port: 8443
    type: "ManageIQ::Providers::Openshift::ContainerManager"
  - connection_configurations:
      - authentication: {auth_key: "<token>", authtype: bearer, type: AuthToken} <1>
        endpoint: {role: default, security_protocol: ssl-without-validation, verify_ssl: 0}
    hostname: "<provider_hostname2>"
    name: <display_name2>
    port: 8443
    type: "ManageIQ::Providers::Openshift::ContainerManager"
management_server:
  hostname: "<hostname>"
  user: <user_name>
  password: <password>
----
<1> Replace `<token>` with the management token for this cluster.

[[cfme-container-provider-multiple-running]]
=== Running the Playbook

To run the multiple-providers integration script, you must provide the path to
the container providers configuration file as an `EXTRA_VARS` parameter to the
`ansible-playbook` command. Use the `-e` (or `--extra-vars`) parameter to set
`container_providers_config` to the configuration file path:

----
# ansible-playbook -v [-i /path/to/inventory] \
    -e container_providers_config=/tmp/cp.yml \
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    playbooks/openshift-management/add_many_container_providers.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-management/add_many_container_providers.yml
endif::[]
----

After the playbook completes, you should find two new container providers in
your {mgmt-app} service. Navigate to the `Compute → Containers → Providers`
page to see an overview.

[[cfme-container-provider-refreshing]]
== Refreshing Providers

After adding either a single or multiple container providers, the new
provider(s) must be refreshed in {mgmt-app} to get all the latest data about
the container provider and the containers being managed. This involves
navigating to each provider in the {mgmt-app} web console and clicking a
refresh button for each.

See the following {mgmt-app} documentation for steps:

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
- link:http://manageiq.org/docs/reference/latest/doc-Managing_Providers/miq/#_refreshing_multiple_management_systems[Refreshing Providers]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
- link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/managing_providers/index#refreshing_cloud_providers[Managing Providers]
endif::[]
