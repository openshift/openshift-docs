== Introduction

The {product-title} installer includes the Ansible role *openshift-management*
and playbooks for deploying 
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Red Hat CloudForms 4.6 (CloudForms Management Engine 5.9, or CFME)
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
ManageIQ (MIQ)
endif::[]
on {product-title}.

[WARNING]
====
The current implementation is incompatible with the Technology Preview
deployment process of {mgmt-app} 4.5 as described in
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/install_config/deploying_cfme.html[{product-title} 3.6 documentation]. 
====

When deploying {mgmt-app} on {product-title}, there are two major decisions to
make:

. Do you want an external or a containerized (also referred to as _podified_)
PostgreSQL database?
. Which storage class will back your persistent volumes (PVs)?

For the first decision, you can deploy {mgmt-app} in one of two ways, depending on the location of the
PostgreSQL database to be used by {mgmt-app}:

[options="header"]
|===
|Deployment Variant |Description

|Fully containerized
|All application services and the PostgreSQL database are run as pods on
{product-title}.

|External database
|The application utilizes an externally-hosted PostgreSQL database server, while
all other services are ran as pods on {product-title}.
|===

For the second decision, the *openshift-management* role provides customization
options for overriding many default deployment parameters. This includes the
following storage class options to back your PVs:

[options="header"]
|===
|Storage Class |Description

|NFS (default)
|Local, on cluster

|NFS External
|NFS somewhere else, like a storage appliance

|Cloud Provider
|Use automatic storage provisioning from your cloud provider (GCE or AWS)

|Preconfigured (advanced) |Assumes you created everything ahead of time
|===

Topics in this guide include the requirements for running {mgmt-app} on
{product-title}, descriptions of the available configuration variables, and
instructions on running the installer either during your initial {product-title}
installation or after your cluster has been provisioned.
