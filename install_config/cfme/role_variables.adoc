== Overview

The following sections describe role variables that may be used in your
xref:../../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[Ansible inventory file], which is used to control the behavior of the {mgmt-app}
installation when xref:installing.adoc#install-config-cfme-installing[running the installer].

[[cfme-role-variables-general]]
== General Variables

[options="header",cols="1,1,1,4"]
|===
|Variable |Required |Default |Description

|`openshift_management_install_management` 
|No
|`false`
|Boolean, set to `true` to install the application.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
|`openshift_management_install_beta`
|Yes
|`false`
|CFME 4.6 is currently available (not in beta), however this variable must be set
to `true` to begin the installation. This requirement will be removed in an
upcoming release.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1557909[BZ#1557909])
endif::[]

|`openshift_management_app_template`
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
|Yes
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
|No
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
|`miq-template`
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
|`miq-template`
endif::[]
a|The deployment variant of {mgmt-app} to install.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Set `miq-template` for a containerized database or `miq-template-ext-db` for
an external database.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Currently, you must change it from the default `miq-template`, otherwise the
upstream ManageIQ application will be installed instead of {mgmt-app}. This
default will be changed to `cfme-template` in an upcoming release.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1557909[BZ#1557909]) Set
`cfme-template` for a containerized database or `cfme-template-ext-db` for an
external database.
endif::[]

|`openshift_management_project`
|No 
|`openshift-management` 
|Namespace (project) for the {mgmt-app} installation.

|`openshift_management_project_description`
|No 
|`CloudForms Management Engine`
|Namespace (project) description.

|`openshift_management_username`
|No 
|`admin` 
|Default management user name. Changing this value does not change the user name;
only change this value if you have changed the name already and are running
integration scripts (such as the script to
xref:container_provider.adoc#install-config-cfme-container-provider[add
container providers]).

|`openshift_management_password`
|No
|`smartvm`
|Default management password. Changing this value does not change the password;
only change this value if you have changed the password already and are running
integration scripts (such as the script to
xref:container_provider.adoc#install-config-cfme-container-provider[add container
providers]).
|===

[[cfme-customization-variables]]
== Customizing Template Parameters

You can use the `openshift_management_template_parameters` Ansible role variable
to specify any template parameters you want to override in the application or PV
templates.

For example, if you wanted to reduce the memory requirement of the PostgreSQL
pod, then you could set the following:

----
openshift_management_template_parameters={'POSTGRESQL_MEM_REQ': '1Gi'}
----

When the {mgmt-app} template is processed, `1Gi` will be used for the value of
the `POSTGRESQL_MEM_REQ` template parameter.

Not all template parameters are present in _both_ template variants
(containerized or external database). For example, while the podified database
template has a `POSTGRESQL_MEM_REQ` parameter, no such parameter is present in
the external db template, as there is no need for this information due to there
being no databases that require pods.

Therefore, be very careful if you are overriding template parameters. Including
parameters not defined in a template will cause errors. If you do receive an
error during the `Ensure the Management App is created` task, run the
xref:uninstalling.adoc#install-config-cfme-uninstalling[uninstall scripts] first before running the installer again.

[[cfme-role-variables-database]]
== Database Variables

[[cfme-role-variables-containerized-db]]
=== Containerized (Podified) Database

Any `POSTGRES_*` or `DATABASE_*` template parameters in the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*_cfme-template.yaml_*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*_miq-template.yaml _*
endif::[]
file may be customized through the `openshift_management_template_parameters`
hash in your inventory file..

[[cfme-role-variables-external-db]]
=== External Database

Any `POSTGRES_*` or `DATABASE_*` template parameters in the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*_cfme-template-ext-db.yaml_*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*_miq-template-ext-db.yaml _*
endif::[]
file may be customized through the `openshift_management_template_parameters`
hash in your inventory file..

External PostgreSQL databases require you to provide database connection
parameters. You must set the required connection keys in the
`openshift_management_template_parameters` parameter in your inventory. The
following keys are required:

- `DATABASE_USER`
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`
- `DATABASE_IP`
- `DATABASE_PORT` (Most PostgreSQL servers run on port `5432`)
- `DATABASE_NAME`

[NOTE]
====
Ensure your external database is running PostgreSQL 9.5 or you may not be able
to deploy the CloudForms application successfully.
====

Your inventory would contain a line similar to:

----
[OSEv3:vars]
openshift_management_app_template=cfme-template-ext-db <1>
openshift_management_template_parameters={'DATABASE_USER': 'root', 'DATABASE_PASSWORD': 'mypassword', 'DATABASE_IP': '10.10.10.10', 'DATABASE_PORT': '5432', 'DATABASE_NAME': 'cfme'}
----
<1> Set `openshift_management_app_template` parameter to `cfme-template-ext-db`.

[[cfme-role-variables-storage]]
== Storage Class Variables

[options="header"]
|===
|Variable |Required |Default |Description
|`openshift_management_storage_class` 
|No
|`nfs` 
|Storage type to use. Options are `nfs`, `nfs_external`, `preconfigured`, or
`cloudprovider`.
|`openshift_management_storage_nfs_external_hostname`
|No 
|`false` 
|If you are using an external NFS server, such as a NetApp appliance, then you
must set the host name here. Leave the value as `false` if you are not using
external NFS. Additionally, external NFS requires that you create the NFS
exports that will back the application PV and optionally the database PV.
|`openshift_management_storage_nfs_base_dir`
|No
|`/exports/`
|If you are using external NFS, then you can set the base path to the exports
location here. For local NFS, you can also change this value if you want to
change the default path used for local NFS exports.
|`openshift_management_storage_nfs_local_hostname`
|No 
|`false` 
|If you do not have an `[nfs]` group in your inventory, or want to simply
manually define the local NFS host in your cluster, set this parameter to the
host name of the preferred NFS server. The server must be a part of your
{product-title} cluster.
|===

[[cfme-storage-class-nfs]]
=== NFS (Default)

The NFS storage class is best suited for proof-of-concept and test deployments.
It is also the default storage class for deployments. No additional
configuration is required for this choice.

This storage class configures NFS on a cluster host (by default, the first master in
the inventory file) to back the required PVs. The application requires a PV,
and the database (which may be hosted externally) may require a second. PV
minimum required sizes are 5GiB for the {mgmt-app} application, and 15GiB for
the PostgreSQL database (20GiB minimum available space on a volume or partition
if used specifically for NFS purposes).

Customization is provided through the following role variables:

- `openshift_management_storage_nfs_base_dir`
- `openshift_management_storage_nfs_local_hostname`

[[cfme-storage-class-nfs-external]]
=== NFS External

External NFS leans on pre-configured NFS servers to provide exports for the
required PVs. For external NFS you must have
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
a `cfme-app` and optionally a `cfme-db` (for containerized database) exports.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
an `miq-app` and optionally an `miq-db` (for containerized database) exports.
endif::[]

Configuration is provided through the following role variables:

- `openshift_management_storage_nfs_external_hostname`
- `openshift_management_storage_nfs_base_dir`

The `openshift_management_storage_nfs_external_hostname` parameter must be set
to the host name or IP of your external NFS server.

If *_/exports_* is not the parent directory to your exports then you
must set the base directory via the
`openshift_management_storage_nfs_base_dir` parameter.

For example, if your server export is *_/exports/hosted/prod/cfme-app_*, then
you must set `openshift_management_storage_nfs_base_dir=/exports/hosted/prod`.

[[cfme-storage-class-cloud-provider]]
=== Cloud Provider

If you are using {product-title} cloud provider integration for your storage
class, {mgmt-app} can also use the cloud provider storage to back its required
PVs. For this functionality to work, you must have configured the
`openshift_cloudprovider_kind` variable (for AWS or GCE) and all associated
parameters specific to your chosen cloud provider.

When the application is created using this storage class, the required PVs are
automatically provisioned using the configured cloud provider storage
integration.

There are no additional variables to configure the behavior of this storage
class.

[[cfme-storage-class-preconfigured]]
=== Preconfigured (Advanced)

The `preconfigured` storage class implies that you know exactly what you are
doing and that all storage requirements have been taken care ahead of time.
Typically this means that you have already created the correctly sized PVs. The
installer will do nothing to modify any storage settings.

There are no additional variables to configure the behavior of this storage
class.
