[[cfme-uninstalling-running-the-playbook]]
== Running the Uninstall Playbook
To uninstall and erase a deployed {mgmt-app} installation from
{product-title}, run the following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook -v [-i /path/to/inventory] \
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    playbooks/openshift-management/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-management/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
NFS export definitions and data stored on NFS exports are not automatically
removed. You are urged to manually erase any data from old application or
database deployments before attempting to initialize a new deployment.
====

[[cfme-uninstalling-troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

Failure to erase old PostgreSQL data can result in cascading errors, causing the
*postgresql* pod to enter a `crashloopbackoff` state. This blocks the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*manageiq*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*cfme*
endif::[]
pod from ever starting. The cause of the `crashloopbackoff` is due to incorrect
file permissions on the database NFS export created during a previous
deployment.

To continue, erase all data from the PostgreSQL export and delete the pod (not
the deployer pod). For example, if you had the following pods:

----
$ oc get pods
NAME                 READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
httpd-1-cx7fk        1/1       Running            1          21h
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
manageiq-0           0/1       Running            1          21h
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
cfme-0               0/1       Running            1          21h
endif::[]
memcached-1-vkc7p    1/1       Running            1          21h
postgresql-1-deploy  1/1       Running            1          21h
postgresql-1-6w2t4   0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   1          21h
----

Then you would:

. Erase the data from the database NFS export.

. Run:
+
----
$ oc delete postgresql-1-6w2t4
----

The PostgreSQL deployer pod will try to scale up a new *postgresql* pod to replace the
one you deleted. After the *postgresql* pod is running, the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*manageiq*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*cfme*
endif::[]
pod will stop blocking and begin application initialization.
