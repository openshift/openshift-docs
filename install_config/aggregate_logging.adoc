== Overview

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can deploy the EFK stack to
aggregate logs for a range of {product-title} services. Application developers
can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access. The EFK stack
aggregates logs from hosts and applications, whether coming from multiple
containers or even deleted pods.

The EFK stack is a modified version of the
https://www.elastic.co/videos/introduction-to-the-elk-stack[ELK stack] and is
comprised of:

* https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch]: An object store where all logs are stored.
* http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd]: Gathers logs from nodes and feeds them to Elasticsearch.
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana]: A web UI for Elasticsearch.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/about.html[Curator]: Removes old logs from Elasticsearch.
endif::openshift-origin[]

Once deployed in a cluster, the stack aggregates logs from all nodes and
projects into Elasticsearch, and provides a Kibana UI to view any logs. Cluster
administrators can view all logs, but application developers can only view logs
for projects they have permission to view. The stack components communicate
securely.

[NOTE]
====
xref:../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#managing-docker-container-logs[Managing
Docker Container Logs] discusses the use of `json-file` logging driver options
to manage container logs and prevent filling node disks.
====

== Pre-deployment Configuration

. An Ansible playbook is available to deploy aggregated logging. You should familiarize yourself with the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc[advanced installation and configuration] section.
This provides information for prepairing to use Ansible and includes information about configuration.
Parameters are added to the Ansible inventory file to configure various areas of the EFK stack.
. Review the xref:../aggregate_logging_sizing.adoc[sizing guidelines] to determine how best to configure your deployment.
. Ensure that you have  deployed a router for the cluster.
. Ensure that you have xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[the
necessary storage] for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch replica
requires its own storage volume. See
xref:aggregated-elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] for more information.
. Create a new project. Once deployed, the EFK stack
collects logs for every project within your {product-title} cluster. The
examples in this topic use the default project *logging*.  The Ansible playbook
will create the project for you if it does not already exist.
+
====
----
$ oadm new-project logging --node-selector=""
$ oc project logging
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Specifying an empty
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#using-node-selectors[node
selector] on the project is recommended, as Fluentd should be deployed
throughout the cluster and any selector would restrict where it is
deployed. To control component placement, specify node selectors per component to
be applied to their deployment configurations.

[[deploying-the-efk-stack]]
== Deploying the EFK Stack

The EFK stack is deployed using an Ansible playbook to
the the EFK components.  Run the playbook from the default Openshift Ansible location
using the default
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc[inventory] file.

----
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/common/openshift-cluster/openshift_logging.yml
----

Running the playbook deploys all the resources (i.e. Secrets, ServiceAccounts, DeploymentConfigs)
 to support the stack. It will wait until the component pods are running. If the wait steps fail,
 the deployment could still be successful; it may be retrieving the component images from
 the registry which can take up to a few minutes.  You can further watch the process with:

----
$ oc get pods -w
----

They will eventually enter *Running* status and end in *Complete* status. If it takes
too long to start, retrieve more details about the pods and any associated events
with:

----
$ oc describe pods/<pod_name>
----

Check the logs if the pods do not run successfully:

----
$ oc logs -f <pod_name>
----

[[aggregate-logging-understanding-the-deployment]]
== Understanding and Adjusting the Deployment
This section describes adjustments that you can make to deployed components.

[[aggregated-ops]]
=== Ops Cluster

[NOTE]
====
The logs for the *default*, *openshift*, and *openshift-infra* projects are
automatically aggregated and grouped into the *.operations* item in the Kibana
interface.

The project where you have deployed the EFK stack (*logging*, as documented
here) is _not_ aggregated into *.operations* and is found under its ID.
====

If you set `openshift_logging_use_ops` to *true* in your inventory file, Fluentd is
configured to split logs between the main Elasticsearch cluster and another
cluster reserved for operations logs (which are defined as node system logs and
the projects *default*, *openshift*, and *openshift-infra*). Therefore, a
separate Elasticsearch cluster, a separate Kibana, and a separate Curator are
deployed to index, access, and manage operations logs. These deployments are set
apart with names that include `-ops`. Keep these separate deployments in mind if
you enabled this option. Most of the following discussion also applies to the
operations cluster if present, just with the names changed to include `-ops`.

[[aggregated-elasticsearch]]
=== Elasticsearch

A highly-available environment requires at least three replicas of
Elasticsearch; each on a different host. Elasticsearch replicas require their
own storage, but an {product-title} deployment configuration shares storage
volumes between all its pods. So, when scaled up, the EFK deployer ensures each
replica of Elasticsearch has its own deployment configuration.

It is possible to scale your cluster up after creation by modifying the
`openshift_logging_es_cluster_size` in the inventory file and re-running the logging
playbook. Additional clustering parameters can be modified and are described in a separate section.

Refer to
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/hardware.html[Elastic's
documentation] for considerations involved in choosing storage and
network location as directed below.

*Viewing all Elasticsearch Deployments*

To view all current Elasticsearch deployments:

====
----
$ oc get dc --selector logging-infra=elasticsearch
----
====

[[logging-node-selector]]
*Node Selector*

Because Elasticsearch can use a lot of resources, all members of a cluster
should have low latency network connections to each other and to any remote
storage. Ensure this by directing the instances to dedicated nodes, or a
dedicated region within your cluster, using a
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#using-node-selectors[node selector].

To configure a node selector, specify the `openshift_logging_es_nodeselector` configuration
option in the inventory file. This applies to all Elasticsearch deployments; if you need
to individualize the node selectors, you must manually edit each deployment
configuration after deployment. The node selector is specified as a python compatible
dict (e.g. `{"node-type":"infra", "region":"east"}`

[[aggregated-logging-persistent-storage]]
*Persistent Elasticsearch Storage*

By default, the `*openshift_logging` Ansible role creates an ephemeral deployment in which all of a pod's
data is lost upon restart. For production usage, specify a persistent storage
volume for each Elasticsearch deployment configuration. You can create
the necessary
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volume-claims[persistent
volume claims] before deploying or have them created for you. The PVCs must be
named to match the `openshift_logging_es_pvc_prefix` setting, which defaults to `logging-es-`;
each PVC name will have a sequence number added to it, so `logging-es-1`,
`logging-es-2`, and so on. If a PVC needed for the deployment exists already, it
is used; if not, and `openshift_logging_es_pvc_size` has been specified, it is created with a
request for that size.

[WARNING]
====
Using NFS storage as a volume or a persistent volume (or via NAS such as
Gluster) is not supported for Elasticsearch storage, as Lucene relies on file
system behavior that NFS does not supply. Data corruption and other problems can
occur. If NFS storage is a requirement, you can allocate a large file on a
volume to serve as a storage device and mount it locally on one host.
For example, if your NFS storage volume is mounted at *_/nfs/storage_*:

----
$ truncate -s 1T /nfs/storage/elasticsearch-1
$ mkfs.xfs /nfs/storage/elasticsearch-1
$ mount -o loop /nfs/storage/elasticsearch-1 /usr/local/es-storage
$ chown 1000:1000 /usr/local/es-storage
----

Then, use *_/usr/local/es-storage_* as a host-mount as described below.
Use a different backing file as storage for each Elasticsearch replica.

This loopback must be maintained manually outside of {product-title}, on the
node. You must not maintain it from inside a container.
====

It is possible to use a local disk volume (if available) on each
node host as storage for an Elasticsearch replica. Doing so requires
some preparation as follows.

. The relevant service account must be given the privilege to mount and edit a
local volume:
+
====
----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged  \
       system:serviceaccount:logging:aggregated-logging-elasticsearch <1>
----
<1> Use the project you created earlier (for example, *logging*) when running the
logging playbook.
====

. Each Elasticsearch replica definition must be patched to claim that privilege,
for example:
+
----
$ for dc in $(oc get deploymentconfig --selector logging-infra=elasticsearch -o name); do
    oc scale $dc --replicas=0
    oc patch $dc \
       -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"elasticsearch","securityContext":{"privileged": true}}]}}}}'
  done
----

. The Elasticsearch replicas must be located on the correct nodes to use the local
storage, and should not move around even if those nodes are taken down for a
period of time. This requires giving each Elasticsearch replica a node selector
that is unique to a node where an administrator has allocated storage for it. To
configure a node selector, edit each Elasticsearch deployment configuration and
add or edit the *nodeSelector* section to specify a unique label that you have
applied for each desired node:
+
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        logging-es-node: "1" <1>
----
<1> This label should uniquely identify a replica with a single node that bears that
label, in this case `logging-es-node=1`. Use the `oc label` command to apply
labels to nodes as needed.

To automate applying the node selector you can instead use the `oc patch` command:

----
$ oc patch dc/logging-es-<suffix> \
   -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"logging-es-node":"1"}}}}}'
----
====

. Once these steps are taken, a local host mount can be applied to each replica
as in this example (where we assume storage is mounted at the same path on each node):
+
----
$ for dc in $(oc get deploymentconfig --selector logging-infra=elasticsearch -o name); do
    oc set volume $dc \
          --add --overwrite --name=elasticsearch-storage \
          --type=hostPath --path=/usr/local/es-storage
    oc rollout latest $dc
    oc scale $dc --replicas=1
  done
----

[[scaling-elasticsearch]]
*Changing the Scale of Elasticsearch*

If you need to scale up the number of Elasticsearch instances your cluster uses,
it is not as simple as scaling up an Elasticsearch deployment configuration.
This is due to the nature of persistent volumes and how Elasticsearch is
configured to store its data and recover the cluster. Instead, scaling up
requires creating a deployment configuration for each Elasticsearch cluster
node.

The simplest way to change the scale of Elasticsearch is to
modify the inventory host file a re-run the logging playbook as desribed previously.
Assuming you have supplied persistent
storage for the deployment, this should not be disruptive.

If you do not wish to reinstall, for instance because you have made
customizations that you would like to preserve, then it is possible to add new
Elasticsearch deployment configurations to the cluster using a template supplied
by the deployer. This requires a more complicated procedure however.

[[cluster-reader-operations]]
*Allowing cluster-reader to view operations logs*

By default, only `cluster-admin` users are granted access in Elasticsearch and
Kibana to view operations logs. To allow `cluster-reader` users to also view these
logs, update the value of `openshift.operations.allow_cluster_reader` in the
Elasticsearch configmap to `true`:

----
$ oc edit configmap/logging-elasticsearch
----

Please note that changes to the configmap might not appear until after redeploying
the pods.  Persisting these changes across deployments can be accomplished by setting
`openshift_logging_es_allows_cluster_reader` to `true` in the inventory file.

[[aggregated-fluentd]]
=== Fluentd

Fluentd is deployed as a DaemonSet that deploys replicas according to a node
label selector (which you can specify with the inventory parameter
`openshift_logging_fluentd_nodeselector`; the default is `logging-infra-fluentd`).
As part of the OpenShift cluster installation, it is recommended that you add the
Fluentd node selector to the list of persisted
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-node-host-labels[node labels].

[[fluentd-use-journald]]
*Having Fluentd Use the Systemd Journal as the Log Source*

By default, Fluentd reads from *_/var/log/messages_* and
*_/var/log/containers/<container>.log_* for system logs and container logs,
respectively. You can instead use the systemd journal as the log source. There
are three inventory parameters available:

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description

| `openshift_logging_use_journal`
|The default is empty, which configures Fluentd to check which log
driver Docker is using. If Docker is using `--log-driver=journald`, Fluentd
reads from the systemd journal, otherwise, it assumes docker is using the
`json-file` log driver and reads from the *_/var/log_* file sources. You can
specify the `openshift_logging_use_journal` option as `true` or `false` to be explicit about
which log source to use. Using the systemd journal requires `docker-1.10` or
later, and Docker must be configured to use `--log-driver=journald`.

// | `journal-source`
// |The default is empty, so that when using the systemd journal, Fluentd first looks for
// *_/var/log/journal_*, and if that is not available, uses *_/run/log/journal_*
// as the journal source. You can specify `journal-source` with an explicit
// journal path. For example, if you want Fluentd to always read logs
// from the transient in-memory journal, set `journal-source`=*_/run/log/journal_*.

| `openshift_logging_journal_read_from_head`
|The default setting is `false`, Fluentd starts reading from the end of the journal,
ignoring historical logs. If this setting is `true`, Fluentd starts reading
logs from the beginning of the journal.
|===

[NOTE]
====
As of {product-title} 3.3, Fluentd no longer reads historical log files when
using the JSON file log driver. In situations where clusters have a large number
of log files and are older than the EFK deployment, this avoids delays when
pushing the most recent logs into Elasticsearch. Curator deleting logs are
migrated soon after they are added to Elasticsearch.
====

[NOTE]
====
It may require several minutes, or hours, depending on the size of your
journal, before any new log entries are available in Elasticsearch, when using
`openshift_logging_journal_read_from_head=true`.
====

[[fluentd-log-external-elasticsearch]]
*Having Fluentd Send Logs to Another Elasticsearch*

[NOTE]
====
The use of `ES_COPY` is being deprecated. To configure FluentD to send a copy of
its logs to an external aggregator, use xref:fluentd-external-log-aggregator[Fluentd
Secure Forward] instead.
====

You can configure Fluentd to send a copy of each log message to both the
Elasticsearch instance included with {product-title} aggregated logging, _and_
to an external Elasticsearch instance. For example, if you already have an
Elasticsearch instance set up for auditing purposes, or data warehousing, you
can send a copy of each log message to that Elasticsearch.

This feature is controlled via environment variables on Fluentd, which can be
modified as described below.

If its environment variable `ES_COPY` is *true*, Fluentd sends a copy of the
logs to another Elasticsearch. The names for the copy variables are just like
the current `ES_HOST`, `OPS_HOST`, and other variables, except that they add
`_COPY`: `ES_COPY_HOST`, `OPS_COPY_HOST`, and so on. There are some
additional parameters added:

* `ES_COPY_SCHEME`, `OPS_COPY_SCHEME` - can use either `http` or `https` - defaults
  to `https`
* `ES_COPY_USERNAME`, `OPS_COPY_USERNAME` - user name to use to authenticate to
  Elasticsearch using username/password auth
* `ES_COPY_PASSWORD`, `OPS_COPY_PASSWORD` - password to use to authenticate to
  Elasticsearch using username/password auth

[NOTE]
====
Sending logs directly to an AWS Elasticsearch instance is not supported. Use
xref:fluentd-external-log-aggregator[Fluentd Secure Forward] to direct logs to
an instance of Fluentd that you control and that is configured with the
`fluent-plugin-aws-elasticsearch-service` plug-in.
====

To set the parameters:

. Edit the DaemonSet for Fluentd:
+
----
$ oc edit -n logging ds logging-fluentd
----
+
Add or edit the environment variable `ES_COPY` to have the value `"true"` (with the quotes),
and add or edit the COPY variables listed above.

[NOTE]
====
These changes will not be persisted across multiple runs of the logging playbook. You
will need to edit the DaemonSet each time to update environment variables.
====

[[fluentd-external-log-aggregator]]
*Configuring Fluentd to Send Logs to an External Log Aggregator*

You can configure Fluentd to send a copy of its logs to an external log
aggregator, and not the default Elasticsearch, using the `secure-forward`
plug-in. From there, you can further process log records after the locally
hosted Fluentd has processed them.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The `secure-forward` plug-in is provided with the Fluentd image as of v1.4.0.
endif::openshift-origin[]

The logging deployment provides a `secure-forward.conf` section in the Fluentd configmap
for configuring the external aggregator:

----
@type secure_forward

self_hostname ${HOSTNAME}
shared_key thisisasharedkey

secure yes
enable_strict_verification yes

ca_cert_path /etc/fluent/keys/your_ca_cert
ca_private_key_path /etc/fluent/keys/your_private_key
ca_private_key_passphrase passphrase

<server>
 host logging-aggregator.external.com  # FQDN or IP
 port 24284
</server>
----

This can be updated using the `oc edit` command:

----
$ oc edit configmap/logging-fluentd
----

Certificates to be used in `secure-forward.conf` can be added to the existing
secret that is mounted on the Fluentd pods. The `your_ca_cert` and
`your_private_key` values must match what is specified in `secure-forward.conf`
in `configmap/logging-fluentd`:

----
$ oc patch secrets/logging-fluentd --type=json \
  --patch "[{'op':'add','path':'/data/your_ca_cert','value':'$(base64 /path/to/your_ca_cert.pem)'}]"
$ oc patch secrets/logging-fluentd --type=json \
  --patch "[{'op':'add','path':'/data/your_private_key','value':'$(base64 /path/to/your_private_key.pem)'}]"
----

[NOTE]
====
Avoid using secret names such as 'cert', 'key', and 'ca' so that the values do
not conflict with the keys generated by the `openshift_logging` Ansible role for Fluentd to talk to
the {product-title} hosted Elasticsearch.
====

When configuring the external aggregator, it must be able to accept messages
securely from Fluentd.

If the external aggregator is another Fluentd process, it must have the
`fluent-plugin-secure-forward` plug-in installed and make use of the input
plug-in it provides:

----
<source>
  @type secure_forward

  self_hostname ${HOSTNAME}
  bind 0.0.0.0
  port 24284

  shared_key thisisasharedkey

  secure yes
  cert_path        /path/for/certificate/cert.pem
  private_key_path /path/for/certificate/key.pem
  private_key_passphrase secret_foo_bar_baz
</source>
----

can be link:https://github.com/tagomoris/fluent-plugin-secure-forward[found

[[fluentd-throttling]]
*Throttling logs in Fluentd*

For projects that are especially verbose, an administrator can throttle down the
rate at which the logs are read in by Fluentd before being processed.

[WARNING]
====
Throttling can contribute to log aggregation falling behind for the configured
projects; log entries can be lost if a pod is deleted before Fluentd catches up.
====

[NOTE]
====
Throttling does not work when using the systemd journal as the log
source. The throttling implementation depends on being able to throttle the
reading of the individual log files for each project. When reading from the
journal, there is only a single log source, no log files, so no file-based
throttling is available. There is not a method of restricting the log
entries that are read into the Fluentd process.
====

To tell Fluentd which projects it should be restricting, edit the throttle
configuration in its ConfigMap after deployment:

----
$ oc edit configmap/logging-fluentd
----

The format of the *_throttle-config.yaml_* key is a YAML file that contains
project names and the desired rate at which logs are read in on each
node. The default is 1000 lines at a time per node. For example:

====
----
logging:
  read_lines_limit: 500

test-project:
  read_lines_limit: 10

.operations:
  read_lines_limit: 100
----
====
[[aggregate-logging-kibana]]
=== Kibana

To access the Kibana console from the {product-title} web console, add the
`loggingPublicURL` parameter in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*
file, with the URL of the Kibana console (the `kibana-hostname` parameter).
The value must be an HTTPS URL:

====
----
...
assetConfig:
  ...
  loggingPublicURL: "https://kibana.example.com"
...
----
====

Setting the `loggingPublicURL` parameter creates a *View Archive* button on the
{product-title} web console under the *Browse* -> *Pods* -> *<pod_name>* ->
*Logs* tab. This links to the Kibana console.

You can scale the Kibana deployment as usual for redundancy:

====
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-kibana --replicas=2
----
====

[NOTE]
====
To ensure the scale persists across multiple executions of the logging playbook,
make sure to update the `openshift_logging_kibana_replica_count` in the inventory file.
====


You can see the user interface by visiting the site specified by the
`openshift_logging_kibana_hostname` variable.

See the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/4.5/discover.html[Kibana
documentation] for more information on Kibana.

[[configuring-curator]]
=== Curator

Curator allows administrators to configure scheduled Elasticsearch maintenance
operations to be performed automatically on a per-project basis. It is scheduled
to perform actions daily based on its configuration. Only one Curator pod is
recommended per Elasticsearch cluster. Curator is configured via a YAML
configuration file with the following structure:

====
----
$PROJECT_NAME:
  $ACTION:
    $UNIT: $VALUE

$PROJECT_NAME:
  $ACTION:
    $UNIT: $VALUE
 ...

----
====

The available parameters are:

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`*$PROJECT_NAME*`
|The actual name of a project, such as *myapp-devel*. For {product-title} *operations*
logs, use the name `.operations` as the project name.

|`*$ACTION*`
|The action to take, currently only `delete` is allowed.

|`*$UNIT*`
|One of `days`, `weeks`, or `months`.

|`*$VALUE*`
|An integer for the number of units.

|`*.defaults*`
|Use `.defaults` as the `$PROJECT_NAME` to set the defaults for projects that are
not specified.

|`*runhour*`
|(Number) the hour of the day in 24-hour format at which to run the Curator jobs. For
use with `.defaults`.

|`*runminute*`
|(Number) the minute of the hour at which to run the Curator jobs. For use with `.defaults`.
|===

For example, to configure Curator to:

- delete indices in the *myapp-dev* project older than `1 day`
- delete indices in the *myapp-qe* project older than `1 week`
- delete *operations* logs older than `8 weeks`
- delete all other projects indices after they are `30 days` old
- run the Curator jobs at midnight every day

Use:

----
myapp-dev:
 delete:
   days: 1

myapp-qe:
  delete:
    weeks: 1

.operations:
  delete:
    weeks: 8

.defaults:
  delete:
    days: 30
  runhour: 0
  runminute: 0
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
When you use `month` as the `$UNIT` for an operation, Curator starts counting at
the first day of the current month, not the current day of the current month.
For example, if today is April 15, and you want to delete indices that are 2 months
older than today (delete: months: 2), Curator does not delete indices that are dated
older than February 15; it deletes indices older than February 1. That is, it
goes back to the first day of the current month, then goes back two whole months
from that date. If you want to be exact with Curator, it is best to use days
(for example, `delete: days: 30`).
====

[[aggregate-logging-creating-the-curator-configuration]]
==== Creating the Curator Configuration

The `openshift_logging` Ansible role provides a ConfigMap from which Curator reads its
configuration.  You may edit or replace this ConfigMap to reconfigure
Curator. Currently the `logging-curator` ConfigMap is used to
configure both your ops and non-ops Curator instances. Any `.operations`
configurations will be in the same location as your application logs
configurations.

. To edit the provided ConfigMap to configure your Curator instances:
+
----
$ oc edit configmap/logging-curator
----

. To replace the provided ConfigMap instead:
+
----
$ create /path/to/mycuratorconfig.yaml
$ oc create configmap logging-curator -o yaml \
  --from-file=config.yaml=/path/to/mycuratorconfig.yaml | \
  oc replace -f -
----

. After you make your changes, redeploy Curator:

[[troubleshooting-kibana]]
== Troubleshooting Kibana

Using the Kibana console with {product-title} can cause problems that are easily
solved, but are not accompanied with useful error messages. Check the following
troubleshooting sections if you are experiencing any problems when deploying
Kibana on {product-title}:

*Login Loop*

The OAuth2 proxy on the Kibana console must share a secret with the master
host's OAuth2 server. If the secret is not identical on both servers, it can
cause a login loop where you are continuously redirected back to the Kibana
login page.

To fix this issue, delete the current OAuthClient, and create a new one, using the
same template as before:

====
----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
$ oc new-app logging-support-template
----
====

*Cryptic Error When Viewing the Console*

When attempting to visit the Kibana console, you may receive a browser
error instead:

====
----
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"The request is missing a required parameter,
 includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed."}
----
====

This can be caused by a mismatch between the OAuth2 client and server. The
return address for the client must be in a whitelist so the server can securely
redirect back after logging in.

Fix this issue by replacing the OAuthClient entry:

====
----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
$ oc new-app logging-support-template
----
====

If the problem persists, check that you are accessing Kibana at a URL listed in
the OAuth client. This issue can be caused by accessing the URL at a forwarded
port, such as 1443 instead of the standard 443 HTTPS port. You can adjust the
server whitelist by editing the OAuth client:

====
----
$ oc edit oauthclient/kibana-proxy
----
====

*503 Error When Viewing the Console*

If you receive a proxy error when viewing the Kibana console, it could be caused
by one of two issues.

First, Kibana may not be recognizing pods. If Elasticsearch is slow in starting
up, Kibana may timeout trying to reach it. Check whether the relevant service
has any endpoints:

====
----
$ oc describe service logging-kibana
Name:                   logging-kibana
[...]
Endpoints:              <none>
----
====

If any Kibana pods are live, endpoints will be listed. If they are not, check
the state of the Kibana pods and deployment. You may need to scale the
deployment down and back up again.

The second possible issue may be caused if the route for accessing the Kibana
service is masked. This can happen if you perform a test deployment in one
project, then deploy in a different project without completely removing the
first deployment. When multiple routes are sent to the same destination, the
default router will only route to the first created. Check the problematic route
to see if it is defined in multiple places:

====
----
$ oc get route  --all-namespaces --selector logging-infra=support
----
====

*F-5 Load Balancer and X-Forwarded-For Enabled*

If you are attempting to use a F-5 load balancer in front of Kibana with
`X-Forwarded-For` enabled, this can cause an issue in which the Elasticsearch
`Searchguard` plug-in is unable to correctly accept connections from Kibana.

.Example Kibana Error Message
----
Kibana: Unknown error while connecting to Elasticsearch

Error: Unknown error while connecting to Elasticsearch
Error: UnknownHostException[No trusted proxies]
----

To configure Searchguard to ignore the extra header:

. Scale down all Fluentd pods.
. Scale down Elasticsearch after the Fluentd pods have terminated.
. Add `searchguard.http.xforwardedfor.header: DUMMY` to the Elasticsearch
configuration section.
+

----
$ oc edit configmap/logging-elasticsearch <1>
----
<1> This approach requires that Elasticsearch's configurations are within a ConfigMap.
+
. Scale Elasticsearch back up.
. Scale up all Fluentd pods.

[[sending-logs-to-an-external-elasticsearch-instance]]
== Sending Logs to an External Elasticsearch Instance

Fluentd sends logs to the value of the `ES_HOST`, `ES_PORT`, `OPS_HOST`,
and `OPS_PORT` environment variables of the Elasticsearch deployment
configuration. The application logs are directed to the `ES_HOST` destination,
and operations logs to `OPS_HOST`.

[NOTE]
====
Sending logs directly to an AWS Elasticsearch instance is not supported. Use
xref:fluentd-external-log-aggregator[Fluentd Secure Forward] to direct logs to
an instance of Fluentd that you control and that is configured with the
`fluent-plugin-aws-elasticsearch-service` plug-in.
====

To direct logs to a specific Elasticsearch instance, edit the deployment
configuration and replace the value of the above variables with the desired
instance:

----
$ oc edit dc/<deployment_configuration>
----

For an external Elasticsearch instance to contain both application and
operations logs, you can set `ES_HOST` and `OPS_HOST` to the same destination,
while ensuring that `ES_PORT` and `OPS_PORT` also have the same value.

If your externally hosted Elasticsearch instance does not use TLS, update the
`_CLIENT_CERT`, `_CLIENT_KEY`, and `_CA` variables to be empty. If it does
use TLS, but not mutual TLS, update the `_CLIENT_CERT` and `_CLIENT_KEY`
variables to be empty and patch or recreate the *logging-fluentd* secret with
the appropriate `_CA` value for communicating with your Elasticsearch instance.
If it uses Mutual TLS as the provided Elasticsearch instance does, patch or
recreate the *logging-fluentd* secret with your client key, client cert, and CA.

Since Fluentd is deployed by a DaemonSet, update the
*logging-fluentd-template* template, delete your current DaemonSet, and recreate
it with `oc new-app logging-fluentd-template` after seeing all previous Fluentd
pods have terminated.

[NOTE]
====
If you are not using the provided Kibana and Elasticsearch images, you will not
have the same multi-tenant capabilities and your data will not be restricted by
user access to a particular project.
====

[[aggregate-logging-performing-elasticsearch-maintenance-operations]]
== Performing Administrative Elasticsearch Operations

As of logging version
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.2.0,
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.2.0,
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
an administrator certificate, key, and CA that can be used to communicate with and perform
administrative operations on Elasticsearch are provided within the
*logging-elasticsearch* secret.

[NOTE]
====
To confirm whether or not your EFK installation provides these, run:
----
$ oc describe secret logging-elasticsearch
----
====

If they are not available, refer to
xref:../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#manual-upgrading-efk-logging-stack[Manual
Upgrades] to ensure you are on the latest version first.

. Connect to an Elasticsearch pod that is in the cluster on which you are
attempting to perform maintenance.

. To find a pod in a cluster use either:
+
====
----
$ oc get pods -l component=es -o name | head -1
$ oc get pods -l component=es-ops -o name | head -1
----
====

. Connect to a pod:
+
====
----
$ oc rsh <your_Elasticsearch_pod>
----
====

. Once connected to an Elasticsearch container, you can use the certificates
mounted from the secret to communicate with Elasticsearch per its
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/indices.html[Indices APIs documentation].
+
Fluentd sends its logs to Elasticsearch using the index format *project.{project_name}.{project_uuid}.YYYY.MM.DD*
where YYYY.MM.DD is the date of the log record.
+
For example, to delete all logs for the *logging* project with uuid *3b3594fa-2ccd-11e6-acb7-0eb6b35eaee3*
from June 15, 2016, we can run:
+
====

$ curl --key /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-key \
  --cert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-cert \
  --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-ca -XDELETE \
