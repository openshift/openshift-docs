== Overview

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can deploy the EFK stack to
aggregate logs for a range of {product-title} services. Application developers
can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access. The EFK stack
aggregates logs from hosts and applications, whether coming from multiple
containers or even deleted pods.

The EFK stack is a modified version of the
https://www.elastic.co/videos/introduction-to-the-elk-stack[ELK stack] and is
comprised of:

* https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch]: An object store where all logs are stored.
* http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd]: Gathers logs from nodes and feeds them to Elasticsearch.
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana]: A web UI for Elasticsearch.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/about.html[Curator]: Removes old logs from Elasticsearch.
endif::openshift-origin[]

Once deployed in a cluster, the stack aggregates logs from all nodes and
projects into Elasticsearch, and provides a Kibana UI to view any logs. Cluster
administrators can view all logs, but application developers can only view logs
for projects they have permission to view. The stack components communicate
securely.

[NOTE]
====
xref:../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#managing-docker-container-logs[Managing
Docker Container Logs] discusses the use of `json-file` logging driver options
to manage container logs and prevent filling node disks.
====

== Pre-deployment Configuration

. Ensure that you have  deployed a router for the cluster.
. Ensure that you have xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[the
necessary storage] for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch replica
requires its own storage volume. See
xref:aggregated-elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] for more information.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Ansible-based installs should create the *logging-deployer-template*
template in the *openshift* project.
Otherwise you can create it with the following command:
+
====
----
$ oc create -n openshift -f \
    /usr/share/openshift/examples/infrastructure-templates/enterprise/logging-deployer.yaml
----
====
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. If your installation did not create templates in the *openshift* namespace, the
*logging-deployer-template* and *logging-deployer-account-template* templates
may not exist. In that case you can create them with the following command:
+
====
----
$ oc create -n openshift -f \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging/master/deployer/deployer.yaml
----
====
endif::openshift-origin[]
. Create a new project. Once implemented in a single project, the EFK stack
collects logs for every project within your {product-title} cluster. The
examples in this topic use *logging* as an example project:
+
====
----
$ oadm new-project logging --node-selector=""
$ oc project logging
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Specifying a non-empty
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#using-node-selectors[node
selector] on the project is not recommended, as this would restrict
where Fluentd can be deployed. Instead, specify node selectors for the
deployer to be applied to your other deployment configurations.
====

. Create a xref:../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secret] to provide security-related files to the deployer. While the secret is necessary, the contents of the secret are optional, and will be generated for you if none are supplied.
+
You can supply the following files when creating a new secret:
+
[cols="2",options="header"]
|===
|File Name
|Description

|*_kibana.crt_*
|A browser-facing certificate for the Kibana server.

|*_kibana.key_*
|A key to be used with the Kibana certificate.

|*_kibana-ops.crt_*
|A browser-facing certificate for the Ops Kibana server.

|*_kibana-ops.key_*
|A key to be used with the Ops Kibana certificate.

|*_server-tls.json_*
|JSON TLS options to override the Kibana server defaults. Refer to
https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback[Node.JS] docs
for available options.

|*_ca.crt_*
|A certificate for a CA that will be used to sign all certificates generated by
the deployer.

|*_ca.key_*
|A matching CA key.
|===
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc secrets new logging-deployer \
   kibana.crt=/path/to/cert kibana.key=/path/to/key
----
+
If a certificate file is not passed as a secret, the deployer will generate a
self-signed certificate instead. However, a secret is still required for
the deployer to run. In this case, you can create a "dummy" secret that
does not specify a certificate value:
+
----
$ oc secrets new logging-deployer nothing=/dev/null
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Create the deployer xref:../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service
account]:
+
====
----
$ oc create -f - <<API
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: logging-deployer
secrets:
- name: logging-deployer
API
----
====
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. Create the deployer xref:../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service
account] and custom roles:
+
====
----
$ oc new-app logging-deployer-account-template
----
====
endif::openshift-origin[]
+
Then, enable the *logging-deployer* service account to create the objects
needed for a logging deployment:
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
+
====
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user edit --serviceaccount logging-deployer
----
====
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
+
====
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user edit --serviceaccount logging-deployer
$ oc policy add-role-to-user daemonset-admin --serviceaccount logging-deployer
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user oauth-editor \
       system:serviceaccount:logging:logging-deployer <1>
----
<1> Use the new project you created earlier (e.g., *logging*) when specifying
this service account.
====
endif::openshift-origin[]

. Enable the Fluentd service account, which the deployer will create, that
requires special privileges to operate Fluentd. Add the service account user to
the security context:
+
====
----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user  \
    privileged system:serviceaccount:logging:aggregated-logging-fluentd <1>
----
<1> Use the new project you created earlier (e.g., *logging*) when specifying
this service account.
====
+
Give the Fluentd service account permission to read labels from all pods:
+
====
----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader \
    system:serviceaccount:logging:aggregated-logging-fluentd <1>
----
<1> Use the new project you created earlier (e.g., *logging*) when specifying
this service account.
====

[[deploying-the-efk-stack]]
== Deploying the EFK Stack

The EFK stack is deployed xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[using a template].

. Run the deployer, specifying at least the parameters in the following example (more are described in the table below):
+
====
----
$ oc new-app logging-deployer-template \
             --param KIBANA_HOSTNAME=kibana.example.com \
             --param ES_CLUSTER_SIZE=1 \
             --param PUBLIC_MASTER_URL=https://localhost:8443
----
====
+
Be sure to replace at least `*KIBANA_HOSTNAME*` and `*PUBLIC_MASTER_URL*` with
values relevant to your deployment.
+
The available parameters are:
+
[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`*PUBLIC_MASTER_URL*`
|(Required with the `oc new-app` command) The external URL for the master. For
OAuth use.

|`*ENABLE_OPS_CLUSTER*`
|If set to `*true*`, configures a second Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana for
operations logs. Fluentd splits
logs between the main cluster and a cluster reserved for operations
logs (which consists of *_/var/log/messages_* on nodes and the logs from the
projects *default*, *openshift*, and *openshift-infra*).
This means a second Elasticsearch and Kibana are deployed. The deployments
are distinguishable by the *-ops* included in their names and have parallel
deployment options listed below.

|`*KIBANA_HOSTNAME*`, `*KIBANA_OPS_HOSTNAME*`
|(Required with the `oc new-app` command) The external host name for web clients
to reach Kibana.

|`*ES_CLUSTER_SIZE*`, `*ES_OPS_CLUSTER_SIZE*`
|(Required with the `oc new-app` command) The number of instances of
Elasticsearch to deploy. Redundancy requires at least three, and more can be
used for scaling.

|`*ES_INSTANCE_RAM*`, `*ES_OPS_INSTANCE_RAM*`
|Amount of RAM to reserve per Elasticsearch instance. The default is 8G (for 8GB), and it
must be at least 512M. Possible suffixes are G,g,M,m.

|`*ES_NODE_QUORUM*`, `*ES_OPS_NODE_QUORUM*`
|The quorum required to elect a new master. Should be more than half the intended cluster size.

|`*ES_RECOVER_AFTER_NODES*`, `*ES_OPS_RECOVER_AFTER_NODES*`
|When restarting the cluster, require this many nodes to be present before starting recovery.
Defaults to one less than the cluster size to allow for one missing node.

|`*ES_RECOVER_EXPECTED_NODES*`, `*ES_OPS_RECOVER_EXPECTED_NODES*`
|When restarting the cluster, wait for this number of nodes to be present before starting recovery.
By default, the same as the cluster size.

|`*ES_RECOVER_AFTER_TIME*`, `*ES_OPS_RECOVER_AFTER_TIME*`
|When restarting the cluster, this is a timeout for waiting for the expected number of nodes to be present.
Defaults to "5m".

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
|`*ES_NODESELECTOR*`, `*ES_OPS_NODESELECTOR*`
| A node selector that specifies which nodes are eligible targets
for deploying Elasticsearch instances. This can be used to place
these instances on nodes reserved and/or optimized for running them.
For example, the selector could be `*node-type=infrastructure*`. At least
one active node must have this label before Elasticsearch will deploy.

|`*KIBANA_NODESELECTOR*`, `*KIBANA_OPS_NODESELECTOR*`, `*CURATOR_NODESELECTOR*`
| A node selector that specifies which nodes are eligible targets
for deploying Kibana or Curator instances.

|`*FLUENTD_NODESELECTOR*`
| A node selector that specifies which nodes are eligible targets
for deploying Fluentd instances. Defaults to "logging-infra-fluentd=true".

|`*IMAGE_PREFIX*`
|The prefix for logging component images. For example, setting the prefix to
*openshift/origin-* creates *openshift/origin-logging-deployer:v1.2*.

|`*IMAGE_VERSION*`
|The version for logging component images. For example, setting the version to
*v1.2* creates *openshift/origin-logging-deployer:v1.2*.
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
|`*IMAGE_PREFIX*`
|The prefix for logging component images. For example, setting the prefix to
*registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-* creates *registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-logging-deployer:latest*.

|`*IMAGE_VERSION*`
|The version for logging component images. For example, setting the version to
*v3.2* creates *registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-logging-deployer:v3.2*.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
|===
+
Running the deployer creates a deployer pod and prints its name. Wait until the
pod is running. This can take up to a few minutes to retrieve the deployer image
from the registry. You can watch its process with:
+
----
$ oc get pod/<pod_name> -w
----
+
If it seems to be taking too long to start, you can retrieve more details about
the pod and any associated events with:
+
----
$ oc describe pod/<pod_name>
----
+
When it runs, you can check the logs of the resulting pod to see if the
deployment was successful:
+
----
$ oc logs -f <pod_name>
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. As a cluster administrator, deploy the `logging-support-template` template
that the deployer created:
+
====
----
$ oc new-app logging-support-template
----
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Deployment of logging components should begin automatically. However,
because deployment is triggered based on tags being imported into the
ImageStreams created in this step, and not all tags are automatically
imported, this mechanism has become unreliable as multiple versions are
released. Therefore, manual importing may be necessary as follows.

For each ImageStream `logging-auth-proxy`, `logging-kibana`,
`logging-elasticsearch`, and `logging-fluentd`, manually import the
tag corresponding to the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` specified (or defaulted)
for the deployer.

----
$ oc import-image <name>:<version> --from <prefix><name>:<tag>
----

For example:

----
$ oc import-image logging-auth-proxy:3.2.0 \
     --from registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-auth-proxy:3.2.0
$ oc import-image logging-kibana:3.2.0 \
     --from registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-kibana:3.2.0
$ oc import-image logging-elasticsearch:3.2.0 \
     --from registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-elasticsearch:3.2.0
$ oc import-image logging-fluentd:3.2.0 \
     --from registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-fluentd:3.2.0
----
====

endif::openshift-enterprise[]

== Post-deployment Configuration

[[aggregated-elasticsearch]]
=== Elasticsearch

A highly-available environment requires at least three replicas of
Elasticsearch; each on a different host. Elasticsearch replicas require their
own storage, but an {product-title} deployment configuration shares storage
volumes between all its pods. So, when scaled up, the EFK deployer ensures each
replica of Elasticsearch has its own deployment configuration.

*Viewing all Elasticsearch Deployments*

To view all current Elasticsearch deployments:

====
----
$ oc get dc --selector logging-infra=elasticsearch
----
====

[[aggregated-logging-persistent-storage]]
*Persistent Elasticsearch Storage*

The deployer creates an ephemeral deployment in which all of a pod's data is
lost upon restart. For production usage, add a persistent storage volume to each
Elasticsearch deployment configuration.

The following example specifies a volume for an Elasticsearch replica (using a
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volume-claims[PersistentVolumeClaim]):

====
----
$ oc volume dc/logging-es-rca2m9u8 \
          --add --overwrite --name=elasticsearch-storage \
          --type=persistentVolumeClaim --claim-name=logging-es-1
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Any available volume type can be used, such as a host-mount, but the
recommended volume type is a PersistentVolumeClaim.
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[[logging-node-selector]]
*Node Selector*

Because Elasticsearch can use a lot of resources, all members of a cluster
should have low latency network connections to each other. Ensure this by
directing the instances to dedicated nodes, or a dedicated region within your
cluster, using a
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#using-node-selectors[node selector].

To configure a node selector, edit each deployment configuration and add the
`*nodeSelector*` parameter to specify the label of the desired nodes:

====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        nodelabel: logging-es-node-1
----
====

Alternatively you can use the `oc patch` command:
====
----
$ oc patch dc/logging-es-<unique_name> \
   -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"nodeLabel":"logging-es-node-1"}}}}}'
----
====
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

[[scaling-elasticsearch]]
*Changing the Scale of Elasticsearch*

If you need to scale up the number of Elasticsearch instances your cluster uses,
it is not as simple as changing the number of Elasticsearch cluster nodes. This
is due to the nature of persistent volumes and how Elasticsearch is configured
to store its data and recover the cluster. Instead, you must create a deployment
configuration for each Elasticsearch cluster node.

During installation, the deployer
xref:../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[creates templates] with the
Elasticsearch configurations provided to it: *logging-es-template* and
*logging-es-ops-template* if the deployer was run with
`*ENABLE_OPS_CLUSTER=true*`.

The node quorum and recovery settings were initially set based on the
`*CLUSTER_SIZE*` value provided to the deployer. Since the cluster size is
changing, those values need to be updated.

. Prior to changing the number of Elasticsearch cluster nodes, the EFK stack
should first be scaled down to preserve log data as described in
xref:../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#manual-upgrading-efk-logging-stack[Upgrading
the EFK Logging Stack].

. Edit the cluster template you are scaling up and change the parameters to the
desired value:
+
- `*NODE_QUORUM*` is the intended cluster size / 2 (rounded down) + 1. For an
intended cluster size of 5, the quorum would be 3.
+
- `*RECOVER_EXPECTED_NODES*` is the same as the intended cluster size.
+
- `*RECOVER_AFTER_NODES*` is the intended cluster size - 1.
+
====
----
$ oc edit template logging-es[-ops]-template
----
====
+
. In addition to updating the template, all of the deployment configurations for
that cluster also need to have the three environment variable values above
updated. To edit each of the configurations for the cluster in series, you use
the following.
+
====
----
$ oc get dc -l component=es[-ops] -o name | xargs -r oc edit
----
====
+
. Create an additional deployment configuration, run the following
command against the Elasticsearch cluster you want to to scale up for
(*logging-es-template* or *logging-es-ops-template*).
+
====
----
$ oc new-app logging-es[-ops]-template
----
====
+
These deployments will be named differently, but all will have the *logging-es*
prefix. Be aware of the cluster parameters (described in the deployer
parameters) based on cluster size that may need corresponding adjustment in the
template, as well as existing deployments.

. After the intended number of deployment configurations are created, scale up
your cluster, starting with Elasticsearch as described in
xref:../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#manual-upgrading-efk-logging-stack[Upgrading
the EFK Logging Stack].
+
[NOTE]
====
The `oc new-app logging-es[-ops]-template` command creates a deployment
configuration with a persistent volume. If you want to create a Elasticsearch
cluster node with a persistent volume attached to it, upon creation you can
instead run the following command to create your deployment configuration with a
persistent volume claim (PVC) attached.

----
$ oc process logging-es-template | oc volume -f - \
          --add --overwrite --name=elasticsearch-storage \
          --type=persistentVolumeClaim --claim-name={your_pvc}`
----
====

=== Fluentd

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Once Elasticsearch is running, scale Fluentd to every node to feed logs into
Elasticsearch. The following example is for an {product-title} instance with
three nodes:

====
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-fluentd --replicas=3
----
====

You will need to scale Fluentd if nodes are added or subtracted.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Once Elasticsearch is running, label nodes to enable Fluentd to run on them
and feed logs to Elasticsearch. Use the `*FLUENTD_NODESELECTOR*` given to
the deployer (if different) in the command below:

====
----
$ oc label nodes --all logging-infra-fluentd=true
----
====

endif::openshift-origin[]

=== Kibana

To access the Kibana console from the {product-title} web console, add the
`loggingPublicURL` parameter in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*
file, with the URL of the Kibana console (the `*KIBANA_HOSTNAME*` parameter).
The value must be an HTTPS URL:

====
----
...
assetConfig:
  ...
  loggingPublicURL: "https://kibana.example.com"
...
----
====

Setting the `loggingPublicURL` parameter creates a *View Archive* button on the
{product-title} web console under the *Browse* -> *Pods* -> *<pod_name>* ->
*Logs* tab. This links to the Kibana console.

You can scale the Kibana deployment as usual for redundancy:

====
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-kibana --replicas=2
----
====

You can see the UI by visiting the site specified at the `*KIBANA_HOSTNAME*`
variable.

See the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/4.1/discover.html[Kibana
documentation] for more information on Kibana.

=== Cleanup

You can remove everything generated during the deployment while
leaving other project contents intact:

----
$ oc delete all --selector logging-infra=kibana
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
$ oc delete all --selector logging-infra=fluentd
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
$ oc delete all,daemonsets --selector logging-infra=fluentd
endif::openshift-origin[]
$ oc delete all --selector logging-infra=elasticsearch
$ oc delete all --selector logging-infra=curator
$ oc delete all,sa,oauthclient --selector logging-infra=support
$ oc delete secret logging-fluentd logging-elasticsearch \
    logging-es-proxy logging-kibana logging-kibana-proxy \
    logging-kibana-ops-proxy

Upgrades].

[[troubleshooting-kibana]]
== Troubleshooting Kibana

Using the Kibana console with {product-title} can cause problems that are easily
solved, but are not accompanied with useful error messages. Check the following
troubleshooting sections if you are experiencing any problems when deploying
Kibana on {product-title}:

*Login Loop*

The OAuth2 proxy on the Kibana console must share a secret with the master
host's OAuth2 server. If the secret is not identical on both servers, it can
cause a login loop where you are continuously redirected back to the Kibana
login page.

To fix this issue, delete the current oauthclient, and create a new one, using the
same template as before:

====
----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
$ oc new-app logging-support-template
----
====

*Cryptic Error When Viewing the Console*

When attempting to visit the Kibana console, you may instead receive a browser
error:

====
----
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"The request is missing a required parameter,
 includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed."}
----
====

This can be caused by a mismatch between the OAuth2 client and server. The
return address for the client must be in a whitelist so the server can securely
redirect back after logging in.

Fix this issue by replacing the OAuth client entry:

====
----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
$ oc new-app logging-support-template
----
====

If the problem persists, check that you are accessing Kibana at a URL listed in
the OAuth client. This issue can be caused by accessing the URL at a forwarded
port, such as 1443 instead of the standard 443 HTTPS port. You can adjust the
server whitelist by editing the OAuth client:

====
----
$ oc edit oauthclient/kibana-proxy
----
====

*503 Error When Viewing the Console*

If you receive a proxy error when viewing the Kibana console, it could be caused
by one of two issues.

First, Kibana may not be recognizing pods. If Elasticsearch is slow in starting
up, Kibana may timeout trying to reach it. Check whether the relevant service
has any endpoints:

====
----
$ oc describe service logging-kibana
Name:                   logging-kibana
[...]
Endpoints:              <none>
----
====

If any Kibana pods are live, endpoints will be listed. If they are not, check
the state of the Kibana pods and deployment. You may need to scale the
deployment down and back up again.

The second possible issue may be caused if the route for accessing the Kibana
service is masked. This can happen if you perform a test deployment in one
project, then deploy in a different project without completely removing the
first deployment. When multiple routes are sent to the same destination, the
default router will only route to the first created. Check the problematic route
to see if it is defined in multiple places:

====
----
$ oc get route  --all-namespaces --selector logging-infra=support
----
====

[[sending-logs-to-an-external-elasticsearch-instance]]
== Sending Logs to an External Elasticsearch instance

Fluentd sends logs to the value of the `ES_HOST`, `ES_PORT`, `OPS_HOST`, and
`OPS_PORT` environment variables of the Elasticsearch deployment configuration.
The application logs are directed to the `ES_HOST` destination, and operations
logs to `OPS_HOST`.

To direct logs to a specific Elasticsearch instance, edit the deployment
configuration and replace the value of the above variables with the desired
instance:

----
$ oc edit dc/<deployment_configuration>
----

For an external Elasticsearch instance to contain both application and
operations logs, you can set `ES_HOST` and `OPS_HOST` to the same destination,
while ensuring that `ES_PORT` and `OPS_PORT` also have the same value.

If your externally hosted Elasticsearch instance does not use TLS, update the
`*_CLIENT_CERT`, `*_CLIENT_KEY`, and `*_CA` variables to be empty. If it does
use TLS, but not mutual TLS, update the `*_CLIENT_CERT` and `*_CLIENT_KEY`
variables to be empty and patch or recreate the `logging-fluentd` secret with
the appropriate `*_CA` value for communicating with your Elasticsearch instance.
If it uses Mutual TLS as the provided Elasticsearch instance does, patch or
recreate the `logging-fluentd` secret with your client key, client cert, and CA.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Since Fluentd is deployed by a DaemonSet, update the
`logging-fluentd-template` template, delete your current DaemonSet, and recreate
it with `oc new-app logging-fluentd-template` after seeing all previous Fluentd
pods have terminated.
endif::openshift-origin[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
You can use `oc edit dc/logging-fluentd` to update your Fluentd configuration,
making sure to first scale down your number of replicas to zero before editing
the deployment configuration.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

[NOTE]
====
If you are not using the provided Kibana and Elasticsearch images, you will not
have the same multi-tenant capabilities and your data will not be restricted by
user access to a particular project.

[[aggregate-logging-performing-elasticsearch-maintenance-operations]]
== Performing Elasticsearch Maintenance Operations

As of the Deployer version
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.2.0,
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.2.0,
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
an admin certificate, key, and CA that can be used to communicate with and perform
administrative operations on Elasticsearch are provided within the
`logging-elasticsearch` secret.

[NOTE]
====
To confirm whether or not your EFK installation provides these, run:
----
$ oc describe secret logging-elasticsearch
----
====

If they are not available, refer to
xref:../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#manual-upgrading-efk-logging-stack[Manual
Upgrades] to ensure you are on the latest version first.

Connect to an Elasticsearch pod that is in the cluster on which you are
attempting to perform maintenance.

To find a pod in a cluster use either:

====
----
$ oc get pods -l component=es -o name | head -1
$ oc get pods -l component=es-ops -o name | head -1
----
====

Then, connect to a pod:

====
----
$ oc rsh <your_Elasticsearch_pod>
----
====

Once connected to an Elasticsearch container, you can use the certificates mounted
from the secret to communicate with Elasticsearch per its 1.5
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.5/docs.html[Document APIs].

Fluentd sends its logs to Elasticsearch using the index format "{project_name}.{project_uuid}.YYYY.MM.DD"
where YYYY.MM.DD is the date of the log record.

For example, to delete all logs for the `logging` project with uuid `3b3594fa-2ccd-11e6-acb7-0eb6b35eaee3`
from June 15, 2016, we can run:

====
----
$ curl --key /etc/elasticsearch/keys/admin-key --cert /etc/elasticsearch/keys/admin-cert \
  --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/keys/admin-ca -XDELETE \
  "https://localhost:9200/logging.3b3594fa-2ccd-11e6-acb7-0eb6b35eaee3.2016.06.15"

== Configuring Curator

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
With Aggregated Logging version 3.2.1, Curator is available for use as Tech
Preview. To start it, after completing an installation using the 3.2.1 Deployer,
scale up the Curator deployment configuration that was created. (It defaults to
zero replicas.)

There should be one Curator pod running per Elasticsearch cluster. If you
deployed aggregated logging with `ENABLE_OPS_CLUSTER=true`, then you will have a
second deployment configuration (one for the ops cluster and one for the non-ops
cluster).

----
$ oc scale dc/logging-curator --replicas=1
$ oc scale dc/logging-curator-ops --replicas=1
----
====
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

Curator allows administrators to configure scheduled Elasticsearch maintenance
operations to be performed automatically on a per-project basis. It is scheduled
to perform actions daily based on its configuration. Only one Curator pod is
recommended per Elasticsearch cluster. Curator is configured via a mounted YAML
configuration file with the following structure:

====
----
$PROJECT_NAME:
  $ACTION:
    $UNIT: $VALUE

$PROJECT_NAME:
  $ACTION:
    $UNIT: $VALUE
 ...

----
====

The available parameters are:

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`*$PROJECT_NAME*`
|The actual name of a project, such as `myapp-devel`.  For {product-title} `operations`
logs, use the name `.operations` as the project name.

|`*$ACTION*`
|The action to take, currently only `delete` is allowed.

|`*$UNIT*`
|One of `days`, `weeks`, or `months`.

|`*$VALUE*`
|An integer for the number of units.

|`*.defaults*`
|Use `.defaults` as the `$PROJECT_NAME` to set the defaults for projects that are
not specified.

|`*runhour*`
|(Number) the hour of the day in 24-hour format at which to run the Curator jobs. For
use with `.defaults`.

|`*runminute*`
|(Number) the minute of the hour at which to run the Curator jobs. For use with `.defaults`.
|===

For example, to configure Curator to

- delete indices in the `myapp-dev` project older than `1 day`
- delete indices in the `myapp-qe` project older than `1 week`
- delete `operations` logs older than `8 weeks`
- delete all other projects indices after they are `30 days` old
- run the Curator jobs at midnight every day

you would use:

----
myapp-dev:
 delete:
   days: 1

myapp-qe:
  delete:
    weeks: 1

.operations:
  delete:
    weeks: 8

.defaults:
  delete:
    days: 30
  runhour: 0
  runminute: 0
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
When you use `month` as the `$UNIT` for an operation, Curator starts counting at
the first day of the current month, not the current day of the current month.
For example, if today is April 15, and you want to delete indices that are 2 months
older than today (delete: months: 2), Curator does not delete indices that are dated
older than February 15; it deletes indices older than February 1. That is, it
goes back to the first day of the current month, then goes back two whole months
from that date. If you want to be exact with Curator, it is best to use days
(for example, `delete: days: 30`).

[[aggregate-logging-creating-the-curator-configuration]]
=== Creating the Curator Configuration

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The deployer provides a configmap from which Curator reads its configuration.
Before making any changes:

. Scale down your Curator pods:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-curator --replicas=0
$ oc scale dc/logging-curator-ops --replicas=0
----

. Once the pods have stopped, edit the provided configmap to configure your
Curator instances:
+
----
$ oc edit configmap/logging-curator
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Within OpenShift Origin, currently the `logging-curator` configmap is used to
configure both your ops and non-ops Curator instances. Any `.operations`
configurations will be in the same location as your application logs
configurations.
====

. After you make your changes, scale your Curator pods back up:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-curator --replicas=1
$ oc scale dc/logging-curator-ops --replicas=1
----
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
To create the Curator configuration:

. Create a YAML file with your configuration settings using your favorite editor.

. Create a secret from your created yaml file:
+
----
$ oc secrets new index-management settings=</path/to/your/yaml/file>
----

. Mount your created secret as a volume in your Curator DC:
+
----
$ oc volumes dc/logging-curator \
    --add \
    --type=secret \
    --secret-name=index-management \
    --mount-path=/etc/curator \
    --name=index-management \
    --overwrite
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The mount-path value (e.g. `/etc/curator`) must match the `CURATOR_CONF_LOCATION` in
the environment.
====
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

You can also specify default values for the run hour, run minute, and age in days
of the indices when processing the Curator template. Use `CURATOR_RUN_HOUR` and
`CURATOR_RUN_MINUTE` to set the default *runhour* and *runminute*, and use
`CURATOR_DEFAULT_DAYS` to set the default index age.
