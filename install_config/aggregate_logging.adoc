== Overview

As an OpenShift cluster administrator, you can deploy the EFK stack to aggregate
logs for a range of OpenShift services. Application developers can view the logs
of the projects for which they have view access. The EFK stack aggregates logs
from hosts and applications, whether coming from multiple containers or even
deleted pods.

The EFK stack is a modified version of the
https://www.elastic.co/videos/introduction-to-the-elk-stack[ELK stack] and is
comprised of:

* https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch]: An object store where all logs are stored.
* http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd]: Gathers logs from nodes and feeds them to Elasticsearch.
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana]: A web UI for Elasticsearch.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/about.html[Curator]: Removes old logs from Elasticsearch.
endif::openshift-origin[]

Once deployed in a cluster, the stack aggregates logs from all nodes and
projects into Elasticsearch, and provides a Kibana UI to view any logs. Cluster
administrators can view all logs, but application developers can only view logs
for projects they have permission to view. The stack components communicate
securely.

[NOTE]
====
link:../install_config/install/prerequisites.html#managing-docker-container-logs[Managing
Docker Container Logs] discusses the use of `json-file` logging driver options
to manage container logs and prevent filling node disks.

== Pre-deployment Configuration

. Ensure that you have xref:../install_config/install/deploy_router.html#[deployed a router] for the cluster.
. Ensure that you have xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/index.html[the
necessary storage] for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch replica
requires its own storage volume. See
xref:#aggregated-elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] for more information.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Ansible-based installs should create the *logging-deployer-template*
template in the *openshift* project.
Otherwise you can create it with the following command:
+
====
----
$ oc create -n openshift -f \
    /usr/share/openshift/examples/infrastructure-templates/enterprise/logging-deployer.yaml
----
====
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. If your installation did not create templates in the *openshift* namespace, the
*logging-deployer-template* and *logging-deployer-account-template* templates
may not exist. In that case you can create them with the following command:
+
====
----
$ oc create -n openshift -f \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging/master/deployer/deployer.yaml
----
====
endif::openshift-origin[]
. Create a new project. Once implemented in a single project, the EFK stack
collects logs for every project within your OpenShift cluster. The examples in
this topic use *logging* as an example project:
+
====
----
$ oadm new-project logging --node-selector=""
$ oc project logging
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Specifying a non-empty
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.html#using-node-selectors[node
selector] on the project is not recommended, as this would restrict
where Fluentd can be deployed. Instead, specify node selectors for the
deployer to be applied to your other deployment configurations.
====

. Create a xref:../dev_guide/secrets.html#[secret] to provide security-related files to the deployer. While the secret is necessary, the contents of the secret are optional, and will be generated for you if none are supplied.
+
You can supply the following files when creating a new secret:
+
[cols="2",options="header"]
|===
|File Name
|Description

|*_kibana.crt_*
|A browser-facing certificate for the Kibana server.

|*_kibana.key_*
|A key to be used with the Kibana certificate.

|*_kibana-ops.crt_*
|A browser-facing certificate for the Ops Kibana server.

|*_kibana-ops.key_*
|A key to be used with the Ops Kibana certificate.

|*_server-tls.json_*
|JSON TLS options to override the Kibana server defaults. Refer to
https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback[Node.JS] docs
for available options.

|*_ca.crt_*
|A certificate for a CA that will be used to sign all certificates generated by
the deployer.

|*_ca.key_*
|A matching CA key.
|===
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc secrets new logging-deployer \
   kibana.crt=/path/to/cert kibana.key=/path/to/key
----
+
If a certificate file is not passed as a secret, the deployer will generate a
self-signed certificate instead. However, a secret is still required for
the deployer to run. In this case, you can create a "dummy" secret that
does not specify a certificate value:
+
----
$ oc secrets new logging-deployer nothing=/dev/null
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Create the deployer link:../admin_guide/service_accounts.html[service
account]:
+
====
----
$ oc create -f - <<API
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: logging-deployer
secrets:
- name: logging-deployer
API
----
====
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. Create the deployer link:../admin_guide/service_accounts.html[service
account] and custom roles:
+
====
----
$ oc new-app logging-deployer-account-template
----
====
endif::openshift-origin[]
+
Then, enable the *logging-deployer* service account to create the objects
needed for a logging deployment:
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
+
====
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user edit --serviceaccount logging-deployer
----
====
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
+
====
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user edit --serviceaccount logging-deployer
$ oc policy add-role-to-user daemonset-admin --serviceaccount logging-deployer
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user oauth-editor \
       system:serviceaccount:logging:logging-deployer <1>
----
<1> Use the new project you created earlier (e.g., *logging*) when specifying
this service account.
====
endif::openshift-origin[]

. Enable the Fluentd service account, which the deployer will create, that
requires special privileges to operate Fluentd. Add the service account user to
the security context:
+
====
----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user  \
    privileged system:serviceaccount:logging:aggregated-logging-fluentd <1>
----
<1> Use the new project you created earlier (e.g., *logging*) when specifying
this service account.
====
+
Give the Fluentd service account permission to read labels from all pods:
+
====
----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader \
    system:serviceaccount:logging:aggregated-logging-fluentd <1>
----
<1> Use the new project you created earlier (e.g., *logging*) when specifying
this service account.
====

[[deploying-the-efk-stack]]
== Deploying the EFK Stack

The EFK stack is deployed link:../dev_guide/templates.html[using a template].

. Run the deployer, specifying at least the parameters in the following example (more are described in the table below):
+
====
----
$ oc new-app logging-deployer-template \
             --param KIBANA_HOSTNAME=kibana.example.com \
             --param ES_CLUSTER_SIZE=1 \
             --param PUBLIC_MASTER_URL=https://localhost:8443
----
====
+
Be sure to replace at least `*KIBANA_HOSTNAME*` and `*PUBLIC_MASTER_URL*` with
values relevant to your deployment.
+
The available parameters are:
+
[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`*PUBLIC_MASTER_URL*`
|(Required with the `oc new-app` command) The external URL for the master. For
OAuth use.

|`*ENABLE_OPS_CLUSTER*`
|If set to `*true*`, configures a second Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana for
operations logs. Fluentd splits
logs between the main cluster and a cluster reserved for operations
logs (which consists of *_/var/log/messages_* on nodes and the logs from the
projects *default*, *openshift*, and *openshift-infra*).
This means a second Elasticsearch and Kibana are deployed. The deployments
are distinguishable by the *-ops* included in their names and have parallel
deployment options listed below.

|`*KIBANA_HOSTNAME*`, `*KIBANA_OPS_HOSTNAME*`
|(Required with the `oc new-app` command) The external host name for web clients
to reach Kibana.

|`*ES_CLUSTER_SIZE*`, `*ES_OPS_CLUSTER_SIZE*`
|(Required with the `oc new-app` command) The number of instances of
Elasticsearch to deploy. Redundancy requires at least three, and more can be
used for scaling.

|`*ES_INSTANCE_RAM*`, `*ES_OPS_INSTANCE_RAM*`
|Amount of RAM to reserve per Elasticsearch instance. The default is 8GB, and it
must be at least 512MB.

|`*ES_NODE_QUORUM*`, `*ES_OPS_NODE_QUORUM*`
|The quorum required to elect a new master. Should be more than half the intended cluster size.

|`*ES_RECOVER_AFTER_NODES*`, `*ES_OPS_RECOVER_AFTER_NODES*`
|When restarting the cluster, require this many nodes to be present before starting recovery.
Defaults to one less than the cluster size to allow for one missing node.

|`*ES_RECOVER_EXPECTED_NODES*`, `*ES_OPS_RECOVER_EXPECTED_NODES*`
|When restarting the cluster, wait for this number of nodes to be present before starting recovery.
By default, the same as the cluster size.

|`*ES_RECOVER_AFTER_TIME*`, `*ES_OPS_RECOVER_AFTER_TIME*`
|When restarting the cluster, this is a timeout for waiting for the expected number of nodes to be present.
Defaults to "5m".

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
|`*ES_NODESELECTOR*`, `*ES_OPS_NODESELECTOR*`
| A node selector that specifies which nodes are eligible targets
for deploying Elasticsearch instances. This can be used to place
these instances on nodes reserved and/or optimized for running them.
For example, the selector could be `*node-type=infrastructure*`. At least
one active node must have this label before Elasticsearch will deploy.

|`*KIBANA_NODESELECTOR*`, `*KIBANA_OPS_NODESELECTOR*`, `*CURATOR_NODESELECTOR*`
| A node selector that specifies which nodes are eligible targets
for deploying Kibana or Curator instances.

|`*FLUENTD_NODESELECTOR*`
| A node selector that specifies which nodes are eligible targets
for deploying Fluentd instances. Defaults to "logging-infra-fluentd=true".

|`*IMAGE_PREFIX*`
|The prefix for logging component images. For example, setting the prefix to
*openshift/origin-* creates *openshift/origin-logging-deployer:v1.2*.

|`*IMAGE_VERSION*`
|The version for logging component images. For example, setting the version to
*v1.2* creates *openshift/origin-logging-deployer:v1.2*.
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
|`*IMAGE_PREFIX*`
|The prefix for logging component images. For example, setting the prefix to
*registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-* creates *registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-logging-deployer:latest*.

|`*IMAGE_VERSION*`
|The version for logging component images. For example, setting the version to
*v3.2* creates *registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-logging-deployer:v3.2*.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
|===
+
Running the deployer creates a deployer pod and prints its name. Wait until the
pod is running. This can take up to a few minutes to retrieve the deployer image
from the registry. You can watch its process with:
+
----
$ oc get pod/<pod_name> -w
----
+
If it seems to be taking too long to start, you can retrieve more details about
the pod and any associated events with:
+
----
$ oc describe pod/<pod_name>
----
+
When it runs, you can check the logs of the resulting pod to see if the
deployment was successful:
+
----
$ oc logs -f <pod_name>
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. As a cluster administrator, deploy the `logging-support-template` template
that the deployer created:
+
====
----
$ oc new-app logging-support-template
----
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Deployment of logging components should begin automatically. However,
because deployment is triggered based on tags being imported into the
ImageStreams created in this step, and not all tags are automatically
imported, this mechanism has become unreliable as multiple versions are
released. Therefore, manual importing may be necessary as follows.

For each ImageStream `logging-auth-proxy`, `logging-kibana`,
`logging-elasticsearch`, and `logging-fluentd`, manually import the
tag corresponding to the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` specified (or defaulted)
for the deployer.

----
$ oc import-image <name>:<version> --from <prefix><name>:<tag>
----

For example:

----
$ oc import-image logging-auth-proxy:3.2.0 \
     --from registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-auth-proxy:3.2.0
$ oc import-image logging-kibana:3.2.0 \
     --from registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-kibana:3.2.0
$ oc import-image logging-elasticsearch:3.2.0 \
     --from registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-elasticsearch:3.2.0
$ oc import-image logging-fluentd:3.2.0 \
     --from registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-fluentd:3.2.0
----
====

endif::openshift-enterprise[]

== Post-deployment Configuration

[[aggregated-elasticsearch]]
=== Elasticsearch

A highly-available environment requires at least three replicas of
Elasticsearch; each on a different host. Elasticsearch replicas require their
own storage, but an OpenShift deployment configuration shares storage volumes
between all its pods. So, when scaled up, the EFK deployer ensures each replica
of Elasticsearch has its own deployment configuration.

*Viewing all Elasticsearch Deployments*

To view all current Elasticsearch deployments:

====
----
$ oc get dc --selector logging-infra=elasticsearch
----
====

[[aggregated-logging-persistent-storage]]
*Persistent Elasticsearch Storage*

The deployer creates an ephemeral deployment in which all of a pod's data is
lost upon restart. For production usage, add a persistent storage volume to each Elasticsearch deployment configuration. 

The following example specifies a volume for an Elasticsearch replica (using a
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volume-claims[PersistentVolumeClaim]):

====
----
$ oc volume dc/logging-es-rca2m9u8 \
          --add --overwrite --name=elasticsearch-storage \
          --type=persistentVolumeClaim --claim-name=logging-es-1
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Any available volume type can be used, such as a host-mount, but the
recommended volume type is a PersistentVolumeClaim.
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[[logging-node-selector]]
*Node Selector*

Because Elasticsearch can use a lot of resources, all members of a cluster
should have low latency network connections to each other. Ensure this by
directing the instances to dedicated nodes, or a dedicated region within your
cluster, using a
link:../admin_guide/managing_projects.html#using-node-selectors[node selector].

To configure a node selector, edit each deployment configuration and add the
`*nodeSelector*` parameter to specify the label of the desired nodes:

====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        nodelabel: logging-es-node-1
----
====

Alternatively you can use the `oc patch` command:
====
----
$ oc patch dc/logging-es-<unique_name> \
   -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"nodeLabel":"logging-es-node-1"}}}}}'
----
====
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

[[scaling-elasticsearch]]
*Changing the Scale of Elasticsearch*

To scale Elasticsearch up, create more deployments. The deployer provides a
template to create Elasticsearch deployments:

====
----
$ oc new-app logging-es-template
----
====

These deployments will be named differently, but all will have the *logging-es*
prefix. You should be aware of the cluster parameters (described in the deployer
parameters) based on cluster size that may need corresponding adjustments in the
template as well as existing deployments.

=== Fluentd

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Once Elasticsearch is running, scale Fluentd to every node to feed logs into
Elasticsearch. The following example is for an OpenShift instance with three
nodes:

====
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-fluentd --replicas=3
----
====

You will need to scale Fluentd if nodes are added or subtracted.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Once Elasticsearch is running, label nodes to enable Fluentd to run on them
and feed logs to Elasticsearch. Use the `*FLUENTD_NODESELECTOR*` given to
the deployer (if different) in the command below:

====
----
$ oc label nodes --all logging-infra-fluentd=true
----
====

endif::openshift-origin[]

=== Kibana

To access the Kibana console from the OpenShift web console, add the
`loggingPublicURL` parameter in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*
file, with the URL of the Kibana console (the `*KIBANA_HOSTNAME*` parameter).
The value must be an HTTPS URL:

====
----
...
assetConfig:
  ...
  loggingPublicURL: "https://kibana.example.com"
...
----
====

Setting the `loggingPublicURL` parameter creates a *View Archive* button on the
OpenShift web console under the *Browse* -> *Pods* -> *<pod_name>* -> *Logs*
tab. This links to the Kibana console.

You can scale the Kibana deployment as usual for redundancy:

====
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-kibana --replicas=2
----
====

You can see the UI by visiting the site specified at the `*KIBANA_HOSTNAME*`
variable.

See the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/4.1/discover.html[Kibana
documentation] for more information on Kibana.

=== Cleanup

You can remove everything generated during the deployment while
leaving other project contents intact:

----
$ oc delete all --selector logging-infra=kibana
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
$ oc delete all --selector logging-infra=fluentd
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
$ oc delete all,daemonsets --selector logging-infra=fluentd
endif::openshift-origin[]
$ oc delete all --selector logging-infra=elasticsearch
$ oc delete all --selector logging-infra=curator
$ oc delete all,sa,oauthclient --selector logging-infra=support
$ oc delete secret logging-fluentd logging-elasticsearch \
    logging-es-proxy logging-kibana logging-kibana-proxy \
    logging-kibana-ops-proxy
----

[[aggregate-logging-upgrading]]
== Upgrading

To upgrade the EFK logging stack, see
link:../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.html#manual-upgrading-efk-logging-stack[Manual
Upgrades].

[[troubleshooting-kibana]]
== Troubleshooting Kibana

Using the Kibana console with OpenShift can cause problems that are easily
solved, but are not accompanied with useful error messages. Check the following
troubleshooting sections if you are experiencing any problems when deploying
Kibana on OpenShift:

*Login Loop*

The OAuth2 proxy on the Kibana console must share a secret with the master
host's OAuth2 server. If the secret is not identical on both servers, it can
cause a login loop where you are continuously redirected back to the Kibana
login page.

To fix this issue, delete the current oauthclient, and create a new one, using the
same template as before:

====
----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
$ oc new-app logging-support-template
----
====

*Cryptic Error When Viewing the Console*

When attempting to visit the Kibana console, you may instead receive a browser
error:

====
----
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"The request is missing a required parameter,
 includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed."}
----
====

This can be caused by a mismatch between the OAuth2 client and server. The
return address for the client must be in a whitelist so the server can securely
redirect back after logging in.

Fix this issue by replacing the OAuth client entry:

====
----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
$ oc new-app logging-support-template
----
====

If the problem persists, check that you are accessing Kibana at a URL listed in
the OAuth client. This issue can be caused by accessing the URL at a forwarded
port, such as 1443 instead of the standard 443 HTTPS port. You can adjust the
server whitelist by editing the OAuth client:

====
----
$ oc edit oauthclient/kibana-proxy
----
====

*503 Error When Viewing the Console*

If you receive a proxy error when viewing the Kibana console, it could be caused
by one of two issues.

First, Kibana may not be recognizing pods. If Elasticsearch is slow in starting
up, Kibana may timeout trying to reach it. Check whether the relevant service
has any endpoints:

====
----
$ oc describe service logging-kibana
Name:                   logging-kibana
[...]
Endpoints:              <none>
----
====

If any Kibana pods are live, endpoints will be listed. If they are not, check
the state of the Kibana pods and deployment. You may need to scale the
deployment down and back up again.

The second possible issue may be caused if the route for accessing the Kibana
service is masked. This can happen if you perform a test deployment in one
project, then deploy in a different project without completely removing the
first deployment. When multiple routes are sent to the same destination, the
default router will only route to the first created. Check the problematic route
to see if it is defined in multiple places:

====
----
$ oc get route  --all-namespaces --selector logging-infra=support
----
====

== External Elasticsearch instance with Fluentd

It is possible to configure the Fluentd pod created with aggregated logging to
connect to an externally hosted Elasticsearch instance.

Fluentd knows where to send its logs to based on the `ES_HOST`, `ES_PORT`,
`OPS_HOST` and `OPS_PORT` environment variables.  If you have an external
Elasticsearch instance that will contain both application and operations logs,
ensure that `ES_HOST` and `OPS_HOST` are the same and that `ES_PORT` and
`OPS_PORT` are also the same.  Fluentd is configured to send its application logs
to the `ES_HOST` destination and all of its operations logs to `OPS_HOST`.

If your externally hosted Elasticsearch does not make use of TLS you will need to
update the `*_CLIENT_CERT`, `*_CLIENT_KEY` and `*_CA` variables to be empty. If
it uses TLS but not Mutual TLS, update the `*_CLIENT_CERT` and `*_CLIENT_KEY`
variables to be empty and patch or recreate the `logging-fluentd` secret with
the appropriate `*_CA` for communicating with your Elasticsearch.  If it uses
Mutual TLS as the provided Elasticsearch does, you will just need to patch or
recreate the `logging-fluentd` secret with your client key, client cert, and CA.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Since Fluentd is deployed by means of a DaemonSet you will need to update the
`logging-fluentd-template` template, delete your current DaemonSet and recreate
it with `oc new-app logging-fluentd-template` after seeing all previous Fluentd
pods have terminated.
endif::openshift-origin[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
You can use `oc edit dc/logging-fluentd` to update your Fluentd configuration.
It is advised that you first scale down your number of replicas to 0 before
editing the DeploymentConfig.
enddef::openshift-enterprise[]

[NOTE]
====
If you are not using the provided Kibana and Elasticsearch images, you will not
have the same multi-tenant capabilities and your data will not be restricted by
user access to a particular project.
