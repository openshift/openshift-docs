== Overview

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can deploy the EFK stack to
aggregate logs for a range of {product-title} services. Application developers
can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access. The EFK stack
aggregates logs from hosts and applications, whether coming from multiple
containers or even deleted pods.

The EFK stack is a modified version of the
https://www.elastic.co/videos/introduction-to-the-elk-stack[ELK stack] and is
comprised of:

* https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch]: An object store where all logs are stored.
* http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd]: Gathers logs from nodes and feeds them to Elasticsearch.
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana]: A web UI for Elasticsearch.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/about.html[Curator]: Removes old logs from Elasticsearch.
endif::openshift-origin[]

Once deployed in a cluster, the stack aggregates logs from all nodes and
projects into Elasticsearch, and provides a Kibana UI to view any logs. Cluster
administrators can view all logs, but application developers can only view logs
for projects they have permission to view. The stack components communicate
securely.

[NOTE]
====
xref:../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#managing-docker-container-logs[Managing
Docker Container Logs] discusses the use of `json-file` logging driver options
to manage container logs and prevent filling node disks.
====

== Pre-deployment Configuration

. Ensure that you have deployed a router for the cluster.
. Ensure that you have xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[the
necessary storage] for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch replica
requires its own storage volume. See
xref:aggregated-elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] for more information.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Ansible-based installs should create the *logging-deployer-template*
template in the *openshift* project.
Otherwise you can create it with the following command:
+
====
----
$ oc apply -n openshift -f \
    /usr/share/openshift/examples/infrastructure-templates/enterprise/logging-deployer.yaml
----
====
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. If your installation did not create templates in the *openshift* namespace, the
*logging-deployer-template* and *logging-deployer-account-template* templates
may not exist. In that case you can create them with the following command:
+
====
----
$ oc apply -n openshift -f \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging/master/deployer/deployer.yaml
----
====
endif::openshift-origin[]
. Create a new project. Once implemented in a single project, the EFK stack
collects logs for every project within your {product-title} cluster. The
examples in this topic use *logging* as an example project:
+
====
----
$ oadm new-project logging --node-selector=""
$ oc project logging
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Specifying an empty
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#using-node-selectors[node
selector] on the project is recommended, as Fluentd should be deployed
throughout the cluster and any selector would restrict where it is
deployed. To control component placement, specify node selectors per component to
be applied to their deployment configurations.
====

. Create the logging xref:../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service
accounts] and custom roles:
+
----
$ oc new-app logging-deployer-account-template
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you deployed logging previously, for example in a different project, then
it is normal for the cluster roles to fail to be created because they already exist.
====

. Enable the deployer service account to create an OAuthClient (normally
a cluster administrator privilege) for Kibana to use later when authenticating
against the master.
+
====
----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user oauth-editor \
       system:serviceaccount:logging:logging-deployer <1>
----
<1> Use the project you created earlier (for example, *logging*) when specifying
this service account.
====

. Enable the Fluentd service account to mount and read system logs by adding
it to the *privileged* security context, and also enable it to read pod metadata
by giving it the *cluster-reader* role:
+
====
----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged  \
    system:serviceaccount:logging:aggregated-logging-fluentd <1>
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader \
    system:serviceaccount:logging:aggregated-logging-fluentd <1>
----
<1> Use the project you created earlier (for example, *logging*) when specifying
this service account.
====

[[aggregate-logging-specifying-deployer-parameters]]
== Specifying Deployer Parameters

Parameters for the EFK deployment may be specified in the
form of a xref:../dev_guide/configmaps.adoc#dev-guide-configmaps[ConfigMap],
a xref:../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secret],
or template parameters (which are passed to the deployer in
environment variables). The deployer looks for each value first in a
*logging-deployer* ConfigMap, then a *logging-deployer* secret, then as
an environment variable. Any or all may be omitted if not needed.

The available parameters are outlined below. Typically, you should at
least specify the host name at which Kibana should be exposed to client
browsers, and also the master URL where client browsers will be directed to
for authenticating to {product-title}.

. Create a xref:../dev_guide/configmaps.adoc#dev-guide-configmaps[ConfigMap] to
provide most deployer parameters. An invocation supplying the most important
parameters might be:
+
----
$ oc create configmap logging-deployer \
   --from-literal kibana-hostname=kibana.example.com \
   --from-literal public-master-url=https://master.example.com:8443 \
   --from-literal es-cluster-size=3 \
   --from-literal es-instance-ram=8G
----
+
. Edit the ConfigMap YAML file after creating it:
+
----
$ oc edit configmap logging-deployer
----
+
Other parameters are available. Read the
xref:aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregated-elasticsearch[ElasticSearch
section] before choosing ElasticSearch parameters for the deployer,
and the xref:aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregated-fluentd[Fluentd section]
for some possible parameters:
+
[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description

|*_kibana-hostname_*
|The external host name for web clients to reach Kibana.

|*_public-master-url_*
|The external URL for the master; used for OAuth purposes.

|*_es-cluster-size_* (default: 1)
|The number of instances of
Elasticsearch to deploy. Redundancy requires at least three, and more can be
used for scaling.

|*_es-instance-ram_* (default: 8G)
|Amount of RAM to reserve per Elasticsearch instance. The default is 8G (for 8GB), and it
must be at least 512M. Possible suffixes are G,g,M,m.

|*_es-pvc-prefix_* (default: *logging-es-*)
|Prefix for the names of persistent volume claims to be used as storage for
Elasticsearch instances; a number will be appended per instance (for example,
*logging-es-1*). If they do not already exist, they will be created with size
*_es-pvc-size_*.

|*_es-pvc-size_*
|Size of the persistent volume claim to create per ElasticSearch instance, 100G,
for example. If omitted, no PVCs are created and ephemeral volumes are used instead.

|*_es-pvc-dynamic_*
|Set to `*true*` to have created persistent volume claims annotated so that their
backing storage can be dynamically provisioned (if that is available for your
cluster).

|*_storage-group_*
|Number of a supplemental group ID for access to Elasticsearch storage volumes;
backing volumes should allow access by this group ID (defaults to 65534).

a|*_fluentd-nodeselector_* (default: *logging-infra-fluentd=true*)
| A node selector that specifies which nodes are eligible targets
for deploying Fluentd instances.
All nodes where Fluentd should run (typically, all) must have this label
before Fluentd will be able to run and collect logs.

|*_es-nodeselector_*
| A node selector that specifies which nodes are eligible targets
for deploying Elasticsearch instances. This can be used to place
these instances on nodes reserved and/or optimized for running them.
For example, the selector could be `*node-type=infrastructure*`. At least
one active node must have this label before Elasticsearch will deploy.

|*_kibana-nodeselector_*
| A node selector that specifies which nodes are eligible targets
for deploying Kibana instances.

|*_curator-nodeselector_*
| A node selector that specifies which nodes are eligible targets
for deploying Curator instances.

|*_enable-ops-cluster_*
|If set to `*true*`, configures a second Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana for
operations logs. Fluentd splits
logs between the main cluster and a cluster reserved for operations
logs (which consists of *_/var/log/messages_* on nodes and the logs from the
projects *default*, *openshift*, and *openshift-infra*).
This means a second Elasticsearch and Kibana are deployed. The deployments
are distinguishable by the *-ops* included in their names and have parallel
deployment options listed below.

|*_kibana-ops-hostname, es-ops-instance-ram, es-ops-pvc-size, es-ops-pvc-prefix, es-ops-cluster-size, es-ops-nodeselector, kibana-ops-nodeselector, curator-ops-nodeselector_*
|Parallel parameters for the ops log cluster.

|*_image-pull-secret_*
|Specify the name of an existing pull secret to be used for pulling component
images from an authenticated registry.
|===

. Create a xref:../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secret] to provide security-related files to the deployer. The contents of the secret are optional, and will be randomly generated if not supplied.
+
You can supply the following files when creating a new secret, for example:
+
----
$ oc create secret generic logging-deployer \
   --from-file kibana.crt=/path/to/cert \
   --from-file kibana.key=/path/to/key
----
+
[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|File Name
|Description

|*_kibana.crt_*
|A browser-facing certificate for the Kibana server.

|*_kibana.key_*
|A key to be used with the Kibana certificate.

|*_kibana-ops.crt_*
|A browser-facing certificate for the Ops Kibana server.

|*_kibana-ops.key_*
|A key to be used with the Ops Kibana certificate.

|*_server-tls.json_*
|JSON TLS options to override the Kibana server defaults. Refer to
https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback[Node.JS] docs
for available options.

|*_ca.crt_*
|A certificate for a CA that will be used to sign all certificates generated by
the deployer.

|*_ca.key_*
|A matching CA key.
|===

[[deploying-the-efk-stack]]
== Deploying the EFK Stack

The EFK stack is deployed using a
xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template] to
create a deployer pod that reads the deployment parameters and manages
the deployment.

Run the deployer, optionally specifying parameters (described in the table
below), for example:

====
Without template parameters:

----
$ oc new-app logging-deployer-template
----

With parameters:

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oc new-app logging-deployer-template \
             --param IMAGE_VERSION=v1.2.0 \
             --param MODE=install
----
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oc new-app logging-deployer-template \
             --param IMAGE_VERSION=3.3.0 \
             --param MODE=install
----
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
====

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter Name
|Description

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
|*_IMAGE_PREFIX_*
|The prefix for logging component images. For example, setting the prefix to
*openshift/origin-* creates *openshift/origin-logging-deployer:v1.2*.

|*_IMAGE_VERSION_*
|The version for logging component images. For example, setting the version to
*v1.2* creates *openshift/origin-logging-deployer:v1.2*.
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
|*_IMAGE_PREFIX_*
|The prefix for logging component images. For example, setting the prefix to
*registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/* creates *registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-deployer:latest*.

|*_IMAGE_VERSION_*
|The version for logging component images. For example, setting the version to
*v3.3* creates *registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-deployer:v3.3*.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

|*_MODE_* (default: *install*)
| Mode to run the deployer in; one of `*install, uninstall, reinstall, upgrade, migrate, start, stop*`.
|===

Running the deployer creates a deployer pod and prints its name. Wait until the
pod is running. This can take up to a few minutes for {product-title} to
retrieve the deployer image from the registry. Watch its process with:

----
$ oc get pod/<pod_name> -w
----

It will eventually enter *Running* status and end in *Complete* status. If takes
too long to start, retrieve more details about the pod and any associated events
with:

----
$ oc describe pod/<pod_name>
----

Check the logs if the deployment does not complete successfully:

----
$ oc logs -f <pod_name>
----

Once deployment completes successfully, you may need to
xref:aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregated-fluentd[label the nodes for
Fluentd to deploy on], and may have other adjustments to make to the
deployed components. These tasks are described in the next section.

[[aggregate-logging-understanding-the-deployment]]
== Understanding and Adjusting the Deployment
This section describes adjustments that you can make to deployed components.

[[aggregated-ops]]
=== Ops Cluster

[NOTE]
====
The logs for the *default*, *openshift*, and *openshift-infra* projects are
automatically aggregated and grouped into the *.operations* item in the Kibana
interface.

The project where you have deployed the EFK stack (*logging*, as documented
here) is _not_ aggregated into *.operations* and is found under its ID.
====

If you set `*enable-ops-cluster*` to *true* for the deployer, Fluentd is
configured to split logs between the main ElasticSearch cluster and another
cluster reserved for operations logs (which are defined as node system logs and
the projects *default*, *openshift*, and *openshift-infra*). Therefore, a
separate Elasticsearch cluster, a separate Kibana, and a separate Curator are
deployed to index, access, and manage operations logs. These deployments are set
apart with names that include `-ops`. Keep these separate deployments in mind if
you enabled this option. Most of the following discussion also applies to the
operations cluster if present, just with the names changed to include `-ops`.

[[aggregated-elasticsearch]]
=== Elasticsearch

A highly-available environment requires at least three replicas of
Elasticsearch; each on a different host. Elasticsearch replicas require their
own storage, but an {product-title} deployment configuration shares storage
volumes between all its pods. So, when scaled up, the EFK deployer ensures each
replica of Elasticsearch has its own deployment configuration.

It is possible to scale your cluster up after creation by adding more
deployments from a template; however, scaling up (or down) requires
the correct procedure and an awareness of clustering parameters (to be
described in a separate section). It is best to indicate the
desired scale at first deployment.

Refer to
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/hardware.html[Elastic's
documentation] for considerations involved in choosing storage and
network location as directed below.

*Viewing all Elasticsearch Deployments*

To view all current Elasticsearch deployments:

====
----
$ oc get dc --selector logging-infra=elasticsearch
----
====

[[logging-node-selector]]
*Node Selector*

Because Elasticsearch can use a lot of resources, all members of a cluster
should have low latency network connections to each other and to any remote
storage. Ensure this by directing the instances to dedicated nodes, or a
dedicated region within your cluster, using a
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#using-node-selectors[node selector].

To configure a node selector, specify the `*es-nodeselector*` configuration
option at deployment. This applies to all Elasticsearch deployments; if you need
to individualize the node selectors, you must manually edit each deployment
configuration after deployment.

[[aggregated-logging-persistent-storage]]
*Persistent Elasticsearch Storage*

By default, the deployer creates an ephemeral deployment in which all of a pod's
data is lost upon restart. For production usage, specify a persistent storage
volume for each Elasticsearch deployment configuration. You can create
the necessary
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volume-claims[persistent
volume claims] before deploying or have them created for you. The PVCs must be
named based on the `*es-pvc-prefix*` setting, which defaults to `logging-es-`;
each PVC name will have a sequence number added to it, so `logging-es-1`,
`logging-es-2`, and so on. If a PVC needed for the deployment exists already, it
is used; if not, and `*es-pvc-size*` has been specified, it is created with a
request for that size.

[WARNING]
====
Using NFS storage as a volume or a persistent volume (or via NAS such as
Gluster) is not supported for Elasticsearch storage, as Lucene relies on file
system behavior that NFS does not supply. Data corruption and other problems can
occur. If NFS storage is a requirement, you can allocate a large file on a
volume to serve as a storage device and mount it locally on one host.
For example, if your NFS storage volume is mounted at *_/nfs/storage_*:

----
$ truncate -s 1T /nfs/storage/elasticsearch-1
$ mkfs.xfs /nfs/storage/elasticsearch-1
$ mount -o loop /nfs/storage/elasticsearch-1 /usr/local/es-storage
$ chown 1000:1000 /usr/local/es-storage
----

Then, use *_/usr/local/es-storage_* as a host-mount as described below.
Use a different backing file as storage for each Elasticsearch replica.

This loopback must be maintained manually outside of {product-title}, on the
node. You must not maintain it from inside a container.
====

It is possible to use a local disk volume (if available) on each
node host as storage for an Elasticsearch replica. Doing so requires
some preparation as follows.

. The relevant service account must be given the privilege to mount and edit a
local volume:
+
====
----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged  \
       system:serviceaccount:logging:aggregated-logging-elasticsearch <1>
----
<1> Use the project you created earlier (for example, *logging*) when specifying
this service account.
====

. Each Elasticsearch replica definition must be patched to claim that privilege,
for example:
+
----
$ for dc in $(oc get deploymentconfig --selector logging-infra=elasticsearch -o name); do
    oc scale $dc --replicas=0
    oc patch $dc \
       -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"elasticsearch","securityContext":{"privileged": true}}]}}}}'
  done
----

. The Elasticsearch replicas must be located on the correct nodes to use the local
storage, and should not move around even if those nodes are taken down for a
period of time. This requires giving each Elasticsearch replica a node selector
that is unique to a node where an administrator has allocated storage for it. To
configure a node selector, edit each Elasticsearch deployment configuration and
add or edit the *nodeSelector* section to specify a unique label that you have
applied for each desired node:
+
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        logging-es-node: "1" <1>
----
<1> This label should uniquely identify a replica with a single node that bears that
label, in this case `*logging-es-node=1*`. Use the `oc label` command to apply
labels to nodes as needed.

To automate applying the node selector you can instead use the `oc patch` command:

----
$ oc patch dc/logging-es-<suffix> \
   -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"logging-es-node":"1"}}}}}'
----
====

. Once these steps are taken, a local host mount can be applied to each replica
as in this example (where we assume storage is mounted at the same path on each node):
+
----
$ for dc in $(oc get deploymentconfig --selector logging-infra=elasticsearch -o name); do
    oc set volume $dc \
          --add --overwrite --name=elasticsearch-storage \
          --type=hostPath --path=/usr/local/es-storage
    oc deploy --latest $dc
    oc scale $dc --replicas=1
  done
----

[[scaling-elasticsearch]]
*Changing the Scale of Elasticsearch*

If you need to scale up the number of Elasticsearch instances your cluster uses,
it is not as simple as scaling up an Elasticsearch deployment configuration.
This is due to the nature of persistent volumes and how Elasticsearch is
configured to store its data and recover the cluster. Instead, scaling up
requires creating a deployment configuration for each Elasticsearch cluster
node.

By far the simplest way to change the scale of Elasticsearch is to
reinstall the whole deployment. Assuming you have supplied persistent
storage for the deployment, this should not be very disruptive. Simply
re-run the deployer with the updated `*es-cluster-size*` configuration
value and the `*MODE=reinstall*` template parameter. For example:

----
$ oc edit configmap logging-deployer
  [change es-cluster-size value to 5]
$ oc new-app logging-deployer-template --param MODE=reinstall
----

If you previously deployed using template parameters rather than a ConfigMap,
this would be a good time to create a ConfigMap instead for future deployer
execution.

If you do not wish to reinstall, for instance because you have made
customizations that you would like to preserve, then it is possible to add new
Elasticsearch deployment configurations to the cluster using a template supplied
by the deployer. This requires a more complicated procedure however.

During installation, the deployer
xref:../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[creates
templates] with the Elasticsearch configurations provided to it:
`logging-es-template` (and `logging-es-ops-template` if the deployer was run
with `*ENABLE_OPS_CLUSTER=true*`). You can use these for scaling, but you need
to adjust the size-related parameters in the templates:

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description

|`*NODE_QUORUM*`
|The quorum required to elect a new master. Should be more than half the intended cluster size.

|`*RECOVER_AFTER_NODES*`
|When restarting the cluster, require this many nodes to be present before starting recovery.
Defaults to one less than the cluster size to allow for one missing node.

|`*RECOVER_EXPECTED_NODES*`
|When restarting the cluster, wait for this number of nodes to be present before starting recovery.
By default, the same as the cluster size.
|===

The node quorum and recovery settings in the template were set based on the
`*es-[ops-]cluster-size*` value initially provided to the deployer. Since the
cluster size is changing, those values need to be overridden.

. The existing deployment configurations for that cluster also need to have the
three environment variable values above updated. To edit each of the
configurations for the cluster in series, you may use the following command:
+
====
----
$ oc edit $(oc get dc -l component=es[-ops] -o name)
----
====
+
Edit the environment variables supplied so that the next time they restart,
they will begin with the correct values. For example, for a cluster of size
5, you would set `*NODE_QUORUM*` to `3`, `*RECOVER_AFTER_NODES*` to `4`, and
`*RECOVER_EXPECTED_NODES*` to `5`.

. Create additional deployment configurations by running the following command
against the Elasticsearch cluster you want to to scale up for
(`logging-es-template` or `logging-es-ops-template`), overriding the parameters
as above.
+
====
----
$ oc new-app logging-es[-ops]-template \
     --param NODE_QUORUM=3 \
     --param RECOVER_AFTER_NODES=4 \
     --param RECOVER_EXPECTED_NODES=5
----
====
+
These deployments will be named differently, but all will have the `logging-es`
prefix.

. Each new deployment configuration is created without a persistent volume. If you
want to attach a persistent volume to it, after creation you can use the `oc set
volume` command to do so, for example:
+
----
$ oc volume dc/logging-es-<suffix> \
          --add --overwrite --name=elasticsearch-storage \
          --type=persistentVolumeClaim --claim-name=<your_pvc>
----

. After the intended number of deployment configurations are created, scale up
each new one to deploy it:
+
----
$ oc scale --replicas=1 dc/logging-es-<suffix>
----

[[aggregated-fluentd]]
=== Fluentd

Fluentd is deployed as a DaemonSet that deploys replicas according to a node
label selector (which you can specify with the deployer parameter
`*fluentd-nodeselector*`; the default is `logging-infra-fluentd`).

Once you have ElasticSearch running as desired, label the nodes intended for
Fluentd deployment to feed their logs into ES. The example below would label a
node named `node.example.com` using the default Fluentd node selector:

----
$ oc label node/node.example.com logging-infra-fluentd=true
----

Alternatively, you can label all nodes with:

----
$ oc label node --all logging-infra-fluentd=true
----

[NOTE]
====
Labeling nodes requires cluster administrator capability.
====

[[fluentd-use-journald]]
*Having Fluentd Use the Systemd Journal as the Log Source*

By default, Fluentd reads from *_/var/log/messages_* and
*_/var/log/containers/<container>.log_* for system logs and container logs,
respectively. You can instead use the systemd journal as the log source. There
are three deployer configuration parameters available in the deployer ConfigMap:

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description

| `*use-journal*`
|The default is empty, which tells the deployer to have Fluentd check which log
driver Docker is using. If Docker is using `--log-driver=journald`, Fluentd
reads from the systemd journal, otherwise, it assumes docker is using the
`json-file` log driver and reads from the *_/var/log_* file sources. You can
specify the `*use-journal*` option as `true` or `false` to be explicit about
which log source to use. Using the systemd journal requires `docker-1.10` or
later, and Docker must be configured to use `--log-driver=journald`.

| `*journal-source*`
|The default is empty, so that when using the systemd journal, Fluentd first looks for
*_/var/log/journal_*, and if that is not available, uses *_/run/log/journal_*
as the journal source. You can specify `*journal-source*` with an explicit
journal path. For example, if you want Fluentd to always read logs
from the transient in-memory journal, set `*journal-source*`=*_/run/log/journal_*.

| `*journal-read-from-head*`
|If this setting is *false*, Fluentd starts reading from the end of the journal,
ignoring historical logs. If this setting is *true*, Fluentd starts reading
logs from the beginning of the journal.
|===

[NOTE]
====
As of {product-title} 3.3, Fluentd no longer reads historical log files when using the
json-file log driver. This is to avoid delays pushing into Elasticsearch the most recent logs
on clusters that have a large number of log files that are older then the EFK deployment, and to 
mitigate Curator deleting logs shortly after they are added to Elasticsearch.
====

[NOTE]
====
It may require several minutes, or hours, depending on the size of your
journal, before any new log entries are available in Elasticsearch, when using
`journal-read-from-head=true`.
====

[[fluentd-log-external-elasticsearch]]
*Having Fluentd Send Logs to Another Elasticsearch*

You can configure Fluentd to send a copy of each log message to both the
Elasticsearch instance included with {product-title} aggregated logging, _and_
to an external Elasticsearch instance. For example, if you already have an
Elasticsearch instance set up for auditing purposes, or data warehousing, you
can send a copy of each log message to that Elasticsearch.

This feature is controlled via environment variables on Fluentd, which can be
modified as described below.

If its environment variable `*ES_COPY*` is *true*, Fluentd sends a copy of the
logs to another Elasticsearch. The names for the copy variables are just like
the current `*ES_HOST*`, `*OPS_HOST*`, and other variables, except that they add
`_COPY`: `*ES_COPY_HOST*`, `*OPS_COPY_HOST*`, and so on. There are some
additional parameters added:

* `*ES_COPY_SCHEME*`, `*OPS_COPY_SCHEME*` - can use either `http` or `https` - defaults
  to `https`

[[fluentd-throttling]]
*Throttling logs in Fluentd*

For projects that are especially verbose, an administrator can throttle down the
rate at which the logs are read in by Fluentd before being processed.

[WARNING]
====
Throttling can contribute to log aggregation falling behind for the configured
projects; log entries can be lost if a pod is deleted before Fluentd catches up.
====

[NOTE]
====
Throttling does not work when using the systemd journal as the log
source. The throttling implementation depends on being able to throttle the
reading of the individual log files for each project. When reading from the
journal, there is only a single log source, no log files, so no file-based
throttling is available. There is not a method of restricting the log
entries that are read into the Fluentd process.
====

To tell Fluentd which projects it should be restricting, edit the throttle
configuration in its ConfigMap after deployment:

----
$ oc edit configmap/logging-fluentd
----

The format of the *_throttle-config.yaml_* key is a YAML file that contains
project names and the desired rate at which logs are read in on each
node. The default is 1000 lines at a time per node. For example:

====
----
logging:
  read_lines_limit: 500

test-project:
  read_lines_limit: 10

.operations:
  read_lines_limit: 100
----

[[aggregate-logging-kibana]]
=== Kibana

To access the Kibana console from the {product-title} web console, add the
`*loggingPublicURL*` parameter in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*
file, with the URL of the Kibana console (the `*kibana-hostname*` parameter).
The value must be an HTTPS URL:

====
----
...
assetConfig:
  ...
  loggingPublicURL: "https://kibana.example.com"
...
----
====

Setting the `*loggingPublicURL*` parameter creates a *View Archive* button on the
{product-title} web console under the *Browse* -> *Pods* -> *<pod_name>* ->
*Logs* tab. This links to the Kibana console.

You can scale the Kibana deployment as usual for redundancy:

====
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-kibana --replicas=2
----
====

You can see the user interface by visiting the site specified at the
`*KIBANA_HOSTNAME*` variable.

See the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/4.1/discover.html[Kibana
documentation] for more information on Kibana.

[[configuring-curator]]
=== Curator

Curator allows administrators to configure scheduled Elasticsearch maintenance
operations to be performed automatically on a per-project basis. It is scheduled
to perform actions daily based on its configuration. Only one Curator pod is
recommended per Elasticsearch cluster. Curator is configured via a YAML
configuration file with the following structure:

====
----
$PROJECT_NAME:
  $ACTION:
    $UNIT: $VALUE

$PROJECT_NAME:
  $ACTION:
    $UNIT: $VALUE
 ...

----
====

The available parameters are:

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`*$PROJECT_NAME*`
|The actual name of a project, such as *myapp-devel*. For {product-title} *operations*
logs, use the name `.operations` as the project name.

|`*$ACTION*`
|The action to take, currently only `delete` is allowed.

|`*$UNIT*`
|One of `days`, `weeks`, or `months`.

|`*$VALUE*`
|An integer for the number of units.

|`*.defaults*`
|Use `.defaults` as the `*$PROJECT_NAME*` to set the defaults for projects that are
not specified.

|`*runhour*`
|(Number) the hour of the day in 24-hour format at which to run the Curator jobs. For
use with `.defaults`.

|`*runminute*`
|(Number) the minute of the hour at which to run the Curator jobs. For use with `.defaults`.
|===

For example, to configure Curator to:

- delete indices in the *myapp-dev* project older than `1 day`
- delete indices in the *myapp-qe* project older than `1 week`
- delete *operations* logs older than `8 weeks`
- delete all other projects indices after they are `30 days` old
- run the Curator jobs at midnight every day

Use:

----
myapp-dev:
 delete:
   days: 1

myapp-qe:
  delete:
    weeks: 1

.operations:
  delete:
    weeks: 8

.defaults:
  delete:
    days: 30
  runhour: 0
  runminute: 0
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
When you use `month` as the `*$UNIT*` for an operation, Curator starts counting at
the first day of the current month, not the current day of the current month.
For example, if today is April 15, and you want to delete indices that are 2 months
older than today (delete: months: 2), Curator does not delete indices that are dated
older than February 15; it deletes indices older than February 1. That is, it
goes back to the first day of the current month, then goes back two whole months
from that date. If you want to be exact with Curator, it is best to use days
(for example, `delete: days: 30`).
====

[[aggregate-logging-creating-the-curator-configuration]]
==== Creating the Curator Configuration

The deployer provides a ConfigMap from which Curator reads its
configuration.  You may edit or replace this ConfigMap to reconfigure
Curator. Currently the `logging-curator` ConfigMap is used to
configure both your ops and non-ops Curator instances. Any `.operations`
configurations will be in the same location as your application logs
configurations.

. To edit the provided ConfigMap to configure your Curator instances:
+
----
$ oc edit configmap/logging-curator
----

. To replace the provided ConfigMap instead:
+
----
$ create /path/to/mycuratorconfig.yaml
$ oc create configmap logging-curator -o yaml \
  --from-file=config.yaml=/path/to/mycuratorconfig.yaml | \
  oc replace -f -
----

. After you make your changes, redeploy Curator:
+
----
$ oc deploy --latest dc/logging-curator
$ oc deploy --latest dc/logging-curator-ops

[[troubleshooting-kibana]]
== Troubleshooting Kibana

Using the Kibana console with {product-title} can cause problems that are easily
solved, but are not accompanied with useful error messages. Check the following
troubleshooting sections if you are experiencing any problems when deploying
Kibana on {product-title}:

*Login Loop*

The OAuth2 proxy on the Kibana console must share a secret with the master
host's OAuth2 server. If the secret is not identical on both servers, it can
cause a login loop where you are continuously redirected back to the Kibana
login page.

To fix this issue, delete the current OAuthClient, and create a new one, using the
same template as before:

====
----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
$ oc new-app logging-support-template
----
====

*Cryptic Error When Viewing the Console*

When attempting to visit the Kibana console, you may receive a browser
error instead:

====
----
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"The request is missing a required parameter,
 includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed."}
----
====

This can be caused by a mismatch between the OAuth2 client and server. The
return address for the client must be in a whitelist so the server can securely
redirect back after logging in.

Fix this issue by replacing the OAuthClient entry:

====
----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
$ oc new-app logging-support-template
----
====

If the problem persists, check that you are accessing Kibana at a URL listed in
the OAuth client. This issue can be caused by accessing the URL at a forwarded
port, such as 1443 instead of the standard 443 HTTPS port. You can adjust the
server whitelist by editing the OAuth client:

====
----
$ oc edit oauthclient/kibana-proxy
----
====

*503 Error When Viewing the Console*

If you receive a proxy error when viewing the Kibana console, it could be caused
by one of two issues.

First, Kibana may not be recognizing pods. If Elasticsearch is slow in starting
up, Kibana may timeout trying to reach it. Check whether the relevant service
has any endpoints:

====
----
$ oc describe service logging-kibana
Name:                   logging-kibana
[...]
Endpoints:              <none>
----
====

If any Kibana pods are live, endpoints will be listed. If they are not, check
the state of the Kibana pods and deployment. You may need to scale the
deployment down and back up again.

The second possible issue may be caused if the route for accessing the Kibana
service is masked. This can happen if you perform a test deployment in one
project, then deploy in a different project without completely removing the
first deployment. When multiple routes are sent to the same destination, the
default router will only route to the first created. Check the problematic route
to see if it is defined in multiple places:

====
----
$ oc get route  --all-namespaces --selector logging-infra=support
----
====

[[sending-logs-to-an-external-elasticsearch-instance]]
== Sending Logs to an External Elasticsearch Instance

Fluentd sends logs to the value of the `*ES_HOST*`, `*ES_PORT*`, `*OPS_HOST*`,
and `*OPS_PORT*` environment variables of the Elasticsearch deployment
configuration. The application logs are directed to the `*ES_HOST*` destination,
and operations logs to `*OPS_HOST*`.

To direct logs to a specific Elasticsearch instance, edit the deployment
configuration and replace the value of the above variables with the desired
instance:

----
$ oc edit dc/<deployment_configuration>
----

For an external Elasticsearch instance to contain both application and
operations logs, you can set `*ES_HOST*` and `*OPS_HOST*` to the same destination,
while ensuring that `*ES_PORT*` and `*OPS_PORT*` also have the same value.

If your externally hosted Elasticsearch instance does not use TLS, update the
`*_CLIENT_CERT*`, `*_CLIENT_KEY*`, and `*_CA*` variables to be empty. If it does
use TLS, but not mutual TLS, update the `*_CLIENT_CERT*` and `*_CLIENT_KEY*`
variables to be empty and patch or recreate the *logging-fluentd* secret with
the appropriate `*_CA*` value for communicating with your Elasticsearch instance.
If it uses Mutual TLS as the provided Elasticsearch instance does, patch or
recreate the *logging-fluentd* secret with your client key, client cert, and CA.

Since Fluentd is deployed by a DaemonSet, update the
*logging-fluentd-template* template, delete your current DaemonSet, and recreate
it with `oc new-app logging-fluentd-template` after seeing all previous Fluentd
pods have terminated.

[NOTE]
====
If you are not using the provided Kibana and Elasticsearch images, you will not
have the same multi-tenant capabilities and your data will not be restricted by
user access to a particular project.

[[aggregate-logging-performing-elasticsearch-maintenance-operations]]
== Performing Administrative Elasticsearch Operations

As of the Deployer version
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.2.0,
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.2.0,
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
an administrator certificate, key, and CA that can be used to communicate with and perform
administrative operations on Elasticsearch are provided within the
*logging-elasticsearch* secret.

[NOTE]
====
To confirm whether or not your EFK installation provides these, run:
----
$ oc describe secret logging-elasticsearch
----
====

If they are not available, refer to
xref:../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#manual-upgrading-efk-logging-stack[Manual
Upgrades] to ensure you are on the latest version first.

. Connect to an Elasticsearch pod that is in the cluster on which you are
attempting to perform maintenance.

. To find a pod in a cluster use either:
+
====
----
$ oc get pods -l component=es -o name | head -1
$ oc get pods -l component=es-ops -o name | head -1
----
====

. Connect to a pod:
+
====
----
$ oc rsh <your_Elasticsearch_pod>
----
====

. Once connected to an Elasticsearch container, you can use the certificates mounted
from the secret to communicate with Elasticsearch per its 1.5
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.5/docs.html[Document APIs].
+
Fluentd sends its logs to Elasticsearch using the index format *{project_name}.{project_uuid}.YYYY.MM.DD*
where YYYY.MM.DD is the date of the log record.
+
For example, to delete all logs for the *logging* project with uuid *3b3594fa-2ccd-11e6-acb7-0eb6b35eaee3*
from June 15, 2016, we can run:
+
====
----
$ curl --key /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-key \
  --cert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-cert \
  --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-ca -XDELETE \
  "https://localhost:9200/logging.3b3594fa-2ccd-11e6-acb7-0eb6b35eaee3.2016.06.15"
