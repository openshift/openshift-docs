== Overview

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can deploy the EFK stack to
aggregate logs for a range of {product-title} services. Application developers
can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access. The EFK stack
aggregates logs from hosts and applications, whether coming from multiple
containers or even deleted pods.

The EFK stack is a modified version of the
https://www.elastic.co/videos/introduction-to-the-elk-stack[ELK stack] and is
comprised of:

* https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch (ES)]: An object store where all logs are stored.
* http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd]: Gathers logs from nodes and feeds them to Elasticsearch.
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana]: A web UI for Elasticsearch.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/about.html[Curator]: Removes old logs from Elasticsearch.
endif::openshift-origin[]

After deployment in a cluster, the stack aggregates logs from all nodes and
projects into Elasticsearch, and provides a Kibana UI to view any logs. Cluster
administrators can view all logs, but application developers can only view logs
for projects they have permission to view. The stack components communicate
securely.

[NOTE]
====
xref:../install/host_preparation.adoc#managing-docker-container-logs[Managing
Docker Container Logs] discusses the use of `json-file` logging driver options
to manage container logs and prevent filling node disks.

[[aggregate-logging-pre-deployment-configuration]]
== Pre-deployment Configuration

. An Ansible playbook is available to deploy and upgrade aggregated logging. You
should familiarize yourself with the
xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[Installing Clusters] guide. This
provides information for preparing to use Ansible and includes information about
configuration. Parameters are added to the Ansible inventory file to configure
various areas of the EFK stack.
. Review the xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging_sizing.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging-sizing[sizing guidelines]
to determine how best to configure your deployment.
. Ensure that you have deployed a router for the cluster.
. Ensure that you have
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[the
necessary storage] for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch node
requires its own storage volume. See
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregated-elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] for more information.
. Determine if you need xref:ha-elasticsearch[highly-available Elasticsearch].
A highly-available environment requires at least three Elasticsearch nodes, each on a different
host. By default, {product-title} creates one shard for each index and zero replicas
of those shards. High availability also requires multiple replicas of each shard.
To create high availability, set the xref:aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[`openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas` Ansible variable]
to a value higher than `1`. See xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregated-elasticsearch[Elasticsearch]
for more information.

[[aggregate-logging-ansible-variables]]
== Specifying Logging Ansible Variables

You can override the https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/master/roles/openshift_logging/defaults/main.yml[default parameter values]
by specifying parameters for the EFK deployment in the
 xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[inventory host file].

Read the xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregated-elasticsearch[Elasticsearch]
and the xref:aggregated-fluentd[Fluentd] sections
before choosing parameters:

[NOTE]
====
By default, the Elasticsearch service uses port 9300 for TCP communication
between nodes in a cluster.

|`openshift_logging_use_ops`
|If set to `true`, configures a second Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana for
operations logs. Fluentd splits logs between the main cluster and a cluster
reserved for operations logs, which consists of the logs from the projects
*default*, *openshift*, and *openshift-infra*, as well as Docker, OpenShift, and
system logs from the journal. This means a second Elasticsearch cluster and
Kibana are deployed. The deployments are distinguishable by the *-ops* suffix
included in their names and have parallel deployment options listed below and

for deploying Fluentd instances.
Any node where Fluentd should run (typically, all) must have this label
before Fluentd is able to run and collect logs.

When scaling up the Aggregated Logging cluster after installation,
the `openshift_logging` role labels nodes provided by
`openshift_logging_fluentd_hosts` with this node selector.

As part of the installation, it is recommended that you add the Fluentd node

example, ['host1.example.com', 'host2.example.com'].

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_audit_container_engine`
|When `openshift_logging_fluentd_audit_container_engine` is set to `true`, the
audit log of the container engine is collected and stored in ES. Enabling this
variable allows the EFK to watch the specified audit log file or the
default `/var/log/audit.log` file, collects audit information for the container
engine for the platform, then puts it into Kibana.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_audit_file`
|Location of audit log file. The default is `/var/log/audit/audit.log`. Enabling this
variable allows the EFK to watch the specified audit log file or the
default `/var/log/audit.log` file, collects audit information for the container
engine for the platform, then puts it into Kibana.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_audit_pos_file`
|Location of the Fluentd `in_tail` position file for the audit log file. The default is
`/var/log/audit/audit.log.pos`. Enabling this
variable allows the EFK to watch the specified audit log file or the
default `/var/log/audit.log` file, collects audit information for the container
engine for the platform, then puts it into Kibana.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_merge_json_log`
|Set to `true` to enable processing of JSON logs embedded in the `log` or `MESSAGE`
field of the record.  The default is `true`.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_extra_keep_fields`
|Specify a comma-separated list of fields that you do not want to be altered
when processing the extra fields generated when using
`openshift_logging_fluentd_merge_json_log`. Otherwise, Fluentd processes
the fields according to the other undefined field settings below.  The default is empty.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_keep_empty_fields`
| Specify a list of comma-delimited fields to keep as empty fields when using
`openshift_logging_fluentd_merge_json_log`. By default, Fluentd removes fields
with empty values from the record, except for the `message` field.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_replace_configmap`
|Set to `no` to prevent the upgrade from replacing the `logging-fluentd` ConfigMap.
Set to `yes` to allow the ConfigMap to be overridden.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_use_undefined`
|Set to `true` to move fields generated by `openshift_logging_fluentd_merge_json_log`
into a sub-field named by the `openshift_logging_fluentd_undefined_name` parameter.
By default, Fluentd keeps these at the top-level of the record,
which can lead to Elasticsearch conflicts and schema errors.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_undefined_name`
|Specify the name of the field to move undefined fields into when using
`openshift_logging_fluentd_use_undefined`. The default is `undefined`.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_undefined_to_string`

representation when using `openshift_logging_fluentd_merge_json_log`. The default is `false`.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_undefined_dot_replace_char`
|Specify a character to replace any `.` characters in a field name, such as `_`
when using `openshift_logging_fluentd_merge_json_log`. Undefined fields with a `.`
character in the name causes problems with Elasticsearch. The default is `UNUSED`
which means `.` in the field name is preserved.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_undefined_max_num_fields`
|Specify a limit to the number of undefined fields when using
`openshift_logging_fluentd_merge_json_log`. Logs can contain hundreds of undefined fields,
which causes problems with Elasticsearch.  If there are more than the specified
number of fields, the fields will be converted into a JSON hash string and
stored in the `openshift_logging_fluentd_undefined_name` field.
The default value is `-1` which means an unlimited number of fields.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_use_multiline_json`
|Set to `true` to force Fluentd to reconstruct any split log lines into a single line
when using `openshift_logging_fluentd_merge_json_log`. With the `json-file`
driver, Docker splits log lines at a size of 16k bytes. The default is `false`.

|`openshift_logging_fluentd_use_multiline_journal`
|Set to `true` to force Fluentd to reconstruct the split lines into a single line
when using `openshift_logging_fluentd_merge_json_log`. With the `journald` driver,
Docker splits log lines at a size of 16k bytes. The default is `false`.

|`openshift_logging_es_host`
|The name of the Elasticsearch service where Fluentd should send logs.

|`openshift_logging_es_port`
|The port for the Elasticsearch service where Fluentd should send logs.

must be at least 512M. Possible suffixes are G,g,M,m.

|`openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas`
|The number of replicas per primary shard for each new index. Defaults to '0'. A minimum of `1` is advisable
for production clusters. For a highly-available environment, set this value to `1` or higher and have at least three Elasticsearch nodes, each on a different host.
If you change the number of replicas, the new value applies to the new indices only. The new number does not apply to existing indices. For information on how to change the
number of replicas for the existing indices, see xref:scaling-elasticsearch-replicas[Changing the Number of Elasticsearch Replicas].


|`openshift_logging_es_number_of_shards`
|The number of primary shards for every new index created in ES. Defaults to `1`.

|`openshift_logging_es_pv_selector`
|A key/value map added to a PVC in order to select specific PVs.

|`openshift_logging_es_pvc_dynamic`
|To dynamically provision the backing storage, set the parameter value to `true`.
When set to `true`, the storageClass spec is omitted from the PVC definition.
When set to `false`, you must specify a value for the `openshift_logging_es_pvc_size` parameter.

If you set a value for the `openshift_logging_es_pvc_storage_class_name` parameter,
its value overrides the value of the `openshift_logging_es_pvc_dynamic` parameter.

|`openshift_logging_es_pvc_storage_class_name`
|To use a non-default storage class, specify the storage class name, such as
`glusterprovisioner` or `cephrbdprovisioner`. After you specify
the storage class name, dynamic volume provisioning is active regardless of the
`openshift_logging_es_pvc_dynamic` value.

|`openshift_logging_es_pvc_size`
|Size of the persistent volume claim to
create per Elasticsearch instance. For example, 100G. If omitted, no PVCs are
created, and ephemeral volumes are used instead. If you set this parameter, the logging installer sets `openshift_logging_elasticsearch_storage_type` to `pvc`.

If the `openshift_logging_es_pvc_dynamic` parameter has been set to `false`, you must set a value for this parameter.
Read the description of `openshift_logging_es_pvc_prefix` for more information.

|`openshift_logging_elasticsearch_image`
|The image version for Elasticsearch.
For example: `registry.redhat.io/openshift3/ose-logging-elasticsearch5:v3.11`

|`openshift_logging_elasticsearch_storage_type`

|`openshift_logging_es_pvc_prefix`
a|Prefix for the names of persistent volume claims to be used as storage for
Elasticsearch nodes. A number is appended per node, such as
*logging-es-1*. If they do not already exist, they are created with size
`_es-pvc-size_`.

When `openshift_logging_es_pvc_prefix` is set, and:

* `openshift_logging_es_pvc_dynamic`=`true`, the value for `openshift_logging_es_pvc_size` is optional.

|Number of a supplemental group ID for access to Elasticsearch storage volumes.
Backing volumes should allow access by this group ID.

|`openshift_logging_es_nodeselector`
|A node selector specified as a map that determines which nodes are eligible targets
for deploying Elasticsearch nodes. Use this map to place these instances on nodes that are reserved or optimized for running them.
For example, the selector could be `{"node-role.kubernetes.io/infra":"true"}`. At least
one active node must have this label before Elasticsearch will deploy.

[[logging-custom-certificates]]
*Custom Certificates*

You can specify custom certificates using the following inventory variables
instead of relying on those generated during the deployment process. These
certificates are used to encrypt and secure communication between a user's
browser and Kibana. The security-related files will be generated if they are not
supplied.

|Description

|`openshift_logging_kibana_cert`
|A browser-facing certificate for the Kibana server.

|`openshift_logging_kibana_key`
|A key to be used with the browser-facing Kibana certificate.

|`openshift_logging_kibana_ca`
|The absolute path on the control node to the CA file to use
for the browser facing Kibana certs.

|`openshift_logging_kibana_ops_cert`

[[deploying-the-efk-stack]]
== Deploying the EFK Stack

The EFK stack is deployed using an Ansible playbook to the EFK components. Run the playbook from the default OpenShift Ansible location
using the default
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[inventory] file.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/openshift-logging/config.yml
----
endif::openshift-origin[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory>] \
    playbooks/openshift-logging/config.yml
----
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

Running the playbook deploys all resources needed to support the stack; such as
Secrets, ServiceAccounts, and DeploymentConfigs, deployed to the project `openshift-logging`.
The playbook waits to deploy the component pods until the stack is running. If the wait steps fail, the
deployment could still be successful; it may be retrieving the component images
from the registry which can take up to a few minutes. You can watch the
process with:

----
$ oc get pods -w

----

They will eventually enter *Running* status. For additional details about the status of the pods during deployment by retrieving
associated events:

[[aggregate-logging-understanding-the-deployment]]
== Understanding and Adjusting the Deployment
This section describes adjustments that you can make to deployed components.

[[aggregated-ops]]
=== Ops Cluster

[NOTE]
====
The logs for the *default*, *openshift*, and *openshift-infra* projects are
automatically aggregated and grouped into the *.operations* item in the Kibana
interface.

The project where you have deployed the EFK stack (*logging*, as documented
here) is _not_ aggregated into *.operations* and is found under its ID.
====

If you set `openshift_logging_use_ops` to *true* in your inventory file, Fluentd is
configured to split logs between the main Elasticsearch cluster and another
cluster reserved for operations logs, which are defined as node system logs and
the projects *default*, *openshift*, and *openshift-infra*. Therefore, a
separate Elasticsearch cluster, a separate Kibana, and a separate Curator are
deployed to index, access, and manage operations logs. These deployments are set
apart with names that include `-ops`. Keep these separate deployments in mind if
you enable this option. Most of the following discussion also applies to the
operations cluster if present, just with the names changed to include `-ops`.

[[aggregated-elasticsearch]]
=== Elasticsearch

link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch (ES)] is an object store where all logs are stored.

Elasticsearch organizes the log data into datastores, each called an _index_. Elasticsearch subdivides each index
into multiple pieces called _shards_, which it spreads across a set of Elasticsearch nodes in your cluster.
You can configure Elasticsearch to make copies of the shards, called _replicas_. Elasticsearch also spreads replicas across
the Elactisearch nodes.  The combination of shards and replicas is intended to
provide redundancy and resilience to failure. For example, if you configure three shards for the index with one replica,
Elasticsearch generates a total of six shards for that index: three primary shards and three replicas as a backup.

The {product-title} logging installer ensures each Elasticsearch node is deployed using a unique deployment configuration that includes its own storage volume.
You can xref:scaling-elasticsearch[create an additional deployment configuration] for each Elasticsearch node you add to the logging system.
During installation, you can use the xref:aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[`openshift_logging_es_cluster_size`] Ansible variable to specify the number of Elasticsearch nodes.

Alternatively, you can scale up your existing cluster by modifying the
`openshift_logging_es_cluster_size` in the inventory file and re-running the
logging playbook. Additional clustering parameters can be modified and are
described in xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[Specifying Logging Ansible Variables].

Refer to
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/hardware.html[Elastic's
documentation] for considerations involved in choosing storage and
network location as directed below.

//tag::elasticsearch-ha[]
[NOTE]
====
A xref:ha-elasticsearch[highly-available Elasticsearch environment] requires at least three Elasticsearch nodes,
each on a different host, and setting the xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[`openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas`] Ansible variable
to a value of `1` or higher to create replicas.
====
//end::elasticsearch-ha[]

*Viewing all Elasticsearch Deployments*

To view all current Elasticsearch deployments:

[[ha-elasticsearch]]
*Configuring Elasticsearch for High Availability*

A highly-available Elasticsearch environment requires at least three Elasticsearch nodes,
each on a different host, and setting the xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[`openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas` Ansible variable]
to a value of `1` or higher to create replicas.

Use the following scenarios as a guide for an {product-title} cluster with three Elasticsearch nodes:

* With `openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas` set to `1`, two nodes have a copy of all of the Elasticsearch data in the cluster.
This ensures that if a node with Elasticsearch data goes down, another node has a copy of all of the Elasticsearch data in the cluster.

* With `openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas` set to `3`, four nodes have a copy of all of the Elasticsearch data in the cluster.
This ensures that if three nodes with Elasticsearch data go down, one node has a copy of all of the Elasticsearch data in the cluster.
+
In this scenario, with multiple Elasticsearch nodes going down, Elasticsearch status would be RED, and new Elasticsearch shards would not be allocated.  However, because of the high availability, you do not lose your Elasticsearch data.

Note that there is a trade-off between high availability and performance.
For example, having `openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas=2` and
`openshift_logging_es_number_of_shards=3` requires Elasticsearch to spend
significant resources replicating the shard data among the nodes in the cluster.
Also, using a higher number of replicas requires doubling or tripling the data storage
requirements on each node, so you must take that into account when xref:aggregated-logging-persistent-storage[planning
persistent storage] for Elasticsearch.

*Considerations when Configuring the Number of Shards*

For the `openshift_logging_es_number_of_shards` parameter, consider:

* For higher performance, increase the number of shards.  For example, in a three
node cluster, set `openshift_logging_es_number_of_shards=3`. This will cause
each index to be split into three parts (shards), and the load for processing the
index will be spread out over all 3 nodes.
* If you have a large number of projects, you might see performance
degradation if you have more than a few thousand shards in the cluster.
Either reduce the number of shards or reduce the curation time.
* If you have a small number of very large indices, you might want to configure
`openshift_logging_es_number_of_shards=3` or higher.  Elasticsearch recommends
using a maximum shard size of less than 50 GB.

[[logging-node-selector]]
*Node Selector*

Because Elasticsearch can use a lot of resources, all members of a cluster
should have low latency network connections to each other and to any remote
storage. Ensure this by directing the instances to dedicated nodes, or a
dedicated region within your cluster, using a
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#using-node-selectors[node selector].

To configure a node selector, specify the `openshift_logging_es_nodeselector`
configuration option in the inventory file. This applies to all Elasticsearch
deployments; if you need to individualize the node selectors, you must manually
edit each deployment configuration after deployment. The node selector is
specified as a python compatible dict. For example, `{"node-type":"infra",
"region":"east"}`.

[[aggregated-logging-persistent-storage]]
==== Persistent Elasticsearch Storage ====

By default, the `openshift_logging` Ansible role creates an ephemeral
deployment in which all data in a pod is lost upon pod restart.

For production environments, each Elasticsearch deployment configuration requires a persistent storage volume. You can specify an existing xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volume-claims[persistent
volume claim] or allow {product-title} to create one.

* *Use existing PVCs.* If you create your own PVCs for the deployment, {product-title} uses those PVCs.
+
Name the PVCs to match the `openshift_logging_es_pvc_prefix` setting, which defaults to
`logging-es`. Assign each PVC a name with a sequence number added to it: `logging-es-0`,
`logging-es-1`, `logging-es-2`, and so on.

* *Allow {product-title} to create a PVC.* If a PVC for Elsaticsearch does not exist, {product-title} creates the PVC based on parameters
in the xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[Ansible inventory file].
+
[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description

|`openshift_logging_es_pvc_size`
| Specify the size of the PVC request.

|`openshift_logging_elasticsearch_storage_type`
a|Specify the storage type as `pvc`.
[NOTE]
====
This is an optional parameter. If you set the `openshift_logging_es_pvc_size` parameter to a value greater than 0, the logging installer automatically sets this parameter to `pvc` by default.
====

|`openshift_logging_es_pvc_prefix`
|Optionally, specify a custom prefix for the PVC.
|===
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
openshift_logging_elasticsearch_storage_type=pvc
openshift_logging_es_pvc_size=104802308Ki
openshift_logging_es_pvc_prefix=es-logging
----

If using xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[dynamically provisioned PVs], the {product-title} logging installer creates PVCs that use the default storage class or the PVC specified with the `openshift_logging_elasticsearch_pvc_storage_class_name` parameter.

If using NFS storage, the {product-title} installer creates the persistent volumes, based on the `openshift_logging_storage_*` parameters
and the xref:#deploying-the-efk-stack[{product-title} logging installer] creates PVCs, using the `openshift_logging_es_pvc_*` parameters.
Make sure you specify the correct parameters in order to use persistent volumes with EFK.
Also set the `openshift_enable_unsupported_configurations=true` parameter in the Ansible inventory file, as the logging installer blocks the installation of NFS with core infrastructure by default.

[WARNING]
====
Using NFS storage as a volume or a persistent volume, or using NAS such as
Gluster, is not supported for Elasticsearch storage, as Lucene relies on file
system behavior that NFS does not supply. Data corruption and other problems can
occur.
====

If your environment requires NFS storage, use one of the following methods:

* xref:aggregated-logging-nfs-persistent[NFS as a persistent volume]

* xref:aggregated-logging-nfs-local[NFS storage as local storage]

[[aggregated-logging-nfs-persistent]]
===== Using NFS as a persistent volume =====

You can deploy NFS as an xref:aggregated-logging-nfs-auto[automatically provisioned persistent volume]
or xref:aggregated-logging-nfs-volume[using a predefined NFS volume].

For more information, see xref:../install_config/storage_examples/shared_storage.adoc#install-config-storage-examples-shared-storage[Sharing an NFS mount across two persistent volume claims] to leverage shared storage for use by two separate containers.

[[aggregated-logging-nfs-auto]]
*Using automatically provisioned NFS*

To use NFS as a persistent volume where NFS is automatically provisioned:

. Add the following lines to the Ansible inventory file to create an NFS auto-provisioned storage class and dynamically provision the backing storage:
+
----
openshift_logging_es_pvc_storage_class_name=$nfsclass
openshift_logging_es_pvc_dynamic=true
----

. Use the following command to deploy the NFS volume using the logging playbook:
+
----
ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-logging/config.yml
----

. Use the following steps to create a PVC:

.. Edit the Ansible inventory file to set the PVC size:
+
----
openshift_logging_es_pvc_size=50Gi
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The logging playbook selects a volume based on size and might use an unexpected volume if any other persistent volume has same size.
====

.. Use the following command to rerun the Ansible *_deploy_cluster.yml_* playbook:
+
----
ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/deploy_cluster.yml
----
+
The installer playbook creates the NFS volume based on the `openshift_logging_storage` variables.

[[aggregated-logging-nfs-volume]]
*Using a predefined NFS volume*

To deploy logging alongside the {product-title} cluster using an existing NFS volume:

. Edit the Ansible inventory file to configure the NFS volume and set the PVC size:
+
----
openshift_logging_storage_kind=nfs
openshift_logging_storage_access_modes=['ReadWriteOnce']
openshift_logging_storage_nfs_directory=/share <1>
openshift_logging_storage_nfs_options='*(rw,root_squash)' <1>
openshift_logging_storage_labels={'storage': 'logging'}
openshift_logging_elasticsearch_storage_type=pvc
openshift_logging_es_pvc_size=10Gi
openshift_logging_es_pvc_storage_class_name=''
openshift_logging_es_pvc_dynamic=true
openshift_logging_es_pvc_prefix=logging
----
+
<1> These parameters work only with the `/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/deploy_cluster.yml`
installation playbook. The parameters will not work with the `/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-logging/config.yml`
playbook.

. Use the following command to redeploy the EFK stack:
+
----
ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/deploy_cluster.yml
----

[[aggregated-logging-nfs-local]]
===== Using NFS as local storage =====

You can allocate a large file on an NFS server and mount the file to the nodes. You can then use the file as a host path device.

----
$ mount -F nfs nfserver:/nfs/storage/elasticsearch-1 /usr/local/es-storage
$ chown 1000:1000 /usr/local/es-storage
----

Then, use *_/usr/local/es-storage_* as a host-mount as described below.
Use a different backing file as storage for each Elasticsearch node.

This loopback must be maintained manually outside of {product-title}, on the
node. You must not maintain it from inside a container.

It is possible to use a local disk volume (if available) on each
node host as storage for an Elasticsearch replica. Doing so requires
some preparation as follows.

. The relevant service account must be given the privilege to mount and edit a
local volume:
+
----
  $ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged  \
         system:serviceaccount:openshift-logging:aggregated-logging-elasticsearch
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you upgraded from an earlier version of {product-title}, cluster logging might have been installed in the `logging` project.
You should adjust the service account accordingly.
====

. Each Elasticsearch node definition must be patched to claim that privilege,
for example:
+
----
$ for dc in $(oc get deploymentconfig --selector component=es -o name); do
    oc scale $dc --replicas=0
    oc patch $dc \
       -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"elasticsearch","securityContext":{"privileged": true}}]}}}}'
  done
----

. The Elasticsearch replicas must be located on the correct nodes to use the local
storage, and must not move around, even if those nodes are taken down for a
period of time. This requires giving each Elasticsearch replica a node selector
that is unique to a node where an administrator has allocated storage for it. To
configure a node selector, edit each Elasticsearch deployment configuration, adding
or editing the *nodeSelector* section to specify a unique label that you have
applied for each desired node:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        logging-es-node: "1" <1>
----
<1> This label must uniquely identify a replica with a single node that bears that
label, in this case `logging-es-node=1`.


. Create a node selector for each required node.
. Use the `oc label` command to apply labels to as many nodes as needed.

For example, if your deployment has three infrastructure nodes, you could add labels for those
nodes as follows:
----
$ oc label node <nodename1> logging-es-node=0
$ oc label node <nodename2> logging-es-node=1
$ oc label node <nodename3> logging-es-node=2
----

For information about adding a label to a node, see
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[Updating Labels on Nodes].

To automate applying the node selector, you can instead use the `oc patch` command:

----
$ oc patch dc/logging-es-<suffix> \
   -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"logging-es-node":"0"}}}}}'
----

Once you have completed these steps, you can apply a local host mount to
each replica. The following example assumes storage is mounted at the same path on each node.

----
$ for dc in $(oc get deploymentconfig --selector component=es -o name); do
    oc set volume $dc \
          --add --overwrite --name=elasticsearch-storage \
          --type=hostPath --path=/usr/local/es-storage
    oc rollout latest $dc
    oc scale $dc --replicas=1
  done
----

[[aggregated-logging-hostPath-Elasticsearch]]
===== Configuring hostPath storage for Elasticsearch =====

You can provision {product-title} clusters using hostPath storage for Elasticsearch.

To use a local disk volume on each node host as storage for an Elasticsearch replica:

. Create a local mount point on each infrastructure node for the local Elasticsearch storage:
+
----
$ mkdir /usr/local/es-storage
----

. Create a filesystem on the Elasticsearch volume:
+
----
$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/xxx
----

. Mount the elasticsearch volume:
+
----
$ mount /dev/xxx /usr/local/es-storage
----

. Add the following line to `/etc/fstab`:
+
----
$ /dev/xxx /usr/local/es-storage ext4
----

. Change ownership for the mount point:
+
----
$ chown 1000:1000 /usr/local/es-storage
----

. Give the privilege to mount and edit a local volume to the relevant service account:
+
----
  $ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged  \
         system:serviceaccount:openshift-logging:aggregated-logging-elasticsearch
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you upgraded from an earlier version of {product-title}, cluster logging might have been installed in the `logging` project.
You should adjust the service account accordingly.
====

. To claim that privilege, patch each Elasticsearch replica definition, as shown in the example,
which specifies `--selector component=es-ops` for an Ops cluster:
+
----
  $ for dc in $(oc get deploymentconfig --selector component=es -o name);
do
    oc scale $dc --replicas=0
    oc patch $dc \
       -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"elasticsearch","securityContext":{"privileged":
true}}]}}}}'
done
----
+
. Locate the Elasticsearch replicas on the correct nodes to use the local storage,
and do not move them around, even if those nodes are taken down for a period of time.
To specify the node location, give each Elasticsearch replica a node selector that is unique
to a node where an administrator has allocated storage for it.
+
To configure a node selector, edit each Elasticsearch deployment configuration, adding
or editing the `nodeSelector` section to specify a unique label that you have applied
for each node you desire:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        logging-es-node: "1"
----
+
The label must uniquely identify a replica with a single node that bears that label,
in this case `logging-es-node=1`.
+
. Create a node selector for each required node. Use the `oc label` command to apply
labels to as many nodes as needed.
+
For example, if your deployment has three infrastructure nodes, you could add
labels for those nodes as follows:
+
----
  $ oc label node <nodename1> logging-es-node=0
  $ oc label node <nodename2> logging-es-node=1
  $ oc label node <nodename3> logging-es-node=2
----
+
To automate application of the node selector, use the `oc patch` command
instead of the `oc label` command, as follows:
+
----
  $ oc patch dc/logging-es-<suffix> \
     -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"logging-es-node":"1"}}}}}'
----
+
. Once you have completed these steps, you can apply a local host mount to each
replica. The following example assumes storage is mounted at the same path
on each node, and specifies `--selector component=es-ops` for an Ops cluster.
+
----
$ for dc in $(oc get deploymentconfig --selector component=es -o name);
do
    oc set volume $dc \
          --add --overwrite --name=elasticsearch-storage \
          --type=hostPath --path=/usr/local/es-storage
    oc rollout latest $dc
    oc scale $dc --replicas=1
done
----

[[scaling-elasticsearch]]
===== Changing the Scale of Elasticsearch =====

If you need to scale up the number of Elasticsearch nodes in your cluster,
you can create a deployment configuration for each Elasticsearch node you want to add.

Due to the nature of persistent volumes and how Elasticsearch is
configured to store its data and recover the cluster, you cannot simply increase
the nodes in an Elasticsearch deployment configuration.

The simplest way to change the scale of Elasticsearch is to modify the inventory
host file and re-run the logging playbook as described previously. If you
have supplied persistent storage for the deployment, this should not be
disruptive.

[NOTE]
====
Resizing an Elasticsearch cluster using the logging playbook is only possible when
the new `openshift_logging_es_cluster_size` value is higher than the current number
of Elasticsearch nodes (scaled up) in the cluster.
====

[[scaling-elasticsearch-replicas]]
===== Changing the Number of Elasticsearch Replicas =====

You can change the number of Elasticsearch replicas by editing the `openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas` value
in the inventory host file and re-running the logging playbook as described previously.

The changes apply only to the new indices. Existing indices continue to use the previous number of replicas.
For example, if you change the number of indices from 3 to 2, your cluster will use 2 replicas for new indices
and 3 replicas for existing indices.

You can modify the replica count for the existing indices by running the following command:

----
$ oc exec -c elasticsearch $pod -- es_util --query=project.* -d '{"index":{"number_of_replicas":"2"}}' <1>
----
<1> Specify the number of replicas you want for existing indices.

[[expose-elasticsearch-as-route]]
===== Expose Elasticsearch as a Route =====

By default, Elasticsearch deployed with OpenShift aggregated logging is not
accessible from outside the logging cluster. You can enable a route for external
access to Elasticsearch for those tools that want to access its data.

You have access to Elasticsearch using your OpenShift token, and
you can provide the external Elasticsearch and Elasticsearch Ops
hostnames when creating the server certificate (similar to Kibana).

. To access Elasticsearch as a reencrypt route, define the following variables:
+
----
openshift_logging_es_allow_external=True
openshift_logging_es_hostname=elasticsearch.example.com
----

. Change to the playbook directory and run the following Ansible playbook:
+
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory>] \
    playbooks/openshift-logging/config.yml
----

. To log in to Elasticsearch remotely, the request must contain three HTTP headers:
+
----
Authorization: Bearer $token
X-Proxy-Remote-User: $username
X-Forwarded-For: $ip_address
----

. You must have access to the project in order to be able to access to the
logs. For example:
+
----
$ oc login <user1>
$ oc new-project <user1project>
$ oc new-app <httpd-example>
----

. You need to get the token of this ServiceAccount to be used in the request:
+
----
$ token=$(oc whoami -t)
----

. Using the token previously configured, you should be able access Elasticsearch
through the exposed route:

[[aggregated-fluentd]]
=== Fluentd

Fluentd is deployed as a DaemonSet that deploys nodes according to a node
label selector, which you can specify with the inventory parameter
`openshift_logging_fluentd_nodeselector` and the default is `logging-infra-fluentd`.
As part of the OpenShift cluster installation, it is recommended that you add the
Fluentd node selector to the list of persisted
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-node-host-labels[node labels].

Fluentd uses `journald` as the system log source. These are log messages from
the operating system, the container runtime, and OpenShift.

The available container runtimes provide minimal information to identify the
source of log messages. Log collection and normalization of logs can occur after
a pod is deleted and additional metadata cannot be retrieved from the
API server, such as labels or annotations.

If a pod with a given name and namespace is deleted before the log collector
finishes processing logs, there might not be a way to distinguish the log messages
from a similarly named pod and namespace. This can cause logs to be indexed and
annotated to an index that is not owned by the user who deployed the pod.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The available container runtimes provide minimal information to identify the
source of log messages and do not guarantee unique individual log
messages or that these messages can be traced to their source.
====

Clean installations of {product-title} 3.9 or later use `json-file` as the default log
driver, but environments upgraded from {product-title} 3.7 will maintain their
existing `journald` log driver configuration. It is recommended to use the
`json-file` log driver. See xref:fluentd-update-source[Changing the Aggregated
Logging Driver] for instructions to change your existing log driver
configuration to `json-file`.

[[fluentd-view-logs]]
*Viewing Fluentd Logs*

How you view logs depends upon the xref:fluentd-file[`LOGGING_FILE_PATH` setting].

* If `LOGGING_FILE_PATH` points to a file, use the *logs* utility to print out the contents of Fluentd log files:
+
----
oc exec <pod> -- logs <1>
----
<1> Specify the name of the Fluentd pod. Note the space before `logs`.
+
For example:
+
----
oc exec logging-fluentd-lmvms -- logs
----
+
The contents of log files are printed out, starting with the oldest log.  Use `-f` option to follow what is being written into the logs.

* If you are using `LOGGING_FILE_PATH=console`, Fluentd writes logs to its default location, `/var/log/fluentd/fluentd.log`. You can retrieve the logs with the `oc logs -f <pod_name>` command.
+
For example
+
----
oc logs -f fluentd.log
----

[[fluentd-file]]
*Configuring Fluentd Log Location*

Fluentd writes logs to a specified file, by default `/var/log/fluentd/fluentd.log`, or to the console, based on the `LOGGING_FILE_PATH` environment variable.

To change the default output location for the Fluentd logs, use the `LOGGING_FILE_PATH` parameter
in the xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[default inventory file].
You can specify a particular file or use the Fluentd default location:

----
LOGGING_FILE_PATH=console <1>
LOGGING_FILE_PATH=<path-to-log/fluentd.log> <2>
----

<1> Sends the log output to the Fluentd default location. Retrieve the logs with the `oc logs -f <pod_name>` command.
<2> Sends the log output to the specified file. Retrieve the logs with the `oc exec <pod_name> -- logs` command.

After changing these parameters, re-run the xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#deploying-the-efk-stack[logging installer playbook]:

----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory>] \
    playbooks/openshift-logging/config.yml
----

[[fluentd-rotation]]
*Configuring Fluentd Log Rotation*

When the current Fluentd log file reaches a specified size, {product-title} automatically renames the *fluentd.log* log file so that new logging data can be collected.
Log rotation is enabled by default.

The following example shows logs in a cluster where the maximum log size is 1Mb and four logs should be retained. When the *fluentd.log* reaches 1Mb, {product-title}
deletes the current *fluentd.log.4*, renames each of the Fluentd logs in turn, and creates a new *fluentd.log*.

----
fluentd.log     0b
fluentd.log.1  1Mb
fluentd.log.2  1Mb
fluentd.log.3  1Mb
fluentd.log.4  1Mb
----

You can control the size of the Fluentd log files and how many of the renamed files that {product-title} retains using
environment variables.

.Parameters for configuring Fluentd log rotation
[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description

| `LOGGING_FILE_SIZE` | The maximum size of a single Fluentd log file in Bytes. If the size of the *flientd.log* file exceeds this value, {product-title} renames the *fluentd.log.** files and creates a new *fluentd.log*. The default is 1024000 (1MB).
| `LOGGING_FILE_AGE` | The number of logs that Fluentd retains before deleting. The default value is `10`.
|===

For example:

----
$ oc set env ds/logging-fluentd LOGGING_FILE_AGE=30 LOGGING_FILE_SIZE=1024000"
----

Turn off log rotation by setting `LOGGING_FILE_PATH=console`.
This causes Fluentd to write logs to the Fluentd default location, *_/var/log/fluentd/fluentd.log_*, where you can retrieve them using the `oc logs -f <pod_name>` command.

----
$ oc set env ds/fluentd LOGGING_FILE_PATH=console
----

[[fluentd-merge-json]]
*Disabling JSON parsing of logs with MERGE_JSON_LOG*

By default, Fluentd determines if a log message is in *JSON* format and merges the message into the JSON payload document posted to Elasticsearch.

When using JSON parsing you might experience:

* log loss due to Elasticsearch rejecting documents due to inconsistent type mappings;
* buffer storage leaks caused by rejected message cycling;
* overwritten data for fields with same names.

For information on how to mitigate some of these problems, see xref:fluentd-undefined-fields[Configuring how the log collector normalizes logs].

You can disable JSON parsing to avoid these problems or if you do not need to parse JSON from your logs.

To disable JSON parsing:

. Run the following command:
+
----
oc set env ds/logging-fluentd MERGE_JSON_LOG=false <1>
----
<1> Set this to `false` to disable this feature or `true` to enable this feature.
+
To ensure this setting is applied each time you run Ansible, add `openshift_logging_fluentd_merge_json_log="false"` to your Ansible inventory.

[[fluentd-undefined-fields]]
*Configuring how the log collector normalizes logs*

Cluster Logging uses a specific data model, like a database schema, to store log records and their metadata in the logging store. There are some restrictions on the data:

* There must be a `"message"` field containing the actual log message.
* There must be a `"@timestamp"` field containing the log record timestamp in RFC 3339 format, preferably millisecond or better resolution.
* There must be a `"level"` field with the log level, such as `err`, `info`, `unknown`, and so forth.

[NOTE]
====
For more information on the data model, see link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging/blob/master/docs/com.redhat.viaq-openshift-project.asciidoc[Exported Fields].
====

Because of these requirements, conflicts and inconsistencies can arise with log data collected from different subsystems.

For example, if you use the `MERGE_JSON_LOG` feature (`MERGE_JSON_LOG=true`), it can be extremely useful to have your applications log their output in JSON, and have the log collector automatically parse and index the data in Elasticsearch. However, this leads to several problems, including:

* field names can be empty, or contain characters that are illegal in Elasticsearch;
* different applications in the same namespace might output the same field name with a different value data type;
* applications might emit too many fields;
* fields may conflict with the cluster logging built-in fields.

You can configure how cluster logging treats fields from disparate sources by editing the Fluentd log collector daemonset and setting environment variables in the table below.

// from https://github.com/ViaQ/fluent-plugin-viaq_data_model/commit/8b5ef11cedec4c372b2cb082afc7f9cc08473654

* *Undefined fields.* Fields unknown to the ViaQ data model are called _undefined_. Log data from disparate systems can contain undefined fields. The data model requires all top-level fields to be defined and described.
+
Use the parameters to configure how {product-title} moves any undefined fields under a top-level field called `undefined` to avoid conflicting with the _well known_
top-level fields. You can add undefined fields to the top-level fields and move others to an `undefined` container.
+
You can also replace special characters in undefined fields and convert undefined fields to their JSON string representation.
Converting to JSON string preserves the structure of the value, so that you can retrieve the value later and convert it back to a map or an array.
+
** Simple scalar values like numbers and booleans are changed to a quoted string. For example: `10` becomes `"10"`, `3.1415` becomes `"3.1415"`, `false` becomes `"false"`.
+
** Map/dict values and array values are converted to their JSON string representation: `"mapfield":{"key":"value"}` becomes `"mapfield":"{\"key\":\"value\"}"` and `"arrayfield":[1,2,"three"]` becomes `"arrayfield":"[1,2,\"three\"]"`.

* *Defined fields.* Defined fields appear in the top levels of the logs. You can configure which fields are considered defined fields.
+
[[default-fields]]
The default top-level fields, defined through the `CDM_DEFAULT_KEEP_FIELDS` parameter, are `CEE`, `time`, `@timestamp`, `aushape`, `ci_job`, `collectd`, `docker`, `fedora-ci`,
`file`, `foreman`, `geoip`, `hostname`, `ipaddr4`, `ipaddr6`, `kubernetes`, `level`, `message`, `namespace_name`, `namespace_uuid`,
`offset`, `openstack`, `ovirt`, `pid`, `pipeline_metadata`, `service`, `systemd`, `tags`, `testcase`, `tlog`, `viaq_msg_id`.
+
Any fields not included in `${CDM_DEFAULT_KEEP_FIELDS}` or `${CDM_EXTRA_KEEP_FIELDS}` are moved to `${CDM_UNDEFINED_NAME}` if `CDM_USE_UNDEFINED` is `true`. See the table below for more information on these parameters.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `CDM_DEFAULT_KEEP_FIELDS` parameter is for only advanced users, or if you are instructed to do so by Red Hat support.
====

* *Empty fields.* Empty fields have no data. You can determine which empty fields to retain from logs.

.Environment parameters for log normalization
[cols="2,4a,2", options="header"]
|===
|Parameters  |Definition  |Example

|`CDM_EXTRA_KEEP_FIELDS`
|Specify an extra set of defined fields to be kept at the top level of the logs in addition to the `CDM_DEFAULT_KEEP_FIELDS`. The default is "".
|`CDM_EXTRA_KEEP_FIELDS="broker"`

|`CDM_KEEP_EMPTY_FIELDS`
|Specify fields to retain in CSV format even if empty. Empty defined fields not specified are dropped. The default is "message", keep empty messages.
|`CDM_KEEP_EMPTY_FIELDS="message"`

|`CDM_USE_UNDEFINED`
|Set to `true` to move undefined fields to the `undefined` top level field. The default is `false`. If `true`, values in `CDM_DEFAULT_KEEP_FIELDS`
and `CDM_EXTRA_KEEP_FIELDS` are not moved to `undefined`.
|`CDM_USE_UNDEFINED=true`

|`CDM_UNDEFINED_NAME`
|Specify a name for the undefined top level field if using `CDM_USE_UNDEFINED`. The default is`undefined`.
Enabled only when `CDM_USE_UNDEFINED` is `true`.
|`CDM_UNDEFINED_NAME="undef"`

|`CDM_UNDEFINED_MAX_NUM_FIELDS`
a|If the number of undefined fields is greater than this number, all undefined fields are converted to their JSON string representation
and stored in the `CDM_UNDEFINED_NAME` field. If the record contains more than this value of undefined fields, no further processing takes place on these fields.
Instead, the fields will be converted to a single string JSON value, stored in the top-level `CDM_UNDEFINED_NAME` field.  Keeping the default of `-1` allows for an unlimited number of undefined fields, which is not recommended.

*NOTE:* This parameter is honored even if `CDM_USE_UNDEFINED` is false.

|`CDM_UNDEFINED_MAX_NUM_FIELDS=4`

|`CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING`
|Set to `true` to convert all undefined fields to their JSON string representation. The default is `false`.
|`CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING=true`

|`CDM_UNDEFINED_DOT_REPLACE_CHAR`
|Specify a character to use in place of a dot character '.' in an undefined field. `MERGE_JSON_LOG` must be `true`. The default is `UNUSED`.
If you set the `MERGE_JSON_LOG` parameter to `true`, see the Note below.
|`CDM_UNDEFINED_DOT_REPLACE_CHAR="_"`

|===

[NOTE]
====
If you set the `MERGE_JSON_LOG` parameter in the Fluentd log collector daemonset and `CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING` environment variables to true, you might receive an Elasticsearch *400* error. When `MERGE_JSON_LOG=true`, the log collector adds fields with data types other than string. If you set `CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING=true`,
the log collector attempts to add those fields as a string value resulting in the Elasticsearch 400 error. The error clears when the log collector rolls over
the indices for the next day’s logs

When the log collector rolls over the indices, it creates a brand new index. The field definitions are updated and you will not get the *400* error. For more information, see xref:fluentd-merge-json-undefined[Setting MERGE_JSON_LOG and CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING].
====

To configure undefined and empty field processing, edit the `logging-fluentd` daemonset:

. Configure how to process fields, as needed:

.. Specify the fields to move using `CDM_EXTRA_KEEP_FIELDS`.

.. Specify any empty fields to retain in the `CDM_KEEP_EMPTY_FIELDS` parameter in CSV format.

. Configure how to process undefined fields, as needed:

.. Set `CDM_USE_UNDEFINED` to `true` to move undefined fields to the top-level `undefined` field:

.. Specify a name for the undefined fields using the `CDM_UNDEFINED_NAME` parameter.

.. Set `CDM_UNDEFINED_MAX_NUM_FIELDS` to a value other than the default `-1`, to set an upper bound on the number of undefined fields
in a single record.

. Specify `CDM_UNDEFINED_DOT_REPLACE_CHAR` to change any dot `.` characters in an undefined field name to another character.
For example, if `CDM_UNDEFINED_DOT_REPLACE_CHAR=@@@` and there is a field named `foo.bar.baz` the field is transformed into `foo@@@bar@@@baz`.

. Set `UNDEFINED_TO_STRING` to `true` to convert undefined fields to their JSON string representation.

[NOTE]
====
If you configure the `CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING` or `CDM_UNDEFINED_MAX_NUM_FIELDS` parameters, you use the `CDM_UNDEFINED_NAME` to change the undefined field name. This field is needed because `CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING` or `CDM_UNDEFINED_MAX_NUM_FIELDS` could change the value type of the undefined field. When `CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING` or `CDM_UNDEFINED_MAX_NUM_FIELDS` is set to true and there are more undefined fields in a log, the value type becomes `string`. Elasticsearch stops accepting records if the value type is changed, for example, from JSON to JSON string.

For example, when `CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING` is `false` or `CDM_UNDEFINED_MAX_NUM_FIELDS` is the default, `-1`, the value type of the undefined field is `json`. If you change `CDM_UNDEFINED_MAX_NUM_FIELDS` to a value other than default and there are more undefined fields in a log, the value type becomes `string` (JSON string). Elasticsearch stops accepting records if the value type is changed.
====

[[fluentd-merge-json-undefined]]
*Setting MERGE_JSON_LOG and CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING*

If you set the `MERGE_JSON_LOG` and `CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING` environment variables to `true`, you might receive an Elasticsearch *400* error. When `MERGE_JSON_LOG=true`, the log collector adds fields with data types other than string. If you set `CDM_UNDEFINED_TO_STRING=true`, Fluentd attempts to add those fields as a *string* value resulting in the Elasticsearch *400* error. The error clears when the indices roll over for the next day.

When Fluentd rolls over the indices for the next day's logs, it will create a brand new index. The field definitions are updated and you will not get the *400* error.

Records that have *hard* errors, such as schema violations, corrupted data, and so forth, cannot be retried. The log collector sends the records for error handling. If you link:https://docs.fluentd.org/v1.0/articles/config-file#@error-label[add a
`<label @ERROR>` section] to your Fluentd config, as the last `<label>`, you can handle these records as needed.

For example:

----
data:
  fluent.conf:

....

    <label @ERROR>
      <match **>
        @type file
        path /var/log/fluent/dlq
        time_slice_format %Y%m%d
        time_slice_wait 10m
        time_format %Y%m%dT%H%M%S%z
        compress gzip
      </match>
    </label>
----

This section writes error records to the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/dead-letter-queues.html[Elasticsearch dead letter queue (DLQ) file]. See link:https://docs.fluentd.org/v/0.12/output/file[the fluentd documentation] for more information about the file output.

Then you can edit the file to clean up the records manually, edit the file to use with the Elasticsearch `/_bulk index` API and use cURL to add those records. For more information on Elasticsearch Bulk API, see link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/docs-bulk.html[the Elasticsearch documentation].

[[fluentd-multiline-docker]]
*Join Multi-line Docker Logs*

You can configure Fluentd to reconstruct whole log records from Docker log partial fragments. With this feature active, Fluentd reads multi-line Docker logs, reconstructs them, and stores the logs as one record in Elasticsearch with no missing data.

However, because this feature can cause a performance regression, the feature is off by default and must be manually enabled.

The following Fluentd environment variables configure cluster logging to process multi-line Docker logs:

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description

| USE_MULTILINE_JSON
| Set to `true` to process multi-line Docker logs when using the `json-file` log driver. This parameter is set to `false` by default.

|USE_MULTILINE_JOURNAL
| Set to `true` to process multi-line Docker logs when using the `journald` log driver, Fluentd reconstructs whole log records from the docker log partial fragments. This parameter is set to `false` by default.

|===

You can use the following command to determine which log driver is being used:

----
$ docker info | grep -i log
----

One of the following is output:

----
Logging Driver: json-file
----

----
Logging Driver: journald
----

To turn on multi-line Docker logs processing:

. Use the following command to enable the multiline Docker logs:

** For the `json-file` log driver:
+
----
oc set env daemonset/logging-fluentd USE_MULTILINE_JSON=true
----
+
** For the `journald` log driver:
+
----
oc set env daemonset/logging-fluentd USE_MULTILINE_JOURNAL=true
----

+
The Fluentd pods in the cluster restart.


[[fluentd-external-log-aggregator]]
*Configuring Fluentd to Send Logs to an External Log Aggregator*

You can configure Fluentd to send a copy of its logs to an external log
aggregator, in addition to the default Elasticsearch, using the `secure-forward`
plug-in. From there, you can further process log records after the locally
hosted Fluentd has processed them.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The `secure-forward` plug-in is provided with the Fluentd image as of v1.4.0.
endif::openshift-origin[]

The logging deployment provides a `secure-forward.conf` section in the Fluentd configmap
for configuring the external aggregator:

----
<store>
@type secure_forward
self_hostname pod-${HOSTNAME}
shared_key thisisasharedkey
secure yes
enable_strict_verification yes
ca_cert_path /etc/fluent/keys/your_ca_cert
ca_private_key_path /etc/fluent/keys/your_private_key
ca_private_key_passphrase passphrase
<server>
  host ose1.example.com
  port 24284
</server>
<server>
  host ose2.example.com
  port 24284
  standby
</server>
<server>
  host ose3.example.com
  port 24284
  standby
</server>
</store>
----

This can be updated using the `oc edit` command:

----
$ oc edit configmap/logging-fluentd
----

Certificates to be used in `secure-forward.conf` can be added to the existing
secret that is mounted on the Fluentd pods. The `your_ca_cert` and
`your_private_key` values must match what is specified in `secure-forward.conf`
in `configmap/logging-fluentd`:

----
$ oc patch secrets/logging-fluentd --type=json \
  --patch "[{'op':'add','path':'/data/your_ca_cert','value':'$(base64 -w 0 /path/to/your_ca_cert.pem)'}]"
$ oc patch secrets/logging-fluentd --type=json \
  --patch "[{'op':'add','path':'/data/your_private_key','value':'$(base64 -w 0 /path/to/your_private_key.pem)'}]"
----

[NOTE]
====
Replace `your_private_key` with a generic name. This is a link to the JSON path,
not a path on your host system.
====

When configuring the external aggregator, it must be able to accept messages
securely from Fluentd.

If the external aggregator is another Fluentd server, it must have the
`fluent-plugin-secure-forward` plug-in installed and make use of the input
plug-in it provides:

----
<source>
  @type secure_forward

  self_hostname ${HOSTNAME}
  bind 0.0.0.0
  port 24284

  shared_key thisisasharedkey

  secure yes
  cert_path        /path/for/certificate/cert.pem
  private_key_path /path/for/certificate/key.pem
  private_key_passphrase secret_foo_bar_baz
</source>
----

You can find further explanation of how to set up the
`fluent-plugin-secure-forward` plug-in in the
link:https://github.com/tagomoris/fluent-plugin-secure-forward[`fluent-plugin-secure-forward` repository].

*Reducing the Number of Connections from Fluentd to the API Server*

[IMPORTANT]
====
`mux` is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.
endif::[]
====

`mux` is a Secure Forward listener service.

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description

| `openshift_logging_use_mux`
|The default is set to `False`. If set to `True`,
a service called `mux` is deployed. This service acts as a Fluentd
`secure_forward` aggregator for the node agent Fluentd daemonsets running in the
cluster. Use `openshift_logging_use_mux` to reduce the number of connections to
the OpenShift API server, and configure each node in Fluentd to send raw logs to
`mux` and turn off the Kubernetes metadata plug-in. This requires the use of
`openshift_logging_mux_client_mode`.

|`openshift_logging_mux_client_mode`
|Values for `openshift_logging_mux_client_mode` are `minimal` and `maximal`, and
there is no default. `openshift_logging_mux_client_mode` causes the Fluentd node
agent to send logs to mux rather than directly to Elasticsearch. The value
`maximal` means that Fluentd does as much processing as possible at the node
before sending the records to `mux`. The `maximal` value is recommended for
using `mux`. The value `minimal` means that Fluentd does no processing at all,
and sends the raw logs to `mux` for processing. It is not recommended to use the
`minimal` value.

| `openshift_logging_mux_allow_external`
|The default is set to `False`. If set to `True`, the `mux` service is
deployed, and it is configured to allow Fluentd clients running outside of
the cluster to send logs using `secure_forward`. This allows OpenShift logging
to be used as a central logging service for clients other than OpenShift, or
other OpenShift clusters.

| `openshift_logging_mux_hostname`
|The default is `mux` plus `openshift_master_default_subdomain`. This is the
hostname `external_clients` will use to connect to `mux`, and is used in the
TLS server cert subject.

| `openshift_logging_mux_port`
|24284

| `openshift_logging_mux_cpu_limit`
|500M

| `openshift_logging_mux_memory_limit`
|2Gi

| `openshift_logging_mux_default_namespaces`
|The default is `mux-undefined`. The first value in the list is the namespace to
use for undefined projects, followed by any additional namespaces to create by
default. Usually, you do not need to set this value.

| `openshift_logging_mux_namespaces`
|The default value is empty, allowing for additional namespaces to create for
external `mux` clients to associate with their logs. You will need to set this
value.
|===


[[fluentd-throttling]]
*Throttling logs in Fluentd*

For projects that are especially verbose, an administrator can throttle down the
rate at which the logs are read in by Fluentd before being processed.

[WARNING]
====
Throttling can contribute to log aggregation falling behind for the configured
projects; log entries can be lost if a pod is deleted before Fluentd catches up.
====

[NOTE]
====
Throttling does not work when using the systemd journal as the log
source. The throttling implementation depends on being able to throttle the
reading of the individual log files for each project. When reading from the
journal, there is only a single log source, no log files, so no file-based
throttling is available. There is not a method of restricting the log
entries that are read into the Fluentd process.
====

To tell Fluentd which projects it should be restricting, edit the throttle
configuration in its ConfigMap after deployment:

----
$ oc edit configmap/logging-fluentd
----

The format of the *_throttle-config.yaml_* key is a YAML file that contains
project names and the desired rate at which logs are read in on each
node. The default is 1000 lines at a time per node. For example:

* Projects
----
project-name:
  read_lines_limit: 50

second-project-name:
  read_lines_limit: 100
----

* Logging
----
logging:
  read_lines_limit: 500

test-project:
  read_lines_limit: 10

.operations:
  read_lines_limit: 100
----


When you make changes to any part of the EFK stack, specifically Elasticsearch
or Fluentd, you should first scale Elasticsearch down to zero and scale Fluentd
so it does not match any other nodes. Then, make the changes and scale
Elasticsearch and Fluentd back.

To scale Elasticsearch to zero:
----
$ oc scale --replicas=0 dc/<ELASTICSEARCH_DC>
----

Change nodeSelector in the daemonset configuration to match zero:

.Get the Fluentd node selector:
----
$ oc get ds logging-fluentd -o yaml |grep -A 1 Selector
     nodeSelector:
       logging-infra-fluentd: "true"
----

.Use the `oc patch` command to modify the daemonset nodeSelector:
----
$ oc patch ds logging-fluentd -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"nonexistlabel":"true"}}}}}'
----

.Get the Fluentd node selector:
----
$ oc get ds logging-fluentd -o yaml |grep -A 1 Selector
     nodeSelector:
       "nonexistlabel: "true"
----

Scale Elasticsearch back up from zero:
----
$ oc scale --replicas=# dc/<ELASTICSEARCH_DC>
----

Change nodeSelector in the daemonset configuration back to
logging-infra-fluentd: "true".

Use the `oc patch` command to modify the daemonset nodeSelector:
----
oc patch ds logging-fluentd -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"logging-infra-fluentd":"true"}}}}}'

`kibana-hostname` parameter). The value must be an HTTPS URL:

====
----
...
clusterInfo:
  ...
  loggingPublicURL: "https://kibana.example.com"
...
----
====

Setting the `loggingPublicURL` parameter creates a *View Archive* button on the
{product-title} web console under the *Browse* -> *Pods* -> *<pod_name>* ->
*Logs* tab. This links to the Kibana console.

[NOTE]
====
You need to log in to the Kibana console when your valid login cookie expires, for example:
you need to log in:

* on the first use
* after logging out
//* after 1 week from initial log in
====

You can scale the Kibana deployment as usual for redundancy:

====
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-kibana --replicas=2
----
====

[NOTE]
====
To ensure the scale persists across multiple executions of the logging playbook,
make sure to update the `openshift_logging_kibana_replica_count` in the inventory file.
====


You can see the user interface by visiting the site specified by the
`openshift_logging_kibana_hostname` variable.

See the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/4.5/discover.html[Kibana
documentation] for more information on Kibana.

[[kibana-visualizations-dashboard]]
*Kibana Visualize*

Kibana Visualize enables you to create visualizations and dashboards for
monitoring container and pod logs allows administrator users (`cluster-admin` or
`cluster-reader`) to view logs by deployment, namespace, pod, and container.

Kibana Visualize exists inside the Elasticsearch and ES-OPS
pod, and must be run inside those pods. To load dashboards and other Kibana UI
objects, you must first log in to Kibana as the user you want to add the
dashboards to, then log out. This will create the necessary per-user
configuration that the next step relies on. Then, run:

----
$ oc exec <$espod> -- es_load_kibana_ui_objects <user-name>
----

Where `$espod` is the name of any one of your Elasticsearch pods.

[[kibana-visualizations-custom]]
*Adding Custom Fields to Kibana Visualize*

If your {product-title} cluster generates logs in JSON format that contain custom fields
that are not defined in the Elasticsearch `.operations.\*` or the `project.*`
indices, you cannot create visualizations with these fields because the custom fields are not
available in Kibana.

However, you can add the custom fields to the Elasticsearch indices, which allows you to add
the fields to the Kibana index patterns for use in Kibana Visualize.

[NOTE]
====
The custom fields are applied to only the indices created after the template is updated.
====

To add custom fields to Kibana Visualize:

. Add custom fields to an Elasticsearch index template:

.. Determine which Elasticsearch index you want to add the fields to, either
the `.operations.\*` or the `project.*` index.
If there is a specific project that has the custom fields,
you add the fields to a specific index for the project,
for example: `project.this-project-has-time-fields.*`.

.. Create a JSON file for the custom fields, similar to the following:
+
For example:
+
----
{
	"order": 20,
	"mappings": {
		"_default_": {
			"properties": {
				"mytimefield1": { <1>
					"doc_values": true,
					"format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSSZ||yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ||yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ||dateOptionalTime",
					"index": "not_analyzed",
					"type": "date"
				},
				"mytimefield2": {
					"doc_values": true,
					"format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSSZ||yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ||yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ||dateOptionalTime",
					"index": "not_analyzed",
					"type": "date"
				}
			}
		}
	},
	"template": "project.<project-name>.*" <2>
}
----
<1> Add a custom field and parameters.
<2> Specify the `.operations.\*` or `project.*` index.

.. Change to the `openshift-logging` project:
+
----
$ oc project openshift-logging
----

.. Get the name of one of the Elasticsearch pods:
+
----
$ oc get -n logging pods -l component=es

NAME                                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP             NODE                         NOMINATED NODE

----

.. Load the JSON file into the Elasticsearch pod:
+
----
$ cat <json-file-name> | \  <1>
oc exec -n logging -i -c elasticsearch <es-pod-name> -- \ <2>
    curl -s -k --cert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-cert \
    --key /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-key \
    https://localhost:9200/_template/<json-file-name> -XPUT -d@- | \ <1>
python -mjson.tool
----
<1> The name of the JSON file you created.
<2> The name of the Elasticsearch pod.
+
----
{
    "acknowledged": true
}
----

..  If you have a separate OPS cluster, get the name of one of the es-ops
Elasticsearch pods:
+
----
$ oc get -n logging pods -l component=es-ops

NAME                                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP             NODE                         NOMINATED NODE
logging-es-ops-data-master-o7nhcbo4-5-b7stm    2/2       Running   0          38m       154.128.0.80   ip-153-12-8-6.wef.internal   <none>
----

.. Load the JSON file into the es-ops Elasticsearch pod:
+
----
$ cat <json-file-name> | \ <1>
oc exec -n logging -i -c elasticsearch <esops-pod-name> -- \ <2>
    curl -s -k --cert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-cert \
    --key /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-key \
    https://localhost:9200/_template/<json-file-name> -XPUT -d@- | \ <1>
python -mjson.tool
----
<1> The name of the JSON file you created.
<2> The name of the OPS cluster Elasticsearch pod.
+
The output appears similar to the following:
+
----
{
    "acknowledged": true
}
----

.. Verify that the indices are updated:
+
----
oc exec -n logging -i -c elasticsearch <es-pod-name> -- \ <1>
    curl -s -k --cert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-cert \
    --key /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-key \
    https://localhost:9200/project.*/_search?sort=<custom-field>:desc | \ <2>
python -mjson.tool
----
<1> The name of the Elasticsearch or OPS cluster Elasticsearch pod.
<2> The name of a custom field you added.
+
The command outputs the index records for your custom fields sorted in descending order.
+
[NOTE]
====
The settings do not apply to existing indices. If you want to apply the settings
to existing indices, perform a re-index.
====

. Add the custom fields to Kibana:

.. Get the existing index pattern file from your Elasticsearch container:
+
----
$ mkdir index_patterns
$ cd index_patterns
$ oc project openshift-logging
$ for espod in $( oc get pods -l component=es -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' ) ; do
>  for ff in $( oc exec -c elasticsearch <es-pod-name> -- ls /usr/share/elasticsearch/index_patterns ) ; do
>    oc exec -c elasticsearch <es-pod-name> -- cat /usr/share/elasticsearch/index_patterns/$ff > $ff
>  done
>  break
> done
----
+
The index pattern files are downloaded to the *_/usr/share/elasticsearch/index_patterns_* directory.
+
For example:
+
----
index_patterns $ ls

com.redhat.viaq-openshift.index-pattern.json
----

.. Edit the corresponding index pattern files to add a definition for each custom field to the `fields` value:
+
For example:
+
----
{\"count\": 0, \"name\": \"mytimefield2\", \"searchable\": true, \"aggregatable\": true, \"readFromDocValues\": true, \"type\": \"date\", \"scripted\": false},
----
+
The definition must contain the `\"searchable\": true,` and `\"aggregatable\": true,` parameters in order to be used in visualizations. The data type must correspond to the Elasticsearch field definition you added above. For example, if you added the `myfield` field in Elasticsearch that is a `number` type, you cannot add `myfield` to Kibana as a `string` type.

.. In the index pattern file, add the name of the Kibana index pattern to the index pattern files:
+
For example, to use the *operations.\** index pattern:
+
----
"title": "*operations.*"
----
+
To use the *project.MYNAMESPACE.\** index pattern:
+
----
"title": "project.MYNAMESPACE.*"
----

.. Identify the user name and get the hash value of the user name. The index patterns are stored using the hash of the user name. Run the following two commands in order:
+
----
$ get_hash() {
>     printf "%s" "$1" | sha1sum | awk '{print $1}'
> }
----
+
----
$ get_hash admin

d0aeb5660fc2140aec35850c4da997
----

.. Apply the index pattern file to Elasticsearch:
+
----
cat com.redhat.viaq-openshift.index-pattern.json | \ <1>
  oc exec -i -c elasticsearch <espod-name> -- es_util \
    --query=".kibana.<user-hash>/index-pattern/<index>" -XPUT --data-binary @- | \ <2>
  python -mjson.tool
----
<1> The name of the index pattern file.
<2> The user hash and the index, either `.operations.\*` or `project.*`.
+
For example:
+
----
cat index-pattern.json | \
  oc exec -i -c elasticsearch mypod-23-gb9pl -- es_util \
    --query=".kibana.d0aeb5660fc2140aec35850c4da997/index-pattern/project.MYNAMESPACE.*" -XPUT --data-binary @- | \
  python -mjson.tool
----
+
The output appears similar to the following:
+
----
{
    "_id": ".operations.*",
    "_index": ".kibana.d0aeb5660fc2140aec35850c4da997",
    "_shards": {
        "failed": 0,
        "successful": 2,
        "total": 2
    },
    "_type": "index-pattern",
    "_version": 1,
    "created": true,
    "result": "created"
}
----

.. Exit and restart the Kibana console for the custom fields to appear in the *Available Fields* list and in the fields list on the *Management* -> *Index Patterns* page.

[[configuring-curator]]
=== Curator

Curator allows administrators to configure scheduled Elasticsearch maintenance
operations to be performed automatically on a per-project basis. It is scheduled
to perform actions daily based on its configuration. Only one Curator pod is
recommended per Elasticsearch cluster. Curator pods only run at the time stated
in the cronjob and then the pod terminates upon completion. Curator is
configured via a YAML configuration file with the following structure:

[NOTE]
====
The time zone is set based on the host node where the curator pod runs.
====

----
$PROJECT_NAME:
  $ACTION:
    $UNIT: $VALUE

$PROJECT_NAME:
  $ACTION:
    $UNIT: $VALUE
 ...

----

The available parameters are:

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`PROJECT_NAME`
|The actual name of a project, such as *myapp-devel*. For {product-title} *operations*
logs, use the name `.operations` as the project name.

|`ACTION`
|The action to take, currently only `delete` is allowed.

|`UNIT`
|One of `days`, `weeks`, or `months`.

|`VALUE`
|An integer for the number of units.

|`.defaults`
|Use `.defaults` as the `$PROJECT_NAME` to set the defaults for projects that are
not specified.

|`.regex`
|The list of regular expressions that match project names.

|`pattern`
|The valid and properly escaped regular expression pattern enclosed by single
quotation marks.

|===

For example, to configure Curator to:

- Delete indices in the *myapp-dev* project older than `1 day`
- Delete indices in the *myapp-qe* project older than `1 week`
- Delete *operations* logs older than `8 weeks`
- Delete all other projects indices after they are `31 days` old
- Delete indices older than 1 day that are matched by the '^project\..+\-dev.*$' regex
- Delete indices older than 2 days that are matched by the '^project\..+\-test.*$' regex

Use:

----
config.yaml: |
  myapp-dev:
    delete:
      days: 1

  myapp-qe:
    delete:
      weeks: 1

  .operations:
    delete:
      weeks: 8

  .defaults:
    delete:
      days: 31

  .regex:
    - pattern: '^project\..+\-dev\..*$'
      delete:
        days: 1
    - pattern: '^project\..+\-test\..*$'
      delete:
        days: 2
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you use `months` as the `$UNIT` for an operation, Curator starts counting at
the first day of the current month, not the current day of the current month.
For example, if today is April 15, and you want to delete indices that are 2 months
older than today (delete: months: 2), Curator does not delete indices that are dated
older than February 15; it deletes indices older than February 1. That is, it
goes back to the first day of the current month, then goes back two whole months
from that date. If you want to be exact with Curator, it is best to use days
(for example, `delete: days: 30`).
====

[[aggregate-logging-using-curator-actions-file]]
==== Using the Curator Actions File

Setting the {product-title} custom configuration file format ensures internal
indices are not mistakenly deleted.

To use the *actions file*, add an exclude rule to your Curator configuration to
retain these indices. You must manually add all of the required patterns.

[[aggregate-logging-creating-the-curator-configuration]]
==== Creating the Curator Configuration

The `openshift_logging` Ansible role provides a ConfigMap from which Curator
reads its configuration. You may edit or replace this ConfigMap to reconfigure
Curator. Currently the `logging-curator` ConfigMap is used to configure both
your ops and non-ops Curator instances. Any `.operations` configurations are
in the same location as your application logs configurations.

. To create the Curator configuration, edit the configuration in the deployed
ConfigMap:
+
----
$ oc edit configmap/logging-curator
----
+
Or, manually create the jobs from a cronjob:
+
----
oc create job --from=cronjob/logging-curator <job_name>
----
+
* For scripted deployments, copy the configuration file that was created by the
installer and create your new {product-title} custom configuration:
+
----
$ oc extract configmap/logging-curator --keys=curator5.yaml,config.yaml --to=/my/config
  edit /my/config/curator5.yaml
  edit /my/config/config.yaml
$ oc delete configmap logging-curator ; sleep 1
$ oc create configmap logging-curator \
    --from-file=curator5.yaml=/my/config/curator5.yaml \
    --from-file=config.yaml=/my/config/config.yaml \
    ; sleep 1
----
+
* Alternatively, if you are using the *actions file*:
+
----
$ oc extract configmap/logging-curator --keys=curator5.yaml,actions.yaml --to=/my/config
  edit /my/config/curator5.yaml
  edit /my/config/actions.yaml
$ oc delete configmap logging-curator ; sleep 1
$ oc create configmap logging-curator \
    --from-file=curator5.yaml=/my/config/curator5.yaml \
    --from-file=actions.yaml=/my/config/actions.yaml \
    ; sleep 1
----

The next scheduled job uses this configuration.

You can use the following commands to control the cronjob:

----
# suspend cronjob
oc patch cronjob logging-curator -p '{"spec":{"suspend":true}}'

# resume cronjob
oc patch cronjob logging-curator -p '{"spec":{"suspend":false}}

# change cronjob schedule
oc patch cronjob logging-curator -p '{"spec":{"schedule":"0 0 * * *"}}' <1>

[[troubleshooting-kibana]]
== Troubleshooting Kibana

Using the Kibana console with {product-title} can cause problems that are easily
solved, but are not accompanied with useful error messages. Check the following
troubleshooting sections if you are experiencing any problems when deploying
Kibana on {product-title}:

*Login Loop*

The OAuth2 proxy on the Kibana console must share a secret with the master
host's OAuth2 server. If the secret is not identical on both servers, it can
cause a login loop where you are continuously redirected back to the Kibana
login page.

To fix this issue, delete the current OAuthClient, change to the playbook directory and use `openshift-ansible`
to re-run the `openshift_logging` role:

====
----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory>] \
    playbooks/openshift-logging/config.yml
----
====

*Cryptic Error When Viewing the Console*

When attempting to visit the Kibana console, you may receive a browser
error instead:

====
----
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"The request is missing a required parameter,
 includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed."}
----
====

This can be caused by a mismatch between the OAuth2 client and server. The
return address for the client must be in a whitelist so the server can securely
redirect back after logging in.

Fix this issue by replacing the OAuthClient entry. Change to the playbook directory
and run the *_config.yml_* playbook again:

====
----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory>] \
    playbooks/openshift-logging/config.yml
----
====

If the problem persists, check that you are accessing Kibana at a URL listed in
the OAuth client. This issue can be caused by accessing the URL at a forwarded
port, such as 1443 instead of the standard 443 HTTPS port. You can adjust the
server whitelist by editing the OAuth client:

====
----
$ oc edit oauthclient/kibana-proxy
----
====

*503 Error When Viewing the Console*

If you receive a proxy error when viewing the Kibana console, it could be caused
by one of two issues.

First, Kibana may not be recognizing pods. If Elasticsearch is slow in starting
up, Kibana may timeout trying to reach it. Check whether the relevant service
has any endpoints:

====
----
$ oc describe service logging-kibana
Name:                   logging-kibana
[...]
Endpoints:              <none>
----
====

If any Kibana pods are live, endpoints are listed. If they are not, check
the state of the Kibana pods and deployment. You may need to scale the
deployment down and back up again.

The second possible issue may be caused if the route for accessing the Kibana
service is masked. This can happen if you perform a test deployment in one
project, then deploy in a different project without completely removing the
first deployment. When multiple routes are sent to the same destination, the
default router will only route to the first created. Check the problematic route
to see if it is defined in multiple places:

====
----
$ oc get route  --all-namespaces --selector logging-infra=support
----
====

*F-5 Load Balancer and X-Forwarded-For Enabled*

If you are attempting to use a F-5 load balancer in front of Kibana with
`X-Forwarded-For` enabled, this can cause an issue in which the Elasticsearch
`Searchguard` plug-in is unable to correctly accept connections from Kibana.

.Example Kibana Error Message
----
Kibana: Unknown error while connecting to Elasticsearch

Error: Unknown error while connecting to Elasticsearch
Error: UnknownHostException[No trusted proxies]
----

To configure Searchguard to ignore the extra header:

. Scale down all Fluentd pods.
. Scale down Elasticsearch after the Fluentd pods have terminated.
. Add `searchguard.http.xforwardedfor.header: DUMMY` to the Elasticsearch
configuration section.
+

----
$ oc edit configmap/logging-elasticsearch <1>
----
<1> This approach requires that Elasticsearch's configurations are within a ConfigMap.
+
. Scale Elasticsearch back up.
. Scale up all Fluentd pods.
////


[[sending-logs-to-an-external-elasticsearch-instance]]
== Sending Logs to an External Elasticsearch Instance

Fluentd sends logs to the value of the `ES_HOST`, `ES_PORT`, `OPS_HOST`,
and `OPS_PORT` environment variables of the Elasticsearch deployment
configuration. The application logs are directed to the `ES_HOST` destination,
and operations logs to `OPS_HOST`.

[NOTE]
====
Sending logs directly to an AWS Elasticsearch instance is not supported. Use
xref:fluentd-external-log-aggregator[Fluentd Secure Forward] to direct logs to
an instance of Fluentd that you control and that is configured with the
`fluent-plugin-aws-elasticsearch-service` plug-in.
====

To direct logs to a specific Elasticsearch instance, edit the deployment
configuration and replace the value of the above variables with the desired
instance:

----
$ oc edit ds/<daemon_set>
----

For an external Elasticsearch instance to contain both application and
operations logs, you can set `ES_HOST` and `OPS_HOST` to the same destination,
while ensuring that `ES_PORT` and `OPS_PORT` also have the same value.

Only Mutual TLS configuration is supported, as the provided Elasticsearch instance does.
Patch or recreate the *logging-fluentd* secret with your client key, client cert, and CA.

[NOTE]
====
If you are not using the provided Kibana and Elasticsearch images, you will not
have the same multi-tenant capabilities and your data will not be restricted by
user access to a particular project.
====

[[sending-logs-to-external-rsyslog]]
== Sending Logs to an External Syslog Server

Use the `fluent-plugin-remote-syslog` plug-in on the host to send logs to an
external syslog server.

Set environment variables in the `logging-fluentd` or `logging-mux` daemonsets:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: REMOTE_SYSLOG_HOST <1>
  value: host1
- name: REMOTE_SYSLOG_HOST_BACKUP
  value: host2
- name: REMOTE_SYSLOG_PORT_BACKUP
  value: 5555
----
<1> The desired remote syslog host. Required for each host.

This will build two destinations. The syslog server on `host1` will be
receiving messages on the default port of `514`, while `host2` will be receiving
the same messages on port `5555`.

Alternatively, you can configure your own custom *_fluent.conf_* in the
`logging-fluentd` or `logging-mux` ConfigMaps.

**Fluentd Environment Variables**

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`USE_REMOTE_SYSLOG`
|Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` to enable use of the
`fluent-plugin-remote-syslog` gem

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_HOST`
|(Required) Hostname or IP address of the remote syslog server.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_PORT`
|Port number to connect on. Defaults to `514`.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_SEVERITY`
|Set the syslog severity level. Defaults to `debug`.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_FACILITY`
|Set the syslog facility. Defaults to `local0`.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_USE_RECORD`
|Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` to use the record's severity and facility fields to set on the syslog message.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_REMOVE_TAG_PREFIX`
|Removes the prefix from the tag, defaults to `''` (empty).

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_TAG_KEY`
|If specified, uses this field as the key to look on the record, to set the tag on the syslog message.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_PAYLOAD_KEY`
|If specified, uses this field as the key to look on the record, to set the payload on the syslog message.

|`REMOTE_SYSLOG_TYPE`
|Set the transport layer protocol type. Defaults to `syslog_buffered`, which sets the TCP protocol. To switch to UDP, set this to `syslog`.

== Performing Administrative Elasticsearch Operations

As of logging version
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.2.0,
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.2.0,
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
an administrator certificate, key, and CA that can be used to communicate with and perform
administrative operations on Elasticsearch are provided within the
*logging-elasticsearch* secret.

[NOTE]
====
To confirm whether or not your EFK installation provides these, run:
----
$ oc describe secret logging-elasticsearch
----
====

. Connect to an Elasticsearch pod that is in the cluster on which you are
attempting to perform maintenance.

. To find a pod in a cluster use either:
+
----
$ oc get pods -l component=es -o name | head -1
$ oc get pods -l component=es-ops -o name | head -1
----

. Connect to a pod:
+
----
$ oc rsh <your_Elasticsearch_pod>
----

. Once connected to an Elasticsearch container, you can use the certificates
mounted from the secret to communicate with Elasticsearch per its
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/indices.html[Indices APIs documentation].
+
Fluentd sends its logs to Elasticsearch using the index format *project.{project_name}.{project_uuid}.YYYY.MM.DD*
where YYYY.MM.DD is the date of the log record.
+
For example, to delete all logs for the *openshift-logging* project with uuid *3b3594fa-2ccd-11e6-acb7-0eb6b35eaee3*
from June 15, 2016, we can run:
+
----
$ curl --key /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-key \
  --cert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-cert \
  --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-ca -XDELETE \
  "https://localhost:9200/project.logging.3b3594fa-2ccd-11e6-acb7-0eb6b35eaee3.2016.06.15"
----

[[fluentd-redeploy-certs]]
== Redeploying EFK Certificates

You can use an Ansible playbook to perform a certificate rotation for the EFK stack without needing to run the install/upgrade playbook.

This playbook deletes the current certificate files, generates new EFK certificates, updates certificate secrets, and restarts Kibana and Elasticsearch
to force those components to read in the updated certificates.

To redeploy EFK certificates:

. Use the Ansible playbook to redeploy the EFK certificates:
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/openshift-logging/redeploy-certificates.yml
----
endif::openshift-origin[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/openshift-logging/redeploy-certificates.yml
----
endif::openshift-enterprise[]


[[fluentd-update-source]]
== Changing the Aggregated Logging Driver

For aggregated logging, it is recommended to use the `json-file` log driver.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using the `json-file` driver, ensure that you are using Docker
version *docker-1.12.6-55.gitc4618fb.el7_4 now* or later.
====

Fluentd determines the driver Docker is using by checking the
*_/etc/docker/daemon.json_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* files.

You can determine which driver Docker is using with the `docker info` command:

----
# docker info | grep Logging

Logging Driver: journald
----

To change to `json-file`:

. Modify either the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* or *_/etc/docker/daemon.json_* files.
+
For example:
+
[source,json]
----
# cat /etc/sysconfig/docker
OPTIONS=' --selinux-enabled --log-driver=json-file --log-opt max-size=1M --log-opt max-file=3 --signature-verification=False'

cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
"log-driver": "json-file",
"log-opts": {
"max-size": "1M",
"max-file": "1"
}
}
----

. Restart the Docker service:
+
----
systemctl restart docker
----

. Restart Fluentd.
+
[WARNING]
====
Restarting Fluentd on more than a dozen nodes at once will create a large load
on the Kubernetes scheduler. Exercise caution when using the following the
directions to restart Fluentd.
====
+
There are two methods for restarting Fluentd. You can restart the Fluentd on one
node or a set of nodes, or on all nodes.
+
.. The following steps demonstrate how to restart Fluentd on one node or a set of
nodes.

... List the nodes where Fluentd is running:
+
----
$ oc get nodes -l logging-infra-fluentd=true
----
+
... For each node, remove the label and turn off Fluentd:
+
----
$ oc label node $node logging-infra-fluentd-
----
+
... Verify Fluentd is off:
+
----
$ oc get pods -l component=fluentd
----
+
... For each node, restart Fluentd:
+
----
$ oc label node $node logging-infra-fluentd=true
----
+
.. The following steps demonstrate how to restart the Fluentd all nodes.

... Turn off Fluentd on all nodes:
+
----
$ oc label node -l logging-infra-fluentd=true --overwrite logging-infra-fluentd=false
----
+
... Verify Fluentd is off:
+
----
$ oc get pods -l component=fluentd
----
+
... Restart Fluentd on all nodes:
+
----
$ oc label node -l logging-infra-fluentd=false --overwrite logging-infra-fluentd=true
----
+
... Verify Fluentd is on:
+
----
$ oc get pods -l component=fluentd
----

[[exported-fields]]
== Exported Fields

These are the fields exported by the logging system and available for searching
from Elasticsearch and Kibana. Use the full, dotted field name when searching.
For example, for an Elasticsearch */_search URL*, to look for a Kubernetes pod name,
use `/_search/q=kubernetes.pod_name:name-of-my-pod`.
The following sections describe fields that may not be present in your logging store.
Not all of these fields are present in every record.
The fields are grouped in the following categories:

* `exported-fields-Default`
* `exported-fields-rsyslog`
* `exported-fields-systemd`
* `exported-fields-kubernetes`
* `exported-fields-docker`
* `exported-fields-pipeline_metadata`
* `exported-fields-ovirt`
* `exported-fields-aushape`
* `exported-fields-tlog`

[discrete]
[[exported-fields-Default]]
=== Top Level Fields

The top level fields are common to every application, and may be present in
every record. For the Elasticsearch template, top level fields populate the actual
mappings of `default` in the template's mapping section.

[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description

| `@timestamp`
| The UTC value marking when the log payload was created, or when the log payload
was first collected if the creation time is not known. This is the log
processing pipeline’s best effort determination of when the log payload was
generated. Add the `@` prefix convention to note a field as being reserved for a
particular use. With Elasticsearch, most tools look for `@timestamp` by default.
For example, the format would be 2015-01-24 14:06:05.071000.

| `geoip`
|This is geo-ip of the machine.

| `hostname`
|The `hostname` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the entity
generating the original payload. This field is an attempt to derive this
context. Sometimes the entity generating it knows the context. While other times
that entity has a restricted namespace itself, which is known by the collector
or normalizer.

| `ipaddr4`
|The IP address V4 of the source server, which can be an array.

| `ipaddr6`
|The IP address V6 of the source server, if available.

| `level`
|The logging level as provided by `rsyslog` (severitytext property), python's
logging module. Possible values are as listed at
link:http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=misc/sys/syslog.h;h=ee01478c4b19a954426a96448577c5a76e6647c0;hb=HEAD#l74[`misc/sys/syslog.h`]
plus `trace` and `unknown`. For example, "alert crit debug emerg err info notice
trace unknown warning". Note that `trace` is not in the `syslog.h` list but many
applications use it.

. You should only use `unknown` when the logging system gets a value it does not
understand, and note that it is the highest level.
. Consider `trace` as higher or more verbose, than `debug`.
. `error` is deprecated, use `err`.
. Convert `panic` to `emerg`.
. Convert `warn` to `warning`.

Numeric values from `syslog/journal PRIORITY` can usually be mapped using the
priority values as listed at
link:http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=misc/sys/syslog.h;h=ee01478c4b19a954426a96448577c5a76e6647c0;hb=HEAD#l51[misc/sys/syslog.h].

Log levels and priorities from other logging systems should be mapped to the
nearest match. See
link:https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/logging.html#logging-levels[python
logging] for an example.

| `message`
|A typical log entry message, or payload. It can be stripped of metadata pulled
out of it by the collector or normalizer, that is UTF-8 encoded.

| `pid`
|This is the process ID of the logging entity, if available.

| `service`
|The name of the service associated with the logging entity, if available. For
example, the `syslog APP-NAME` and `rsyslog programname` property are mapped to
the service field.

| `tags`
|Optionally provided operator defined list of tags placed on each log by the
collector or normalizer. The payload can be a string with whitespace-delimited
string tokens, or a JSON list of string tokens.

| `file`
|Optional path to the file containing the log entry local to the collector `TODO`
analyzer for file paths.

| `offset`
|The offset value can represent bytes to the start of the log line in the file
(zero or one based), or log line numbers (zero or one based), as long as the
values are strictly monotonically increasing in the context of a single log
file. The values are allowed to wrap, representing a new version of the log file
(rotation).

| `namespace_name`
|Associate this record with the `namespace` that shares it's name. This value
will not be stored, but it is used to associate the record with the appropriate
`namespace` for access control and visualization. Normally this value will be
given in the tag, but if the protocol does not support sending a tag, this field
can be used. If this field is present, it will override the `namespace` given in
the tag or in `kubernetes.namespace_name`.

| `namespace_uuid`
|This is the `uuid` associated with the `namespace_name`. This value will not be
stored, but is used to associate the record with the appropriate namespace for
access control and visualization. If this field is present, it will override the
`uuid` given in `kubernetes.namespace_uuid`. This will also cause the Kubernetes
metadata lookup to be skipped for this log record.

[[manual-elasticsearch-rollouts]]
== Manual Elasticsearch Rollouts

As of {product-title} 3.7 the Aggregated Logging stack updated the Elasticsearch
Deployment Config object so that it no longer has a Config Change Trigger, meaning
any changes to the `dc` will not result in an automatic rollout. This was to prevent
unintended restarts happening in the Elasticsearch cluster, which could create excessive shard
rebalancing as cluster members restart.

This section presents two restart procedures: xref:elasticsearch-rolling-restart[rolling-restart]
and xref:elasticsearch-full-restart[full-restart]. Where a rolling restart
applies appropriate changes to the Elasticsearch cluster without down time
(provided three masters are configured) and a full restart safely applies major
changes without risk to existing data.

[[elasticsearch-rolling-restart]]
=== Performing an Elasticsearch Rolling Cluster Restart

A rolling restart is recommended, when any of the following changes are made:

* nodes on which Elasticsearch pods run require a reboot
* logging-elasticsearch configmap
* logging-es-* deployment configuration
* new image deployment, or upgrade

This will be the recommended restart policy going forward.

=== Performing an Elasticsearch Full Cluster Restart

A full restart is recommended when changing major versions of Elasticsearch or
other changes which might put data integrity a risk during the change process.

[NOTE]
====
Any action you do for an Elasticsearch cluster will need to be repeated for the ops cluster
if `openshift_logging_use_ops` was configured to be `True`.
====

[NOTE]
====
When making changes to the `logging-es-ops` service use components
"es-ops-blocked" and "es-ops" instead in the patch
====

. Disable all external communications to the Elasticsearch cluster while it is down. Edit
your non-cluster logging service (for example, `logging-es`, `logging-es-ops`)
to no longer match the Elasticsearch pods running:
+
----
$  oc patch svc/logging-es -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"component":"es-blocked","provider":"openshift"}}}'
----

. Perform a shard synced flush to ensure there are no pending operations waiting
to be written to disk prior to shutting down:
+
----
$ oc exec -c elasticsearch <any_es_pod_in_the_cluster> -- \
          curl -s \
          --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-ca \
          --cert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-cert \
          --key /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-key \
          -XPOST 'https://localhost:9200/_flush/synced'
----

. Prevent shard balancing when purposely bringing down nodes:
+
----
$ oc exec -c elasticsearch <any_es_pod_in_the_cluster> -- \
          curl -s \
          --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-ca \
          --cert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-cert \
          --key /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-key \
          -XPUT 'https://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings' \
          -d '{ "transient": { "cluster.routing.allocation.enable" : "none" } }'
----

. Once complete, for each `dc` you have for an Elasticsearch cluster, scale down all nodes:
+
----
$ oc scale dc <dc_name> --replicas=0
----

. Once scale down is complete, for each `dc` you have for an Elasticsearch cluster, run
`oc rollout latest` to deploy the latest version of the `dc` object:
+
----
$ oc rollout latest <dc_name>
----
+
You will see a new pod deployed. Once the pod has two ready containers, you can
move on to the next `dc`.

. Once deployment is complete, for each `dc` you have for an Elasticsearch cluster, scale up
the nodes:
+
----
$ oc scale dc <dc_name> --replicas=1
----

. Once the scale up is complete, enable all external communications to the ES
cluster. Edit your non-cluster logging service (for example, `logging-es`,
`logging-es-ops`) to match the Elasticsearch pods running again:
+
----
$ oc patch svc/logging-es -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"component":"es","provider":"openshift"}}}'
----

[[logging-troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting EFK

The following is troubleshooting information for a number of commonly identified issues with cluster logging deployments:

===  Troubleshooting related to all EFK components

The following troubleshooting issues apply to the EFK stack in general.

*Deployment fails, ReplicationControllers scaled to 0*

If you perform a deployment that does not successfully bring up an
instance before a ten-minute timeout, {product-title} considers the deployment as failed
and scales down to zero instances. The `oc get pods` command shows a deployer pod
with a non-zero exit code and no deployed pods.

In the following example, the deployer pod name for an Elasticsearch deployment is shown;
this is from ReplicationController `logging-es-2e7ut0iq-1`, which is a deployment
of DeploymentConfig `logging-es-2e7ut0iq`.

----
NAME                           READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
logging-es-2e7ut0iq-1-deploy   1/1       ExitCode:255       0          1m
----

Deployment failure can happen for a number of transitory reasons, such as
the image pull taking too long or nodes being unresponsive.

Examine the deployer pod logs for possible reasons or attempt to redeploy:

----
$ oc deploy --latest logging-es-2e7ut0iq
----

Alternatively, attempt to scale up the existing deployment:

----
$ oc scale --replicas=1 logging-es-2e7ut0iq-1
----

If the problem persists, examine the pod, events, and systemd unit
logs to determine the source of the problem.

*Cannot resolve kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local*

This internal alias for the master must be resolvable by the included DNS server on the master.
Depending on your platform, you can run the `dig` command (for example, in a container) against the master to check whether this is the case:

----
$ dig kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local @localhost
[...]
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local. IN A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local. 30 IN A   172.30.0.1
----

Older versions of cluster logging did not automatically define this internal
alias for the master. You might need to upgrade your cluster in order to
use aggregated logging. If your cluster is up to date, there might be
a problem with your pods reaching the SkyDNS resolver at the master
or the pod could have been blocked from running. You must resolve this
problem before deploying again.

*Cannot connect to the master or services*

If DNS resolution does not return at all or the address cannot be
connected to from within a pod (such as the *fluentd* pod), this could be an
indication of a system firewall/network problem. You must debug this problem.

=== Troubleshooting related to ElasticSearch

The following troubleshooting issues apply to the ElasticSearch components of the EFK stack.

*Elasticsearch deployments never succeed and rollback to previous version*

This situation typically occurs itself on {product-title} with cluster logging deployed on AWS. Describing the Elasticsearch pods typically reveals issues re-attaching the pods
storage:

----
$ oc describe pod <elasticsearch-pod>
----

Consider patching each Elasticsearch deployment configuration to allow more time for AWS to make the storage available:

----
$ oc patch dc <elasticsearch-deployment-config> -p '{"spec":{"strategy":{"recreateParams": {"timeoutSeconds":1800}}}}'
----

*Searchguard index remains red*

This is a known issue related to upgrading and moving to a single SearchGuard index per
cluster instead of one index per deployment configuration.  The Elasticsearch Explain API is used to discover the reason and removing the index to node assignment is required:

----
$ oc -c elasticsearch exec ${pod} -- es_util --query=".searchguard/_settings" -XPUT -d "{\"index.routing.allocation.include._name\": \"\"}"
----

*Elasticsearch pods never become ready*

This is known issue when the initialization and seeding process fails, which
can be from a red `.searchguard` index.

----
for p in $(oc get pods -l component=es -o jsonpath={.items[*].metadata.name}); do \
  oc exec -c elasticsearch $ES_POD -- touch /opt/app-root/src/init_failures;  \
done
----

=== Kibana

The following troubleshooting issues apply to the Kibana components of the EFK stack.

*Looping log in on Kibana*

If you launch the Kibana console and login successfully, you are incorrectly redirected back to Kibana,
which immediately redirects back to the login screen.

The likely cause for this issue is that the OAuth2 proxy in front of Kibana
must share a secret with the master's OAuth2 server in order
to identify it as a valid client. This problem could indicate that
the secrets do not match. Nothing reports this problem in a way that can be exposed.

This can happen when you deploy logging more than once. For example, if you fix the initial deployment and the `secret`
used by Kibana is replaced while the matching master `oauthclient` entry to match is not replaced.

You can do the following:

----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
----

Follow the `openshift-ansible` instructions to re-run the `openshift_logging` role.
This replaces the oauthclient and your next successful login should not loop.

----
*"error":"invalid\_request" on login*
----

*Login error on Kibana*

When attempting to visit the Kibana console, you might receive a browser error instead:

----
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"The request is missing a required parameter,
 includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed."}
----

This problem can be caused by a mismatch between the OAuth2 client and server.
The return address for the client must be in a whitelist so the server can
securely redirect back after logging in. If there is a mismatch, the
error message is shown.

This can be caused by an `oauthclient` entry lingering from a
previous deployment, in which case you can replace it:

----
$ oc delete oauthclient/kibana-proxy
----

Follow the `openshift-ansible` instructions to re-run the `openshift_logging` role,
which replaces the `oauthclient` entry. Return to the Kibana console and log in again.

If the problem persists, check that you are accessing Kibana at a URL listed in the OAuth client.
This issue can be caused by accessing the URL at a forwarded port, such as 1443 instead of the standard 443 HTTPS port.

You can adjust the server whitelist by editing its `oauthclient`:

----
$ oc edit oauthclient/kibana-proxy
----

Edit the list of redirect URIs accepted to include the address you are actually using. After you save and exit, this should resolve the error.

*Kibana access shows 503 error*

If you receive a proxy error when viewing the Kibana console, it could be caused by one of two issues.

* Kibana might not be recognizing pods. If ElasticSearch is slow in starting up, Kibana might
error out trying to reach ElasticSearch and Kibana does not consider it alive. You can
check whether the relevant service has any endpoints:
+
----
$ oc describe service logging-kibana
Name:                   logging-kibana
[...]
Endpoints:              <none>
----
+
If any Kibana pods are live, endpoints should be listed. If they are
not, check the state of the Kibana pod(s) and deployment.

* The named route for accessing the Kibana service might be masked.
+
This can happen if you perform a test deployment in one project, then deploy in a different project without completely removing the first deployment.
When multiple routes are sent to the same destination, the default router only routes to the first destination created.
Check the problematic route to see if it is defined in multiple places:
+
----
$ oc get route  --all-namespaces --selector logging-infra=support
NAMESPACE   NAME         HOST/PORT                 PATH      SERVICE
logging     kibana       kibana.example.com                  logging-kibana
logging     kibana-ops   kibana-ops.example.com              logging-kibana-ops
----
+
In this example there are no overlapping routes.
