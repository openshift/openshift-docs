This guide walks cluster administrators through the process of installing the {pipelines-title} Operator to an {OCP} cluster.

// Prerequisites for installing OpenShift Operator
[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* You have access to an {OCP} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have installed `oc` CLI.
* You have installed xref:../tkn_cli/installing-tkn.adoc#installing-tkn[{pipelines-shortname} (`tkn`) CLI] on your local system.
* Your cluster has the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/cluster-capabilities.html#marketplace-operator_cluster-capabilities[Marketplace capability] enabled or the Red Hat Operator catalog source configured manually.

* Ensure that you have downloaded the {cluster-manager-url-pull} as shown in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.html#installation-obtaining-installer_installing-gcp-customizations[Obtaining the installation program] to install this Operator.
