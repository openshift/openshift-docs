== Overview

The xref:../architecture/networking/sdn.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-sdn[OpenShift SDN] enables
communication between pods across the {product-title} cluster, establishing a _pod
network_. Three xref:../architecture/networking/sdn.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-sdn[SDN plug-ins]
are currently available (*ovs-subnet*, *ovs-multitenant*, and *ovs-networkpolicy*), which provide
different methods for configuring the pod network.

[[admin-guide-configuring-sdn-available-sdn-providers]]
== Available SDN Providers

The upstream Kubernetes project does not come with a default network solution.
Instead, Kubernetes has developed a Container Network Interface (CNI) to allow
network providers for integration with their own SDN solutions.

There are several OpenShift SDN plug-ins available out of the box from Red Hat,
as well as third-party plug-ins.

Red Hat has worked with a number of SDN providers to certify their SDN network
solution on {product-title} via the Kubernetes CNI interface, including a
support process for their SDN plug-in through their product’s entitlement
process. Should you open a support case with OpenShift, Red Hat can facilitate
an exchange process so that both companies are involved in meeting your needs.

The following SDN solutions are validated and supported on {product-title}
directly by the third-party vendor:

* Cisco ACI (™)
* Juniper Contrail (™)
* Nokia Nuage (™)
* Tigera Calico (™)
* VMware NSX-T (™)

[[configuring-sdn-installing-vmware-nsx-t]]
==== Installing VMware NSX-T (™) on {product-title}

VMware NSX-T (™) provides an SDN and security infrastructure to build
cloud-native application environments. In addition to vSphere hypervisors (ESX),
these environments include KVM and native public clouds.

The current integration requires a _new_ install of both NSX-T and
{product-title}. Currently, NSX-T version 2.4 is supported, and only supports
the use of ESXi and KVM hypervisors at this time.

See the
link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/nsxt_24_ncp_openshift.pdf[NSX-T
Container Plug-in for OpenShift - Installation and Administration Guide] for
more information.


[[configuring-sdn-config-pod-network-ansible]]
== Configuring the Pod Network with Ansible

For initial cluster installations, the *ovs-subnet* plug-in is installed and
configured by default, though it can be overridden during installation using the
`os_sdn_network_plugin_name` parameter, which is configurable in the Ansible
inventory file.

For example, to override the standard *ovs-subnet* plug-in and use the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in instead:

----
# Configure the multi-tenant SDN plugin (default is 'redhat/openshift-ovs-subnet')
os_sdn_network_plugin_name='redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant'
----

See
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-networking-variables-table[Configuring Cluster Variables] for descriptions of networking-related Ansible variables
that can be set in your inventory file.

[[configuring-the-pod-network-on-masters]]
== Configuring the Pod Network on Masters

The cluster administrators can control pod network settings on master hosts by
modifying parameters in the `*networkConfig*` section of the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[master
configuration file] (located at *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* by
default):

.Configuring a pod network for a single CIDR
[source,yaml]
----
networkConfig:
  clusterNetworks:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14 <1>
    hostSubnetLength: 9 <2>
  networkPluginName: "redhat/openshift-ovs-subnet" <3>
  serviceNetworkCIDR: 172.30.0.0/16 <4>
----
<1> Cluster network for node IP allocation
<2> Number of bits for pod IP allocation within a node
<3> Set to `redhat/openshift-ovs-subnet` for the *ovs-subnet* plug-in,
`redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant` for the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in, or
`redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy` for the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in
<4> Service IP allocation for the cluster

Alternatively, you can create a pod network with multiple CIDR ranges by
adding separate ranges into the `clusterNetworks` field with the range and the `hostSubnetLength`.

Multiple ranges can be used at once, and the range can be expanded or
contracted. Nodes can be moved from one range to another by evacuating a node,
then deleting and re-creating the node. See the
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#admin-guide-manage-nodes[Managing Nodes]
section for more information. Node allocations occur in the order listed, then
when the range is full, move to the next on the list.

.Configuring a pod network for multiple CIDRs
[source,yaml]
----
networkConfig:
  clusterNetworks:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14 <1>
    hostSubnetLength: 9 <2>
  - cidr: 10.132.0.0/14
    hostSubnetLength: 9
  externalIPNetworkCIDRs: null
  hostSubnetLength: 9
  ingressIPNetworkCIDR: 172.29.0.0/16
  networkPluginName: redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant <3>
  serviceNetworkCIDR: 172.30.0.0/16
----
<1> Cluster network for node IP allocation.
<2> Number of bits for pod IP allocation within a node.
<3> Set to `redhat/openshift-ovs-subnet` for the *ovs-subnet* plug-in,
`redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant` for the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in, or
`redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy` for the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in.

You can add elements to the `clusterNetworks` value, or remove them if no node
is using that CIDR range.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `*hostSubnetLength*` value cannot be changed after the cluster is
first created, A `*cidr*` field can only be changed to be a
larger network that still contains the original network if nodes are
allocated within it's range , and
`*serviceNetworkCIDR*` can only be expanded. For example, given the
typical value of *10.128.0.0/14*, you could change
`*cidr*` to *10.128.0.0/9* (i.e., the entire upper half
of net 10) but not to *10.64.0.0/16*, because that does not overlap
the original value.

You can change `*serviceNetworkCIDR*` from *172.30.0.0/16* to *172.30.0.0/15*,
but not to *172.28.0.0/14*, because even though the original range is entirely
inside the new range, the original range must be at the start of the CIDR. See
xref:expanding-the-service-network[Expanding the service network] for more
information.
====

Ensure that you restart the API and master services for any changes to take effect:

----
$ master-restart api
$ master-restart controllers
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The pod network settings on the nodes must match the pod network settings configured by the networkConfig.clusterNetworks parameter on the masters. This can be done by modifying parameters in the `*networkConfig*` section of the appropriate xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#modifying-nodes[node configuration map]:
----
proxyArguments:
  cluster-cidr:
  - 10.128.0.0/12 <1>
----
<1> The CIDR value must encompass all the cluster network CIDR ranges defined at the master level but not conflict with other IP ranges, such as for nodes and services.

====

After the master services have been restarted the configuration must be propagated to the nodes. On each node the atomic-openshift-node service and ovs pod must be restarted. To avoid downtime follow the steps defined in xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#admin-guide-manage-nodes[Managing Nodes] and described in the following procedure for each node or group of nodes at a time:

. Mark the node as unschedulable:
+
----
# oc adm manage-node <node1> <node2> --schedulable=false
----

. Drain the node:
+
----
# oc adm drain <node1> <node2>
----

. Restart the node:
+
----
# reboot
----

. Mark the node as schedulable again:
+
----
#  oc adm manage-node <node1> <node2> --schedulable
----

[[config-changing-vxlan-port-for-cluster-network]]
== Changing the VXLAN PORT for the cluster network

As a cluster administrator, you can change the VXLAN port the system uses.

Because you cannot change the VXLAN port of a running `clusternetwork` object, you must delete any existing network configurations and
create a new configuration by editing the `vxlanPort` variable in the master configuration file.

. Delete the existing `clusternetwork`:
+
----
# oc delete clusternetwork default
----

. Edit the master configuration file located at
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* by default creating the new `clusternetwork`:
+
----
networkConfig:
  clusterNetworks:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostSubnetLength: 9
  - cidr: 10.132.0.0/14
    hostSubnetLength: 9
  externalIPNetworkCIDRs: null
  hostSubnetLength: 9
  ingressIPNetworkCIDR: 172.29.0.0/16
  networkPluginName: redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant
  serviceNetworkCIDR: 172.30.0.0/16
  vxlanPort: 4889 <1>
----
<1> Set to the value used by the nodes for the VXLAN Port. It can be an integer between 1-65535. The default value is `4789`.

. Add the new port to the iptables rule on each cluster node:
+
----
# iptables -A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -p udp -m state --state NEW -m udp --dport 4889 -j ACCEPT <1>
----
<1> `4889` is the `vxlanPort` value that you set in the master configuration file.

. Restart the master services:
+
----
# master-restart api
# master-restart controllers
----

. Delete any old SDN pods to propagate new pods with the new change:
+
----
# oc delete pod -l app=sdn -n openshift-sdn
----

[[configuring-the-pod-network-on-nodes]]
== Configuring the Pod Network on Nodes

The cluster administrators can control pod network settings on nodes by modifying
parameters in the `*networkConfig*` section of the
appropriate xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#modifying-nodes[node configuration map]:

====
[source,yaml]
----
networkConfig:
  mtu: 1450 <1>
  networkPluginName: "redhat/openshift-ovs-subnet" <2>
----
<1> Maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the pod overlay network
<2> Set to *redhat/openshift-ovs-subnet* for the *ovs-subnet* plug-in,
*redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant* for the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in, or
*redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy* for the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in
====

[NOTE]
====
You must change the MTU size on all masters and nodes that are part of the
{product-title} SDN. Also, the MTU size of the tun0 interface must be the same
across all nodes that are part of the cluster.
====

[[expanding-the-service-network]]
== Expanding the service network

If you are running low on addresses in your service network, you can expand the
range as long as you ensure that the current range is at the beginning of the
new range:

. xref:configuring-the-pod-network-on-masters[Change the `*serviceNetworkCIDR*`
parameter in the configuration files for all masters]
(*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* by default). Change only the number
following the `/` to a smaller number.

. Delete the `*clusterNetwork*` object:
+
----
$ oc delete clusternetwork default
----

. Restart the master host services:
+
----
# master-restart controllers
----

. Update the value of the `openshift_portal_net` variable in the Ansible
inventory file to the new CIDR:
+
----
# Configure SDN cluster network and kubernetes service CIDR blocks. These
# network blocks should be private and should not conflict with network blocks
# in your infrastructure that pods may require access to. Can not be changed
# after deployment.
#osm_cluster_network_cidr=10.1.0.0/16
#openshift_portal_net=172.30.0.0/<new_CIDR_range>
----

. Run the `*config.yml*` Ansible playbook to redeploy the cluster:
+
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/openshift-master/config.yml
----

[[migrating-between-sdn-plugins]]
== Migrating Between SDN Plug-ins

If you are already using one SDN plug-in and want to switch to another:

. Change the `*networkPluginName*` parameter on all
xref:configuring-the-pod-network-on-masters[masters] and
xref:configuring-the-pod-network-on-nodes[nodes] in their configuration files.

. Restart the API and master services on all masters:
+
----
# master-restart api
# master-restart controllers
----

. Stop the node service on all masters and nodes:
+
----
# systemctl stop atomic-openshift-node.service
----

. If you are switching between OpenShift SDN plug-ins, restart OpenShift SDN on all masters and nodes.
+
----
oc delete pod --all -n openshift-sdn
----

. Restart the node service on all masters and nodes:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node.service
----

. If you are switching from an OpenShift SDN plug-in to a
third-party plug-in, then clean up OpenShift SDN-specific
artifacts:
+
----
$ oc delete clusternetwork --all
$ oc delete hostsubnets --all
$ oc delete netnamespaces --all
----

When switching from the *ovs-subnet* to the *ovs-multitenant* OpenShift SDN plug-in,
all the existing projects in the cluster will be fully isolated (assigned unique VNIDs).
The cluster administrators can choose to xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-pod-network[modify
the project networks] using the administrator CLI.

Check VNIDs by running:

----
$ oc get netnamespace
----

[[migrating-between-sdn-plugins-networkpolicy]]
=== Migrating from ovs-multitenant to ovs-networkpolicy

[NOTE]
====
The `v1` NetworkPolicy features are available only in {product-title}. This
means that egress policy types, IPBlock, and combining `podSelector` and
`namespaceSelector` are not available in {product-title}.
====

[NOTE]
====
Do not apply `NetworkPolicy` features on default {product-title} projects, because they can disrupt communication with the cluster.
====

In addition to the generic plug-in migration steps above in the xref:migrating-between-sdn-plugins[Migrating between SDN plug-ins section], there is one additional
step when migrating from the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in to the
*ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in; you must ensure that every namespace has a unique
`NetID`. This means that if you have previously
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#joining-project-networks[joined
projects together] or
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#making-project-networks-global[made
projects global], you will need to undo that before switching to the
*ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in, or the NetworkPolicy objects may not function
correctly.

A helper script is available that fixes `NetID's`, creates NetworkPolicy objects
to isolate previously-isolated namespaces, and enables connections between
previously-joined namespaces.

Use the following steps to migrate to the *ovs-networkpolicy*
plug-in, by using this helper script, while still running the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in:

. Download the script and add the execution file permission:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/contrib/migration/migrate-network-policy.sh
$ chmod a+x migrate-network-policy.sh
----
. Run the script (requires the cluster administrator role).
+
[source, bash]
----
$ ./migrate-network-policy.sh
----

After running this script, every namespace is fully isolated from every other
namespace, therefore connection attempts between pods in different namespaces
will fail until you complete the migration to the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in.

If you want newly-created namespaces to also have the same policies by default, you can set
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy-setting-default[default
NetworkPolicy objects] to be created matching the `default-deny` and
`allow-from-global-namespaces` policies created by the migration script.

[NOTE]
====
In case of script failures or other errors, or if you later decide you want to
revert back to the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in, you can use the
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/contrib/migration/unmigrate-network-policy.sh[un-migration script]. This script undoes the changes made by the migration script and re-joins
previously-joined namespaces.
====

[[external-access-to-the-cluster-network]]
== External Access to the Cluster Network

If a host that is external to {product-title} requires access to the cluster network,
you have two options:

. Configure the host as an {product-title} node but mark it
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[unschedulable]
so that the master does not schedule containers on it.
. Create a tunnel between your host and a host that is on the cluster network.

Both options are presented as part of a practical use-case in the documentation
for configuring xref:../install_config/routing_from_edge_lb.adoc#install-config-routing-from-edge-lb[routing from an
edge load-balancer to containers within OpenShift SDN].

[[using-flannel]]
== Using Flannel
As an alternate to the default SDN, {product-title} also provides Ansible
playbooks for installing *flannel*-based networking. This is useful if running
{product-title} within a cloud provider platform that also relies on SDN, such
as Red Hat OpenStack Platform, and you want to avoid encapsulating packets twice
through both platforms.

Flannel uses a single IP network space for all of the containers allocating a
contiguous subset of the space to each instance. Consequently, nothing prevents
a container from attempting to contact any IP address in the same network
space. This hinders multi-tenancy because the network cannot be used to isolate
containers in one application from another.

Depending on whether you prefer mutli-tenancy isolation or performance, you should determine the
appropriate choice when deciding between OpenShift SDN (multi-tenancy) and flannel (performance)
for internal networks.

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Flannel is only supported for {product-title} on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.
====
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The current version of Neutron enforces port security on ports by default. This
prevents the port from sending or receiving packets with a MAC address
different from that on the port itself. Flannel creates virtual MACs and IP
addresses and must send and receive packets on the port, so port security must
be disabled on the ports that carry flannel traffic.
====

To enable flannel within your {product-title} cluster:

. Neutron port security controls must be configured to be compatible with
Flannel. The default configuration of Red Hat OpenStack Platform disables user
control of `port_security`. Configure Neutron to allow users to control the
`port_security` setting on individual ports.
+
.. On the Neutron servers, add the following to the
*_/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini_* file:
+
----
[ml2]
...
extension_drivers = port_security
----
+
.. Then, restart the Neutron services:
+
----
service neutron-dhcp-agent restart
service neutron-ovs-cleanup restart
service neutron-metadata-agentrestart
service neutron-l3-agent restart
service neutron-plugin-openvswitch-agent restart
service neutron-vpn-agent restart
service neutron-server  restart
----

. When creating the {product-title} instances on Red Hat OpenStack Platform, disable both port security and security
groups in the ports where the container network flannel interface will be:
+
----
neutron port-update $port --no-security-groups --port-security-enabled=False
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Flannel gather information from etcd to configure and assign
the subnets in the nodes. Therefore, the security group attached to the etcd
hosts should allow access from nodes to port 2379/tcp, and nodes security
group should allow egress communication to that port on the etcd hosts.
====

.. Set the following variables in your Ansible inventory file before running the
installation:
+
----
openshift_use_openshift_sdn=false <1>
openshift_use_flannel=true <2>
flannel_interface=eth0
----
<1> Set `openshift_use_openshift_sdn` to `false` to disable the default SDN.
<2> Set `openshift_use_flannel` to `true` to enable *flannel* in place.

.. Optionally, you can specify the interface to use for inter-host communication
using the `flannel_interface` variable. Without this variable, the
{product-title} installation uses the default interface.
+
[NOTE]
====
Custom networking CIDR for pods and services using flannel will be supported in a future release.
link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1473858[*BZ#1473858*]
====

. After the {product-title} installation, add a set of iptables rules on every {product-title} node:
+
----
iptables -A DOCKER -p all -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE
----
+
To persist those changes in the *_/etc/sysconfig/iptables_* use the following
command on every node:
+
----
cp /etc/sysconfig/iptables{,.orig}
sh -c "tac /etc/sysconfig/iptables.orig | sed -e '0,/:DOCKER -/ s/:DOCKER -/:DOCKER ACCEPT/' | awk '"\!"p && /POSTROUTING/{print \"-A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE\"; p=1} 1' | tac > /etc/sysconfig/iptables"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `iptables-save` command saves all the current _in memory_ iptables rules.
However, because Docker, Kubernetes and {product-title} create a high number of iptables rules
(services, etc.) not designed to be persisted, saving these rules can become problematic.
====

To isolate container traffic from the rest of the {product-title} traffic, Red Hat
recommends creating an isolated tenant network and attaching all the nodes to it.
If you are using a different network interface (eth1), remember to configure the
interface to start at boot time through the
*_/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1_* file:

----
DEVICE=eth1
TYPE=Ethernet
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes
DEFTROUTE=no
PEERDNS=no
----
