== Overview
For production environments, a reference configuration implemented using
http://www.ansible.com[Ansible] playbooks is available as the _advanced
installation_ method for installing OpenShift hosts. Familiarity with Ansible is
assumed, however you can use this configuration as a reference to create your
own implementation using the configuration management tool of your choosing.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Alternatively, you can use the link:quick_install.html[quick installation]
method if you prefer an interactive installation experience.
endif::[]

== Prerequisites

Before installing OpenShift, you must first see the general
link:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.html[Prerequisites] topic to
prepare your hosts, which includes verifying system and environment requirements
per component type and properly installing and configuring Docker. It also
includes installing Ansible version 1.8.4 or later, as the advanced installation
method is based on Ansible playbooks and as such requires directly invoking
Ansible.

After following the instructions in the
link:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.html[Prerequisites] topic, you
can continue in this topic to link:#configuring-ansible[Configuring Ansible].

[[configuring-ansible]]

== Configuring Ansible

The *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file is Ansible's inventory file for the playbook to
use during the installation. The inventory file describes the configuration for
your OpenShift cluster. You must replace the default contents of the file with
your desired configuration.

The following sections describe commonly-used variables to set in your inventory
file during an advanced installation, followed by example inventory files you
can use as a starting point for your installation. The examples describe various
environment topographies, including link:#multiple-masters[using multiple
masters for high availability]. You can choose an example that matches your
requirements, modify it to match your own environment, and use it as your
inventory file when link:#running-the-advanced-installation[running the advanced
installation].

[[configuring-host-variables]]

*Configuring Host Variables*

To assign environment variables to hosts during the Ansible install, indicate
the desired variables in the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file after the host entry in
the *[masters]* or *[nodes]* sections. For example:

====
----
[masters]
ec2-52-6-179-239.compute-1.amazonaws.com openshift_public_hostname=ose3-master.public.example.com
----
====

The following table describes variables for use with the Ansible installer that
can be assigned to individual host entries:

.Host Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose

|`*openshift_hostname*`
|This variable overrides the internal cluster host name for the system. Use this
when the system's default IP address does not resolve to the system host name.

|`*openshift_public_hostname*`
|This variable overrides the system's public host name. Use this for cloud
installations, or for hosts on networks using a network address translation
(NAT).

|`*openshift_ip*`
|This variable overrides the cluster internal IP address for the system. Use
this when using an interface that is not configured with the default route.

|`*openshift_public_ip*`
|This variable overrides the system's public IP address. Use this for cloud
installations, or for hosts on networks using a network address translation
(NAT).
|===

[[configuring-cluster-variables]]

*Configuring Cluster Variables*

To assign environment variables during the Ansible install that apply more
globally to your OpenShift cluster overall, indicate the desired variables in
the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file on separate, single lines within the *[OSEv3:vars]*
section. For example:

====
----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'htpasswd_auth', 'login': 'true', 'challenge': 'true', 'kind': 'HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider', 'filename': '/etc/origin/htpasswd'}]

osm_default_subdomain=apps.test.example.com
----
====

The following table describes variables for use with the Ansible installer that
can be assigned cluster-wide:

.Cluster Variables
[options="header", cols="1,2"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose

|`*ansible_ssh_user*`
|This variable sets the SSH user for the installer to use and defaults to
*root*. This user should allow SSH-based authentication
link:prerequisites.html#ensuring-host-access[without requiring a password]. If
using SSH key-based authentication, then the key should be managed by an SSH
agent.

|`*ansible_sudo*`
|If `*ansible_ssh_user*` is not *root*, this variable must be set to *true* and
the user must be configured for passwordless *sudo*.

|`*openshift_master_cluster_hostname*`
|This variable overrides the host name for the cluster, which defaults to the
host name of the master.

|`*openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname*`
|This variable overrides the public host name for the cluster, which defaults to
the host name of the master.

|`*openshift_master_cluster_method*`
|Optional. This variable defines the HA method when deploying multiple masters.
Can be either `native` or `pacemaker`. See link:#multiple-masters[Multiple
Masters] for more information.

|`*openshift_master_cluster_password*`
.3+.^a|These variables are only required when using the `pacemaker` HA method.

For `*openshift_master_cluster_vip*`, the virtual IP (VIP) is assigned to the
active master automatically, so the IP must be available in the cluster network.
This IP should be in the same network and able to communicate with any other
master, *etcd*, and node hosts' IP. See link:#multiple-masters[Multiple Masters]
for more information.

|`*openshift_master_cluster_vip*`

|`*openshift_master_cluster_public_vip*`

|`*os_sdn_network_plugin_name*`
|This variable configures which
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.html[OpenShift SDN plug-in] to
use for the pod network, which defaults to *redhat/openshift-ovs-subnet* for the
standard SDN plug-in. Set the variable to *redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant* to
use the multitenant plug-in.

|`*openshift_master_identity_providers*`
|This variable overrides the
link:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.html[identity provider], which
defaults to
link:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Deny
All].

|`*openshift_master_session_name*`
.4+.^|These variables override defaults for
link:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#session-options[session
options] in the OAuth configuration. See link:#advanced-install-session-options[Configuring Session Options] for more information.

|`*openshift_master_session_max_seconds*`

|`*openshift_master_session_auth_secrets*`

|`*openshift_master_session_encryption_secrets*`

|`*openshift_master_portal_net*`
|This variable configures the subnet in which
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[services]
will be created within the
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.html[OpenShift SDN]. This
defaults to *172.30.0.0/16*, which covers *172.30.0.0* through *172.30.255.255*.
Setting this variable to override the default can be useful if the default
subnet interferes with other subnets in use in your environment.

|`*osm_default_subdomain*`
|This variable overrides the default subdomain to use for exposed
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[routes].

|`*osm_default_node_selector*`
|This variable overrides the node selector that projects will use by default
when placing pods.

|`*osm_cluster_network_cidr*`
| This variable overrides the
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.html#sdn-design-on-masters[SDN cluster network]
CIDR block. This is the network from which pod IPs are assigned. This network
block should be a private block and should not conflict with existing network
blocks in your infrastructure that pods may require access to. Defaults to
10.1.0.0/16 and *can not* be re-configured after deployment.

|`*osm_host_subnet_length*`
|This variable specifies the size of the per host subnet allocated for pod IPs
by link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.html#sdn-design-on-masters[OpenShift SDN].
Defaults to /8 which means that from the 10.1.0.0/16 cluster network a subnet of
size /24 is allocated to each host (i.e., 10.1.0.0/24, 10.1.1.0/24, 10.1.2.0/24, and so on).
This *can not* be re-configured after deployment.
|===

[[configuring-node-host-labels]]

*Configuring Node Host Labels*

You can assign
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#labels[labels] to
node hosts during the Ansible install by configuring the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*
file. Labels are useful for determining the placement of pods onto nodes using
the link:../../admin_guide/scheduler.html#configurable-predicates[scheduler].

To assign labels to a node host during an Ansible install, use the
`*openshift_node_labels*` variable with the desired labels added to the desired
node host entry in the *[nodes]* section. For example:

====
----
[nodes]
node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'east'}"
----
====

[[marking-masters-as-unschedulable-nodes]]

*Marking Masters as Unschedulable Nodes*

Any hosts you designate as masters during the installation process should also
be configured as nodes by adding them to the *[nodes]* section so that the
masters are configured as part of the
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/networking.html#openshift-sdn[OpenShift
SDN].

However, in order to ensure that your masters are not burdened with running
pods, you can make them
link:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html#marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[unschedulable]
by adding the `*openshift_scheduleable=false*` option any node that is also a
master. For example:

====
----
[nodes]
master.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region':'infra','zone':'default'}" openshift_schedulable=false
----
====

[[advanced-install-session-options]]

*Configuring Session Options*

link:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#session-options[Session
options] in the OAuth configuration are configurable in the inventory file. By
default, Ansible populates a `*sessionSecretsFile*` with generated
authentication and encryption secrets so that sessions generated by one master
can be decoded by the others. The default location is
*_/etc/origin/master/session-secrets.yaml_*, and this file will only be
re-created if deleted on all masters.

You can set the session name and maximum number of seconds with
`*openshift_master_session_name*` and `*openshift_master_session_max_seconds*`:

====
----
openshift_master_session_name=ssn
openshift_master_session_max_seconds=3600
----
====

If provided, `*openshift_master_session_auth_secrets*` and
`*openshift_master_encryption_secrets*` must be equal length.

For `*openshift_master_session_auth_secrets*`, used to authenticate sessions
using HMAC, it is recommended to use secrets with 32 or 64 bytes:

====
----
openshift_master_session_auth_secrets=['DONT+USE+THIS+SECRET+b4NV+pmZNSO']
----
====

For `*openshift_master_encryption_secrets*`, used to encrypt sessions, secrets
must be 16, 24, or 32 characters long, to select AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256:

====
----
openshift_master_session_encryption_secrets=['DONT+USE+THIS+SECRET+b4NV+pmZNSO']
----
====



[[single-master]]

You can configure an environment with a single master and multiple nodes, and
either a single embedded *etcd* or multiple external *etcd* hosts.

[[multiple-masters]]

=== Multiple Masters

You can configure an environment with multiple masters, multiple *etcd* hosts,
and multiple nodes. Configuring
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#high-availability-masters[multiple
masters for high availability] (HA) ensures that the cluster has no single point
of failure.

When configuring multiple masters, the advanced installation supports two high
availability (HA) methods:

.HA Master Methods
[cols="1,5"]
|===

|`native`
|Leverages the native HA master capabilities built into OpenShift and can be
combined with any load balancing solution. If a host is defined in the *[lb]*
section of the inventory file, Ansible installs and configures HAProxy
automatically as the load balancing solution. If no host is defined, it is
assumed you have pre-configured a load balancing solution of your choice to
balance the master API (port 8443) on all master hosts.

|`pacemaker`
|Configures Pacemaker as the load balancer for multiple masters.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Requires a High
Availability Add-on for Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, which is provided
separately from the OpenShift Enterprise subscription.
endif::[]
|===

[NOTE]
====
For more on these methods and the high availability master architecture, see
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[Kubernetes
Infrastructure].
====

To configure multiple masters, choose one of the above HA methods, and refer to
the relevant example section that follows.

[[multi-masters-using-native-ha]]

*Multiple Masters Using Native HA*

The following describes an example environment for three
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[masters],
one HAProxy load balancer, three
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[*etcd*]
hosts, and two

To use this example, modify the file to match your environment and
specifications, and save it as *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.

Note the following when using the `native` HA method:

- The advanced installation method does not currently support multiple HAProxy
load balancers in an active-passive setup. See the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Load_Balancer_Administration/ch-lvs-overview-VSA.html[Load
Balancer Administration documentation] for post-installation amendments, or
use the `pacemaker` method if you require this capability.
- In a HAProxy setup, controller manager servers run as standalone processes.
They elect their active leader with a lease stored in *etcd*. The lease
expires after 30 seconds by default. If a failure happens on an active
controller server, it will take up to this number of seconds to elect another
leader. The interval can be configured with the `*osm_controller_lease_ttl*`
variable.

To use this example, modify the file to match your environment and
specifications, and save it as *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.

Note the following when using this configuration:

- Installing multiple masters with Pacemaker requires that you
link:#configuring-fencing[configure a fencing device] after running the
installer.
- When specifying multiple masters, the installer handles creating and starting
the HA cluster. If during that process the `pcs status` command indicates that
an HA cluster already exists, the installer skips HA cluster configuration.

[[running-the-advanced-installation]]
== Running the Advanced Installation

After you have link:#configuring-ansible[configured Ansible] by defining an
inventory file in *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, you can run the advanced installation
using the following playbook:

----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# ansible-playbook ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
endif::[]
----

If for any reason the installation fails, before re-running the installer, see
link:#installer-known-issues[Known Issues] to check for any specific
instructions or workarounds.


[[configuring-fencing]]

== Configuring Fencing

If you installed OpenShift using a link:#multiple-masters[configuration for
multiple masters] with Pacemaker as a load balancer, you must configure a
fencing device. See
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/High_Availability_Add-On_Reference/ch-fencing-HAAR.html[Fencing:
Configuring STONITH] in the High Availability Add-on for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux documentation for instructions, then continue to
link:#verifying-the-installation[Verifying the Installation].

[[verifying-the-installation]]

== Verifying the Installation

After the installer completes, you can verify that the master is started and
nodes are registered and reporting in *Ready* status by running the following as
*root*:

====
----
# oc get nodes

NAME                      LABELS                                                                     STATUS

node2.example.com         kubernetes.io/hostname=node2.example.com,region=primary,zone=west          Ready
----
====

*Multiple etcd Hosts*

If you installed multiple *etcd* hosts:

. On a master host, verify the *etcd* cluster health, substituting for the FQDNs
of your *etcd* hosts in the following:
+
====
----
# etcdctl -C \
    https://etcd1.example.com:2379,https://etcd2.example.com:2379,https://etcd3.example.com:2379 \

*Multiple Masters Using Pacemaker*

If you installed multiple masters using Pacemaker as a load balancer:

. On a master host, determine which host is currently running as the active
master:
+
----
# pcs status
----

. After determining the active master, put the specified host into standby mode:
+
----
# pcs cluster standby <host1_name>
----

. Verify the master is now running on another host:
+
----
# pcs status
----

. After verifying the master is running on another node, re-enable the host on standby for normal operation by running:
+
----
# pcs cluster unstandby <host1_name>
----

Red Hat recommends that you also verify your installation by consulting the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html-single/High_Availability_Add-On_Reference/index.html[High
Availability Add-on for Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation].

*Multiple Masters Using HAProxy*

If you installed multiple masters using HAProxy as a load balancer, browse to
the following URL according to your *[lb]* section definition and check
HAProxy's status:

----
http://<lb_hostname>:9000
----

You can verify your installation by consulting the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Load_Balancer_Administration/ch-haproxy-setup-VSA.html[HAProxy
Configuration documentation].

== Known Issues

The following are known issues for specified installation configurations.

*Multiple Masters*

- On failover, it is possible for the controller manager to overcorrect, which
causes the system to run more pods than what was intended. However, this is a
transient event and the system does correct itself over time. See
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/issues/10030 for details.

- On failure of the Ansible installer, you must start from a clean operating
system installation. If you are using virtual machines, start from a fresh
image. If you are use bare metal machines:
+
. Run the following on a master host with Pacemaker:
+
----
# pcs cluster destroy --all
----
+
. Then, run the following on all node hosts:
+
----
# yum -y remove openshift openshift-* etcd docker

# rm -rf /etc/origin /var/lib/openshift /etc/etcd \
    /var/lib/etcd /etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift* /etc/sysconfig/docker* \
    /root/.kube/config /etc/ansible/facts.d /usr/share/openshift

== Uninstalling OpenShift

You can uninstall OpenShift by running the following Ansible playbook:

----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# ansible-playbook ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
----

== What's Next?

Now that you have a working OpenShift instance, you can:

- link:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.html[Configure
authentication]; by default, authentication is set to
link:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Deny
All].
- Deploy an link:docker_registry.html[integrated Docker registry].
- Deploy a link:deploy_router.html[router].
- link:first_steps.html[Populate your OpenShift installation] with a useful set
of Red Hat-provided image streams and templates.
