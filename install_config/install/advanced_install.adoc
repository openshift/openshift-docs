== Overview
A reference configuration implemented using
link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/[Ansible] playbooks is available as the _advanced
installation_ method for installing a {product-title} cluster. Familiarity with Ansible is
assumed, however you can use this configuration as a reference to create your
own implementation using the configuration management tool of your choosing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While RHEL Atomic Host is supported for running containerized {product-title}
services, the advanced installation method utilizes Ansible, which is not
available in RHEL Atomic Host, and must therefore be run from
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
a RHEL 7 system.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
a supported version of Fedora, CentOS, or RHEL.
endif::[]
The host initiating the installation does not need to be intended for inclusion
in the {product-title} cluster, but it can be.

Alternatively, a
xref:running-the-advanced-installation-system-container[containerized version of the installer] is available as a system container, which is currently a
Technology Preview feature.
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Alternatively, you can use the xref:quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick installation]
method if you prefer an interactive installation experience.
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
To install {product-title} as a stand-alone registry, see
xref:../../install_config/install/stand_alone_registry.adoc#install-config-installing-stand-alone-registry[Installing a Stand-alone Registry].
====

[[advanced-before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

Before installing {product-title}, you must first see the
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[Prerequisites]
and
xref:../../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#install-config-install-host-preparation[Host
Preparation] topics to prepare your hosts. This includes verifying system and
environment requirements per component type and properly installing and
configuring Docker. It also includes installing Ansible version 2.2.0 or later,
as the advanced installation method is based on Ansible playbooks and as such
requires directly invoking Ansible.

If you are interested in installing {product-title} using the containerized method
(optional for RHEL but required for RHEL Atomic Host), see
xref:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[Installing on Containerized Hosts] to ensure that you understand the differences between these
methods, then return to this topic to continue.

For large-scale installs, including suggestions for optimizing install time,
see the
xref:../../scaling_performance/install_practices.adoc#scaling-performance-install-best-practices[Scaling and Performance Guide].

After following the instructions in the
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[Prerequisites] topic and
deciding between the RPM and containerized methods, you can continue in this
topic to xref:configuring-ansible[Configuring Ansible Inventory Files].

[[configuring-ansible]]
== Configuring Ansible Inventory Files

The *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file is Ansible's inventory file for the playbook
used to install {product-title}. The inventory file describes the configuration
for your {product-title} cluster. You must replace the default contents of the
file with your desired configuration.

The following sections describe commonly-used variables to set in your inventory
file during an advanced installation, followed by
xref:adv-install-example-inventory-files[example inventory files] you can use as
a starting point for your installation.

Many of the Ansible variables described are optional. Accepting the default
values should suffice for development environments, but for production
environments it is recommended you read through and become familiar with the
various options available.

The example inventories describe various environment topographies, including
xref:multiple-masters[using multiple masters for high availability]. You can
choose an example that matches your requirements, modify it to match your own
environment, and use it as your inventory file when
xref:running-the-advanced-installation[running the advanced installation].

[[advanced-install-image-version-policy]]
=== Image Version Policy

Images require a version number policy in order to maintain updates. See
the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#architecture-images-tag-policy[Image
Version Tag Policy] section in the Architecture Guide for more information.

[[configuring-cluster-variables]]
=== Configuring Cluster Variables

To assign environment variables during the Ansible install that apply more
globally to your {product-title} cluster overall, indicate the desired variables in
the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file on separate, single lines within the *[OSEv3:vars]*
section. For example:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'htpasswd_auth',
'login': 'true', 'challenge': 'true',
'kind': 'HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider',
'filename': '/etc/origin/master/htpasswd'}]

openshift_master_default_subdomain=apps.test.example.com
----

The following table describes variables for use with the Ansible installer that
can be assigned cluster-wide:

[[cluster-variables-table]]
.Cluster Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose

|`ansible_ssh_user`
|This variable sets the SSH user for the installer to use and defaults to
`root`. This user should allow SSH-based authentication
xref:host_preparation.adoc#ensuring-host-access[without requiring a password]. If
using SSH key-based authentication, then the key should be managed by an SSH
agent.

|`ansible_become`
|If `ansible_ssh_user` is not `root`, this variable must be set to `true` and
the user must be configured for passwordless `sudo`.

|`debug_level`
a|This variable sets which INFO messages are logged to the `systemd-journald.service`. Set one of the following:

* `0` to log errors and warnings only
* `2` to log normal information (This is the default level.)
* `4` to log debugging-level information
* `6` to log API-level debugging information (request / response)
* `8` to log body-level API debugging information

For more information on debug log levels, see xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-logging-levels[Configuring Logging Levels].

|`containerized`
|If set to `true`, containerized {product-title} services are run on all target master
and node hosts in the cluster instead of installed using RPM packages. If set to
`false` or unset, the default RPM method is used. RHEL Atomic Host requires the
containerized method, and is automatically selected for you based on the
detection of the *_/run/ostree-booted_* file. See
xref:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[Installing on
Containerized Hosts] for more details.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Containerized installations are supported starting in {product-title} 3.1.1.
endif::[]

|`openshift_master_cluster_hostname`
|This variable overrides the host name for the cluster, which defaults to the
host name of the master.

|`openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname`
|This variable overrides the public host name for the cluster, which defaults to
the host name of the master.

|`openshift_master_cluster_method`

Supports the `native` method. See xref:multiple-masters[Multiple Masters] for
more information.

|`openshift_rolling_restart_mode`
|This variable enables rolling restarts of HA masters (i.e., masters are taken
down one at a time) when
xref:../upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#running-the-upgrade-playbook-directly[running
the upgrade playbook directly]. It defaults to `services`, which allows rolling
restarts of services on the masters. It can instead be set to `system`, which
enables rolling, full system restarts and also works for single master clusters.

|`os_sdn_network_plugin_name`
|This variable configures which
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-sdn[OpenShift SDN plug-in] to
use for the pod network, which defaults to `redhat/openshift-ovs-subnet` for the
standard SDN plug-in. Set the variable to `redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant` to
use the multitenant plug-in.

|`openshift_master_identity_providers`
|This variable overrides the
xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[identity provider], which
defaults to
xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Deny
All].

|`openshift_master_named_certificates`
.2+.^|These variables are used to configure xref:../../install_config/certificate_customization.adoc#install-config-certificate-customization[custom certificates] which are deployed as part of the installation. See xref:advanced-install-custom-certificates[Configuring Custom Certificates] for more information.
|`openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates`

|Validity of the auto-generated CA certificate in days. Defaults to `1825` (5 years).

|`openshift_node_cert_expire_days`
|Validity of the auto-generated node certificate in days. Defaults to `730` (2 years).

|`openshift_master_cert_expire_days`
|Validity of the auto-generated master certificate in days. Defaults to `730` (2 years).

|`etcd_ca_default_days`
|Validity of the auto-generated external etcd certificates in days. Controls
validity for etcd CA, peer, server and client certificates. Defaults to `1825`
(5 years).

|`os_firewall_use_firewalld`
|Set to `true` to use firewalld instead of the default iptables. Not available on RHEL Atomic Host. See the xref:advanced-install-configuring-firewalls[Configuring the Firewall] section for more information.

|`openshift_master_session_name`
.4+.^|These variables override defaults for
xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#session-options[session
options] in the OAuth configuration. See xref:advanced-install-session-options[Configuring Session Options] for more information.

|`openshift_master_session_max_seconds`

|`openshift_master_session_auth_secrets`

|`openshift_master_session_encryption_secrets`

|`openshift_portal_net`
|This variable configures the subnet in which
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[services]
will be created within the
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-sdn[{product-title}
SDN]. This network block should be private and must not conflict with any
existing network blocks in your infrastructure to which pods, nodes, or the
master may require access to, or the installation will fail. Defaults to
`172.30.0.0/16`, and cannot be re-configured after deployment. If changing from the default, avoid `172.17.0.0/16`, which the *docker0* network bridge uses by default, or modify the *docker0* network.

|`openshift_master_default_subdomain`
|This variable overrides the default subdomain to use for exposed
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[routes].

|`openshift_master_image_policy_config`
|Sets `imagePolicyConfig` in the master configuration. See xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-config-image-config[Image Configuration] for details.

|`openshift_node_proxy_mode`
|This variable specifies the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#service-proxy-mode[service
proxy mode] to use: either `iptables` for the default, pure-`iptables`
implementation, or `userspace` for the user space proxy.

|`osm_default_node_selector`
|This variable overrides the node selector that projects will use by default
when placing pods.

|`osm_cluster_network_cidr`
| This variable overrides the
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.adoc#sdn-design-on-masters[SDN
cluster network] CIDR block. This is the network from which pod IPs are
assigned. This network block should be a private block and must not conflict
with existing network blocks in your infrastructure to which pods, nodes, or the
master may require access. Defaults to `10.128.0.0/14` and cannot be arbitrarily
re-configured after deployment, although certain changes to it can be made in
the xref:../configuring_sdn.adoc#configuring-the-pod-network-on-masters[SDN
master configuration].

|`osm_host_subnet_length`
|This variable specifies the size of the per host subnet allocated for pod IPs
by
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.adoc#sdn-design-on-masters[{product-title}
SDN]. Defaults to `9` which means that a subnet of size /23 is allocated to each
host; for example, given the default 10.128.0.0/14 cluster network, this will
allocate 10.128.0.0/23, 10.128.2.0/23, 10.128.4.0/23, and so on. This cannot be
re-configured after deployment.

|`openshift_use_flannel`
|This variable enables *flannel* as an alternative networking layer instead of
the default SDN. If enabling *flannel*, disable the default SDN with the
`openshift_use_openshift_sdn` variable. For more information, see xref:../configuring_sdn.adoc#using-flannel[Using Flannel].

|`openshift_docker_additional_registries`
|{product-title} adds the specified additional registry or registries to the
*docker* configuration.

|`openshift_docker_insecure_registries`
|{product-title} adds the specified additional insecure registry or registries
to the *docker* configuration.

|`openshift_docker_blocked_registries`
|{product-title} adds the specified blocked registry or registries to the *docker*
configuration.

|`openshift_hosted_metrics_public_url`
|This variable sets the host name for integration with the metrics console by
overriding `metricsPublicURL` in the master configuration for cluster metrics.
If you alter this variable, ensure the host name is accessible via your router.
See xref:advanced-install-cluster-metrics[Configuring Cluster Metrics] for
details.

|`openshift_template_service_broker_namespaces`
|This variable enables the template service broker by specifying one of more
namespaces whose templates will be served by the broker.
|===

[[advanced-install-deployment-types]]
=== Configuring Deployment Type

Various defaults used throughout the playbooks and roles used by the installer
are based on the deployment type configuration (usually defined in an Ansible
inventory file).

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Ensure the `deployment_type` parameter in your inventory file's `[OSEv3:vars]`
section is set to `openshift-enterprise` to install the {product-title} variant:

----
[OSEv3:vars]
deployment_type=openshift-enterprise
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Ensure the `deployment_type` parameter in your inventory file's `[OSEv3:vars]`
section is set to `origin` to install the {product-title} variant:

----
[OSEv3:vars]
openshift_deployment_type=origin
----
endif::[]


[[configuring-host-variables]]
=== Configuring Host Variables

To assign environment variables to hosts during the Ansible installation, indicate
the desired variables in the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file after the host entry in
the *[masters]* or *[nodes]* sections. For example:

----
[masters]
ec2-52-6-179-239.compute-1.amazonaws.com openshift_public_hostname=ose3-master.public.example.com
----

The following table describes variables for use with the Ansible installer that
can be assigned to individual host entries:

[[advanced-host-variables]]
.Host Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose

|`openshift_hostname`
|This variable overrides the internal cluster host name for the system. Use this
when the system's default IP address does not resolve to the system host name.

|`openshift_public_hostname`
|This variable overrides the system's public host name. Use this for cloud
installations, or for hosts on networks using a network address translation
(NAT).

|`openshift_ip`
|This variable overrides the cluster internal IP address for the system. Use
this when using an interface that is not configured with the default route.

|`openshift_public_ip`
|This variable overrides the system's public IP address. Use this for cloud
installations, or for hosts on networks using a network address translation
(NAT).

|`containerized`
|If set to *true*, containerized {product-title} services are run on the target master and
node hosts instead of installed using RPM packages. If set to *false* or unset,
the default RPM method is used. RHEL Atomic Host requires the containerized
method, and is automatically selected for you based on the detection of the
*_/run/ostree-booted_* file. See
xref:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[Installing on Containerized Hosts] for more details.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Containerized installations are supported starting in {product-title} 3.1.1.
endif::[]

|`openshift_node_labels`
|This variable adds labels to nodes during installation. See
xref:configuring-node-host-labels[Configuring Node Host Labels] for more
details.

|`openshift_node_kubelet_args`
|This variable is used to configure `kubeletArguments` on nodes, such as
arguments used in xref:../../admin_guide/garbage_collection.adoc#admin-guide-garbage-collection[container and
image garbage collection], and to
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#configuring-node-resources[specify
resources per node]. `kubeletArguments` are key value pairs that are passed
directly to the Kubelet that match the
http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/docs/admin/kubelet.html[Kubelet's command line
arguments]. `kubeletArguments` are not migrated or validated and may become
invalid if used. These values override other settings in node configuration
which may cause invalid configurations. Example usage:
*{'image-gc-high-threshold': ['90'],'image-gc-low-threshold': ['80']}*.

|`openshift_hosted_router_selector`
|Default node selector for automatically deploying router pods. See
xref:configuring-node-host-labels[Configuring Node Host Labels] for details.

|`openshift_registry_selector`
|Default node selector for automatically deploying registry pods. See
xref:configuring-node-host-labels[Configuring Node Host Labels] for details.

|`openshift_docker_options`
|This variable configures additional `docker` options within
*_/etc/sysconfig/docker_*, such as options used in
xref:../../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#managing-docker-container-logs[Managing Container Logs]. Example usage: *"--log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size=1M
--log-opt max-file=3"*. Do not use when
xref:advanced-install-docker-system-container[running `docker` as a system container].

|`openshift_schedulable`
|This variable configures whether the host is marked as a schedulable node,
meaning that it is available for placement of new pods. See
xref:marking-masters-as-unschedulable-nodes[Configuring Schedulability on Masters].
|===

[[configuring-cluster-pre-install-checks]]
=== Configuring Cluster Pre-install Checks

Pre-install checks are a set of diagnostic tasks that run as part of the
*openshift_health_checker* Ansible role. They run prior to an Ansible
installation of {product-title}, ensure that required inventory values are set,
and identify potential issues on a host that can prevent or interfere with a
successful installation.

The following table describes available pre-install checks that will run before
every Ansible installation of {product-title}:

[[configuring-cluster-pre-install-checks-pre-install-checks]]
.Pre-install Checks
[options="header"]
|===

|Check Name |Purpose

|`memory_availability`
|This check ensures that a host has the recommended amount of memory for the
specific deployment of {product-title}. Default values have been derived from
the
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.html#system-requirements[latest
installation documentation]. A user-defined value for minimum memory
requirements may be set by setting the `openshift_check_min_host_memory_gb`
cluster variable in your inventory file.

|`disk_availability`
|This check only runs on etcd, master, and node hosts. It ensures that the mount
path for an {product-title} installation has sufficient disk space remaining.
Recommended disk values are taken from the
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.html#system-requirements[latest
installation documentation]. A user-defined value for minimum disk space
requirements may be set by setting `openshift_check_min_host_disk_gb` cluster
variable in your inventory file.

|`docker_storage`
|Only runs on hosts that depend on the *docker* daemon (nodes and containerized
installations). Checks that *docker*'s total usage does not exceed a
user-defined limit. If no user-defined limit is set, *docker*'s maximum usage
threshold defaults to 90% of the total size available. The threshold limit for
total percent usage can be set with a variable in your inventory file:
`max_thinpool_data_usage_percent=90`. A user-defined limit for maximum thinpool
usage may be set by setting the `max_thinpool_data_usage_percent` cluster
variable in your inventory file.

|`docker_storage_driver`
|Ensures that the *docker* daemon is using a storage driver supported by
{product-title}. If the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver[`devicemapper`]
storage driver is being used, the check additionally ensures that a loopback
device is not being used.

|`docker_image_availability`
|Attempts to ensure that images required by an {product-title} installation are
available either locally or in at least one of the configured container image
registries on the host machine.

|`package_version`
|Runs on `yum`-based systems determining if multiple releases of a required
{product-title} package are available. Having multiple releases of a package
available during an `enterprise` installation of OpenShift suggests that there
are multiple `yum` repositories enabled for different releases, which may lead
to installation problems. This check is skipped if the `openshift_release`
variable is not defined in the inventory file.

|`package_availability`
|Runs prior to non-containerized installations of {product-title}. Ensures that
RPM packages required for the current installation are available.

|`package_update`
|Checks whether a `yum` update or package installation will succeed, without
actually performing it or running `yum` on the host.
|===

To disable specific pre-install checks, include the variable
`openshift_disable_check` with a comma-delimited list of check names in your
inventory file. For example:

----
openshift_disable_check=memory_availability,disk_availability
----

A similar set of checks meant to run for diagnostic on existing clusters can be
found in
xref:../../admin_guide/diagnostics_tool.adoc#additional-cluster-health-checks[Additional Diagnostic Checks via Ansible]. Another set of checks for checking certificate
expiration can be found in
xref:../../install_config/redeploying_certificates.adoc#install-config-redeploying-certificates[Redeploying Certificates].

features in {product-title} 3.6. They must not be used in production and they
are not supported for upgrades to {product-title} 3.6. During this phase, they
are only meant for use with new cluster installations in non-production
environments.
====
// end::syscontainers_techpreview[]

System containers provide a way to containerize services that need to run before
the `docker` daemon is running. They are Docker-formatted containers that use:

- link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.2/html/content_management_guide/managing_ostree_content[OSTree] for storage,
- link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#running_containers_with_runc[runC] for the runtime,
- link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#using_systemd_with_containers[systemd] for service management, and
- link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#using_skopeo_to_work_with_container_registries[skopeo] for searching.

System containers are therefore stored and run outside of the traditional
`docker` service. For more details on system container technology, see
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/managing_containers/running_system_containers[Running System Containers] in the _Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host: Managing Containers_ documentation.

You can configure your {product-title} installation to run certain components as
system containers instead of their RPM or standard containerized methods.
Currently, the `docker` and etcd components can be run as system containers in
{product-title}.

[WARNING]
====
System containers are currently OS-specific because they require specific
versions of `atomic` and systemd. For example, different system containers are
created for RHEL, Fedora, or CentOS. Ensure that the system containers you are
using match the OS of the host they will run on.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
{product-title} only supports RHEL and RHEL Atomic as the host OS, so by default
system containers built for RHEL are used.
endif::[]
====

[[advanced-install-docker-system-container]]
==== Running Docker as a System Container

include::install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc[tag=syscontainers_techpreview]

The traditional method for using `docker` in an {product-title} cluster is an
xref:../../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#installing-docker[RPM package installation]. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) systems, it must be
specifically installed; for RHEL Atomic Host systems, it is provided by default.

However, you can configure your {product-title} installation to alternatively
run `docker` on node hosts as a system container. When using the system
container method, the `container-engine` container image and systemd service is
used on the host instead of the `docker` package and service.

To run `docker` as a system container:

. Because the default storage back end for Docker on RHEL 7 is a thin pool on
loopback devices, for any RHEL systems you must still configure a thin pool
logical volume for `docker` to use before running the {product-title}
installation. You can skip these steps for any RHEL Atomic Host systems.
+
For any RHEL systems, perform the steps described in the following sections:
+
--
... xref:../../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#installing-docker[Installing Docker]

... xref:../../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#configuring-docker-storage[Configuring Docker Storage]
--
After completing the storage configuration steps, you can leave the RPM
installed.

. Set the following cluster variable to `True` in your inventory file in the
`[OSEv3:vars]` section:
+
----
openshift_docker_use_system_container=True
----

When using the system container method, the following inventory variables for
`docker` are ignored:

- `docker_version`
- `docker_upgrade`

Further, the following inventory variable must not be used:

- `openshift_docker_options`

You can also force `docker` in the system container to use a specific container
registry and repository when pulling the `container-engine` image instead of
from the default `registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/`. To do so, set the
following cluster variable in your inventory file in the `[OSEv3:vars]` section:

----
openshift_docker_systemcontainer_image_registry_override="registry.example.com/myrepo/"
----

[[advanced-install-etcd-system-container]]
==== Running etcd as a System Container

include::install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc[tag=syscontainers_techpreview]

When using the RPM-based installation method for {product-title}, etcd is
installed using RPM packages on any RHEL systems. When using the containerized
installation method, the `rhel7/etcd` image is used instead for RHEL or RHEL
Atomic Hosts.

However, you can configure your {product-title} installation to alternatively
run `etcd` as a system container. Whereas the standard containerized method uses
a systemd service named `etcd_container`, the system container method uses the
service name `etcd`, same as the RPM-based method. The data directory for etcd
using this method is *_/var/lib/etcd/etcd.etcd/etcd.etcd/member_*.

To run etcd as a system container, set the following cluster variable in your
inventory file in the `[OSEv3:vars]` section:

----
openshift_use_etcd_system_container=True
----

[[advanced-install-configuring-registry-location]]
=== Configuring a Registry Location

If you are using an image registry other than the default at
`registry.access.redhat.com`, specify the desired registry within the
*_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file.

. In your inventory file, add `glusterfs` in the `[OSEv3:children]` section to
enable the `[glusterfs]` group:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes
glusterfs
----

. (Optional) Include any of the following role variables in the `[OSEv3:vars]`
section you wish to change:
+
----
[OSEv3:vars]
openshift_storage_glusterfs_namespace=glusterfs <1>
openshift_storage_glusterfs_name=storage <2>
----
<1> The project (namespace) to host the storage pods. Defaults to `glusterfs`.
<2> A name to identify the GlusterFS cluster, which will be used in resource names.
Defaults to `storage`.

. Add a `[glusterfs]` section with entries for each storage node that will host
the GlusterFS storage and include tnclude the `glusterfs_ip` and
`glusterfs_devices` parameters in the form:
+
----
<hostname_or_ip> glusterfs_ip=<ip_address> glusterfs_devices='[ "</path/to/device1/>", "</path/to/device2>", ... ]'
----
+
For example:

192.168.10.13 glusterfs_ip=192.168.10.13 glusterfs_devices='[ "/dev/xvdc", "/dev/xvdd" ]'
----
+
Set `glusterfs_devices` to a list of raw block devices that will be completely
managed as part of a GlusterFS cluster. There must be at least one device
listed. Each device must be bare, with no partitions or LVM PVs. Set
`glusterfs_ip` to the IP address that will be used by pods to communicate with
the GlusterFS node.

. Add the hosts listed under `[glusterfs]` to the `[nodes]` group as well:

[[advanced-install-configuring-openshift-container-registry]]
=== Configuring the OpenShift Container Registry

Additional configuration options are available at installation time for the
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[OpenShift Container Registry].

If no registry storage options are used, the default {product-title} registry is
ephermal and all data will be lost if the pod no longer exists. {product-title}
also supports a single node NFS-backed registry, but this option lacks
redundancy and reliability compared with the GlusterFS-backed option.

[[advanced-install-containerized-glusterfs-backed-registry]]
==== Configuring a Containerized GlusterFS-Backed Registry

Similar to
xref:advanced-install-containerized-glusterfs-persistent-storage[configuring containerized GlusterFS for persistent storage], GlusterFS storage can be
configured and deployed for an OpenShift Container Registry during the initial
installation of the cluster to offer redundant and more reliable storage for the
registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
See
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#prereq-containerized-glusterfs-considerations[Containerized
GlusterFS Considerations] for specific host preparations and prerequisites.
====

Configuration of storage for an OpenShift Container Registry is very similar to
configuration for GlusterFS persistent storage in that it can be either
containerized or non-containerized. For this containerized method, the following
exceptions and additions apply:

. In your inventory file, add `glusterfs_registry` in the `[OSEv3:children]` section
to enable the `[glusterfs_registry]` group:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes
glusterfs_registry
----

. Add the following role variable in the `[OSEv3:vars]` section:
+
----
[OSEv3:vars]
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_kind=glusterfs <1>
----
<1> Enables the GlusterFS-backed registry if the `glusterfs_registry` group name and
the `[glusterfs_registry]` group exist.

. It is recommended to have at least three registry pods, so set the following
role variable in the `[OSEv3:vars]` section:
+
----
openshift_hosted_registry_replicas=3
----

. The installer will deploy the OpenShift Container Registry pods and associated
routers on nodes containing the `region=infra` label. Add this label on at least
one node entry in the `[nodes]` section, otherwise the registry deployment will
fail. For example:
+
----
[nodes]
192.168.10.14 openshift_schedulable=True openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra'}"
----

. Add a `[glusterfs_registry]` section with entries for each storage node that
will host the GlusterFS-backed registry and include the `glusterfs_ip` and
`glusterfs_devices` parameters in the form:
+
----
<hostname_or_ip> glusterfs_ip=<ip_address> glusterfs_devices='[ "</path/to/device1/>", "</path/to/device2>", ... ]'
----
+
For example:
+
----
[glusterfs_registry] 
192.168.10.14 glusterfs_ip=192.168.10.14 glusterfs_devices='[ "/dev/xvdc", "/dev/xvdd" ]'
192.168.10.15 glusterfs_ip=192.168.10.15 glusterfs_devices='[ "/dev/xvdc", "/dev/xvdd" ]'
192.168.10.16 glusterfs_ip=192.168.10.16 glusterfs_devices='[ "/dev/xvdc", "/dev/xvdd" ]'
----
+
Set `glusterfs_devices` to a list of raw block devices that will be completely
managed as part of a GlusterFS cluster. There must be at least one device
listed. Each device must be bare, with no partitions or LVM PVs. Set
`glusterfs_ip` to the IP address that will be used by pods to communicate with
the GlusterFS node.

. Add the hosts listed under `[glusterfs_registry]` to the `[nodes]` group as well:
+
----
[nodes] 
192.168.10.14
192.168.10.15

status of the GlusterFS clusters.

[[advanced-install-configuring-global-proxy]]
=== Configuring Global Proxy Options

If your hosts require use of a HTTP or HTTPS proxy in order to connect to
external hosts, there are many components that must be configured to use the
proxy, including masters, Docker, and builds. Node services only connect to the
master API requiring no external access and therefore do not need to be
configured to use a proxy.

In order to simplify this configuration, the following Ansible variables can be
specified at a cluster or host level to apply these settings uniformly across
your environment.

[NOTE]
====
See xref:../../install_config/build_defaults_overrides.adoc#install-config-build-defaults-overrides[Configuring
Global Build Defaults and Overrides] for more information on how the proxy
environment is defined for builds.
====

.Cluster Proxy Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose

|`*openshift_http_proxy*`
|This variable specifies the `*HTTP_PROXY*` environment variable for masters and
the Docker daemon.

|`*openshift_https_proxy*`
|This variable specifices the `*HTTPS_PROXY*` environment variable for masters
and the Docker daemon.

|`*openshift_no_proxy*`
|This variable is used to set the `*NO_PROXY*` environment variable for masters
and the Docker daemon. This value should be set to a comma separated list of
host names or wildcard host names that should not use the defined proxy. This
list will be augmented with the list of all defined {product-title} host names
by default.

|`*openshift_generate_no_proxy_hosts*`
|This boolean variable specifies whether or not the names of all defined
OpenShift hosts and `pass:[*.cluster.local]` should be automatically appended to
the `*NO_PROXY*` list. Defaults to *true*; set it to *false* to override this
option.

|`*openshift_builddefaults_http_proxy*`
|This variable defines the `*HTTP_PROXY*` environment variable inserted into
builds using the `*BuildDefaults*` admission controller. If
`*openshift_http_proxy*` is set, this variable will inherit that value; you only
need to set this if you want your builds to use a different value.

|`*openshift_builddefaults_https_proxy*`
|This variable defines the `*HTTPS_PROXY*` environment variable inserted into
builds using the `*BuildDefaults*` admission controller. If
`*openshift_https_proxy*` is set, this variable will inherit that value; you
only need to set this if you want your builds to use a different value.

|`*openshift_builddefaults_no_proxy*`
|This variable defines the `*NO_PROXY*` environment variable inserted into
builds using the `*BuildDefaults*` admission controller. If
`*openshift_no_proxy*` is set, this variable will inherit that value; you only
need to set this if you want your builds to use a different value.

|`*openshift_builddefaults_git_http_proxy*`
|This variable defines the HTTP proxy used by `git clone` operations during a
build, defined using the `*BuildDefaults*` admission controller. If
`*openshift_builddefaults_http_proxy*` is set, this variable will inherit that
value; you only need to set this if you want your `git clone` operations to use
a different value.

|`*openshift_builddefaults_git_https_proxy*`
|This variable defines the HTTPS proxy used by `git clone` operations during a
build, defined using the `*BuildDefaults*` admission controller. If
`*openshift_builddefaults_https_proxy*` is set, this variable will inherit that
value; you only need to set this if you want your `git clone` operations to use
a different value.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[[advanced-install-configuring-firewalls]]
=== Configuring the Firewall

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are changing the default firewall, ensure that each host in your cluster
is using the same firewall type to prevent inconsistencies.
====

[NOTE]
====
While iptables is the default firewall, firewalld is recommended for new
installations.
====

{product-title} uses iptables as the default firewall, but you can configure
your cluster to use firewalld during the install process.

Because iptables is the default firewall, {product-title} is designed to have it
configured automatically. However, iptables rules can break {product-title} if
not configured correctly. The advantages of firewalld include allowing multiple
objects to safely share the firewall rules.

To use firewalld as the firewall for an {product-title} installation, add the
`os_firewall_use_firewalld` variable to the list of configuration variables in
the Ansible host file at install:

----
[OSEv3:vars]
os_firewall_use_firewalld=True
----
endif::[]

[[marking-masters-as-unschedulable-nodes]]
=== Configuring Schedulability on Masters

Any hosts you designate as masters during the installation process should also
be configured as nodes so that the masters are configured as part of the
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/networking.adoc#openshift-sdn[OpenShift SDN]. You must do so by adding entries for these hosts to the `[nodes]` section:

----
[nodes]
master.example.com
----

In order to ensure that your masters are not burdened with running pods, they
are automatically marked unschedulable by default by the installer, meaning that
new pods cannot be placed on the hosts. This is the same as setting the
`openshift_schedulable=false` host variable.

You can manually set a master host to schedulable during installation using the
`openshift_schedulable=true` host variable, though this is not recommended in
production environments:

----
[nodes]
master.example.com openshift_schedulable=true
----

If you want to change the schedulability of a host post-installation, see
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[Marking Nodes as Unschedulable or Schedulable].

[[configuring-node-host-labels]]
=== Configuring Node Host Labels

You can assign
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels] to
node hosts during the Ansible install by configuring the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*
file. Labels are useful for determining the placement of pods onto nodes using
the xref:../../admin_guide/scheduling/scheduler.adoc#configurable-predicates[scheduler].
Other than `region=infra` (discussed in
xref:configuring-dedicated-infrastructure-nodes[Configuring Dedicated Infrastructure Nodes]), the actual label names and values are arbitrary and can
be assigned however you see fit per your cluster's requirements.

To assign labels to a node host during an Ansible install, use the
`openshift_node_labels` variable with the desired labels added to the desired
node host entry in the `[nodes]` section. In the following example, labels are
set for a region called `primary` and a zone called `east`:

----
[nodes]
node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'east'}"
----

[[configuring-dedicated-infrastructure-nodes]]
==== Configuring Dedicated Infrastructure Nodes

The `openshift_router_selector` and `openshift_registry_selector` Ansible
settings determine the label selectors used when placing registry and router
pods. They are set to `region=infra` by default:

----
# default selectors for router and registry services
# openshift_router_selector='region=infra'
# openshift_registry_selector='region=infra'
----

The registry and router are only able to run on node hosts with the `region=infra` label. 
Ensure that at least one node host in your {product-title} environment has the `region=infra` label. For example:

----
[nodes]
infra-node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra','zone': 'default'}"
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If there is not a node in the [nodes] section that matches the selector settings,
the default router and registry will be deployed as failed with `Pending` status.
====

It is recommended for production environments that you maintain dedicated
infrastructure nodes where the registry and router pods can run separately from
pods used for user applications.

If you do not intend to use {product-title} to manage the registry and router, 
configure the following Ansible settings:

----
openshift_hosted_manage_registry=false 
openshift_hosted_manage_router=false
----

If you are using an image registry other than the default `registry.access.redhat.com`,
you need to xref:advanced-install-configuring-registry-location[specify the desired registry]
in the  *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file.

As described in xref:marking-masters-as-unschedulable-nodes[Configuring
Schedulability on Masters], master hosts are marked unschedulable by default. If
you label a master host with `region=infra` and have no other dedicated
infrastructure nodes, you must also explicitly mark these master hosts as
schedulable. Otherwise, the registry and router pods cannot be placed anywhere:

----
[nodes]
master.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra','zone': 'default'}" openshift_schedulable=true
----

[[advanced-install-session-options]]
=== Configuring Session Options

xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#session-options[Session
options] in the OAuth configuration are configurable in the inventory file. By
default, Ansible populates a `*sessionSecretsFile*` with generated
authentication and encryption secrets so that sessions generated by one master
can be decoded by the others. The default location is
*_/etc/origin/master/session-secrets.yaml_*, and this file will only be
re-created if deleted on all masters.

You can set the session name and maximum number of seconds with
`*openshift_master_session_name*` and `*openshift_master_session_max_seconds*`:

----
openshift_master_session_name=ssn
openshift_master_session_max_seconds=3600
----

If provided, `*openshift_master_session_auth_secrets*` and
`*openshift_master_encryption_secrets*` must be equal length.

For `*openshift_master_session_auth_secrets*`, used to authenticate sessions
using HMAC, it is recommended to use secrets with 32 or 64 bytes:

----
openshift_master_session_auth_secrets=['DONT+USE+THIS+SECRET+b4NV+pmZNSO']
----

For `*openshift_master_encryption_secrets*`, used to encrypt sessions, secrets
must be 16, 24, or 32 characters long, to select AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256:

----
openshift_master_session_encryption_secrets=['DONT+USE+THIS+SECRET+b4NV+pmZNSO']
----

[[advanced-install-custom-certificates]]
=== Configuring Custom Certificates

xref:../../install_config/certificate_customization.adoc#install-config-certificate-customization[Custom serving
certificates] for the public host names of the {product-title} API and
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console]
can be deployed during an advanced installation and are configurable in the
inventory file.

[NOTE]
====
Custom certificates should only be configured for the host name associated with
the `*publicMasterURL*` which can be set using
`*openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname*`. Using a custom serving certificate
for the host name associated with the `*masterURL*`
(*`openshift_master_cluster_hostname`*) will result in TLS errors as
infrastructure components will attempt to contact the master API using the
internal `*masterURL*` host.
====

Certificate and key file paths can be configured using the
`*openshift_master_named_certificates*` cluster variable:

----
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/path/to/custom1.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/custom1.key"}]
----

File paths must be local to the system where Ansible will be run. Certificates
are copied to master hosts and are deployed within the
*_/etc/origin/master/named_certificates/_* directory.

Ansible detects a certificate's `Common Name` and `Subject Alternative Names`.
Detected names can be overridden by providing the `*"names"*` key when setting
`*openshift_master_named_certificates*`:

----
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/path/to/custom1.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/custom1.key", "names": ["public-master-host.com"]}]
----

Certificates configured using `*openshift_master_named_certificates*` are cached
on masters, meaning that each additional Ansible run with a different set of
certificates results in all previously deployed certificates remaining in place
on master hosts and within the master configuration file.

If you would like `*openshift_master_named_certificates*` to be overwritten with
the provided value (or no value), specify the
`*openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates*` cluster variable:

----
openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates=true
----

For a more complete example, consider the following cluster variables in an
inventory file:

----
openshift_master_cluster_method=native
openshift_master_cluster_hostname=lb.openshift.com
openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname=custom.openshift.com
----

To overwrite the certificates on a subsequent Ansible run, you could set the
following:

----
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/root/STAR.openshift.com.crt", "keyfile": "/root/STAR.openshift.com.key", "names": ["custom.openshift.com"]}]
openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates=true
----

[[advanced-install-config-certificate-validity]]
=== Configuring Certificate Validity

By default, the certificates used to govern the etcd, master, and kubelet expire
after two to five years. The validity (length in days until they expire) for the
auto-generated registry, CA, node, and master certificates can be configured
during installation using the following variables (default values shown):

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_hosted_registry_cert_expire_days=730
openshift_ca_cert_expire_days=1825
openshift_node_cert_expire_days=730
openshift_master_cert_expire_days=730
etcd_ca_default_days=1825
----

These values are also used when
xref:../../install_config/redeploying_certificates.adoc#install-config-redeploying-certificates[redeploying certificates] via Ansible post-installation.

[[advanced-install-cluster-metrics]]
=== Configuring Cluster Metrics

Cluster metrics are not set to automatically deploy by default. Set the
following to enable cluster metrics when using the advanced install:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_hosted_metrics_deploy=true
----

The {product-title} web console uses the data coming from the Hawkular Metrics
service to display its graphs. The metrics public URL can be set during cluster
installation using the `openshift_hosted_metrics_public_url` Ansible variable,
which defaults to:

`\https://hawkular-metrics.{{openshift_master_default_subdomain}}/hawkular/metrics`

If you alter this variable, ensure the host name is accessible via your router.

[[advanced-install-cluster-metrics-storage]]
==== Configuring Metrics Storage

The `openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type` variable must be set in order to
use persistent storage for metrics. If
`openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type` is not set, then cluster metrics data
is stored in an `EmptyDir` volume, which will be deleted when the Cassandra pod
terminates.

There are three options for enabling cluster metrics storage when using the
advanced install:

[discrete]
[[advanced-install-cluster-metrics-storage-nfs-host-group]]
===== Option A: NFS Host Group

When the following variables are set, an NFS volume is created during an
advanced install with path *_<nfs_directory>/<volume_name>_* on the host within
the `[nfs]` host group. For example, the volume path using these options would
be *_/exports/metrics_*:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_hosted_metrics_storage_kind=nfs
openshift_hosted_metrics_storage_access_modes=['ReadWriteOnce']
openshift_hosted_metrics_storage_nfs_directory=/exports
openshift_hosted_metrics_storage_nfs_options='*(rw,root_squash)'
openshift_hosted_metrics_storage_volume_name=metrics
openshift_hosted_metrics_storage_volume_size=10Gi
----

[discrete]
[[advanced-install-cluster-metrics-storage-external-nfs]]
===== Option B: External NFS Host

To use an external NFS volume, one must already exist with a path of
*_<nfs_directory>/<volume_name>_* on the storage host.

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_hosted_metrics_storage_kind=nfs
openshift_hosted_metrics_storage_access_modes=['ReadWriteOnce']

openshift_hosted_metrics_storage_nfs_directory=/exports
openshift_hosted_metrics_storage_volume_name=metrics
openshift_hosted_metrics_storage_volume_size=10Gi
----

The remote volume path using the following options would be
*_nfs.example.com:/exports/metrics_*.

[discrete]
[[advanced-install-cluster-metrics-storage-dynamic]]
===== Option C: Dynamic

Use the following variable if your {product-title} environment supports
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[dynamic volume provisioning] for your cloud provider:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

[[advanced-install-cluster-logging]]
=== Configuring Cluster Logging

Cluster logging is not set to automatically deploy by default. Set the
following to enable cluster logging when using the advanced installation method:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_hosted_logging_deploy=true
----

[[advanced-installation-logging-storage]]
==== Configuring Logging Storage

The `openshift_hosted_logging_storage_kind` variable must be set in order to use
persistent storage for logging. If `openshift_hosted_logging_storage_kind` is
not set, then cluster logging data is stored in an `EmptyDir` volume, which will
be deleted when the Elasticsearch pod terminates.

There are three options for enabling cluster logging storage when using the
advanced install:

[discrete]

[[enabling-service-catalog]]
=== Enabling the Service Catalog

[NOTE]
====
Enabling the service catalog is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not
supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be
functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for
production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features,
enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the
development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.
endif::[]
====

Enabling the
xref:../../architecture/service_catalog/index.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-service-catalog[service catalog] allows service brokers to be registered with the catalog. The web
console is also configured to enable an updated landing page for browsing the
catalog.

To enable the service catalog, add the following in your inventory file's
`[OSEv3:vars]` section:

----
openshift_enable_service_catalog=true
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
openshift_service_catalog_image_prefix=openshift/origin-
openshift_service_catalog_image_version=latest
endif::[]
----

When the service catalog is enabled, the web console shows the updated landing
page but still uses the normal image stream and template behavior. The Ansible
service broker is also enabled; see
xref:configuring-ansible-service-broker[Configuring the Ansible Service Broker]
for more details. The template service broker (TSB) is not deployed by default;
see xref:configuring-template-service-broker[Configuring the Template Service Broker] for more information.

If you have xref:enabling-service-catalog[enabled the service catalog], the
xref:../../architecture/service_catalog/ansible_service_broker.adoc#arch-ansible-service-broker[Ansible service broker] (ASB) is also enabled.

The ASB deploys its own etcd instance separate from the etcd used by the rest of
the {product-title} cluster. The ASB's etcd instance requires separate storage
using persistent volumes (PVs) to function. If no PV is available, etcd will
wait until the PV can be satisfied. The ASB application will enter a `CrashLoop`
state until its etcd instance is available.

[NOTE]
====
The following example shows usage of an NFS host to provide the required PVs,
but
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[other persistent storage providers] can be used instead.
====

Some Ansible playbook bundles (APBs) may also require a PV for their own usage.
Two APBs are currently provided with {product-title} 3.6: MediaWiki and
PostgreSQL. Both of these require their own PV to deploy.

To configure the ASB:

. In your inventory file, add `nfs` to the `[OSEv3:children]` section to enable
the `[nfs]` group:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes
nfs
----

. Add a `[nfs]` group section and add the host name for the system that will
be the NFS host:
+
----
[nfs]
master1.example.com
----

. In addition to the settings from xref:enabling-service-catalog[Enabling the

To configure the TSB:

. One or more projects must be defined as the broker's source
namespace(s) for loading templates and image streams into the service catalog.
Set the desired projects by modifying the following in your inventory file's
`[OSEv3:vars]` section:
+
----
openshift_template_service_broker_namespaces=['openshift','myproject']

[[multiple-masters]]
=== Multiple Masters Examples

You can configure an environment with multiple masters, multiple *etcd* hosts,
and multiple nodes. Configuring
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#high-availability-masters[multiple
masters for high availability] (HA) ensures that the cluster has no single point
of failure.

[NOTE]
====
Moving from a single master cluster to multiple masters after installation is
not supported.
====

When configuring multiple masters, the advanced installation supports the following high
availability (HA) method:

[cols="1,5"]
|===
|`native`
|Leverages the native HA master capabilities built into {product-title} and can be
combined with any load balancing solution. If a host is defined in the *[lb]*
section of the inventory file, Ansible installs and configures HAProxy
automatically as the load balancing solution. If no host is defined, it is
assumed you have pre-configured a load balancing solution of your choice to
balance the master API (port 8443) on all master hosts.
|===

For your pre-configured load balancing solution, you must have:

* A pre-created load balancer VIP configured for SSL passthrough.
* A domain name for VIP registered in DNS.
** The domain name will become the value of both
`openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname` and
`openshift_master_cluster_hostname` in the {product-title} installer.

See
link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/installation/load_balancing.adoc[External
Load Balancer Integrations] for more information.

[NOTE]
====
For more on the high availability master architecture, see
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[Kubernetes
Infrastructure].
====

Note the following when using the `native` HA method:

- The advanced installation method does not currently support multiple HAProxy
load balancers in an active-passive setup. See the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Load_Balancer_Administration/ch-lvs-overview-VSA.html[Load
Balancer Administration documentation] for post-installation amendments.
- In a HAProxy setup, controller manager servers run as standalone processes.
They elect their active leader with a lease stored in *etcd*. The lease
expires after 30 seconds by default. If a failure happens on an active
controller server, it will take up to this number of seconds to elect another
leader. The interval can be configured with the `*osm_controller_lease_ttl*`
variable.

To configure multiple masters, refer to the following section.

== Running the Advanced Installation

After you have xref:configuring-ansible[configured Ansible] by defining an
inventory file in *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, you run the advanced installation
playbook via Ansible. {product-title} installations are currently supported
using the RPM-based installer, while the containerized installer is currently a
Technology Preview feature.

[[running-the-advanced-installation-rpm]]
=== Running the RPM-based Installer

The RPM-based installer uses Ansible installed via RPM packages to run playbooks
and configuration files available on the local host. To run the installer, use
the following command, specifying `-i` if your inventory file located somewhere
other than *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*:

----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# ansible-playbook  [-i /path/to/inventory] \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/inventory] \
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
endif::[]

The 
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift3/ose-ansible*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-ansible*
endif::[]
image is a containerized version of the {product-title} installer that runs as a
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/managing_containers/running_system_containers[system container]. System containers are stored and run outside of the traditional
*docker* service. Functionally, using the containerized installer is the same as
using the traditional RPM-based installer, except it is running in a
containerized environment instead of directly on the host.

. Use the Docker CLI to pull the image locally:

endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
$ docker pull docker.io/openshift/origin-ansible:v3.6

----

. The installer system container must be stored in
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.2/html/content_management_guide/managing_ostree_content[OSTree]
instead of defaulting to *docker* daemon storage. Use the Atomic CLI to import
the installer image from the local *docker* engine to OSTree storage:
+
----
$ atomic pull --storage ostree \
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    docker:registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-ansible:v3.6
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    docker:docker.io/openshift/origin-ansible:v3.6

<1> Sets the name for the systemd service.
<2> Specify the location for your inventory file on your local workstation.

. Use the `systemctl` command to start the installer service as you would any
other systemd service. This command initiates the cluster installation:
+
----
$ systemctl start openshift-installer
----
+
If for any reason the installation fails, before re-running the installer, see
xref:installer-known-issues[Known Issues] to check for any specific instructions
or workarounds.

. After the installation completes, you can uninstall the system container if you want. However, if you need to run the installer again to run any other playbooks later, you would have to follow this procedure again.
+
To uninstall the system container:
+
----
$ atomic uninstall openshift-installer
----

[[running-the-advanced-installation-system-container-other-playbooks]]
==== Running Other Playbooks

After you have completed the cluster installation, if you want to later run any
other playbooks using the containerized installer (for example, cluster upgrade
playbooks), you can use the `PLAYBOOK_FILE` environment variable. The default
value is `playbooks/byo/config.yml`, which is the main cluster installation
playbook, but you can set it to the path of another playbook inside the
container.

For example:

----
$ atomic install --system \
    --storage=ostree \
    --name=openshift-installer \
    --set INVENTORY_FILE=/etc/ansible/hosts \
    --set PLAYBOOK_FILE=playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_6/upgrade.yml \//<1>
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    docker:registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-ansible:v3.6
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    docker:docker.io/openshift/origin-ansible:v3.6
endif::[]
----
<1> Set `PLAYBOOK_FILE` to the relative path of the playbook starting at the
*_playbooks/_* directory. Playbooks mentioned elsewhere in {product-title}
documentation assume use of the RPM-based installer, so use this relative path
instead when using the containerized installer.

=== Deploying the Template Service Broker

If you have xref:enabling-service-catalog[enabled the service catalog] and want
to deploy the xref:configuring-template-service-broker[template service broker]
(TSB), run the following manual steps after the cluster installation completes
successfully:

[NOTE]
====
The template service broker is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not
supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be
functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for
production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features,
enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the
development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.
endif::[]
====

[WARNING]
====
Enabling the TSB currently requires opening unauthenticated access to the
cluster; this security issue will be resolved before exiting the Technology
Preview phase.
====

. Ensure that one or more source projects for the TSB were defined via
`openshift_template_service_broker_namespaces` as described in
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-template-service-broker[Configuring the Template Service Broker].

. Run the following command to enable unauthenticated access for the TSB:
+
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group \
    system:openshift:templateservicebroker-client \
    system:unauthenticated system:authenticated
----

. Create a *_template-broker.yml_* file with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: template-broker
spec:
  url: https://kubernetes.default.svc:443/brokers/template.openshift.io
----

. Use the file to register the broker:
+
----
$ oc create -f template-broker.yml
----

. Enable the Technology Preview feature in the web console to use the TSB instead
of the standard `openshift` global library behavior.

.. Save the following script to a file (for example, *_tech-preview.js_*):
+
[source, javascript]
----
window.OPENSHIFT_CONSTANTS.ENABLE_TECH_PREVIEW_FEATURE.template_service_broker = true;
----

.. Add the file to the master configuration file in
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_*:
+
[source, yaml]
----
assetConfig:
  ...
  extensionScripts:
    - /path/to/tech-preview.js
----

.. Restart the master service:
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
----
endif::[]

[[advanced-verifying-the-installation]]
== Verifying the Installation

// tag::verifying-the-installation[]
After the installation completes:

. Verify that the master is started and nodes
are registered and reporting in *Ready* status. _On the master host_, run the
following as root:
+
----
# oc get nodes

NAME                        STATUS                     AGE
master.example.com          Ready,SchedulingDisabled   165d
node1.example.com           Ready                      165d
node2.example.com           Ready                      165d
----

. To verify that the web console is installed correctly, use the master host name
and the web console port number to access the web console with a web browser.
+
For example, for a master host with a host name of `master.openshift.com` and
using the default port of `8443`, the web console would be found at `\https://master.openshift.com:8443/console`.

// end::verifying-the-installation[]

[NOTE]
====
The default port for the console is `8443`. If this was changed during the installation, the port can be found at *openshift_master_console_port* in the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file.
====

[discrete]
[[verifying-multiple-etcd-hosts]]
==== Verifying Multiple etcd Hosts

If you installed multiple *etcd* hosts:

. First, verify that the *etcd* package, which provides the `etcdctl`
command, is installed:
+
----
# yum install etcd
----

. On a master host, verify the *etcd* cluster health, substituting for the FQDNs
of your *etcd* hosts in the following:
+
----
# etcdctl -C \
    https://etcd1.example.com:2379,https://etcd2.example.com:2379,https://etcd3.example.com:2379 \
    --ca-file=/etc/origin/master/master.etcd-ca.crt \
    --cert-file=/etc/origin/master/master.etcd-client.crt \
    --key-file=/etc/origin/master/master.etcd-client.key cluster-health
----

. Also verify the member list is correct:
+
----
# etcdctl -C \
    https://etcd1.example.com:2379,https://etcd2.example.com:2379,https://etcd3.example.com:2379 \
    --ca-file=/etc/origin/master/master.etcd-ca.crt \
    --cert-file=/etc/origin/master/master.etcd-client.crt \
    --key-file=/etc/origin/master/master.etcd-client.key member list
----

[discrete]
[[verifying-multiple-masters-haproxy]]
==== Verifying Multiple Masters Using HAProxy

If you installed multiple masters using HAProxy as a load balancer, browse to
the following URL according to your *[lb]* section definition and check
HAProxy's status:

----
http://<lb_hostname>:9000
----

You can verify your installation by consulting the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Load_Balancer_Administration/ch-haproxy-setup-VSA.html[HAProxy
Configuration documentation].

[[uninstalling-advanced]]
== Uninstalling {product-title}

You can uninstall {product-title} hosts in your cluster by running the
*_uninstall.yml_* playbook. This playbook deletes {product-title} content
installed by Ansible, including:

- Configuration
- Containers
- Default templates and image streams
- Images
- RPM packages

The playbook will delete content for any hosts defined in the inventory file
that you specify when running the playbook. If you want to uninstall
{product-title} across all hosts in your cluster, run the playbook using the
inventory file you used when installing {product-title} initially or ran most
recently:

----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/file] \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/file] \
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
----

[[uninstalling-nodes-advanced]]
=== Uninstalling Nodes

You can also uninstall node components from specific hosts using the
*_uninstall.yml_* playbook while leaving the remaining hosts and cluster alone:

[WARNING]
====
This method should only be used when attempting to uninstall specific node hosts
and not for specific masters or etcd hosts, which would require further
configuration changes within the cluster.
====

. First follow the steps in
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#deleting-nodes[Deleting Nodes] to
remove the node object from the cluster, then continue with the remaining steps
in this procedure.

. Create a different inventory file that only references those hosts. For
example, to only delete content from one node:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
nodes <1>

[OSEv3:vars]
ansible_ssh_user=root
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
openshift_deployment_type=openshift-enterprise
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
openshift_deployment_type=origin
endif::[]

[nodes]
node3.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}" <2>
----
<1> Only include the sections that pertain to the hosts you are interested in
uninstalling.
<2> Only include hosts that you want to uninstall.

. Specify that new inventory file using the `-i` option when running the
*_uninstall.yml_* playbook:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# ansible-playbook -i /path/to/new/file \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# ansible-playbook -i /path/to/new/file \
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
----

When the playbook completes, all {product-title} content should be removed from
any specified hosts.

[[installer-known-issues]]
== Known Issues

- On failover in multiple master clusters, it is possible for the controller
manager to overcorrect, which causes the system to run more pods than what was
intended. However, this is a transient event and the system does correct itself
over time. See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/10030 for
details.

- On failure of the Ansible installer, you must start from a clean operating
system installation. If you are using virtual machines, start from a fresh
image. If you are using bare metal machines, see
xref:uninstalling-advanced[Uninstalling {product-title}] for instructions.
