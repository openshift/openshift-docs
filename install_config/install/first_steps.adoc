== Overview
You can populate your OpenShift installation with a useful set of Red
Hat-provided
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[image
streams] and link:../../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html[templates] to
make it easy for developers to create new applications. By default, the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
link:quick_install.html[quick installation] and
link:advanced_install.html[advanced installation] methods automatically create
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
link:advanced_install.html[advanced installation] method automatically creates
endif::[]
these sets in the *openshift* project, which is a default project to which all
users have view access.

Use the following instructions to create the objects
yourself. The files are installed on the file system of your master.

[NOTE]
====
This topic is only necessary if you installed OpenShift using a method other
than the link:quick_install.html[quick installation] or the
link:advanced_install.html[advanced installation]. Image streams and templates
will be automatically populated in the `openshift` project when using these
methods.

[[prerequisites]]

== Prerequisites
////
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
- You installed OpenShift Enterprise using either the
link:quick_install.html[quick installation] or
link:advanced_install.html[advanced installation] method.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
- You installed OpenShift Origin using the  link:advanced_install.html[advanced
installation] method.
endif::[]
////
- The link:docker_registry.html[integrated Docker registry] service must be
deployed in your OpenShift installation.
- You must be able to run the following CLI commands with
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[*cluster-admin*
privileges], because they operate on the default *openshift*
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#projects[project].
- You must have cloned the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/tree/master/roles/openshift_examples/files[repository] that contains the supported imagestreams:

[[creating-image-streams-for-openshift-images]]

== Creating Image Streams for OpenShift Images
The core set of image streams provide images that can be used to build
link:../../using_images/s2i_images/nodejs.html[*Node.js*],
link:../../using_images/s2i_images/perl.html[*Perl*],
link:../../using_images/s2i_images/php.html[*PHP*],
link:../../using_images/s2i_images/python.html[*Python*], and
link:../../using_images/s2i_images/ruby.html[*Ruby*] applications. It also
defines images for link:../../using_images/db_images/mongodb.html[*MongoDB*],
link:../../using_images/db_images/mysql.html[*MySQL*], and
link:../../using_images/db_images/postgresql.html[*PostgreSQL*] to support data
storage.

If your node hosts are subscribed using Red Hat Subscription Manager and you
want to use the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 based images:

----
$ oc create -f \
    openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.1/image-streams/image-streams-rhel7.json \
    -n openshift
----

Alternatively, to create the core set of image streams that use the CentOS 7
based images:

----
$ oc create -f \
    openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.1/image-streams/image-streams-centos7.json \
    -n openshift
----

It is not possible to create both the CentOS and RHEL sets of image streams
because they use the same names. If you desire to have both sets of image
streams available to users, either create one set in a different project, or
edit one of the files and modify the image stream names to make them unique.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
== Creating Image Streams for xPaaS Middleware Images
The xPaaS Middleware image streams provide images for
link:../../using_images/xpaas_images/eap.html[*JBoss EAP*],
link:../../using_images/xpaas_images/jws.html[*JBoss JWS*], and
link:../../using_images/xpaas_images/a_mq.html[*JBoss A-MQ*]. They can be used
to build applications for those platforms using the provided templates.

To create the xPaaS Middleware set of image streams:

----
$ oc create -f \
    openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.1/xpaas-streams/jboss-image-streams.json \
    -n openshift
----

[NOTE]
====
Access to the images referenced by these image streams requires the relevant
xPaaS Middleware subscriptions.

[[creating-database-service-templates]]

== Creating Database Service Templates
The database service templates make it easy to run a database image which can be
utilized by other components. For each database
(link:../../using_images/db_images/mongodb.html[*MongoDB*],
link:../../using_images/db_images/mysql.html[*MySQL*], and
link:../../using_images/db_images/postgresql.html[*PostgreSQL*]), two templates
are defined.

One template uses ephemeral storage in the container which means data stored
will be lost if the container is restarted, for example if the pod moves. This
template should be used for demonstration purposes only.

The other template defines a persistent volume for storage, however it requires
your OpenShift installation to have
link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.html[persistent volumes]
configured.

To create the core set of database templates:

----
$ oc create -f \
    openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.1/db-templates -n openshift
----

After creating the templates, users are able to easily instantiate the various
templates, giving them quick access to a database deployment.

[[creating-instantapp-templates]]

== Creating InstantApp Templates
The InstantApp templates define a full set of objects for a running application.
These include:

- link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[Build configurations] to build the
application from source located in a GitHub public repository
- link:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[Deployment configurations] to deploy the
application image after it is built.
- link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[Services]
to provide load balancing for the application
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods[pods].
- link:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[Routes] to
provide external access to the application.

Some of the templates also define a database deployment and service so the
application can perform database operations.

[NOTE]
====
The templates which define a database use ephemeral storage for the database content.  These templates should be used
for demonstration purposes only as all database data will be lost if the database pod restarts for any reason.
====

After creating the templates, users are able to easily instantiate full
applications using the various language images provided with OpenShift. They can
also customize the template parameters during instantiation so that it builds
source from their own repository rather than the sample repository, so this
provides a simple starting point for building new applications.

To create the core InstantApp templates:

----
$ oc create -f \
    openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.1/quickstart-templates -n openshift
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
There is also a set of templates for creating applications using various xPaaS
Middleware products (link:../../using_images/xpaas_images/eap.html[*JBoss EAP*],
link:../../using_images/xpaas_images/jws.html[*JBoss JWS*], and
link:../../using_images/xpaas_images/a_mq.html[*JBoss A-MQ*]), which can be
registered by running:

----
$ oc create -f \
    openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.1/xpaas-templates -n openshift
----

[NOTE]
====
The xPaaS Middleware templates require the
link:#creating-image-streams-for-xpaas-middleware-images[xPaaS Middleware image
streams], which in turn require the relevant xPaaS Middleware subscriptions.
====

[NOTE]
====
The templates which define a database use ephemeral storage for the database
content. These templates should be used for demonstration purposes only as all
database data will be lost if the database pod restarts for any reason.

[[what-s-next]]

== What's Next?

With these artifacts created, developers can now
link:../../dev_guide/authentication.html[log into the web console] and follow
the flow for
link:../../dev_guide/templates.html#creating-from-templates-using-the-web-console[creating
from a template]. Any of the database or application templates can be selected
to create a running database service or application in the current project. Note
that some of the application templates define their own database services as
well.

The example applications are all built out of https://github.com[GitHub]
repositories which are referenced in the templates by default, as seen in the
`*SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL*` parameter value. Those repositories can be forked, and
the fork can be provided as the `*SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL*` parameter value when
creating from the templates. This allows developers to experiment with creating
their own applications.

You can direct your developers to the
link:../../dev_guide/templates.html#using-the-instantapp-templates[Using the
InstantApp Templates] section in the Developer Guide for these instructions.
