[NOTE]
====
If you are using https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant] to run {product-title}, you
do not need to go through the following sections. These changes are only
necessary when you are setting up the host yourself. If you are using Vagrant,
see the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.html#develop-on-virtual-machine-using-vagrant[Contributing
Guide], then you can skip directly to trying out the
xref:../../getting_started/administrators.adoc#try-it-out[sample applications].

[[software-prerequisites]]
== Operating System Requirements

A base installation of RHEL 7.1 or later or RHEL Atomic Host 7.2.4 or later is
required for master and node hosts. See the following documentation for the
respective installation instructions, if required:

- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/index.html[Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide]
- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/installation-and-configuration-guide/[Red
Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host 7 Installation and Configuration Guide]

== Host Registration

Each host must be registered using Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM) and have
an active {product-title} subscription attached to access the required
packages.

. On each host, register with RHSM:
+
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<user_name> --password=<password>
----

. List the available subscriptions:
+
----
# subscription-manager list --available
----

. In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for an {product-title} subscription and attach it:
+
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Disable all repositories and enable only the required ones:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.2-rpms"
----
endif::[]

== Installing Base Packages

For RHEL 7 systems:

. Install the following base packages:
+
----
# yum install wget git net-tools bind-utils iptables-services bridge-utils bash-completion
----

. Update the system to the latest packages:
+
----
# yum update
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Install the following package, which provides {product-title} utilities and pulls in
other tools required by the
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick] and
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
methods, such as Ansible and related configuration files:
+
----
# yum install atomic-openshift-utils
----
endif::[]

For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems:

. Ensure the host is up to date by upgrading to the latest Atomic tree if one is
available:
+
----
# atomic host upgrade
----

. After the upgrade is completed and prepared for the next boot, reboot the
host:
+
----
# systemctl reboot
----


ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[[preparing-for-advanced-installations-origin]]

== Preparing for Advanced Installations

If you plan to use the
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
method, you must install Ansible and clone the *openshift-ansible* repository from
GitHub, which provides the required playbooks and configuration files.

For convenience, the following steps are provided if you want to use EPEL as a
package source for Ansible:

. Install the EPEL repository:
+
----
# yum -y install \
    https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm
----

. Disable the EPEL repository globally so that it is not accidentally used during
later steps of the installation:
+
----
# sed -i -e "s/^enabled=1/enabled=0/" /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo
----

. Install the packages for Ansible:
+
----
# yum -y --enablerepo=epel install ansible pyOpenSSL
----

To clone the *openshift-ansible* repository:

----
# cd ~
# git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible
# cd openshift-ansible
----

[NOTE]
====
Be sure to stay on the *master* branch of the *openshift-ansible* repository
when running an advanced installation.
====
endif::[]

[[installing-docker]]
== Installing Docker

At this point, you should install Docker on all master and node hosts. This
allows you to configure your xref:configuring-docker-storage[Docker storage
options] before installing {product-title}.

. For RHEL 7 systems, install Docker 1.10:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# yum install docker-1.10.3
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# yum install docker
endif::[]
----
+
[NOTE]
====
On RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems, Docker should already be installed, configured,
and running by default.
====

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file and add `--insecure-registry
172.30.0.0/16` to the `*OPTIONS*` parameter. For example:
+
----
OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled --insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16'
----
+
If using the
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[Quick
Installation] method, you can easily script a complete installation from a
kickstart or cloud-init setup, change the default configuration file:
+
----
# sed -i '/OPTIONS=.*/c\OPTIONS="--selinux-enabled --insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16"' \
/etc/sysconfig/docker
----
+
[[NOTE]]
====
The
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced
Installation] method automatically changes *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_*.
====
+
The `--insecure-registry` option instructs the Docker daemon to trust any Docker
registry on the indicated subnet, rather than
xref:docker_registry.adoc#securing-the-registry[requiring a certificate].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
172.30.0.0/16 is the default value of the `*servicesSubnet*` variable in the
*_master-config.yaml_* file. If this has changed, then the `--insecure-registry`
value in the above step should be adjusted to match, as it is indicating the
subnet for the registry to use. Note that the `*openshift_master_portal_net*`
variable can be set in the Ansible inventory file and used during the
xref:advanced_install.adoc#configuring-ansible[advanced installation]
method to modify the `*servicesSubnet*` variable.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
After the initial {product-title} installation is complete, you can choose to
xref:docker_registry.adoc#securing-the-registry[secure the integrated Docker
registry], which involves adjusting the `--insecure-registry` option
accordingly.
====

[[configuring-docker-storage]]
== Configuring Docker Storage

Docker containers and the images they are created from are stored in Docker's
storage back end. This storage is ephemeral and separate from any
xref:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[persistent storage] allocated to
meet the needs of your applications.

.For RHEL Atomic Host

The default storage back end for Docker on RHEL Atomic Host is a thin pool
logical volume, which is supported for production environments. You must ensure
that enough space is allocated for this volume per the Docker storage
requirements mentioned in
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#system-requirements[System
Requirements].

If you do not have enough allocated, see
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/getting-started-with-containers/#managing_storage_with_docker_formatted_containers[Managing
Storage with Docker Formatted Containers] for details on using
*docker-storage-setup* and basic instructions on storage management in RHEL
Atomic Host.

.For RHEL

The default storage back end for Docker on RHEL 7 is a thin pool on loopback
devices, which is not supported for production use and only appropriate for
proof of concept environments. For production environments, you must create a
thin pool logical volume and re-configure Docker to use that volume.

You can use the *docker-storage-setup* script included with Docker to create a
thin pool device and configure Docker's storage driver. This can be done after
installing Docker and should be done before creating images or containers. The
script reads configuration options from the
*_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_* file and supports three options for
creating the logical volume:

- *Option A)* Use an additional block device.
- *Option B)* Use an existing, specified volume group.
- *Option C)* Use the remaining free space from the volume group where your root
file system is located.

Option A is the most robust option, however it requires adding an additional
block device to your host before configuring Docker storage. Options B and C
both require leaving free space available when provisioning your host.

. Create the *docker-pool* volume using one of the following three options:

** [[docker-storage-a]]*Option A) Use an additional block device.*
+
In *_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_*, set *DEVS* to the path of the block
device you wish to use. Set *VG* to the volume group name you wish to create;
*docker-vg* is a reasonable choice. For example:
+
====
----
# cat <<EOF > /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup
DEVS=/dev/vdc
VG=docker-vg
EOF
----
====
+
Then run *docker-storage-setup* and review the output to ensure the
*docker-pool* volume was created:
+
====
----
# docker-storage-setup                                                                                                                                                                                                                                [5/1868]

+
====
----
# cat <<EOF > /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup
VG=docker-vg
EOF
----
====

----
====

** [[docker-storage-c]]*Option C) Use the remaining free space from the volume
 group where your root file system is located.*
+
Verify that the volume group where your root file system resides has the desired
free space, then run *docker-storage-setup* and review the output to ensure the
*docker-pool* volume was created:
+
====
----
# docker-storage-setup

----
====

. Verify your configuration. You should have a *dm.thinpooldev* value in the
*_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage_* file and a *docker-pool* logical volume:
+
====
----
# cat /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage

----
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Before using Docker or {product-title}, verify that the *docker-pool* logical volume
is large enough to meet your needs. The *docker-pool* volume should be 60% of
the available volume group and will grow to fill the volume group via LVM
monitoring.
====

. Check if Docker is running:
+
----
# systemctl is-active docker
----

. If Docker has not yet been started on the host, enable and start the service:
+
----
# systemctl enable docker
# systemctl start docker
----
+
If Docker is already running, re-initialize Docker:
+
[WARNING]
====
This will destroy any Docker containers or images currently on the host.
====
+
----
# systemctl stop docker
# rm -rf /var/lib/docker/*
# systemctl restart docker
----
+
If there is any content in *_/var/lib/docker/_*, it must be deleted. Files
will be present if Docker has been used prior to the installation of {product-title}.

[[reconfiguring-docker-storage]]
=== Reconfiguring Docker Storage

Should you need to reconfigure Docker storage after having created the
*docker-pool*, you should first remove the *docker-pool* logical volume. If you
are using a dedicated volume group, you should also remove the volume group and
any associated physical volumes before reconfiguring *docker-storage-setup*
according to the instructions above.

See
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Logical_Volume_Manager_Administration/index.html[Logical
Volume Manager Administration] for more detailed information on LVM management.

[[managing-docker-container-logs]]
=== Managing Docker Container Logs

Sometimes a container's log file (the
*_/var/lib/docker/containers/<hash>/<hash>-json.log_* file on the node where the
container is running) can increase to a problematic size. You can manage this by
configuring Docker's `json-file` logging driver to restrict the size and number
of log files.

[options="header"]
|===

|Option |Purpose

|`--log-opt max-size`
|Sets the size at which a new log file is created.

|`--log-opt max-file`
|Sets the file on each host to configure the options.
|===

For example, to set the maximum file size to 1MB and always keep the last three
log files, edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file to configure `max-size=1M`
and `max-file=3`:
====
----
OPTIONS='--insecure-registry=172.30.0.0/16 --selinux-enabled --log-opt max-size=1M --log-opt max-file=3'
----
====

Next, restart the Docker service:
----
# systemctl restart docker
----

[[viewing-available-container-logs]]
=== Viewing Available Container Logs

Container logs are stored in the *_/var/lib/docker/containers/<hash>/_*
directory on the node where the container is running. For example:

Do *not* use a password.

An easy way to distribute your SSH keys is by using a `bash` loop:
