== Overview

The default method for installing OpenShift on
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Fedora, CentOS, or RHEL
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
endif::[]
uses RPMs. Alternatively, you can use the containerized method, which deploys
containerized OpenShift master and node components. When targeting a RHEL Atomic
Host system, the containerized method is the only available option, and is
automatically selected for you based on the detection of the
*_/run/ostree-booted_* file.

You can easily deploy environments mixing containerized and RPM based
installations. For the
link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation
method], you can set the Ansible variable `*containerized=true*` in an
link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-ansible[inventory
file] on a cluster-wide or per host basis.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
For the link:../../install_config/install/quick_install.html[quick installation
method], you can choose between the RPM or containerized method on a per host
basis during the interactive installation, or set the values manually in an
link:../../install_config/install/quick_install.html#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation
configuration file].

[NOTE]
====
Containerized installations are supported starting in OpenShift Enterprise
3.1.1. When installing an environment with multiple masters, the load balancer
cannot be deployed by the installation process as a container. See
link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html#multiple-masters[Advanced
Installation] for load balancer requirements using either the native HA or
Pacemaker methods.

The following sections detail the differences between the RPM and containerized
methods.

[[containerized-required-images]]
== Required Images

Containerized installations make use of the following images:

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
- *openshift/origin*
- *openshift/node* (*node* + *openshift-sdn* + *openvswitch* RPM for client tools)
- *openshift/openvswitch* (CentOS 7 + *openvswitch* RPM, runs *ovsdb* and *ovsctl* processes)
- *registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/etcd*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
- *openshift3/ose*
- *openshift3/node*
- *openshift3/openvswitch*
- *registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/etcd*

By default, all of the above images are pulled from the Red Hat Registry at
https://registry.access.redhat.com[registry.access.redhat.com].
endif::[]

If you need to use a private registry to pull these images during the
installation, you can specify the registry information ahead of time. For the
advanced installation method, you can set the following Ansible variables in
your inventory file, as required:

====
----
cli_docker_additional_registries=<registry_hostname>
cli_docker_insecure_registries=<registry_hostname>
cli_docker_blocked_registries=<registry_hostname>
----
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
For the quick installation method, you can export the following environment
variables on each target host:

====
----
# export OO_INSTALL_ADDITIONAL_REGISTRIES=<registry_hostname>
# export OO_INSTALL_INSECURE_REGISTRIES=<registry_hostname>
----
====

Blocked Docker registries cannot currently be specified using the quick
installation method.
endif::[]

The configuration of additional, insecure, and blocked Docker registries occurs
at the beginning of the installation process to ensure that these settings are
applied before attempting to pull any of the required images.

[[containerized-cli-wrappers]]
== CLI Wrappers

When using containerized installations, a CLI wrapper script is deployed on each
master at *_/usr/local/bin/openshift_*. The following set of symbolic links are
also provided to ease administrative tasks:

|===
|Symbolic Link |Usage

|*_/usr/local/bin/oc_*
|Developer CLI

|*_/usr/local/bin/oadm_*
|Administrative CLI

|*_/usr/local/bin/kubectl_*
|Kubernetes CLI
|===

The wrapper spawns a new container on each invocation, so you may notice
it run slightly slower than native CLI operations.

The wrapper scripts mount a limited subset of paths:

- *_~/.kube_*
- *_/etc/origin/_*
- *_/tmp/_*

Be mindful of this when passing in files to be processed by the `oc` or `oadm`
commands. You may find it easier to redirect the input, for example:

====
----
# oc create -f - < my-file.json
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The wrapper is intended only to be used to bootstrap an environment. You should
install the CLI tools on another host after you have granted *cluster-admin*
privileges to a user. See
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#managing-role-bindings[Managing
Role Bindings] and link:../../cli_reference/get_started_cli.html[Get Started
with the CLI] for more information.
====

[[containerized-starting-and-stopping-containers]]
== Starting and Stopping Containers

The installation process creates relevant *systemd* units which can be used to
start, stop, and poll services using normal *systemctl* commands. For
containerized installations, these unit names match those of an RPM
installation, with the exception of the *etcd* service which is named
*etcd_container*.

This change is necessary as currently RHEL Atomic Host ships with the *etcd*
package installed as part of the operating system, so a containerized version is
used for the OpenShift installation instead. The installation process disables
the default *etcd* service. The *etcd* package is slated to be removed from RHEL
Atomic Host in the future.

[[containerized-file-paths]]
== File Paths

All OpenShift configuration files are placed in the same locations during
containerized installation as RPM based installations and will survive *os-tree*
upgrades.

However, 
link:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.html[the default image stream and template files]
are installed at *_/etc/origin/examples/_* for
containerized installations rather than the standard
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_*, because that directory is read-only on RHEL
Atomic Host.

[[containerized-storage-requirements]]
== Storage Requirements

RHEL Atomic Host installations normally have a very small root file system.
However, the etcd, master, and node containers persist data in the *_/var/lib/_*
directory. Ensure that you have enough space on the root file system before
installing OpenShift; see the
link:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.html#system-requirements[System
Requirements] section for details.

[[containerized-openvswitch-sdn-initialization]]
== Open vSwitch SDN Initialization

OpenShift SDN initialization requires that the Docker bridge be reconfigured and
that Docker is restarted. This complicates the situation when the node is
running within a container. When using the Open vSwitch (OVS) SDN, you will see
the node start, reconfigure Docker, restart Docker (which restarts all
containers), and finally start successfully.

In this case, the node service may fail to start and be restarted a few times
because the master services are also restarted along with Docker. The current
implementation uses a workaround which relies on setting the `*Restart=always*`
parameter in the Docker based *systemd* units.
