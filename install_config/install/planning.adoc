[[inital-planning]]
== Initial Planning

For production environments, several factors influence installation. Consider
the following questions as you read through the documentation:

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* _Do you install on-premises or in public/private clouds?_ The xref:planning-cloud-providers[Installation Methods]
section provides more information about the cloud providers options available.
endif::[]

* _How many pods are required in your cluster?_ The xref:sizing[Sizing Considerations]
section provides limits for nodes and pods so you can calculate how large your
environment needs to be.

* _How many hosts do you require in the cluster?_ The xref:environment-scenarios[Environment Scenarios]
section provides multiple examples of Single Master and Multiple Master
configurations.

* _Is xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#admin-guide-high-availability[high availability]
required?_ High availability is recommended for fault tolerance. In this
situation, you might aim to use the xref:multi-masters-using-native-ha[Multiple Masters Using Native HA]
example as a basis for your environment.

* _Which installation type do you want to use: xref:rpm-vs-containerized[RPM or
 containerized]?_ Both installations provide a working {product-title}
 environment, but you might have a preference for a particular method of
 installing, managing, and updating your services.
 
 * _Which identity provider do you use for 
 xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[authentication]?_
 If you already use a supported identity provider, it is a best practice to 
 configure {product-title} to use that identity provider during 
 xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation].
 
 
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
* _Is my installation supported if integrating with other technologies?_ See the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2176281[OpenShift Container Platform Tested Integrations] for a list of tested integrations.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[[planning-cloud-providers]]
=== On-premises vs Cloud Providers

{product-title} can be installed on-premises or hosted on public or private
clouds. Ansible playbooks can help you with automating
the provisioning and installation processes. For information, see
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#advanced-cloud-providers[Advanced Installation].
endif::[]

[[sizing]]
== Sizing Considerations

Determine how many nodes and pods you require for your {product-title} cluster.
Cluster scalability correlates to the number of pods in a cluster environment.
That number influences the other numbers in your setup. See
xref:../../scaling_performance/cluster_limits.adoc#scaling-performance-cluster-limits[Cluster
Limits] for the latest limits for objects in {product-title}.

[[environment-scenarios]]
== Environment Scenarios

This section outlines different examples of scenarios for your {product-title}
environment. Use these scenarios as a basis for planning your own
{product-title} cluster, based on your xref:sizing[sizing] needs.

See
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-kubernetes-infrastructure[Kubernetes
Infrastructure] for details on how nodes, masters, and etcd fit together to make
a {product-title} deployment.

[NOTE]
====
Moving from a single master cluster to multiple masters after installation is
not supported.
====

For information on updating labels, see
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[Updating Labels
on Nodes].

[[single-master-single-box]]
=== Single Master and Node on One System

{product-title} can be installed on a single system
for a development environment only.
An _all-in-one environment_ is not considered a production environment.

[[single-master-multi-node]]
=== Single Master and Multiple Nodes

The following table describes an example environment for a single
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master] (with etcd installed on the same host)
and two
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[nodes]:

[options="header"]
|===

|Host Name |Infrastructure Component to Install

|*master.example.com*
|Master, etcd, and node

|*node1.example.com*
.2+.^|Node

|*node2.example.com*
|===

[[single-master-multi-etcd-multi-node]]
=== Single Master, Multiple etcd, and Multiple Nodes

The following table describes an example environment for a single
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master],
three
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[etcd]
hosts, and two
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[nodes]:

[options="header"]
|===

|Host Name |Infrastructure Component to Install

|*master.example.com*
|Master and node

|*etcd1.example.com*
.3+.^|etcd

|*etcd2.example.com*

|*etcd3.example.com*

|*node1.example.com*
.2+.^|Node

|*node2.example.com*
|===

[[multi-masters-using-native-ha-colocated]]
=== Multiple Masters Using Native HA with Co-located Clustered etcd

The following describes an example environment for three
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[masters] with co-located clustered etcd,
one HAProxy load balancer, and two
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[nodes]
using the `native` HA method:

[options="header"]
|===

|Host Name |Infrastructure Component to Install

|*master1.example.com*
.3+.^|Master (clustered using native HA) and node and clustered etcd

|*master2.example.com*

|*master3.example.com*

|*lb.example.com*
|HAProxy to load balance API master endpoints

|*node1.example.com*
.2+.^|Node

|*node2.example.com*
|===

[[multi-masters-using-native-ha]]
=== Multiple Masters Using Native HA with External Clustered etcd

The following describes an example environment for three
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[masters],
one HAProxy load balancer, three external clustered xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[etcd]
hosts, and two
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[nodes]
using the `native` HA method:

[options="header"]
|===

|Host Name |Infrastructure Component to Install

|*master1.example.com*
.3+.^|Master (clustered using native HA) and node

|*master2.example.com*

|*master3.example.com*

|*lb.example.com*
|HAProxy to load balance API master endpoints

|*etcd1.example.com*
.3+.^|Clustered etcd

|*etcd2.example.com*

|*etcd3.example.com*

|*node1.example.com*
.2+.^|Node

|*node2.example.com*
|===

[[planning-stand-alone-registry]]
=== Stand-alone Registry

You can also install {product-title} to act as a stand-alone registry using the
{product-title}'s integrated registry. See
xref:../../install_config/install/stand_alone_registry.adoc#install-config-installing-stand-alone-registry[Installing
a Stand-alone Registry] for details on this scenario.

[[rpm-vs-containerized]]
== RPM vs Containerized

An RPM installation installs all services through package management and
configures services to run within the same user space, while a containerized
installation installs services using container images and runs separate services
in individual containers.

See the
xref:rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[Installing on
Containerized Hosts] topic for more details on configuring your
installation to use containerized services.
