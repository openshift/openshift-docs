[[inital-planning]]
== Initial Planning

For production environments, several factors influence installation. Consider
the following questions as you read through the documentation:

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* _Do you install on-premises or in public/private clouds?_ The xref:planning-cloud-providers[Installation Methods]
section provides more information about the cloud providers options available.
endif::[]

* _Which installation method do you want to use?_ The xref:installation-methods[Installation Methods]
section provides some information about the quick and advanced installation
methods.

* _How many pods are required in your cluster?_ The xref:sizing[Sizing Considerations]
section provides limits for nodes and pods so you can calculate how large your
environment needs to be.

* _How many hosts do you require in the cluster?_ The xref:environment-scenarios[Environment Scenarios]
section provides multiple examples of Single Master and Multiple Master
configurations.

* _Is xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#admin-guide-high-availability[high availability]
required?_ High availability is recommended for fault tolerance. In this
situation, you might aim to use the xref:multi-masters-using-native-ha[Multiple Masters Using Native HA]
example as a basis for your environment.

* _Which installation type do you want to use: xref:rpm-vs-containerized[RPM or
 containerized]?_ Both installations provide a working {product-title}
 environment, but you might have a preference for a particular method of
 installing, managing, and updating your services.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
* _Is my installation supported if integrating with other technologies?_ See the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2176281[OpenShift Container Platform Tested Integrations] for a list of tested integrations.
endif::[]

[[installation-methods]]
== Installation Methods

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of {product-title} 3.9, the quick installation method is deprecated. In a
future release, it will be removed completely. In addition, using the quick
installer to upgrade from version 3.7 to 3.9 is not supported.
====

Both the quick and advanced installation methods are supported for development
and production environments. If you want to quickly get {product-title} up and
running to try out for the first time, use the quick installer and let the
interactive CLI guide you through the configuration options relevant to your
environment.

For the most control over your cluster’s configuration, you can use the advanced
installation method. This method is particularly suited if you are already
familiar with Ansible. However, following along with the {product-title}
documentation should equip you with enough information to reliably deploy your
cluster and continue to manage its configuration post-deployment using the
provided Ansible playbooks directly.

If you install initially using the quick installer, you can always further tweak
your cluster’s configuration and adjust the number of hosts in the cluster using
the same installer tool. If you wanted to later switch to using the advanced
method, you can create an inventory file for your configuration and carry on
that way.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[[planning-cloud-providers]]
=== On-premises vs Cloud Providers

{product-title} can be installed on-premises or hosted on public or private
clouds. Ansible playbooks can help you with automating
the provisioning and installation processes. For information, see
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#advanced-cloud-providers[Advanced Installation].
endif::[]

[[sizing]]
== Sizing Considerations

Determine how many nodes and pods you require for your {product-title} cluster.
Cluster scalability correlates to the number of pods in a cluster environment.
That number influences the other numbers in your setup. See
xref:../../scaling_performance/cluster_limits.adoc#scaling-performance-cluster-limits[Cluster
Limits] for the latest limits for objects in {product-title}.

[[environment-scenarios]]
== Environment Scenarios

This section outlines different examples of scenarios for your {product-title}
environment. Use these scenarios as a basis for planning your own
{product-title} cluster, based on your xref:sizing[sizing] needs.

[NOTE]
====
Moving from a single master cluster to multiple masters after installation is
not supported.
====

[[single-master-single-box]]
=== Single Master and Node on One System

{product-title} can be installed on a single system
for a development environment only.
An _all-in-one environment_ is not considered a production environment.

[[single-master-multi-node]]
=== Single Master and Multiple Nodes

The following table describes an example environment for a single
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master] (with etcd installed on the same host)
and two
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[nodes]:

[options="header"]
|===

|Host Name |Infrastructure Component to Install

|*master.example.com*
|Master, etcd, and node

|*node1.example.com*
.2+.^|Node

|*node2.example.com*
|===

[[single-master-multi-etcd-multi-node]]
=== Single Master, Multiple etcd, and Multiple Nodes

The following table describes an example environment for a single
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master],
three
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[etcd]
hosts, and two
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[nodes]:

[options="header"]
|===

|Host Name |Infrastructure Component to Install

|*master.example.com*
|Master and node

|*etcd1.example.com*

|*etcd2.example.com*

|*etcd3.example.com*

|*node1.example.com*
.2+.^|Node

|*node2.example.com*
|===

[[multi-masters-using-native-ha-colocated]]
=== Multiple Masters Using Native HA with Co-located Clustered etcd

The following describes an example environment for three
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[masters] with co-located clustered etcd,
one HAProxy load balancer, and two
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[nodes]
using the `native` HA method:

[options="header"]
|===

|Host Name |Infrastructure Component to Install

|*master1.example.com*
.3+.^|Master (clustered using native HA) and node and clustered etcd

|*master2.example.com*

|*master3.example.com*

|*lb.example.com*
|HAProxy to load balance API master endpoints

|*node1.example.com*
.2+.^|Node

|*node2.example.com*
|===

[[multi-masters-using-native-ha]]
=== Multiple Masters Using Native HA with External Clustered etcd

The following describes an example environment for three
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[masters],
one HAProxy load balancer, three external clustered xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[etcd]
hosts, and two
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[nodes]
using the `native` HA method:

[options="header"]
|===

|Host Name |Infrastructure Component to Install

|*master1.example.com*
.3+.^|Master (clustered using native HA) and node

|*master2.example.com*

|*master3.example.com*

|*lb.example.com*
|HAProxy to load balance API master endpoints

|*etcd1.example.com*
.3+.^|Clustered etcd

|*etcd2.example.com*

|*etcd3.example.com*

|*node1.example.com*
.2+.^|Node

|*node2.example.com*
|===

[[planning-stand-alone-registry]]
=== Stand-alone Registry

You can also install {product-title} to act as a stand-alone registry using the
{product-title}'s integrated registry. See
xref:../../install_config/install/stand_alone_registry.adoc#install-config-installing-stand-alone-registry[Installing
a Stand-alone Registry] for details on this scenario.

[[rpm-vs-containerized]]
== RPM vs Containerized

An RPM installation installs all services through package management and
configures services to run within the same user space, while a containerized
installation installs services using container images and runs separate services
in individual containers.

See the
xref:rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[Installing on
Containerized Hosts] topic for more details on configuring your
installation to use containerized services.
