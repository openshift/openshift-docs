== Overview
The _quick installation_ method allows you to use an interactive CLI utility,
the `atomic-openshift-installer` command, to install OpenShift across a set of
hosts. The installation utility is provided to make the installation experience
easier by link:#running-an-interactive-installation[interactively gathering the
data] needed to run on each host. The utility is a self-contained wrapper
intended for usage on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host.

In addition to running link:#running-an-interactive-installation[interactive
installations] from scratch, the `atomic-openshift-installer` command can also
be run or re-run using a predefined installation configuration file. This file
can be used with the installation utility to:

- run an link:#running-an-unattended-installation[unattended installation],
- link:#adding-nodes-or-reinstalling[add nodes] to an existing cluster,
- link:../../install_config/upgrades.html[upgrade your cluster], or
- link:#adding-nodes-or-reinstalling[reinstall] the OpenShift cluster completely.
endif::[]

Alternatively, you can use the link:advanced_install.html[advanced installation]
method for more complex environments.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

[[quick-install-prereqs]]

== Prerequisites

The installation utility allows you to install OpenShift
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master]
and
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#node[node]
components on a defined set of hosts.

[NOTE]
====
By default, any hosts you designate as masters during the installation process
are automatically also configured as nodes so that the masters are configured as
part of the
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/networking.html#openshift-sdn[OpenShift
SDN]. The node component on the masters, however, are marked unscheduable, which
blocks pods from being scheduled on it. After the installation, you can
link:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html#marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[mark
them schedulable] if you want.
====

Before installing OpenShift, you must first
link:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.html[satisfy the prerequisites]
on your hosts, which includes verifying system and environment requirements and
properly installing and configuring Docker. After following the instructions in
the link:prerequisites.html[Prerequisites] topic, you can continue to running an
link:#running-an-interactive-installation[interactive] or
link:#running-an-unattended-installation[unattended] installation.

[[running-an-interactive-installation]]

== Running an Interactive Installation

[NOTE]
====
Ensure you have read through the link:#quick-install-prereqs[Prerequisites]
before proceeding.
====

You can start the interactive installation by running:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer install
----

Then follow the on-screen instructions to install a new OpenShift Enterprise
cluster.

After it has finished, ensure that you back up the
*_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_*
link:#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] that is created, as it is required if you later want to re-run the
installation, add hosts to the cluster, or
link:../../install_config/upgrades.html[upgrade your cluster]. Then, see
link:#quick-install-whats-next[What's Next] for the next steps on configuring
your OpenShift cluster.

[[defining-an-installation-configuration-file]]

== Defining an Installation Configuration File

The installation utility can use a predefined installation configuration file,
which contains information about your installation, individual hosts, and
cluster. When running an link:#running-an-interactive-installation[interactive
installation], an installation configuration file based on your answers is
created for you in *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_*. The file is
created if you are instructed to exit the installation to manually modify the
configuration or when the installation completes. You can also create the
configuration file manually from scratch to perform an
link:#running-an-unattended-installation[unattended installation].

----
<1> The version of this installation configuration file. As of OpenShift Enterprise 3.1, the only valid version here is `v1`.
<2> The OpenShift variant to install. For OpenShift Enterprise, set this to
`openshift-enterprise`.
<3> A valid version your selected variant. If not specified, this defaults to
the newest version for the specified variant. For example: `3.1` or `3.0`.
<4> Defines which user Ansible uses to SSH in to remote systems for gathering
facts and for the installation. By default, this is the root user, but you can
set it to any user that has *sudo* privileges.
<5> Defines where the Ansible logs are stored. By default, this is the
*_/tmp/ansible.log_* file.
<6> Defines a list of the hosts onto which you want to install the OpenShift
master and node components.
<7> Required. Allows the installer to connect to the system and gather facts
before proceeding with the install.
<8> Required for unattended installations. If these details are not
specified, then this information is pulled from the facts gathered by the
installation utility, and you are asked to confirm the details. If undefined for
an unattended installation, the installation fails.
<9> Determines the type of services that are installed. At least one of these
must be set to *true* for the configuration file to be considered valid.
<10> If set to *true*, OpenShift services are run in a container on this host
instead of installed using RPM packages. Containerized installations are in
Technology Preview in OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.
<11> The IP address that Ansible attempts to connect to when installing,
upgrading, or uninstalling the systems. If the configuration file was
auto-generated, then this is the value you first enter for the host during that
interactive install process.

[[running-an-unattended-installation]]

== Running an Unattended Installation

[NOTE]
====
Ensure you have read through the link:#quick-install-prereqs[Prerequisites]
before proceeding.
====

Unattended installations allow you to define your hosts and cluster
configuration in an
link:#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] before running the installation utility so that you do not have to go
through all of the link:#running-an-interactive-installation[interactive
installation] questions and answers. It also allows you to resume an interactive
installation you may have left unfinished, and quickly get back to where you
left off.

To run an unattended installation, first define an
link:#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] at *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_*. Then, run the installation
utility with the `-u` flag:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer -u install
----

By default in interactive or unattended mode, the installation utility uses the
configuration file located at *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* if the
file exists. If it does not exist, attempting to start an unattended
installation fails. Alternatively, you can specify a different location for the
configuration file using the `-c` option, but doing so will require you to
specify the file location every time you run the installation:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer -u -c </path/to/file> install
----

After the unattended installation finishes, ensure that you back up the
*_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* file that was used, as it is required
if you later want to re-run the installation, add hosts to the cluster, or
link:../../install_config/upgrades.html[upgrade your cluster]. Then, see
link:#quick-install-whats-next[What's Next] for the next steps on configuring
your OpenShift cluster.

[[adding-nodes-or-reinstalling]]

== Adding Nodes or Reinstalling the Cluster

Whether you began the process using an
link:#running-an-interactive-installation[interactive] or
link:#running-an-unattended-installation[unattended] installation, you can
re-run the installation as long as you have an
link:#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] at *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* (or specify its location with
the `-c` option).

To re-run an installation, use the `install` subcommand again in interactive or
unattended mode:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer install
----

The installer will detect your installed environment and allow you to either add
an additional node or perform a clean install:

====
----
Gathering information from hosts...
Installed environment detected.
By default the installer only adds new nodes to an installed environment.
Do you want to (1) only add additional nodes or (2) perform a clean install?:
----
====

Choose one of the options and follow the on-screen  instructions to complete
your desired task.

[[uninstalling-openshift-quick]]

== Uninstalling OpenShift

You can uninstall OpenShift using the installation utility by running:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer uninstall
