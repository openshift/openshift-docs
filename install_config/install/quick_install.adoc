== Overview
The _quick installation_ method allows you to use an interactive CLI utility,
the `atomic-openshift-installer` command, to install OpenShift across a set of
hosts. The installation utility can deploy OpenShift components on targeted
hosts by either installing RPMs or running containerized services.

This installation method is provided to make the installation experience easier
by link:#running-an-interactive-installation[interactively gathering the data]
needed to run on each host. The utility is a self-contained wrapper intended for
usage on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 system. While RHEL Atomic Host is
supported for running containerized OpenShift services, the installation utility
is
link:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.html#software-prerequisites[provided
by an RPM] not available by default in RHEL Atomic Host, and must therefore be
run from a RHEL 7 system. The host initiating the installation does not need to
be intended for inclusion in the OpenShift cluster, but it can be.

In addition to running link:#running-an-interactive-installation[interactive
installations] from scratch, the `atomic-openshift-installer` command can also
be run or re-run using a predefined installation configuration file. This file
can be used with the installation utility to:

- run an link:#running-an-unattended-installation[unattended installation],
- link:#adding-nodes-or-reinstalling[add nodes] to an existing cluster,
- link:../../install_config/upgrading/index.html[upgrade your cluster], or
- link:#adding-nodes-or-reinstalling[reinstall] the OpenShift cluster completely.

Alternatively, you can use the link:advanced_install.html[advanced installation]
method for more complex environments.

[[quick-before-you-begin]]

== Before You Begin

The installation utility allows you to install OpenShift
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master]
and
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#node[node]
components on a defined set of hosts.

[NOTE]
====
By default, any hosts you designate as masters during the installation process
are automatically also configured as nodes so that the masters are configured as
part of the
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/networking.html#openshift-sdn[OpenShift
SDN]. The node component on the masters, however, are marked unscheduable, which
blocks pods from being scheduled on it. After the installation, you can
link:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html#marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[mark
them schedulable] if you want.
====

Before installing OpenShift, you must first
link:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.html[satisfy the prerequisites]
on your hosts, which includes verifying system and environment requirements and
properly installing and configuring Docker. You must also be prepared to provide
or validate the following information for each of your targeted hosts during the
course of the installation:

- User name on the target host that should run the Ansible-based installation
(can be root or non-root)
- Host name
- Whether to install components for master, node, or both
- Whether to use the RPM or containerized method
- Internal and external IP addresses

If you are interested in installing OpenShift using the containerized method
(optional for RHEL but required for RHEL Atomic Host), see
link:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.html[RPM vs
Containerized] to ensure that you understand the differences between these
methods, then return to this topic to continue.

After following the instructions in the
link:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.html[Prerequisites] topic and
deciding between the RPM and containerized methods, you can continue to running
an link:#running-an-interactive-installation[interactive] or
link:#running-an-unattended-installation[unattended] installation.

[[running-an-interactive-installation]]

== Running an Interactive Installation

[NOTE]
====
Ensure you have read through link:#quick-before-you-begin[Before You Begin].
====

You can start the interactive installation by running:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer install
----

Then follow the on-screen instructions to install a new OpenShift Enterprise
cluster.

After it has finished, ensure that you back up the
*_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_*
link:#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] that is created, as it is required if you later want to re-run the
installation, add hosts to the cluster, or
link:../../install_config/upgrading/index.html[upgrade your cluster]. Then, see
link:#quick-install-whats-next[What's Next] for the next steps on configuring
your OpenShift cluster.

[[defining-an-installation-configuration-file]]

== Defining an Installation Configuration File

The installation utility can use a predefined installation configuration file,
which contains information about your installation, individual hosts, and
cluster. When running an link:#running-an-interactive-installation[interactive
installation], an installation configuration file based on your answers is
created for you in *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_*. The file is
created if you are instructed to exit the installation to manually modify the
configuration or when the installation completes. You can also create the
configuration file manually from scratch to perform an
link:#running-an-unattended-installation[unattended installation].

----
<1> The version of this installation configuration file. As of OpenShift
Enterprise (OSE) 3.1, the only valid version here is `v1`.
<2> The OpenShift variant to install. For OSE, set this to
`openshift-enterprise`.
<3> A valid version your selected variant. If not specified, this defaults to
the newest version for the specified variant. For example: `3.1` or `3.0`.
<4> Defines which user Ansible uses to SSH in to remote systems for gathering
facts and for the installation. By default, this is the root user, but you can
set it to any user that has *sudo* privileges.
<5> Defines where the Ansible logs are stored. By default, this is the
*_/tmp/ansible.log_* file.
<6> Defines a list of the hosts onto which you want to install the OpenShift
master and node components.
<7> Required. Allows the installer to connect to the system and gather facts
before proceeding with the install.
<8> Required for unattended installations. If these details are not
specified, then this information is pulled from the facts gathered by the
installation utility, and you are asked to confirm the details. If undefined for
an unattended installation, the installation fails.
<9> Determines the type of services that are installed. At least one of these
must be set to *true* for the configuration file to be considered valid.
<10> If set to *true*, containerized OpenShift services are run on target master
and node hosts instead of installed using RPM packages. If set to *false* or
unset, the default RPM method is used. RHEL Atomic Host requires the
containerized method, and is automatically selected for you based on the
detection of the *_/run/ostree-booted_* file. See
link:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.html[RPM vs
Containerized] for more details. Containerized installations are supported
starting in OSE 3.1.1.
<11> The IP address that Ansible attempts to connect to when installing,
upgrading, or uninstalling the systems. If the configuration file was
auto-generated, then this is the value you first enter for the host during that
interactive install process.

[[running-an-unattended-installation]]

== Running an Unattended Installation

[NOTE]
====
Ensure you have read through the link:#quick-before-you-begin[Before You Begin].
====

Unattended installations allow you to define your hosts and cluster
configuration in an
link:#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] before running the installation utility so that you do not have to go
through all of the link:#running-an-interactive-installation[interactive
installation] questions and answers. It also allows you to resume an interactive
installation you may have left unfinished, and quickly get back to where you
left off.

To run an unattended installation, first define an
link:#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] at *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_*. Then, run the installation
utility with the `-u` flag:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer -u install
----

By default in interactive or unattended mode, the installation utility uses the
configuration file located at *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* if the
file exists. If it does not exist, attempting to start an unattended
installation fails. Alternatively, you can specify a different location for the
configuration file using the `-c` option, but doing so will require you to
specify the file location every time you run the installation:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer -u -c </path/to/file> install
----

After the unattended installation finishes, ensure that you back up the
*_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* file that was used, as it is required
if you later want to re-run the installation, add hosts to the cluster, or
link:../../install_config/upgrading/index.html[upgrade your cluster]. Then, see
link:#quick-install-whats-next[What's Next] for the next steps on configuring
your OpenShift cluster.

[[adding-nodes-or-reinstalling]]

== Adding Nodes or Reinstalling the Cluster

Whether you began the process using an
link:#running-an-interactive-installation[interactive] or
link:#running-an-unattended-installation[unattended] installation, you can
re-run the installation as long as you have an
link:#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] at *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* (or specify its location with
the `-c` option).

To re-run an installation, use the `install` subcommand again in interactive or
unattended mode:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer install
----

The installer will detect your installed environment and allow you to either add
an additional node or perform a clean install:

====
----
Gathering information from hosts...
Installed environment detected.
By default the installer only adds new nodes to an installed environment.
Do you want to (1) only add additional nodes or (2) perform a clean install?:
----
====

Choose one of the options and follow the on-screen  instructions to complete
your desired task.

[[uninstalling-openshift-quick]]

== Uninstalling OpenShift

You can uninstall OpenShift using the installation utility by running:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer uninstall
