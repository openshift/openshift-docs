You can quickly get {product-title} running by choosing an installation method
in xref:../../getting_started/administrators.adoc#getting-started-administrators[Getting Started for
Administrators]. Alternatively, you can use the xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
method for more complex environments.

== Overview

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of {product-title} 3.9, the quick installation method is deprecated. In a
future release, it will be removed completely. In addition, using the quick
installer to upgrade from version 3.7 to 3.9 is not supported. The
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation] method will continue to be supported for new installations and
cluster upgrades.
====

The _quick installation_ method allows you to use an interactive CLI utility,
the `atomic-openshift-installer` command, to install {product-title} across a
set of hosts. This installer can deploy {product-title} components on targeted
hosts by either installing RPMs or running containerized services.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While RHEL Atomic Host is supported for running containerized {product-title}
services, the installer is provided by an RPM and not available by default in
RHEL Atomic Host. Therefore, it must be run from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
system. The host initiating the installation does not need to be intended for
inclusion in the {product-title} cluster, but it can be.
====

This installation method is provided to make the installation experience easier
by xref:running-an-interactive-installation[interactively gathering the data]
needed to run on each host. The installer is a self-contained wrapper intended
for usage on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 system.

In addition to running xref:running-an-interactive-installation[interactive
installations] from scratch, the `atomic-openshift-installer` command can also
be run or re-run using a predefined installation configuration file. This file
can be used with the installer to:

- run an xref:running-an-unattended-installation[unattended installation],
- xref:../../install_config/adding_hosts_to_existing_cluster.adoc#adding-nodes-or-reinstalling-quick[add nodes] to an existing cluster,
- xref:../../upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[upgrade your cluster], or
- reinstall the {product-title} cluster completely.

[NOTE]
====
To install {product-title} as a stand-alone registry, see
xref:../../install_config/install/stand_alone_registry.adoc#install-config-installing-stand-alone-registry[Installing a Stand-alone Registry].
====

[[quick-before-you-begin]]

== Before You Begin

The installer allows you to install {product-title}
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master]
and
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[node]
components on a defined set of hosts.

[NOTE]
====
By default, any hosts you designate as masters during the installation process
are automatically also configured as nodes so that the masters are configured as
part of the
xref:../../architecture/networking/network_plugins.adoc#openshift-sdn[{product-title}
SDN].

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
See the {product-title} 3.9 Release Notes for information on the following related
notable technical changes:

- xref:../../release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.adoc#ocp-39-schedulable-masters[Masters Marked as Schedulable Nodes by Default]
- xref:../../release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.adoc#ocp-39-default-node-selector[Default Node Selector Set By Default and Automatic Node Labeling] 
endif::[]
====

Before installing {product-title}, you must first
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[satisfy the prerequisites]
on your hosts, which includes verifying system and environment requirements and
properly installing and configuring Docker. You must also be prepared to provide
or validate the following information for each of your targeted hosts during the
course of the installation:

- User name on the target host that should run the Ansible-based installation
(can be root or non-root)
- Host name
- Whether to install components for master, node, or both
- Whether to use the RPM or containerized method
- Internal and external IP addresses

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are installing {product-title} using the containerized method
(optional for RHEL but required for RHEL Atomic Host), see the
xref:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[Installing on
Containerized Hosts] topic to ensure that you understand the differences between these
methods, then return to this topic to continue.
====

After following the instructions in the
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[Prerequisites] topic and
deciding between the RPM and containerized methods, you can continue to running
an xref:running-an-interactive-installation[interactive] or
xref:running-an-unattended-installation[unattended] installation.

[[running-an-interactive-installation]]

== Running an Interactive Installation

[NOTE]
====
Ensure you have read through xref:quick-before-you-begin[Before You Begin].
====

You can start the interactive installation by running:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer install
----

Then follow the on-screen instructions to install a new {product-title} cluster.

After it has finished, ensure that you back up the
*_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_*
xref:defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] that is created, as it is required if you later want to re-run the
installation, add hosts to the cluster, or
xref:../../upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[upgrade your cluster]. Then,
xref:quick-verifying-the-installation[verify the installation].

[[defining-an-installation-configuration-file]]

== Defining an Installation Configuration File

The installer can use a predefined installation configuration file, which
contains information about your installation, individual hosts, and cluster.
When running an xref:running-an-interactive-installation[interactive
installation], an installation configuration file based on your answers is
created for you in *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_*. The file is
created if you are instructed to exit the installation to manually modify the
configuration or when the installation completes. You can also create the
configuration file manually from scratch to perform an
xref:running-an-unattended-installation[unattended installation].

----
<1> The version of this installation configuration file. As of {product-title} 3.3,
the only valid version here is `v2`.
<2> The {product-title} variant to install. For {product-title}, set this to
`openshift-enterprise`.
<3> A valid version of your selected variant: `3.9`, `3.7`, `3.6`, `3.5`, `3.4`, `3.3`,
`3.2`, or `3.1`. If not specified, this defaults to the latest version for the
specified variant.
<4> Defines where the Ansible logs are stored. By default, this is the
*_/tmp/ansible.log_* file.
<5> Defines which user Ansible uses to SSH in to remote systems for gathering
facts and for the installation. By default, this is the root user, but you can
set it to any user that has *sudo* privileges.
<6> Defines a list of the hosts onto which you want to install the {product-title}
master and node components.
<7> Required. Allows the installer to connect to the system and gather facts
before proceeding with the install.
<8> Required for unattended installations. If these details are not specified,
then this information is pulled from the facts gathered by the installer, and
you are asked to confirm the details. If undefined for an unattended
installation, the installation fails.
<9> Determines the type of services that are installed. Specified as a list.
<10> If set to *true*, containerized {product-title} services are run on target master
and node hosts instead of installed using RPM packages. If set to *false* or
unset, the default RPM method is used. RHEL Atomic Host requires the
containerized method, and is automatically selected for you based on the
detection of the *_/run/ostree-booted_* file. See
xref:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[Installing on
Containerized Hosts] for more details.
<11> The IP address that Ansible attempts to connect to when installing,
upgrading, or uninstalling the systems. If the configuration file was
auto-generated, then this is the value you first enter for the host during that
interactive install process.
<12> Node labels can optionally be set per-host.
<13> Defines a dictionary of roles across the deployment.
<14> Any ansible variables that should only be applied to hosts assigned a role can be defined.
For examples, see xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-ansible[Configuring Ansible].

[[running-an-unattended-installation]]

== Running an Unattended Installation

[NOTE]
====
Ensure you have read through the xref:quick-before-you-begin[Before You Begin].
====

Unattended installations allow you to define your hosts and cluster
configuration in an
xref:defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] before running the installer so that you do not have to go through all of
the xref:running-an-interactive-installation[interactive installation]
questions and answers. It also allows you to resume an interactive installation
you may have left unfinished, and quickly get back to where you left off.

To run an unattended installation, first define an
xref:defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] at *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_*. Then, run the installer with
the `-u` flag:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer -u install
----

By default in interactive or unattended mode, the installer uses the
configuration file located at *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* if the
file exists. If it does not exist, attempting to start an unattended
installation fails.

Alternatively, you can specify a different location for the configuration file
using the `-c` option, but doing so will require you to specify the file
location every time you run the installation:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer -u -c </path/to/file> install
----

After the unattended installation finishes, ensure that you back up the
*_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* file that was used, as it is required
if you later want to re-run the installation, add hosts to the cluster, or
xref:../../upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[upgrade your cluster]. Then,
xref:quick-verifying-the-installation[verify the installation].

[[quick-verifying-the-installation]]
== Verifying the Installation

include::install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc[tag=verifying-the-installation]

. Then, see xref:quick-install-whats-next[What's Next] for the next steps on
configuring your {product-title} cluster.

////
[[adding-nodes-or-reinstalling-quick]]
== Adding Nodes or Reinstalling the Cluster

You can use the installer to add nodes to your existing cluster, or to reinstall
the cluster entirely.

If you installed {product-title} using the installer in either
xref:running-an-interactive-installation[interactive] or
xref:running-an-unattended-installation[unattended] mode, you can re-run the
installation as long as you have an
xref:defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] at *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* (or specify a different
location with the `-c` option).

If you installed using the
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
method and therefore do not have an installation configuration file, you can
either try xref:defining-an-installation-configuration-file[creating your own]
based on your cluster's current configuration, or see the advanced installation
method on how to
xref:../../install_config/adding_hosts_to_existing_cluster.adoc#adding-nodes-advanced[run
the playbook for adding new nodes directly].

[IMPORTANT]
====
See the
xref:../../scaling_performance/cluster_limits.adoc#scaling-performance-cluster-limits[cluster
limits] section for the recommended maximum number of nodes.
====

To add nodes or reinstall the cluster:

. Re-run the installer with the `install` subcommand in interactive or
unattended mode:
+
----
$ atomic-openshift-installer [-u] [-c </path/to/file>] install
----

. The installer will detect your installed environment and allow you to either
add an additional node or perform a clean install:
+
====
----
Gathering information from hosts...
Installed environment detected.
By default the installer only adds new nodes to an installed environment.
Do you want to (1) only add additional nodes or (2) perform a clean install?:
----
====
+
Choose one of the options and follow the on-screen instructions to complete your
desired task.
////

[[uninstalling-quick]]
== Uninstalling {product-title}

You can uninstall {product-title} from all hosts in your cluster using the
installer's `uninstall` command. By default, the installer uses the installation
configuration file located at *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* if the
file exists:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer uninstall
----

Alternatively, you can specify a different location for the configuration file
using the `-c` option:

----
$ atomic-openshift-installer -c </path/to/file> uninstall
----

See the
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#uninstalling-advanced[advanced
installation method] for more options.
