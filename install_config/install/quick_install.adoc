== Overview
The _quick installation_ method allows you to use an interactive CLI utility to
install OpenShift across a set of hosts. The installation utility is provided to
make the trial experience easier by interactively gathering the data needed to
run the installation. The utility is a self-contained wrapper available at
https://install.openshift.com and is intended for usage on a Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7 host.

Alternatively, you can use the link:advanced_install.html[advanced installation]
method for production environments.

== Prerequisites

The installation utility allows you to install OpenShift
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master]
and
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#node[node]
hosts. By default, any hosts you designate as masters during the installation
process will also be configured as nodes that are marked
link:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html#marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[unschedulable].
This is so the masters are configured as part of the
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/networking.html#openshift-sdn[OpenShift
SDN].

Before installing OpenShift, you must first link:prerequisites.html[satisfy the
prerequisites] on your hosts, which includes verifying system and environment
requirements and properly installing and configuring Docker. After following the
instructions in the link:prerequisites.html[Prerequisites] topic, you can
continue to link:#installing-openshift[installing OpenShift].

. Run the installation utility directly from the Internet using the following
command on a host that has SSH access to your intended master and node hosts:
+
----
$ sh <(curl -s https://install.openshift.com/ose/)
----

. Follow the on-screen instructions to install a new OpenShift Enterprise
instance.

*Method 2: Downloading and Running the Installation Utility*

. Download and unpack the installation utility on a host that has SSH access to
your intended master and node hosts:
+
----
$ curl -o oo-install-ose.tgz \
    https://install.openshift.com/portable/oo-install-ose.tgz
$ tar -zxf oo-install-ose.tgz
----

. Execute the installation utility to interactively configure one or more hosts:
+
----
$ ./oo-install-ose
