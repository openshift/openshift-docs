[[install-config-about-ocr]]
== About OpenShift Container Registry

{product-title} is a fully-featured platform-as-a-service (PaaS) enterprise
solution that includes an integrated container registry called
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[OpenShift Container Registry] (OCR). Alternatively, instead of deploying {product-title}
as a full PaaS environment for developers, you can install OCR as a stand-alone
container registry to run on-premise or in the cloud.

When installing a stand-alone deployment of OCR, a cluster of masters and nodes
is still installed, similar to a typical {product-title} installation. Then, the
container registry is deployed to run on the cluster. This stand-alone
deployment option is useful for administrators that want a container registry,
but do not require the full {product-title} environment that includes the
developer-focused web console and application build and deployment tools.

OCR provides the following capabilities:

- A user-focused xref:../../install_config/registry/deploy_registry_existing_clusters.adoc#registry-console[registry web console].
- xref:../../install_config/registry/securing_and_exposing_registry.adoc#install-config-registry-securing-exposing[Secured traffic] by default, served via TLS.
- Global xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[identity provider authentication].
- A
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-projects-and-users[project namespace] model to enable teams to collaborate through
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[role-based access control (RBAC)] authorization.
- A xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-kubernetes-infrastructure[Kubernetes-based cluster] to manage services.
- An image abstraction called xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image streams] to enhance image management.

Administrators may want to deploy a stand-alone OCR to manage a registry
separately that supports multiple {product-title} clusters. A stand-alone OCR
also enables administrators to separate their registry to satisfy their own
security or compliance requirements.

[[registry-minimum-hardware-requirements]]
== Minimum Hardware Requirements

Installing a stand-alone OCR has the following hardware requirements:

- Physical or virtual system, or an instance running on a public or private IaaS.
- Base OS:
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Fedora 21, CentOS 7.4, or
endif::[]
RHEL 7.3 or 7.4 with the "Minimal" installation option and the latest packages from the
RHEL 7 Extras channel, or RHEL Atomic Host 7.4.5 or later.
- NetworkManager 1.0 or later
- 2 vCPU.
- Minimum 16 GB RAM.
- Minimum 15 GB hard disk space for the file system containing *_/var/_*.
- An additional minimum 15 GB unallocated space to be used for Docker's storage
back end; see xref:../../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#configuring-docker-storage[Configuring Docker Storage] for details.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} only supports servers with x86_64 architecture.
====

[NOTE]
====
Meeting the *_/var/_* file system sizing requirements in RHEL Atomic Host
requires making changes to the default configuration. See
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/getting-started-with-containers/#managing_storage_in_red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host[Managing
Storage in Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host] for instructions on configuring
this during or after installation.
====

[[registry-supported-system-topologies]]
== Supported System Topologies

The following system topologies are supported for stand-alone OCR:

[horizontal]
All-in-one::
A single host that includes the master, node, etcd, and registry components.
Multiple Masters (Highly-Available)::
Three hosts with all components included on each (master, node, etcd, and
registry), with the masters configured for native high-availability.

[[registry-host-preparation]]
== Host Preparation

Before installing stand-alone OCR, all of the same steps detailed in the
xref:../../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#install-config-install-host-preparation[Host Preparation] topic for installing a full {product-title} PaaS must be performed.
This includes registering and subscribing the host(s) to the proper
repositories, installing or updating certain packages, and setting up Docker and
its storage requirements.

Follow the steps in the
xref:../../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#install-config-install-host-preparation[Host Preparation] topic, then continue to
xref:registry-installation-methods[Stand-alone Registry Installation Methods].

[[registry-installation-methods]]
== Stand-alone Registry Installation Methods

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
To install a stand-alone registry, use either of the standard installation
methods (quick or advanced) used to install any variant of {product-title}.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
To install a stand-alone registry, use the advanced installation method.

[[registry-quick-installation]]
=== Quick Installation for Stand-alone OpenShift Container Registry

The following shows the step-by-step process for running the quick install tool to install an OpenShift Container Registry, instead of the full {product-title} install.

. Start the interactive installation:
+
----
$ atomic-openshift-installer install
----

. Follow the on-screen instructions to install a new registry. The installation questions will be largely the same as if you were installing a full {product-title} PaaS. When you reach the following screen, choose `2` to follow the registry installation path.:
+
----
Which variant would you like to install?


(1) OpenShift Container Platform
(2) Registry
----

. Specify the hosts that make up your cluster:
+
----
Enter hostname or IP address:
Will this host be an OpenShift master? [y/N]:
Will this host be RPM or Container based (rpm/container)? [rpm]:
----
+
See the xref:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[Installing on Containerized Hosts] topic for information about RPM versus containerized hosts.

. Change the cluster host name, if desired:
+
----
Enter hostname or IP address [None]:
----

. Choose the host to act as the storage host (the master host by default):
+
----
Enter hostname or IP address [master.host.example.com]:
----

. Change the default subdomain, if desired:
+
----
New default subdomain (ENTER for none) []:
----
+
[NOTE]
====
All certificates and routes are created with this subdomain. Ensure this is set to the correct desired subdomain to avoid having to change the configuration after installation.
====

. Specify a HTTP or HTTPS proxy, if needed:
+
----
Specify your http proxy ? (ENTER for none) []:
Specify your https proxy ? (ENTER for none) []:
----

After the previous has been entered, the next page summarizes your install and starts to gather the host information.

[NOTE]

[[registry-advanced-installation]]
=== Advanced Installation for Stand-alone OpenShift Container Registry

When using the advanced installation method to install stand-alone OCR,
use the same steps for installing a full {product-title} PaaS using Ansible
described in the full
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced Installation] topic. The main difference is that you must set
`deployment_subtype=registry` in the inventory file within the `[OSEv3:vars]`
section for the playbooks to follow the registry installation path.

See the following example inventory files for the different supported system
topologies:

.All-in-one Stand-alone OpenShift Container Registry Inventory File

----
<1> Set `deployment_subtype=registry` to ensure installation of stand-alone OCR and
not a full {product-title} environment.

After you have configured Ansible by defining an inventory file in
*_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, you can run the advanced installation using the
following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/deploy_cluster.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
For more detailed usage information on the advanced installation method,
including a comprehensive list of available Ansible variables, see the full
topic at
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced Installation].
