== Overview
OpenShift can build
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#docker-images[Docker
images] from your source code, deploy them, and manage their lifecycle. To
enable this, OpenShift provides an internal,
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[integrated
Docker registry] that can be deployed in your OpenShift environment to locally
manage images.

== Deploying the Registry

ifdef::atomic-registry[]
[NOTE]
====
Until an advanced installation method for {product-title} is tested and documented, refer to the
xref:../../registry_quickstart/administrators/index.adoc#registry-quickstart-administrators-index[quickstart install]
information.
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
To deploy the integrated Docker registry, use the `oadm registry` command from
the *_admin.kubeconfig_* file's location, as a user with cluster administrator
privileges:

----
$ oadm registry --config=admin.kubeconfig \//<1>
    --credentials=openshift-registry.kubeconfig <2>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
To deploy the integrated Docker registry, use the `oadm registry` command as a
user with cluster administrator privileges. For example:

----
$ oadm registry --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig \//<1>
    --credentials=/etc/origin/master/openshift-registry.kubeconfig \//<2>
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}' <3>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
<1> `--config` is the path to the
xref:../../cli_reference/manage_cli_profiles.adoc#cli-reference-manage-cli-profiles[CLI configuration file] for
the xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[cluster
administrator].
<2> `--credentials` is the path to the
xref:../../cli_reference/manage_cli_profiles.adoc#cli-reference-manage-cli-profiles[CLI configuration file] for
the *openshift-registry*.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
<3> Required to pull the correct image for OpenShift Enterprise.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
This creates a service and a deployment configuration, both called
*docker-registry*. Once deployed successfully, a pod is created with a name
similar to *docker-registry-1-cpty9*.

Use `--selector` to deploy the registry to any node(s) that match a specified node label:

----
$ oadm registry <registry_name> --replicas=<number> --selector=<label> \
    --service-account=registry
----

For example, if you want to create a registry named `registry` and have it placed on
a node labeled with `region=infra`:

----
$ oadm registry registry --replicas=1 --selector='region=infra' \
  --service-account=registry
----

To see a full list of options that you can specify when creating the registry:

----
$ oadm registry --help
----
endif::[]

[[storage-for-the-registry]]
=== Storage for the Registry

The registry stores Docker images and metadata. If you simply deploy a pod with
the registry, it uses an ephemeral volume that is destroyed if the pod exits.
Any images anyone has built or pushed into the registry would disappear.

ifdef::atomic-registry[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Be careful when re-deploying the registry if the
xref:../../registry_quickstart/administrators/index.adoc#registry-quickstart-administrators-index[quickstart method] was
used. The quickstart method maps the registry service to host ports. This mapping must be updated when the registry is
re-deployed.

----
$ oc patch service docker-registry -p \
     '{ "spec": { "type": "NodePort", "selector": {"docker-registry": "default"},
        "ports": [ {"nodePort": 5000, "port": 5000, "targetPort": 5000}] }}'
----
====
endif::[]

[[registry-production-use]]
==== Production Use

For production use, attach a remote volume or
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[define and use the
persistent storage method of your choice].

For example, to use an existing persistent volume claim:

----
$ oc volume deploymentconfigs/docker-registry --add --name=registry-storage -t pvc \
     --claim-name=<pvc_name> --overwrite
----

Or, to attach an existing NFS volume to the registry:

----
$ oc volume deploymentconfigs/docker-registry \
     --add --overwrite --name=registry-storage --mount-path=/registry \
     --source='{"nfs": { "server": "<fqdn>", "path": "/path/to/export"}}'
----

[NOTE]
====
See xref:registry-known-issues[Known Issues] if using a scaled registry with a
shared NFS volume.
====

[[registry-non-production-use]]
==== Non-Production Use

For non-production use, you can use the `--mount-host=<path>` option to specify
a directory for the registry to use for persistent storage. The registry volume
is then created as a host-mount at the specified `<path>`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `--mount-host` option mounts a directory from the node on which the registry
container lives. If you scale up the *docker-registry* deployment configuration,
it is possible that your registry pods and containers will run on different
nodes, which can result in two or more registry containers, each with its own
local storage. This will lead to unpredictable behavior, as subsequent requests
to pull the same image repeatedly may not always succeed, depending on which
container the request ultimately goes to.
====

The `--mount-host` option requires that the registry container run in privileged
mode. This is automatically enabled when you specify `--mount-host`.
However, not all pods are allowed to run
xref:prerequisites.adoc#security-warning[privileged containers] by default.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you still want to use this option, create the registry and specify that it use the *registry* service account that was created during installation:
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
If you still want to use this option:

. Create a new xref:../../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service account] in
the *default* project for the registry to run as. The following example creates
a service account named *registry*:
+
----
$ echo \
    '{"kind":"ServiceAccount","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"registry"}}' \
    | oc create -n default -f -
----

. To add the new *registry* service account to the list of users allowed to run
privileged containers:
+
----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged registry
----

. Create the registry and specify that it use the new *registry* service
account:
+
----
$ oadm registry --service-account=registry \
    --config=admin.kubeconfig \
    --credentials=openshift-registry.kubeconfig \
    --mount-host=<path>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm registry --service-account=registry \
    --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig \
    --credentials=/etc/origin/master/openshift-registry.kubeconfig \
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}' \
    --mount-host=<path>
----
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Docker registry pod runs as user *1001*. This user must be able to write to
the host directory. You may need to change directory ownership to user ID *1001*
with this command:

----
$ sudo chown 1001:root <path>
----
====



[[maintaining-the-registry-ip-address]]
=== Maintaining the Registry IP Address

OpenShift refers to the integrated registry by its service IP address,
so if you decide to delete and recreate the *docker-registry* service,
you can ensure a completely transparent transition by arranging to
re-use the old IP address in the new service.
If a new IP address cannot be avoided, you can minimize cluster
disruption by rebooting only the masters.

[[re-using-the-address]]
Re-using the Address::

To re-use the IP address, you must save the IP address of the old *docker-registry*
service prior to deleting it, and arrange to replace the newly assigned IP address
with the saved one in the new *docker-registry* service.

// NB: Snarfed from <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/issues/1494>.
. Make a note of the `ClusterIP` for the service:
+
----
$ oc get svc/docker-registry -o yaml | grep clusterIP:
----

. Delete the service:
+
----
$ oc delete svc/docker-registry dc/docker-registry
----

. Create the registry definition in *_registry.yaml_*, replacing `<options>`
with, for example, those used in step 3 of the instructions in the
xref:registry-non-production-use[Non-Production Use] section:
+
----
$ oadm registry <options> -o yaml > registry.yaml
----

. Edit *_registry.yaml_*, find the `Service` there,
and change its `ClusterIP` to the address noted in step 1.

. Create the registry using the modified *_registry.yaml_*:
+
----
$ oc create -f registry.yaml
----

[[rebooting-the-masters]]
Rebooting the Masters::

If you are unable to re-use the IP address, any operation that uses a xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#referencing-images-in-image-streams[pull specification]
that includes the old IP address will fail.
To minimize cluster disruption, you must reboot the masters:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# systemctl restart origin-master
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
endif::[]
----
// Code block snarfed from ../http_proxies.adoc, w/ node-reboot stuff removed.
// tnguyen opines: It would be nice to #define this somewhere and include it here...
+
This ensures that the old registry URL, which includes the old IP address,
is cleared from the cache.
+
[NOTE]
We recommend against rebooting the entire cluster because that incurs
unnecessary downtime for pods and does not actually clear the cache.

[[viewing-logs]]
== Viewing Logs

To view the logs for the Docker registry, run the `oc logs` indicating the desired pod:

====
----
$ oc logs docker-registry-1-da73t

[[file-storage]]

== File Storage

Tag and image metadata is stored in OpenShift, but the registry stores layer and
signature data in a volume that is mounted into the registry container at
*_/registry_*. As `oc exec` does not work on privileged containers, to view a
registry's contents you must manually SSH into the node housing the registry
pod's container, then run `docker exec` on the container itself:

. List the current pods to find the pod name of your Docker registry:
+
----
# oc get pods
----
+
Then, use `oc describe` to find the host name for the node running the
container:
+
----
# oc describe pod <pod_name>
----

. Log into the desired node:
+
----
# ssh node.example.com
----

. List the running containers on the node host and identify the container ID for
the Docker registry:
+
----
# docker ps | grep ose-docker-registry
----

. List the registry contents using the `docker exec` command:
+
====
----

[[access]]
== Accessing the Registry Directly
For advanced usage, you can access the registry directly to invoke `docker`
commands. This allows you to push images to or pull them from the integrated
registry directly using operations like `docker push` or `docker pull`. To do
so, you must be logged in to the registry using the `docker login` command. The
operations you can perform depend on your user permissions, as described in the
following sections.

[[access-user-prerequisites]]
=== User Prerequisites
To access the registry directly, the user that you use must satisfy the
following, depending on your intended usage:

- For any direct access, you must have a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#users[regular
user], if one does not already exist, for your
preferred xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[identity
provider]. A regular user can generate an access token required for logging in to
the registry.
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#users[System
users], such as *system:admin*, cannot obtain access tokens and, therefore,
cannot access the registry directly.
+
For example, if you are using `HTPASSWD` authentication, you can create one
using the following command:
+
----
# htpasswd /etc/origin/openshift-htpasswd <user_name>
----

- The user must have the *system:registry* role. To add this role:
+
----
# oadm policy add-role-to-user system:registry <user_name>
----

- Have the *admin* role for the project associated with the Docker operation. For
example, if accessing images in the global *openshift* project:
+
----
 $ oadm policy add-role-to-user admin <user_name> -n openshift
----

- For writing or pushing images, for example when using the `docker push` command,
the user must have the *system:image-builder* role. To add this role:
+
----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user system:image-builder <user_name>
----

For more information on user permissions, see
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.adoc#managing-role-bindings[Managing
Role Bindings].

[[access-logging-in-to-the-registry]]
=== Logging in to the Registry

[NOTE]
====
Ensure your user satisfies the xref:access-user-prerequisites[prerequisites]
for accessing the registry directly.
====

To log in to the registry directly:

. Ensure you are logged in to OpenShift as a *regular user*:
+
----
$ oc login
----

. Get your access token:
+
----
$ oc whoami -t
----

. Log in to the Docker registry:
+
----
$ docker login -u <username> -e <any_email_address> \
    -p <token_value> <registry_ip>:<port>
----

[[access-pushing-and-pulling-images]]
=== Pushing and Pulling Images
After xref:access-logging-in-to-the-registry[logging in to the registry], you
can perform `docker pull` and `docker push` operations against your registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can pull arbitrary images, but if you have the *system:registry* role
added, you can only push images to the registry in your project.
====

In the following examples, we use:
|====

|Component |Value

|*<registry_ip>*
|`172.30.124.220`

|*<port>*
|`5000`

|*<project>*
|`openshift`

|*<image>*
|`busybox`

|*<tag>*
| omitted (defaults to `latest`)

|====

. Pull an arbitrary image:
+
====
----
$ docker pull docker.io/busybox
----
====

. Tag the new image with the form `<registry_ip>:<port>/<project>/<image>`.
The project name *must* appear in this
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#referencing-images-in-image-streams[pull specification]
for OpenShift to
correctly place and later access the image in the registry.
+
====
----
$ docker tag docker.io/busybox 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Your regular user must have the *system:image-builder* role for the specified
project, which allows the user to write or push an image. Otherwise, the `docker
push` in the next step will fail. To test, you can
xref:../../dev_guide/projects.adoc#create-a-project[create a new project] to
push the *busybox* image.
====

. Push the newly-tagged image to your registry:
+
====
----
$ docker push 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
...
cf2616975b4a: Image successfully pushed
Digest: sha256:3662dd821983bc4326bee12caec61367e7fb6f6a3ee547cbaff98f77403cab55

[[securing-the-registry]]
== Securing the Registry

Optionally, you can secure the registry so that it serves traffic via TLS:

. xref:deploy-registry[Deploy the registry].
+
endif::[]
. Fetch the service IP and port of the registry:

[IMPORTANT]
====
If {product-title} was deployed using the xref:../../registry_quickstart/administrators/index.adoc#registry-quickstart-administrators-index[quickstart method]
use the system hostname or IP address.

+
----
$ oadm ca create-server-cert \
    --signer-cert=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \

    --cert=/etc/secrets/registry.crt \
    --key=/etc/secrets/registry.key
----
+
. Create the secret for the registry certificates:
+
----
$ oc secrets new registry-secret \
    /etc/secrets/registry.crt \
    /etc/secrets/registry.key
----
+
. Add the secret to the registry pod's service accounts (including the *default*
service account):
+
----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccounts/registry secrets/registry-secret
$ oc secrets add serviceaccounts/default  secrets/registry-secret
----
+
. Add the secret volume to the registry deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc volume dc/docker-registry --add --type=secret \
    --secret-name=registry-secret -m /etc/secrets
----
+
. Enable TLS by adding the following environment variables to the registry
deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc env dc/docker-registry \
    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/etc/secrets/registry.crt \
    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/etc/secrets/registry.key
----
+
See more details on
https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#override-configuration-options[overriding
registry options].

. Update the scheme used for the registry's liveness probe from HTTP to HTTPS:
+
----
$ oc patch dc/docker-registry --api-version=v1 -p '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"containers":[{
    "name":"registry",
    "livenessProbe":  {"httpGet": {"scheme":"HTTPS"}}
  }]}}}}'
----

. Validate the registry is running in TLS mode. Wait until the *docker-registry*
pod status changes to `Running` and verify the Docker logs for the registry
container. You should find an entry for `listening on :5000, tls`.
+
====

[[advanced-overriding-the-registry-configuration]]
== Advanced: Overriding the Registry Configuration

You can override the integrated registry's default configuration, found by
default at *_/config.yml_* in a running registry's container, with your own
custom configuration. See the upstream registry documentation's
https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/[Registry Configuration
Reference] for the full list of available options.

To enable managing the registry configuration file directly, it
is recommended that the configuration file be mounted as a
xref:../../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secret volume]:

. xref:deploy-registry[Deploy the registry].

. Edit the registry configuration file locally as needed. The initial YAML file
deployed on the registry is provided below:
+
====
----
version: 0.1
log:
  level: debug
http:
  addr: :5000
storage:
  cache:
    layerinfo: inmemory
  filesystem:
    rootdirectory: /registry
  delete:
    enabled: true
auth:
  openshift:
    realm: openshift
middleware:
  repository:
    - name: openshift
      options:
        pullthrough: true
----
====
+
See https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/[Registry Configuration
Reference] for more options.

. Create a new secret called *registry-config* from your custom registry
configuration file you edited locally:
+
----
$ oc secrets new registry-config config.yml=</path/to/custom/registry/config.yml>
----

. Add the *registry-config* secret as a volume to the registry's deployment
configuration to mount the custom configuration file at
*_/etc/docker/registry/_*:
+
----
$ oc volume dc/docker-registry --add --type=secret \
    --secret-name=registry-config -m /etc/docker/registry/
----
+
. Update the registry to reference the configuration path from the previous step
by adding the following environment variable to the registry's deployment
configuration:
+
----
$ oc env dc/docker-registry \
    REGISTRY_CONFIGURATION_PATH=/etc/docker/registry/config.yml
----

This may be performed as an iterative process to achieve the desired
configuration. For example, during troubleshooting, the configuration may be
temporarily updated to put it in *debug* mode.

To update an existing configuration:

[WARNING]
====
This procedure will overwrite the currently deployed registry configuration.
====

. Edit the local registry configuration file, *_config.yml_*.

. Delete the *registry-config* secret:
+
----
$ oc delete secret registry-config
----
+
. Recreate the secret to reference the updated configuration file the first
step:
+
----
$ oc secrets new registry-config config.yml=</path/to/custom/registry/config.yml>
----
+
. Redeploy the registry to read the updated configuration:
+
----
$ oc deploy docker-registry --latest
----

[TIP]
====
It is recommended that configuration files be maintained in a source control
repository.
====

[[whitelisting-docker-registries]]
== Whitelisting Docker Registries

You can specify a whitelist of docker registries, allowing you to curate a set
of images and templates that are available for download by OpenShift users. This
curated set can be placed in one or more docker registries, and then added to
the whitelist. When using a whitelist, only the specified registries are
accessible within OpenShift, and all other registries are denied access by
default.

To configure a whitelist:

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file to block all registries:
+
----
BLOCK_REGISTRY='--block-registry=all'
----
+
You may need to uncomment the `*BLOCK_REGISTRY*` line.
. In the same file, add registries to which you want to allow access:
+
----
ADD_REGISTRY='--add-registry=<registry1> --add-registry=<registry2>'
----
+
.Allowing Access to Registries
====
----
ADD_REGISTRY='--add-registry=registry.access.redhat.com'
----
====
+
This example would restrict access to images available on the
link:https://access.redhat.com/search/#/container-images[Red Hat Customer Portal].

Once the whitelist is configured, if a user tries to pull from a docker registry
that is not on the whitelist, they will receive an error message stating that
this registry is not allowed.

[[exposing-the-registry]]
== Exposing the Registry

To expose your internal registry externally, it is recommended that you run a
xref:securing-the-registry[secure registry]. To expose the registry you must
first have xref:deploy_router.adoc#install-config-install-deploy-router[deployed a router].

. xref:deploy-registry[Deploy the registry].
+
. xref:securing-the-registry[Secure the registry].
+
. xref:deploy_router.adoc#install-config-install-deploy-router[Deploy a router].
+
. Create your
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#passthrough-termination[passthrough]
route with `oc create -f <filename>.json`.  The passthrough route will point to
the registry service that you have created.
+
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: registry
spec:
  host: <host> <1>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: docker-registry <2>
  tls:
    termination: passthrough <3>
----
<1> The host for your route.  You must be able to resolve this name externally via DNS to the router's IP address.
<2> The service name for your registry.
<3> Specify this route as a passthrough route.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Passthrough is currently the only type of route supported for exposing the
secure registry.
====
+
. Next, you must trust the certificates being used for the registry on your host system.
The certificates referenced were created when you secured your registry.
+
====
----
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/<host>
$ sudo cp <ca certificate file> /etc/docker/certs.d/<host>
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
----
====
+

. xref:access[Log in to the registry] using the information from securing the
registry. However, this time point to the host name used in the route rather
than your service IP. You should now be able to tag and push images using the
route host.
+

Your image streams will have the IP address and port of the registry service,
not the route name and port. See `oc get imagestreams` for details.

[NOTE]
====
In the `<host>/test/busybox` example above, `test` refers to the project name.

[[registry-known-issues]]
== Known Issues

The following are the known issues when deploying or using the integrated
registry.

*Image Push Errors with Scaled Registry Using Shared NFS Volume*

When using a scaled registry with a shared NFS volume, you may see one of the
following errors during the push of an image:

- `digest invalid: provided digest did not match uploaded content`
- `blob upload unknown`
- `blob upload invalid`

These errors are returned by an internal registry service when Docker attempts
to push the image. Its cause originates in the synchronization of file
attributes across nodes. Factors such as NFS client side caching, network
latency, and layer size can all contribute to potential errors that might occur
when pushing an image using the default round-robin load balancing
configuration.

You can perform the following steps to minimize the probability of such a
failure:

. Ensure that the `*sessionAffinity*` of your *docker-registry* service is set
to `ClientIP`:
+
----
$ oc get svc/docker-registry --template='{{.spec.sessionAffinity}}'
----
+
This should return `ClientIP`, which is the default in recent {product-title}
versions. If not, change it:
+
----
$ oc get -o yaml svc/docker-registry | \
      sed 's/\(sessionAffinity:\s*\).*/\1ClientIP/' | \
      oc replace -f -
----
+
. Ensure that the NFS export line of your registry volume on your NFS server has
the `no_wdelay` options listed. See
xref:../persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.adoc#nfs-export-settings[Export
Settings] in the
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-nfs[Persistent
Storage Using NFS] topic for details.
