== Overview
OpenShift can build
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.html#docker-images[Docker
images] from your source code, deploy them, and manage their lifecycle. To
enable this, OpenShift provides an internal,
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html#integrated-openshift-registry[integrated
Docker registry] that can be deployed in your OpenShift environment to locally
manage images.

[[deploy-registry]]
== Deploying the Registry

ifdef::atomic-registry[]
[NOTE]
====
Until an advanced installation method for {product-title} is tested and documented, refer to the
link:../../registry_quickstart/administrators/index.html[quickstart install]
information.
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
To deploy the integrated Docker registry, use the `oadm registry` command from
the *_admin.kubeconfig_* file's location, as a user with cluster administrator
privileges:

----
$ oadm registry --config=admin.kubeconfig \//<1>
    --credentials=openshift-registry.kubeconfig <2>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
To deploy the integrated Docker registry, use the `oadm registry` command as a
user with cluster administrator privileges. For example:

----
$ oadm registry --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig \//<1>
    --credentials=/etc/origin/master/openshift-registry.kubeconfig \//<2>
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}' <3>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
<1> `--config` is the path to the
link:../../cli_reference/manage_cli_profiles.html[CLI configuration file] for
the link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[cluster
administrator].
<2> `--credentials` is the path to the
link:../../cli_reference/manage_cli_profiles.html[CLI configuration file] for
the *openshift-registry*.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
<3> Required to pull the correct image for OpenShift Enterprise.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
This creates a service and a deployment configuration, both called
*docker-registry*. Once deployed successfully, a pod is created with a name
similar to *docker-registry-1-cpty9*.

To see a full list of options that you can specify when creating the registry:

----
$ oadm registry --help
----
endif::[]

[[storage-for-the-registry]]
=== Storage for the Registry

The registry stores Docker images and metadata. If you simply deploy a pod with
the registry, it uses an ephemeral volume that is destroyed if the pod exits.
Any images anyone has built or pushed into the registry would disappear.

ifdef::atomic-registry[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Be careful when re-deploying the registry if the
link:../../registry_quickstart/administrators/index.html[quickstart method] was
used. The quickstart method maps the registry service to host ports. This mapping must be updated when the registry is
re-deployed.

----
$ oc patch service docker-registry -p \
     '{ "spec": { "type": "NodePort", "selector": {"docker-registry": "default"},
        "ports": [ {"nodePort": 5000, "port": 5000, "targetPort": 5000}] }}'
----
====
endif::[]

==== Production Use

For production use, attach a remote volume or
link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/index.html[define and use the
persistent storage method of your choice].

For example, to use an existing persistent volume claim:
----
$ oc volume deploymentconfigs/docker-registry --add --name=v1 -t pvc \
     --claim-name=<pvc_name> --overwrite
----

Or, to attach an existing NFS volume to the registry:

----
$ oc volume deploymentconfigs/docker-registry \
     --add --overwrite --name=registry-storage --mount-path=/registry \
     --source='{"nfs": { "server": "<fqdn>", "path": "/path/to/export"}}'
----

[[session-affinity-workaround]]
There are link:#registry-known-issues[known issues] when using multiple registry
replicas with the same NFS volume. We recommend changing the docker-registry
service's `*sessionAffinity*` to *ClientIP*:

----
$ oc get -o yaml svc docker-registry | \
      sed 's/\(sessionAffinity:\s*\).*/\1ClientIP/' | \
      oc replace -f -
----

[[non-production-use]]
==== Non-Production use

For non-production use, you can use the `--mount-host=<path>` option to specify
a directory for the registry to use for persistent storage. The registry volume
is then created as a host-mount at the specified `<path>`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `--mount-host` option mounts a directory from the node on which the registry
container lives. If you scale up the *docker-registry* deployment configuration,
it is possible that your registry pods and containers will run on different
nodes, which can result in two or more registry containers, each with its own
local storage. This will lead to unpredictable behavior, as subsequent requests
to pull the same image repeatedly may not always succeed, depending on which
container the request ultimately goes to.
====

The `--mount-host` option requires that the registry container run in privileged
mode. This is automatically enabled when you specify `--mount-host`.
However, not all pods are allowed to run
link:prerequisites.html#security-warning[privileged containers] by default.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you still want to use this option, create the registry and specify that it use the *registry* service account that was created during installation:
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
If you still want to use this option:

. Create a new link:../../admin_guide/service_accounts.html[service account] in
the *default* project for the registry to run as. The following example creates
a service account named *registry*:
+
----
$ oc create serviceaccount registry -n default
----

. To add the new *registry* service account in the *default* namespace
to the list of users allowed to run privileged containers:
+
----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:default:registry
----

. Create the registry and specify that it use the new *registry* service
account:
+
----
$ oadm registry --service-account=registry \
    --config=admin.kubeconfig \
    --credentials=openshift-registry.kubeconfig \
    --mount-host=<path>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm registry --service-account=registry \
    --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig \
    --credentials=/etc/origin/master/openshift-registry.kubeconfig \
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}' \
    --mount-host=<path>
----
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Docker registry pod runs as user *1001*. This user must be able to write to
the host directory. You may need to change directory ownership to user ID *1001*
with this command:

----
$ sudo chown 1001:root <path>
----
====

==== Setting Storage Quota
To protect the storage from being accidentally filled up or to prevent users
from abusing the space, you may set size constraints on images, image streams,
and projects.

link:../../dev_guide/quota.html#create-a-quota[Create a quota object] on a
particular namespace with one or more of the following resources:

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===
|Resource|Purpose
|`openshift.io/imagesize`
|To constrain the maximum size of an image

|`openshift.io/imagestreamsize`
|To limit an image's total size when tagged in an image stream (also known as a
repository)

|`openshift.io/projectimagessize`
|To limit the total combined size of all images per project

|===

Once the quota is exceeded, an image push will fail with:

----
Failed to push image: unknown: requested access to the resource is denied
----

Then, you can link:../../admin_guide/pruning_resources.html#pruning-images[prune obsoleted images] to retrieve some space back.


[[maintaining-the-registry-ip-address]]
=== Maintaining the Registry IP Address

OpenShift refers to the integrated registry by its service IP address,
so if you decide to delete and recreate the *docker-registry* service,
you can ensure a completely transparent transition by arranging to
re-use the old IP address in the new service.
If a new IP address cannot be avoided, you can minimize cluster
disruption by rebooting only the masters.

[[re-using-the-address]]
Re-using the Address::

To re-use the IP address, you must save the IP address of the old *docker-registry*
service prior to deleting it, and arrange to replace the newly assigned IP address
with the saved one in the new *docker-registry* service.

// NB: Snarfed from <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/issues/1494>.
. Make a note of the `ClusterIP` for the service:
+
----
$ oc get svc/docker-registry -o yaml | grep clusterIP:
----

. Delete the service:
+
----
$ oc delete svc/docker-registry dc/docker-registry
----

. Create the registry definition in *_registry.yaml_*,
replacing `<options>` with, for example, those used in step 3 of the
instructions in the link:#non-production-use[Non-Production use] section:
+
----
$ oadm registry <options> -o yaml > registry.yaml
----

. Edit *_registry.yaml_*, find the `Service` there,
and change its `ClusterIP` to the address noted in step 1.

. Create the registry using the modified *_registry.yaml_*:
+
----
$ oc create -f registry.yaml
----

[[rebooting-the-masters]]
Rebooting the Masters::

If you are unable to re-use the IP address, any operation that uses a link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#referencing-images-in-image-streams[pull specification]
that includes the old IP address will fail.
To minimize cluster disruption, you must reboot the masters:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# systemctl restart origin-master
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
endif::[]
----
// Code block snarfed from ../http_proxies.adoc, w/ node-reboot stuff removed.
// tnguyen opines: It would be nice to #define this somewhere and include it here...
+
This ensures that the old registry URL, which includes the old IP address,
is cleared from the cache.
+
[NOTE]
We recommend against rebooting the entire cluster because that incurs
unnecessary downtime for pods and does not actually clear the cache.

[[viewing-logs]]
== Viewing Logs

To view the logs for the Docker registry, use the `oc logs` command with the deployment config:

====
----
$ oc logs dc/docker-registry

----
====

[[file-storage]]

== File Storage

Tag and image metadata is stored in OpenShift, but the registry stores layer and
signature data in a volume that is mounted into the registry container at
*_/registry_*. As `oc exec` does not work on privileged containers, to view a
registry's contents you must manually SSH into the node housing the registry
pod's container, then run `docker exec` on the container itself:

. List the current pods to find the pod name of your Docker registry:
+
----
# oc get pods
----
+
Then, use `oc describe` to find the host name for the node running the
container:
+
----
# oc describe pod <pod_name>
----

. Log into the desired node:
+
----
# ssh node.example.com
----

. List the running containers on the node host and identify the container ID for
the Docker registry:
+
----
# docker ps | grep ose-docker-registry
----

. List the registry contents using the `docker exec` command:
+
====
----

[[access]]
== Accessing the Registry Directly
For advanced usage, you can access the registry directly to invoke `docker`
commands. This allows you to push images to or pull them from the integrated
registry directly using operations like `docker push` or `docker pull`. To do
so, you must be logged in to the registry using the `docker login` command. The
operations you can perform depend on your user permissions, as described in the
following sections.

[[access-user-prerequisites]]
=== User Prerequisites
To access the registry directly, the user that you use must satisfy the
following, depending on your intended usage:

- For any direct access, you must have a
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#users[regular
user], if one does not already exist, for your
preferred link:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.html[identity
provider]. A regular user can generate an access token required for logging in to
the registry.
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#users[System
users], such as *system:admin*, cannot obtain access tokens and, therefore,
cannot access the registry directly.
+
For example, if you are using `HTPASSWD` authentication, you can create one
using the following command:
+
----
# htpasswd /etc/origin/openshift-htpasswd <user_name>
----

- The user must have the *system:registry* role. To add this role:
+
----
# oadm policy add-role-to-user system:registry <user_name>
----

- Have the *admin* role for the project associated with the Docker operation. For
example, if accessing images in the global *openshift* project:
+
----
 $ oadm policy add-role-to-user admin <user_name> -n openshift
----

- For writing or pushing images, for example when using the `docker push` command,
the user must have the *system:image-builder* role. To add this role:
+
----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user system:image-builder <user_name>
----

For more information on user permissions, see
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#managing-role-bindings[Managing
Role Bindings].

[[access-logging-in-to-the-registry]]
=== Logging in to the Registry

[NOTE]
====
Ensure your user satisfies the link:#access-user-prerequisites[prerequisites]
for accessing the registry directly.
====

To log in to the registry directly:

. Ensure you are logged in to OpenShift as a *regular user*:
+
----
$ oc login
----

. Get your access token:
+
----
$ oc whoami -t
----

. Log in to the Docker registry:
+
----
$ docker login -u <username> -e <any_email_address> \
    -p <token_value> <registry_ip>:<port>
----

[[access-pushing-and-pulling-images]]
=== Pushing and Pulling Images
After link:#access-logging-in-to-the-registry[logging in to the registry], you
can perform `docker pull` and `docker push` operations against your registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can pull arbitrary images, but if you have the *system:registry* role
added, you can only push images to the registry in your project.
====

In the following examples, we use:
|====

|Component |Value

|*<registry_ip>*
|`172.30.124.220`

|*<port>*
|`5000`

|*<project>*
|`openshift`

|*<image>*
|`busybox`

|*<tag>*
| omitted (defaults to `latest`)

|====

. Pull an arbitrary image:
+
====
----
$ docker pull docker.io/busybox
----
====

. Tag the new image with the form `<registry_ip>:<port>/<project>/<image>`.
The project name *must* appear in this
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#referencing-images-in-image-streams[pull specification]
for OpenShift to
correctly place and later access the image in the registry.
+
====
----
$ docker tag docker.io/busybox 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Your regular user must have the *system:image-builder* role for the specified
project, which allows the user to write or push an image. Otherwise, the `docker
push` in the next step will fail. To test, you can
link:../../dev_guide/projects.html#create-a-project[create a new project] to
push the *busybox* image.
====

. Push the newly-tagged image to your registry:
+
====
----
$ docker push 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
...
cf2616975b4a: Image successfully pushed
Digest: sha256:3662dd821983bc4326bee12caec61367e7fb6f6a3ee547cbaff98f77403cab55
----
====

== Securing the Registry

Optionally, you can secure the registry so that it serves traffic via TLS:

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
. link:#deploy-registry[Deploy the registry].
+
endif::[]
. Fetch the service IP and port of the registry:
+
ifdef::atomic-registry[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If {product-title} was deployed using the link:../../registry_quickstart/administrators/index.html[quickstart method]
use the system hostname or IP address.
====
+
endif::[]
====
----
$ oc get svc/docker-registry
NAME              LABELS                                    SELECTOR                  IP(S)            PORT(S)
docker-registry   docker-registry=default                   docker-registry=default   172.30.124.220   5000/TCP
----
====
+
. You can use an existing server certificate, or create a key and server
certificate valid for specified IPs and host names, signed by a specified CA. To
create a server certificate for the registry service IP and the
*docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local* host name:
+
----
$ oadm ca create-server-cert --signer-cert=ca.crt \
    --signer-key=ca.key --signer-serial=ca.serial.txt \
    --hostnames='docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local,172.30.124.220' \
    --cert=registry.crt --key=registry.key
----
+
. Create the secret for the registry certificates:
+
----
$ oc secrets new registry-secret registry.crt registry.key
----
+
. Add the secret to the registry pod's service account (i.e., the *default*
service account):
+
----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccounts/default secrets/registry-secret
----
+
. Add the secret volume to the registry deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc volume dc/docker-registry --add --type=secret \
    --secret-name=registry-secret -m /etc/secrets
----
+
. Enable TLS by adding the following environment variables to the registry
deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc env dc/docker-registry \
    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/etc/secrets/registry.crt \
    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/etc/secrets/registry.key
----
+
See more details on
https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#override-configuration-options[overriding
registry options].

. Update the scheme used for the registry's liveness probe from HTTP to HTTPS:
+
----
$ oc patch dc/docker-registry --api-version=v1 -p '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"containers":[{
    "name":"registry",
    "livenessProbe":  {"httpGet": {"scheme":"HTTPS"}}
  }]}}}}'
----

. If your registry was initially deployed on {product-title}
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.2
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.1.2
endif::[]
or later, update the scheme used for the registry's readiness probe from HTTP to HTTPS:
+

. Validate the registry is running in TLS mode. Wait until the latest *docker-registry*
deployment completes and verify the Docker logs for the registry container. You should
find an entry for `listening on :5000, tls`.

. Remove the `--insecure-registry` option only for this particular registry in
the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file. Then, reload the daemon and restart the
*docker* service to reflect this configuration change:

. Validate the `docker` client connection. Running
https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/push/[`docker push`]
to the registry or
https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/pull/[`docker pull`] from the registry should succeed.  Make sure you have

[[advanced-overriding-the-registry-configuration]]
== Advanced: Overriding the Registry Configuration

You can override the integrated registry's default configuration, found by
default at *_/config.yml_* in a running registry's container, with your own
custom configuration. See the upstream registry documentation's
https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/[Registry Configuration
Reference] for the full list of available options.

To enable managing the registry configuration file directly, it
is recommended that the configuration file be mounted as a
link:../../dev_guide/secrets.html[secret volume]:

. link:#deploy-registry[Deploy the registry].

. Edit the registry configuration file locally as needed. The initial YAML file
deployed on the registry is provided below:
+
====
----
version: 0.1
log:
  level: debug
http:
  addr: :5000
storage:
  cache:
    layerinfo: inmemory
  filesystem:
    rootdirectory: /registry
  delete:
    enabled: true
auth:
  openshift:
    realm: openshift
middleware:
  repository:
    - name: openshift
      options:
        pullthrough: true
----
====
+
See https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/[Registry Configuration
Reference] for more options.

. Create a new secret called *registry-config* from your custom registry
configuration file you edited locally:
+
----
$ oc secrets new registry-config config.yml=</path/to/custom/registry/config.yml>
----

. Add the *registry-config* secret as a volume to the registry's deployment
configuration to mount the custom configuration file at
*_/etc/docker/registry/_*:
+
----
$ oc volume dc/docker-registry --add --type=secret \
    --secret-name=registry-config -m /etc/docker/registry/
----
+
. Update the registry to reference the configuration path from the previous step
by adding the following environment variable to the registry's deployment
configuration:
+
----
$ oc env dc/docker-registry \
    REGISTRY_CONFIGURATION_PATH=/etc/docker/registry/config.yml
----

This may be performed as an iterative process to achieve the desired
configuration. For example, during troubleshooting, the configuration may be
temporarily updated to put it in *debug* mode.

To update an existing configuration:

[WARNING]
====
This procedure will overwrite the currently deployed registry configuration.
====

. Edit the local registry configuration file, *_config.yml_*.

. Delete the *registry-config* secret:
+
----
$ oc delete secret registry-config
----
+
. Recreate the secret to reference the updated configuration file the first
step:
+
----
$ oc secrets new registry-config config.yml=</path/to/custom/registry/config.yml>
----
+
. Redeploy the registry to read the updated configuration:
+
----
$ oc deploy docker-registry --latest
----

[TIP]
====
It is recommended that configuration files be maintained in a source control
repository.
====

[[whitelisting-docker-registries]]
== Whitelisting Docker Registries

You can specify a whitelist of docker registries, allowing you to curate a set
of images and templates that are available for download by OpenShift users. This
curated set can be placed in one or more docker registries, and then added to
the whitelist. When using a whitelist, only the specified registries are
accessible within OpenShift, and all other registries are denied access by
default.

To configure a whitelist:

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file to block all registries:
+
----
BLOCK_REGISTRY='--block-registry=all'
----
+
You may need to uncomment the `*BLOCK_REGISTRY*` line.
. In the same file, add registries to which you want to allow access:
+
----
ADD_REGISTRY='--add-registry=<registry1> --add-registry=<registry2>'
----
+
.Allowing Access to Registries
====
----
ADD_REGISTRY='--add-registry=registry.access.redhat.com'
----
====
+
This example would restrict access to images available on the
link:https://access.redhat.com/search/#/container-images[Red Hat Customer Portal].

Once the whitelist is configured, if a user tries to pull from a docker registry
that is not on the whitelist, they will receive an error message stating that
this registry is not allowed.

[[exposing-the-registry]]
== Exposing the Registry

To expose your internal registry externally, it is recommended that you run a
link:#securing-the-registry[secure registry]. To expose the registry you must
first have link:deploy_router.html[deployed a router].

. link:#deploy-registry[Deploy the registry].
+
. link:#securing-the-registry[Secure the registry].
+
. link:deploy_router.html[Deploy a router].
+
. Create a
link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#secured-routes[passthrough]
route via `oc create route passthrough` by pointing the `--service` flag to the service
of the registry. You can optionally provide a route name by passing an argument, otherwise
the name of the service will be used as the route name.
+
For example:
+
====
----
$ oc get svc
NAME              CLUSTER_IP       EXTERNAL_IP   PORT(S)                 SELECTOR                  AGE

$ oc create route passthrough --service=docker-registry --hostname=<host>
route "docker-registry" created
----
====
+
====
----
$ oc get route/docker-registry -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: docker-registry
spec:
  host: <host> <1>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: docker-registry <2>
  tls:
    termination: passthrough <3>
----
<1> The host for your route.  You must be able to resolve this name externally via DNS to the router's IP address.
<2> The service name for your registry.
<3> Specify this route as a passthrough route.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Passthrough is currently the only type of route supported for exposing the
secure registry.
====
+
. Next, you must trust the certificates being used for the registry on your host system.
The certificates referenced were created when you secured your registry.
+
====
----
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/<host>
$ sudo cp <ca certificate file> /etc/docker/certs.d/<host>
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
----
====
+

. link:#access[Log in to the registry] using the information from securing the

than your service IP. You should now be able to tag and push images using the
route host.

[[registry-known-issues]]
== Known Issues

The following are the known issues when deploying or using the integrated
registry.

*Image Push Errors with Scaled Registry Using Shared NFS Volume*

During a push of an image, you may see one of the following errors:

* `digest invalid: provided digest did not match uploaded content`
* `blob upload unknown`

The error is returned by an internal registry service when Docker attempts to
push the image. Its cause originates in the synchronization of file attributes
across nodes. Factors such as NFS client side caching, network latency, and
layer size can all contribute to potential errors that might occur when pushing
an image using the default round-robin load balancing configuration.

link:#session-affinity-workaround[One possible workaround] is to set the
*docker-registry* service's `*sessionAffinity*` to *ClientIP*. This ensures that
requests from a particular Docker client will always be handled by the same
replica.
