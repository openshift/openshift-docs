== Overview
OpenShift can build
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.html#docker-images[Docker
images] from your source code, deploy them, and manage their lifecycle. To
enable this, OpenShift provides an internal,
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html#integrated-openshift-registry[integrated
Docker registry] that can be deployed in your OpenShift environment to locally
manage images.

[[deploy-registry]]
== Deploying the Registry

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
To deploy the integrated Docker registry, use the `oadm registry` command from
the *_admin.kubeconfig_* file's location, as a user with cluster administrator
privileges:

----
$ oadm registry --config=admin.kubeconfig \//<1>
    --credentials=openshift-registry.kubeconfig <2>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
To deploy the integrated Docker registry, use the `oadm registry` command as a
user with cluster administrator privileges. For example:

----
$ oadm registry --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig \//<1>
    --credentials=/etc/origin/master/openshift-registry.kubeconfig \//<2>
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}' <3>
----
endif::[]
<1> `--config` is the path to the
link:../../cli_reference/manage_cli_profiles.html[CLI configuration file] for
the link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[cluster
administrator].
<2> `--credentials` is the path to the
link:../../cli_reference/manage_cli_profiles.html[CLI configuration file] for
the *openshift-registry*.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
<3> Required to pull the correct image for OpenShift Enterprise.
endif::[]

This creates a service and a deployment configuration, both called
*docker-registry*. Once deployed successfully, a pod is created with a name
similar to *docker-registry-1-cpty9*.

To see a full list of options that you can specify when creating the registry:

----
$ oadm registry --help
----

[[storage-for-the-registry]]
=== Storage for the Registry

The registry stores Docker images and metadata. If you simply deploy a pod with
the registry, it uses an ephemeral volume that is destroyed if the pod exits.
Any images anyone has built or pushed into the registry would disappear.

==== Production Use

For production use, attach a remote volume or
link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/index.html[define and use the
persistent storage method of your choice].

For example, to use an existing persistent volume claim:
----
$ oc volume deploymentconfigs/docker-registry --add --name=v1 -t pvc \
     --claim-name=<pvc_name> --overwrite
----

Or, to attach an existing NFS volume to the registry:

----
$ oc volume deploymentconfigs/docker-registry \
     --add --overwrite --name=registry-storage --mount-path=/registry \
     --source='{"nfs": { "server": "<fqdn>", "path": "/path/to/export"}}'
----

[[session-affinity-workaround]]
There are link:#registry-known-issues[known issues] when using multiple registry
replicas with the same NFS volume. We recommend changing the docker-registry
service's `*sessionAffinity*` to *ClientIP*:

----
$ oc get -o yaml svc docker-registry | \
      sed 's/\(sessionAffinity:\s*\).*/\1ClientIP/' | \
      oc replace -f -
----

==== Non-Production use

For non-production use, you can use the `--mount-host=<path>` option to specify
a directory for the registry to use for persistent storage. The registry volume
is then created as a host-mount at the specified `<path>`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `--mount-host` option mounts a directory from the node on which the registry
container lives. If you scale up the *docker-registry* deployment configuration,
it is possible that your registry pods and containers will run on different
nodes, which can result in two or more registry containers, each with its own
local storage. This will lead to unpredictable behavior, as subsequent requests
to pull the same image repeatedly may not always succeed, depending on which
container the request ultimately goes to.
====

The `--mount-host` option requires that the registry container run in privileged
mode. This is automatically enabled when you specify `--mount-host`.
However, not all pods are allowed to run
link:prerequisites.html#security-warning[privileged containers] by default. If
you still want to use this option:

. Create a new link:../../admin_guide/service_accounts.html[service account] in
the *default* project for the registry to run as. The following example creates
a service account named *registry*:
+
----
$ echo \
    '{"kind":"ServiceAccount","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"registry"}}' \
    | oc create -n default -f -
----

. To add the new *registry* service account to the list of users allowed to run
privileged containers:
+
.. Edit the *privileged*
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#security-context-constraints[security
context constraint] (SCC):
+
----
$ oc edit scc privileged
----
+
.. Add a line under *users* with the user name
*system:serviceaccount:default:registry*.

. Create the registry and specify that it use the new *registry* service
account:
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oadm registry --service-account=registry \
    --config=admin.kubeconfig \
    --credentials=openshift-registry.kubeconfig \
    --mount-host=<path>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm registry --service-account=registry \
    --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig \
    --credentials=/etc/origin/master/openshift-registry.kubeconfig \
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}' \
    --mount-host=<path>
----
endif::[]

[[viewing-logs]]


== Viewing Logs

To view the logs for the Docker registry, run the `oc logs` indicating the desired pod:

====
----
$ oc logs docker-registry-1-da73t
2015-05-01T19:48:36.300593110Z time="2015-05-01T19:48:36Z" level=info msg="version=v2.0.0+unknown"

----
====

[[file-storage]]

== File Storage

Tag and image metadata is stored in OpenShift, but the registry stores layer and
signature data in a volume that is mounted into the registry container at
*_/registry_*. As `oc exec` does not work on privileged containers, to view a
registry's contents you must manually SSH into the node housing the registry
pod's container, then run `docker exec` on the container itself:

. List the current pods to find the pod name of your Docker registry:
+
----
# oc get pods
----
+
Then, use `oc describe` to find the host name for the node running the
container:
+
----
# oc describe pod <pod_name>
----

. Log into the desired node:
+
----
# ssh node.example.com
----

. List the running containers on the node host and identify the container ID for
the Docker registry:
+
----
# docker ps | grep ose-docker-registry
----

. List the registry contents using the `docker exec` command:
+
====
----
# docker exec -it 4c01db0b339c find /registry

[[access]]
== Accessing the Registry Directly
For advanced usage, you can access the registry directly to invoke `docker`
commands. This allows you to push images to or pull them from the integrated
registry directly using operations like `docker push` or `docker pull`. To do
so, you must be logged in to the registry using the `docker login` command. The
operations you can perform depend on your user permissions, as described in the
following sections.

[[access-user-prerequisites]]
=== User Prerequisites
To access the registry directly, the user that you use must satisfy the
following, depending on your intended usage:

- For any direct access, you must have a
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#users[regular
user], if one does not already exist, for your
preferred link:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.html[identity
provider]. A regular user can generate an access token required for logging in to
the registry.
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#users[System
users], such as *system:admin*, cannot obtain access tokens and, therefore,
cannot access the registry directly.
+
For example, if you are using `HTPASSWD` authentication, you can create one
using the following command:
+
----
# htpasswd /etc/origin/openshift-htpasswd <user_name>
----

- The user must have the *system:registry* role. To add this role:
+
----
# oadm policy add-role-to-user system:registry <user_name>
----

- Have the *admin* role for the project associated with the Docker operation. For
example, if accessing images in the global *openshift* project:
+
----
 $ oadm policy add-role-to-user admin <user_name> -n openshift
----

- For writing or pushing images, for example when using the `docker push` command,
the user must have the *system:image-builder* role. To add this role:
+
----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user system:image-builder <user_name>
----

For more information on user permissions, see
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#managing-role-bindings[Managing
Role Bindings].

[[access-logging-in-to-the-registry]]
=== Logging in to the Registry

[NOTE]
====
Ensure your user satisfies the link:#access-user-prerequisites[prerequisites]
for accessing the registry directly.
====

To log in to the registry directly:

. Ensure you are logged in to OpenShift as a *regular user*:
+
----
$ oc login
----

. Get your access token:
+
----
$ oc whoami -t
----

. Log in to the Docker registry:
+
----
$ docker login -u <username> -e <any_email_address> \
    -p <token_value> <registry_ip>:<port>
----

[[access-pushing-and-pulling-images]]
=== Pushing and Pulling Images
After link:#access-logging-in-to-the-registry[logging in to the registry], you
can perform `docker pull` and `docker push` operations against your registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can pull arbitrary images, but if you have the *system:registry* role
added, you can only push images to the registry in your project.
====

In the following examples, we use:
|====

|Component |Value

|*<registry_ip>*
|`172.30.124.220`

|*<port>*
|`5000`

|*<project>*
|`openshift`

|*<image>*
|`busybox`

|====

. Pull an arbitrary image:
+
====
----
$ docker pull docker.io/busybox
----
====

. Tag the new image with the form `<registry_ip>:<port>/<project>/<image>`:
+
====
----
$ docker tag docker.io/busybox 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Your regular user must have the *system:image-builder* role for the specified
project, which allows the user to write or push an image. Otherwise, the `docker
push` in the next step will fail. To test, you can
link:../../dev_guide/projects.html#create-a-project[create a new project] to
push the *busybox* image.
====

. Push the newly-tagged image to your registry:
+
====
----
$ docker push 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
...
cf2616975b4a: Image successfully pushed
Digest: sha256:3662dd821983bc4326bee12caec61367e7fb6f6a3ee547cbaff98f77403cab55
----
====

== Securing the Registry

Optionally, you can secure the registry so that it serves traffic via TLS:

. link:#deploy-registry[Deploy the registry].
+
. Fetch the service IP and port of the registry:
+
====
----
$ oc get svc/docker-registry
NAME              LABELS                                    SELECTOR                  IP(S)            PORT(S)
docker-registry   docker-registry=default                   docker-registry=default   172.30.124.220   5000/TCP
----
====
+
. You can use an existing server certificate, or create a key and server
certificate valid for specified IPs and host names, signed by a specified CA. To
create a server certificate for the registry service IP and the
*docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local* host name:
+
----
$ oadm ca create-server-cert --signer-cert=ca.crt \
    --signer-key=ca.key --signer-serial=ca.serial.txt \
    --hostnames='docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local,172.30.124.220' \
    --cert=registry.crt --key=registry.key
----
+
. Create the secret for the registry certificates:
+
----
$ oc secrets new registry-secret registry.crt registry.key
----
+
. Add the secret to the registry pod's service account (i.e., the *default*
service account):
+
----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccounts/default secrets/registry-secret
----
+
. Add the secret volume to the registry deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc volume dc/docker-registry --add --type=secret \
    --secret-name=registry-secret -m /etc/secrets
----
+
. Enable TLS by adding the following environment variables to the registry
deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc env dc/docker-registry \
    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/etc/secrets/registry.crt \
    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/etc/secrets/registry.key
----
+
See more details on
https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#override-configuration-options[overriding
registry options].

. Update the scheme used for the registry's liveness probe from HTTP to HTTPS:
+
----
$ oc get dc/docker-registry -o yaml \
    | sed -e 's/scheme: HTTP/scheme: HTTPS/g' \
    | oc replace -f -
----

. Validate the registry is running in TLS mode. Wait until the *docker-registry*
pod status changes to `Running` and verify the Docker logs for the registry
container. You should find an entry for `listening on :5000, tls`.
+
====
----
$ oc get pods

----
====
+
. Copy the CA certificate to the Docker certificates directory. This must be
done on all nodes in the cluster:
+
----
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/172.30.124.220:5000
$ sudo cp ca.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/172.30.124.220:5000

$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local:5000
$ sudo cp ca.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local:5000
----
+
. Remove the `--insecure-registry` option only for this particular registry in
the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file. Then, reload the daemon and restart the
*docker* service to reflect this configuration change:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
----
+
. Validate the `docker` client connection. Running
https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/push/[`docker push`]
to the registry or
https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/pull/[`docker pull`] from the registry should succeed.  Make sure you have
link:#access[logged into the registry].
+
----
$ docker tag|push <registry/image> <internal_registry/project/image>
----
+
For example:
+
====
----
$ docker pull busybox
$ docker tag docker.io/busybox 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
$ docker push 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
...

====

== Exposing the Registry

To expose your internal registry externally, it is recommended that you run a
link:#securing-the-registry[secure registry]. To expose the registry you must
first have link:deploy_router.html[deployed a router].

. link:#deploy-registry[Deploy the registry].
+
. link:#securing-the-registry[Secure the registry].
+
. link:deploy_router.html[Deploy a router].
+
. Create your
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#passthrough-termination[passthrough]
route with `oc create -f <filename>.json`.  The passthrough route will point to
the registry service that you have created.
+
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: registry
spec:
  host: <host> <1>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: docker-registry <2>
  tls:
    termination: passthrough <3>
----
<1> The host for your route.  You must be able to resolve this name externally via DNS to the router's IP address.
<2> The service name for your registry.
<3> Specify this route as a passthrough route.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Passthrough is currently the only type of route supported for exposing the
secure registry.
====
+
. Next, you must trust the certificates being used for the registry on your host system.
The certificates referenced were created when you secured your registry.
+
====
----
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/<host>
$ sudo cp <ca certificate file> /etc/docker/certs.d/<host>
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
----
====
+

. link:#access[Log in to the registry] using the information from securing the
registry. However, this time point to the host name used in the route rather
than your service IP. You should now be able to tag and push images using the
route host.

[[registry-known-issues]]
== Known Issues

The following are the known issues when deploying or using the integrated
registry.

*Image Push Errors with Scaled Registry Using Shared NFS Volume*

During a push of an image, you may see one of the following errors:

* `digest invalid: provided digest did not match uploaded content`
* `blob upload unknown`

The error is returned by an internal registry service when Docker attempts to
push the image. Its cause originates in the synchronization of file attributes
across nodes. Factors such as NFS client side caching, network latency, and
layer size can all contribute to potential errors that might occur when pushing
an image using the default round-robin load balancing configuration.

link:#session-affinity-workaround[One possible workaround] is to set the
*docker-registry* service's `*sessionAffinity*` to *ClientIP*. This ensures that
requests from a particular Docker client will always be handled by the same
replica.

== What's Next?

After you have a registry deployed, you can:

- link:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.html[Configure
authentication]; by default, authentication is set to
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
link:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Deny
All].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
link:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Allow
All].
endif::[]
- Deploy a link:deploy_router.html[router].
- link:first_steps.html[Populate your OpenShift installation] with a useful set
of Red Hat-provided image streams and templates.
