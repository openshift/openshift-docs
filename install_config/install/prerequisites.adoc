[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} only supports servers with the x86_64 architecture.
====

=== Production Level Hardware Requirements

Test or sample environments function with the minimum requirements. For
production environments, the following recommendations apply:

Master Hosts::
In a highly available {product-title} cluster with external etcd, a master host
should have, in addition to the minimum requirements in the table above, 1 CPU
core and 1.5 GB of memory for each 1000 pods. Therefore, the recommended size of
a master host in an {product-title} cluster of 2000 pods would be the minimum
requirements of 2 CPU cores and 16 GB of RAM, plus 2 CPU cores and 3 GB of RAM,
totaling 4 CPU cores and 19 GB of RAM.

When planning an environment with multiple masters, a minimum of three etcd
hosts and a load-balancer between the master hosts are required.

The {product-title} master caches deserialized versions of resources
aggressively to ease CPU load. However, in smaller clusters of less than 1000
pods, this cache can waste a lot of memory for negligible CPU load reduction.
The default cache size is 50,000 entries, which, depending on the size of your
resources, can grow to occupy 1 to 2 GB of memory.  This cache size can be
reduced using the following setting the in *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*:

----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
    deserialization-cache-size:
    - "1000"
----

Node Hosts::
The size of a node host depends on the expected size of its workload. As an
{product-title} cluster administrator, you will need to calculate the expected
workload, then add about 10 percent for overhead. For production environments,
allocate enough resources so that a node host failure does not affect your
maximum capacity.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Oversubscribing the physical resources on a node affects resource guarantees the
Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod placement. Learn what measures you can
take to xref:../../admin_guide/overcommit.adoc#disabling-swap-memory[avoid memory swapping].
====

[[configuring-core-usage]]
=== Configuring Core Usage

By default, {product-title} masters and nodes use all available cores in the
system they run on. You can choose the number of cores you want {product-title}
to use by setting the https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/[`*GOMAXPROCS*` environment
variable].

For example, run the following before starting the server to make
{product-title} only run on one core:

====
----
# export GOMAXPROCS=1
----
====

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Alternatively, if you plan to
xref:../../getting_started/administrators.adoc#running-in-a-docker-container[run
OpenShift in a container], add `-e GOMAXPROCS=1` to the `docker run`
command when launching the server.
endif::[]

[[prereq-selinux]]
=== SELinux

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) must be enabled on all of the servers before
installing {product-title} or the installer will fail. Also, configure
`*SELINUXTYPE=targeted*` in the *_/etc/selinux/config_* file:

----
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these three values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
----

[discrete]
[[install-prerequisites-overlayfs]]
=== Using OverlayFS

OverlayFS is a union file system that allows you to overlay one file system on
top of another.

As of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4, you have the option to configure your
{product-title} environment to use OverlayFS. The `overlay2` graph driver is
fully supported in addition to the older `overlay` driver. However, Red Hat
recommends using `overlay2` instead of `overlay`, because of its speed and
simple implementation.

See the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#overlay_graph_driver[Overlay
Graph Driver] section of the Atomic Host documentation for instructions on how
to to enable the `overlay2` graph driver for the Docker service.

[[prereq-NTP]]
=== NTP

You must enable Network Time Protocol (NTP) to prevent masters and nodes in the
cluster from going out of sync. Set `openshift_clock_enabled` to `true` in the
Ansible playbook to enable NTP on masters and nodes in the cluster during
Ansible installation.

----
# openshift_clock_enabled=true
----

[[security-warning]]
=== Security Warning

{product-title} runs
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#containers[containers] on your hosts, and in some cases, such as build operations and the
registry service, it does so using privileged containers. Furthermore, those
containers access your host's Docker daemon and perform `docker build` and
`docker push` operations. As such, you should be aware of the inherent security
risks associated with performing `docker run` operations on arbitrary images as
they effectively have root access.

For more information, see these articles:

- http://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/

To address these risks, {product-title} uses
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#security-context-constraints[security
context constraints] that control the actions that pods can perform and what it
has the ability to access.

[[envirornment-requirements]]
== Environment Requirements

The following section defines the requirements of the environment containing
your {product-title} configuration. This includes networking considerations
and access to external services, such as Git repository access, storage, and
cloud infrastructure providers.

[[prereq-dns]]
=== DNS

{product-title} requires a fully functional DNS server in the environment. This
is ideally a separate host running DNS software and can provide name resolution
to hosts and containers running on the platform.

[IMPORTANT]
Adding entries into the *_/etc/hosts_* file on each host is not enough. This
file is not copied into containers running on the platform.

Key components of {product-title} run themselves inside of containers and use
the following process for name resolution:

. By default, containers receive their DNS configuration
file (*_/etc/resolv.conf_*) from their host.

. {product-title} then inserts one DNS value into the pods
(above the node's nameserver values). That value is defined in the
*_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file by the
xref:../../admin_solutions/master_node_config.adoc#node-config-options[`*dnsIP*`]
parameter, which by default is set to the address of the host node because the host
is using *dnsmasq*.

. If the
xref:../../admin_solutions/master_node_config.adoc#node-config-options[`*dnsIP*`]
parameter is omitted from the *_node-config.yaml_*
file, then the value defaults to the kubernetes service IP, which is the first
nameserver in the pod's *_/etc/resolv.conf_* file.

As of {product-title}
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.2,
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.2,
endif::[]
*dnsmasq* is automatically configured on all masters and nodes. The pods use the
nodes as their DNS, and the nodes forward the requests. By default, *dnsmasq*
is configured on the nodes to listen on port 53, therefore the nodes cannot run
any other type of DNS application.

[NOTE]
====
*NetworkManager* is required on the nodes in order to populate *dnsmasq* with
the DNS IP addresses.

DNSMSQ must be enabled (`openshift_use_dnsmasq=true`) or the installation will fail
and critical features will not function.
====

The following is an example set of DNS records for the xref:../../install_config/install/planning.adoc#single-master-multi-node[Single Master and Multiple Nodes] scenario:

----
master    A   10.64.33.100
node1     A   10.64.33.101
node2     A   10.64.33.102
----

If you do not have a properly functioning DNS environment, you could experience
failure with:

- Product installation via the reference Ansible-based scripts
- Deployment of the infrastructure containers (registry, routers)
- Access to the {product-title} web console, because it is not accessible via
IP address alone


[[dns-config-prereq]]
==== Configuring Hosts to Use DNS

Make sure each host in your environment is configured to resolve hostnames from
your DNS server. The configuration for hosts' DNS resolution depend on whether
DHCP is enabled. If DHCP is:

- Disabled, then configure your network interface to be static, and add DNS
nameservers to NetworkManager.

- Enabled, then the NetworkManager dispatch script automatically configures DNS
based on the DHCP configuration. Optionally, you can add a value to xref:../../admin_solutions/master_node_config.adoc#node-config-options[`*dnsIP*`]
in the *_node-config.yaml_* file to prepend the pod's *_resolv.conf_* file. The
second nameserver is then defined by the host's first nameserver. By default,
this will be the IP address of the node host.
+
[NOTE]
====
For most configurations, do not set the `*openshift_dns_ip*` option during the
advanced installation of {product-title} (using Ansible), because this option
overrides the default IP address set by xref:../../admin_solutions/master_node_config.adoc#node-config-options[`*dnsIP*`].

Instead, allow the installer to configure each node to use *dnsmasq* and forward
requests to SkyDNS or the external DNS provider. If you do set the
`*openshift_dns_ip*` option, then it should be set either with a DNS IP that
queries SkyDNS first, or to the SkyDNS service or endpoint IP (the Kubernetes
service IP).
====

To verify that hosts can be resolved by your DNS server:

. Check the contents of *_/etc/resolv.conf_*:
+
----
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Generated by NetworkManager
search example.com
nameserver 10.64.33.1
# nameserver updated by /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-origin-dns.sh
----
+
In this example, 10.64.33.1 is the address of our DNS server.

. Test that the DNS servers listed in *_/etc/resolv.conf_* are able to resolve
host names to the IP addresses of all masters and nodes in your {product-title}
environment:
+
----
$ dig <node_hostname> @<IP_address> +short
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ dig master.example.com @10.64.33.1 +short
10.64.33.100
$ dig node1.example.com @10.64.33.1 +short
10.64.33.101
----

[[wildcard-dns-prereq]]
==== Configuring a DNS Wildcard

Optionally, configure a wildcard for the router to use, so that you do not need
to update your DNS configuration when new routes are added.

A wildcard for a DNS zone must ultimately resolve to the IP address of the
{product-title} xref:../../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#routers[router].

For example, create a wildcard DNS entry for *cloudapps* that has a low
time-to-live value (TTL) and points to the public IP address of the host where
the router will be deployed:

----
*.cloudapps.example.com. 300 IN  A 192.168.133.2
----

In almost all cases, when referencing VMs you must use host names, and the host
names that you use must match the output of the `hostname -f` command on each
node.

[WARNING]
====
In your *_/etc/resolv.conf_* file on each node host, ensure that the DNS server
that has the wildcard entry is not listed as a nameserver or that the wildcard
domain is not listed in the search list. Otherwise, containers managed by
{product-title} may fail to resolve host names properly.
====

[[prereq-network-access]]
=== Network Access

A shared network must exist between the master and node hosts. If you plan to
configure
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#high-availability-masters[multiple
masters for high-availability] using the xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced
installation method], you must also select an IP to be configured as your
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master-components[virtual
IP] (VIP) during the installation process. The IP that you select must be
routable between all of your nodes, and if you configure using a FQDN it should
resolve on all nodes.

[[prereq-networkmanager]]
==== NetworkManager

NetworkManager, a program for providing detection and configuration for systems
to automatically connect to the network, is required.

[[required-ports]]
==== Required Ports

The {product-title} installation automatically creates a set of internal
firewall rules on each host using `iptables`. However, if your network
configuration uses an external firewall, such as a hardware-based firewall, you
must ensure infrastructure components can communicate with each other through
specific ports that act as communication endpoints for certain processes or
services.

Ensure the following ports required by {product-title} are open on your network
and configured to allow access between hosts. Some ports are optional depending
on your configuration and usage.

*Notes*

* In the above examples, port *4789* is used for User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
* When deployments are using the SDN, the pod network is accessed via a service proxy, unless it is accessing the registry from the same node the registry is deployed on.
* {product-title} internal DNS cannot be received over SDN. Depending on the detected values of `*openshift_facts*`, or if the `*openshift_ip*` and `*openshift_public_ip*` values are overridden, it will be the computed value of `*openshift_ip*`. For non-cloud deployments, this will default to the IP address associated with the default route on the master host. For cloud deployments, it will default to the IP address associated with the first internal interface as defined by the cloud metadata.
* The master host uses port *10250* to reach the nodes and does not go over SDN. It depends on the target host of the deployment and uses the computed values of `*openshift_hostname*` and `*openshift_public_hostname*`.

.Aggregated Logging

| *9300*
|TCP
|For Elasticsearch inter-cluster use. Required to be internally open on any
infrastructure node so the members of the Elasticsearch cluster may communicate
with each other.
|===

[[prereq-persistent-storage]]
=== Persistent Storage

The Kubernetes
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume]
framework allows you to provision an {product-title} cluster with persistent storage
using networked storage available in your environment. This can be done after
completing the initial {product-title} installation depending on your application
needs, giving users a way to request those resources without having any
knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

The xref:../../install_config/index.adoc#install-config-index[Installation and Configuration Guide]
provides instructions for cluster administrators on provisioning an {product-title}
cluster with persistent storage using
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-nfs[NFS],

[[prereq-cloud-provider-considerations]]
=== Cloud Provider Considerations

There are certain aspects to take into consideration if installing {product-title}
on a cloud provider.

==== Configuring a Security Group

When installing on AWS or OpenStack, ensure that you set up the appropriate
security groups. These are some ports that you should have in your security
groups, without which the installation will fail. You may need more depending on
the cluster configuration you want to install. For more information and to
adjust your security groups accordingly, see xref:required-ports[Required Ports]
for more information.

|===

If configuring ELBs for load balancing the masters and/or routers, you also need
to configure Ingress and Egress security groups for the ELBs appropriately.

==== Overriding Detected IP Addresses and Host Names

Some deployments require that the user override the detected host names and IP
addresses for the hosts. To see the default values, run the `*openshift_facts*`
playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook  [-i /path/to/inventory] \
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
----

Now, verify the detected common settings. If they are not what you expect them
to be, you can override them.

The
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-ansible[Advanced
Installation] topic discusses the available Ansible variables in greater detail.

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Variable |Usage

|`*hostname*`

a| - Should be the internal IP of the instance.
- `*openshift_ip*` will overrides.

|`*public_hostname*`
a| - Should resolve to the external IP from hosts outside of the cloud.
- Provider `*openshift_public_hostname*` overrides.

|`*public_ip*`
a| - Should be the externally accessible IP associated with the instance.
- `*openshift_public_ip*` overrides.

[WARNING]
====
If `*openshift_hostname*` is set to a value other than the metadata-provided
`*private-dns-name*` value, the native cloud integration for those providers
will no longer work.

In AWS, situations that require overriding the variables include:

|Variable |Usage

|`*hostname*`
a|The user is installing in a VPC that is not configured for both `*DNS hostnames*` and `*DNS resolution*`.

|`*ip*`
a|Possibly if they have multiple network interfaces configured and they want to
use one other than the default. You must first set
`*openshift_set_node_ip*` to `True`. Otherwise, the SDN would attempt to
use the `*hostname*` setting or try to resolve the host name for the IP.

|`*public_hostname*`
a| - A master instance where the VPC subnet is not configured for `*Auto-assign
Public IP*`. For external access to this master, you need to have an ELB or
other load balancer configured that would provide the external access needed, or
you need to connect over a VPN connection to the internal name of the host.
- A master instance where metadata is disabled.
- This value is not actually used by the nodes.

|`*public_ip*`
a| - A master instance where the VPC subnet is not configured for `*Auto-assign Public IP*`.
- A master instance where metadata is disabled.
- This value is not actually used by the nodes.

|===

If setting `*openshift_hostname*` to something other than the metadata-provided
`*private-dns-name*` value, the native cloud integration for those providers
will no longer work.

For EC2 hosts in particular, they must be deployed in a VPC that has both
`*DNS host names*` and `*DNS resolution*` enabled, and `*openshift_hostname*`
should not be overridden.

==== Post-Installation Configuration for Cloud Providers

Following the installation process, you can configure {product-title} for
xref:../../install_config/configuring_aws.adoc#install-config-configuring-aws[AWS],
xref:../../install_config/configuring_openstack.adoc#install-config-configuring-openstack[OpenStack], or
xref:../../install_config/configuring_gce.adoc#install-config-configuring-gce[GCE].

=== Containerized GlusterFS Considerations

If you choose to configure
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#advanced-install-containerized-glusterfs-persistent-storage[containerized GlusterFS persistent storage] for your cluster, or if you choose to configure a
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#advanced-install-containerized-glusterfs-backed-registry[containerized GlusterFS-backed OpenShift Container Registry], you must consider the following
prerequisites.

[[prereq-glusterfs-storage-nodes]]
==== Storage Nodes

To use containerized GlusterFS persistent storage:

- A minimum of 3 storage nodes is required.
- Each storage node must have at least 1 raw block device with least 100 GB
available.

To run a containerized GlusterFS-backed OpenShift Container Registry:

- A minimum of 3 storage nodes is required.
- Each storage node must have at least 1 raw block device with at least 10 GB of
free storage.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While containerized GlusterFS persistent storage can be configured and deployed
on the same {product-title} cluster as a containerized GlusterFS-backed
registry, their storage should be kept separate from each other and also
requires additional storage nodes. For example, if both are configured, a total
of 6 storage nodes would be needed: 3 for the registry and 3 for persistent
storage. This limitation is imposed to avoid potential impacts on performance in
I/O and volume creation.

[[prereq-glusterfs-software-components]]
==== Required Software Components

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
For any RHEL (non-Atomic) storage nodes, the following RPM respository must be
enabled:

----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rh-gluster-3-client-for-rhel-7-server-rpms
----
endif::[]

The `mount.glusterfs` command must be available on all nodes which will host
pods which will use GlusterFS volumes. For RPM-based systems, the
*glusterfs-fuse* package must be installed:

----
# yum install glusterfs-fuse
----
