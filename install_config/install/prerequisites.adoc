[[system-requirements]]

== System Requirements

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
You must have an active OpenShift Enterprise subscription on your Red Hat
account to proceed. If you do not, contact your sales representative for more
information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
OpenShift Enterprise (OSE) 3.x supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.1 or
later. Starting in OSE 3.1.1, RHEL Atomic Host 7.1.6 or later is also supported,
as it requires the
link:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.html[containerized
method] introduced in OSE 3.1.1.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
OSE 3.1.x requires Docker 1.8.2, however Docker 1.9 is currently not supported
due to performance issues. See the
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2214221[Red Hat Knowledgebase] for details.
Follow this topic to ensure you have the correct version of Docker installed on
your hosts before installing or upgrading to OSE 3.1.
====

- An additional minimum 15 GB unallocated space to be used for Docker's storage
back end; see link:#configuring-docker-storage[Configuring Docker Storage]
below.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Meeting the *_/var/_* file system sizing requirements in RHEL Atomic Host
requires making changes to the default configuration. See
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/getting-started-with-containers/#managing_storage_in_red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host[Managing
Storage in Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host] for instructions on configuring
this during or after installation.
====

[[configuring-core-usage]]

=== Configuring Core Usage

By default, OpenShift masters and nodes use all available cores in the system they run on.
You can choose the number of cores you want OpenShift to use by setting the
https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/[`*GOMAXPROCS*` environment variable].

For example, run the following before starting the server to make OpenShift only
run on one core:

====
----
# export GOMAXPROCS=1
----
====

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Alternatively, if you plan to
link:../../getting_started/administrators.html#running-in-a-docker-container[run
OpenShift in a Docker container], add `-e GOMAXPROCS=1` to the `docker run`
command when launching the server.
endif::[]

[[security-warning]]

=== Security Warning

OpenShift runs
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.html#containers[Docker
containers] on your hosts, and in some cases, such as build operations and the
registry service, it does so using privileged containers. Furthermore, those
containers access your host's Docker daemon and perform `docker build` and
`docker push` operations. As such, you should be aware of the inherent security
risks associated with performing `docker run` operations on arbitrary images as
they effectively have root access.

For more information, see these articles:

- http://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux
- https://docs.docker.com/articles/security/

To address these risks, OpenShift uses
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#security-context-constraints[security
context constraints] that control the actions that pods can perform and what it
has the ability to access.

[[envirornment-requirements]]

== Environment Requirements

The following must be set up in your environment before OpenShift can be
installed.

[[prereq-dns]]

=== DNS

A wildcard for a DNS zone must ultimately resolve to the IP address of the
OpenShift link:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#routers[router].

For example, create a wildcard DNS entry for *cloudapps*, or something similar,
that has a low TTL and points to the public IP address of the host where the
router will be deployed:

----
*.cloudapps.example.com. 300 IN  A 192.168.133.2
----

In almost all cases, when referencing VMs you must use host names, and the host
names that you use must match the output of the `hostname -f` command on each
node.

[WARNING]
====
In your *_/etc/resolv.conf_* file on each node host, ensure that the DNS server
that has the wildcard entry is not listed as a nameserver or that the wildcard
domain is not listed in the search list. Otherwise, containers managed by
OpenShift may fail to resolve host names properly.
====

[[prereq-network-access]]

=== Network Access

A shared network must exist between the master and node hosts. If you plan to
configure
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#high-availability-masters[multiple
masters for high-availability] using the link:advanced_install.html[advanced
installation method], you must also select an IP to be configured as your
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master-components[virtual
IP] (VIP) during the installation process. The IP that you select must be
routable between all of your nodes, and if you configure using a FQDN it should
resolve on all nodes.

[[required-ports]]

*Required Ports*

OpenShift infrastructure components communicate with each other using ports,
which are communication endpoints that are identifiable for specific processes
or services. Ensure the following ports required by OpenShift are open between hosts,
for example if you have a firewall in your environment. Some ports are optional
depending on your configuration and usage.

.Node to Node
[cols='2,8']
|===
| *4789*
|Required for SDN communication between pods on separate hosts.
|===

.Nodes to Master
[cols='2,8']
|===
| *53*
|Required for SDN communication between pods on separate hosts.

| *4789*
|Required for SDN communication between pods on separate hosts.

| *443* or *8443*
|Required for node hosts to communicate to the master API, for the node hosts to
post back status, to receive tasks, and so on.
|===

.Master to Node
[cols='2,8']
|===
| *4789*
|Required for SDN communication between pods on separate hosts.

| *10250*
|The master proxies to node hosts via the Kubelet for `oc` commands.
|===

.Master to Master
[cols='2,8']
|===
| *53*
|Provides DNS services.

| *2049*
|Required when provisioning an NFS host as part of the installer.

| *2379*
|Used for standalone etcd (clustered) to accept changes in state.

| *2380*
|etcd requires this port be open between masters for leader election and peering
connections when using standalone etcd (clustered).

| *4001*
|Used for embedded etcd (non-clustered) to accept changes in state.

| *4789*
|Required for SDN communication between pods on separate hosts.

| *5404* or *5405*
|UDP ports associated with Corosync and used with `*pacemaker*` HA.

| *9000*
|If you choose the `*native*` HA method, optional to allow access to the HAProxy statistics page.


|===

.External to Master
[cols='2,8']
|===
| *443* or *8443*
|Required for node hosts to communicate to the master API, for node hosts to
post back status, to receive tasks, and so on.
|===

.IaaS Deployments
[cols='2,8']
|===
| *22*
| Required for SSH by the installer or system administrator.

| *53*
| For SkyDNS use. Only required to be internally open on master hosts.

| *80* or *443*
| For HTTP/HTTPS use for the router. Required to be externally open on node hosts, especially on nodes running the router.

| *1936*
| For router statistics use. Required to be open when running the template
router to access statistics, and can be open externally or internally to
connections depending on if you want the statistics to be expressed publicly.

| *4001*
| For embedded etcd (non-clustered) use. Only required to be internally open on
the master host. *4001* is for server-client connections.

| *2379* and *2380*
| For standalone etcd use. Only required to be internally open on the master host.
*2379* is for server-client connections. *2380* is for server-server
connections, and is only required if you have clustered etcd.

| *4789*
| For VxLAN use (OpenShift SDN). Required only internally on node hosts.

| *8443*
| For use by the OpenShift web console, shared with the API server.

| *10250*
| For use by the Kubelet. Required to be externally open on nodes.

| *24224*
| For use by Fluentd. Required to be open on master hosts for internal
connections to node hosts.
|===

*Notes*

* In the above examples, port *4789* is used for User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
* When deployments are using the SDN, the pod network is accessed via a service proxy, unless it is accessing the registry from the same node the registry is deployed on.
* OpenShift internal DNS cannot be received over SDN. Depending on the detected values of `*openshift_facts*`, or if the `*openshift_ip*` and `*openshift_public_ip*` values are overridden, it will be the computed value of `*openshift_ip*`. For non-cloud deployments, this will default to the IP address associated with the default route on the master host. For cloud deployments, it will default to the IP address associated with the first internal interface as defined by the cloud metadata.
* The master host uses port *10250* to reach the nodes and does not go over SDN. It depends on the target host of the deployment and uses the computed values of `*openshift_hostname*` and `*openshift_public_hostname*`.

[[prereq-git]]

=== Git Access

You must have either Internet access and a GitHub account, or read and write
access to an internal, HTTP-based Git server.

[[prereq-persistent-storage]]

=== Persistent Storage

The Kubernetes
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent volume]
framework allows you to provision an OpenShift cluster with persistent storage
using networked storage available in your environment. This can be done after
completing the initial OpenShift installation depending on your application
needs, giving users a way to request those resources without having any
knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

The link:../../install_config/index.html[Installation and Configuration Guide]
provides instructions for cluster administrators on provisioning an OpenShift
cluster with persistent storage using
link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.html[NFS],
link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_glusterfs.html[GlusterFS],
link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_ceph_rbd.html[Ceph
RBD],
link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_cinder.html[OpenStack
Cinder],
link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_aws.html[AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)],
link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_gce.html[GCE
Persistent Disks], and
link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_iscsi.html[iSCSI].

[[prereq-selinux]]

=== SELinux

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) must be enabled on all of the servers before
installing OpenShift or the installer will fail. Also, configure
`*SELINUXTYPE=targeted*` in the *_/etc/selinux/config_* file:

----
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these three values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
----

[[prereq-cloud-provider-considerations]]

=== Cloud Provider Considerations

*Set up the Security Group*

When installing on AWS or OpenStack, ensure that you set up the appropriate
security groups. These are some ports that you should have in your security
groups, without which the installation will fail. You may need more depending on
the cluster configuration you want to install. For more information and to
adjust your security groups accordingly, see link:#required-ports[Required Ports]
for more information.


[cols="1,2"]
|===
|*All OpenShift Hosts*
a|tcp/22 from host running the installer/Ansible

|*etcd Security Group*
a| - tcp/2379 from masters
- tcp/2380 from etcd hosts

|*Master Security Group*
a| - tcp/8443 from 0.0.0.0/0
- tcp/53 from all OpenShift hosts

|*Infrastructure Nodes*
(ones that can host the `*openshift-router*`)
a|- tcp/443 from 0.0.0.0/0
- tcp/80 from 0.0.0.0/0

|===

If configuring ELBs for load balancing the masters and/or routers, you also need
to configure Ingress and Egress security groups for the ELBs appropriately.

*Override Detected IP Addresses and Host Names*

Some deployments require that the user override the detected host names and IP
addresses for the hosts. To see the default values, run the `*openshift_facts*`
playbook:

====
----
# ansible-playbook playbooks/byo/openshift_facts.yml
----
====

Now, verify the detected common settings. If they are not what you expect them
to be, you can override them.

The link:../install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-ansible[Advanced Installation] topic discusses the available Ansible variables in greater detail.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|`*hostname*`
a| - Should resolve to the internal IP from the instances themselves.
- `*openshift_hostname*` overrides.

|`*ip*`
a| - Should be the internal IP of the instance.
- `*openshift_ip*` will overrides.

|`*public_hostname*`
a| - Should resolve to the external IP from hosts outside of the cloud.
- Provider `*openshift_public_hostname*` overrides.

|`*public_ip*`
a| - Should be the externally accessible IP associated with the instance.
- `*openshift_public_ip*` overrides.

|`*use_openshift_sdn*`
a| - Should be true unless the cloud is GCE.
- `*openshift_use_openshift_sdn*` overrides.

|===

[WARNING]
====
If `*openshift_hostname*` is set to a value other than the metadata-provided
`*private-dns-name*` value, the native cloud integration for those providers
will no longer work.
====

In AWS, situations that require overriding the variables include:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|`*hostname*`
a|The user is installing in a VPC that is not configured for both `*DNS hostnames*` and `*DNS resolution*`.

|`*ip*`
a|Possibly if they have multiple network interfaces configured and they want to
use one other than the default. You must first set
`*openshift_node_set_node_ip*` to `True`. Otherwise, the SDN would attempt to
use the `*hostname*` setting or try to resolve the host name for the IP.

|`*public_hostname*`
a| - A master instance where the VPC subnet is not configured for `*Auto-assign
Public IP*`. For external access to this master, you need to have an ELB or
other load balancer configured that would provide the external access needed, or
you need to connect over a VPN connection to the internal name of the host.
- A master instance where metadata is disabled.
- This value is not actually used by the nodes.

|`*public_ip*`
a| - A master instance where the VPC subnet is not configured for `*Auto-assign Public IP*`.
- A master instance where metadata is disabled.
- This value is not actually used by the nodes.

|===

If setting `*openshift_hostname*` to something other than the metadata-provided
`*private-dns-name*` value, the native cloud integration for those providers
will no longer work.

For EC2 hosts in particular, they must be deployed in a VPC that has both
`*DNS host names*` and `*DNS resolution*` enabled, and `*openshift_hostname*`
should not be overridden.

*Post-Installation Configuration for Cloud Providers*

Following the installation process, you can configure OpenShift for
link:../install_config/configuring_aws.html[AWS],
link:../install_config/configuring_openstack.html[OpenStack], or
link:../install_config/configuring_gce.html[GCE].

[[host-preparation]]

== Host Preparation

Before installing OpenShift, you must first prepare each host per the following.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
If you are using https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant] to run OpenShift Origin, you
do not need to go through the following sections. These changes are only
necessary when you are setting up the host yourself. If you are using Vagrant,
see the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#develop-on-virtual-machine-using-vagrant[Contributing
Guide], then you can skip directly to trying out the
link:../../getting_started/administrators.html#try-it-out[sample applications].
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

[[software-prerequisites]]

=== Software Prerequisites

*Installing an Operating System*

A base installation of RHEL 7.1 or later or RHEL Atomic Host 7.1.6 or later is
required for master and node hosts. See the following documentation for the
respective installation instructions, if required:

- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/index.html[Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide]
- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/installation-and-configuration-guide/[Red
Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host 7 Installation and Configuration Guide]

*Registering the Hosts*

Each host must be registered using Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM) and have
an active OpenShift Enterprise subscription attached to access the required
packages.

. On each host, register with RHSM:
+
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<user_name> --password=<password>
----

. List the available subscriptions:
+
----
# subscription-manager list --available
----

. In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for an OpenShift
Enterprise subscription and attach it:
+
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----
+
If you plan to configure
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#high-availability-masters[multiple
masters] with the link:advanced_install.html[advanced installation] using the
`pacemaker` HA method, you must also attach a subscription for
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/High_Availability_Add-On_Overview/index.html[High
Availability Add-on for Red Hat Enterprise Linux]:
+
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id_for_rhel_ha>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The High Availability Add-on for Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription is
provided separately from the OpenShift Enterprise subscription.
====

. Disable all repositories and enable only the required ones:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms"
----
+
If you plan to use the `pacemaker` HA method, enable the following repository as
well:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-ha-for-rhel-7-server-rpms"
----
endif::[]

*Managing Packages*

For RHEL 7 systems:

. Install the following base packages:
+
----
# yum install wget git net-tools bind-utils iptables-services bridge-utils bash-completion
----

. Update the system to the latest packages:
+
----
# yum update
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Install the following package, which provides OpenShift utilities and pulls in
other tools required by the
link:../../install_config/install/quick_install.html[quick] and
link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation]
methods, such as Ansible and related configuration files:
+
----
# yum install atomic-openshift-utils
----
endif::[]

For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems:

. Ensure the host is up to date by upgrading to the latest Atomic tree if one is
available:
+
----
# atomic host upgrade
----

. After the upgrade is completed and prepared for the next boot, reboot the
host:
+
----
# systemctl reboot
----


ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[[preparing-for-advanced-installations-origin]]

*Preparing for Advanced Installations*

If you plan to use the
link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation]
method, you must install Ansible and clone the *openshift-ansible* repository from
GitHub, which provides the required playbooks and configuration files.

For convenience, the following steps are provided if you want to use EPEL as a
package source for Ansible:

. Install the EPEL repository:
+
----
# yum -y install \
    https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm
----

. Disable the EPEL repository globally so that it is not accidentally used during
later steps of the installation:
+
----
# sed -i -e "s/^enabled=1/enabled=0/" /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo
----

. Install the packages for Ansible:
+
----
# yum -y --enablerepo=epel install ansible pyOpenSSL
----

To clone the *openshift-ansible* repository:

----
# cd ~
# git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible
# cd openshift-ansible
----

[NOTE]
====
Be sure to stay on the *master* branch of the *openshift-ansible* repository
when running an advanced installation.
====
endif::[]

[[installing-docker]]

*Installing Docker*

At this point, you should install Docker on all master and node hosts. This
allows you to configure your link:#configuring-docker-storage[Docker storage
options] before installing OpenShift.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Docker 1.9 is currently not supported
due to performance issues. See the
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2214221[Red Hat Knowledgebase] for details.
====
endif::[]

. For RHEL 7 systems, install Docker:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# yum install docker-1.8.2
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# yum install docker
endif::[]
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Docker should already be installed, configured, and running by default on RHEL
Atomic Host 7 systems.
====

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file and add `--insecure-registry
172.30.0.0/16` to the `*OPTIONS*` parameter. For example:
+
----
OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled --insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16'
----
+
The `--insecure-registry` option instructs the Docker daemon to trust any Docker
registry on the indicated subnet, rather than
link:docker_registry.html#securing-the-registry[requiring a certificate].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
172.30.0.0/16 is the default value of the `*servicesSubnet*` variable in the
*_master-config.yaml_* file. If this has changed, then the `--insecure-registry`
value in the above step should be adjusted to match, as it is indicating the
subnet for the registry to use. Note that the `*openshift_master_portal_net*`
variable can be set in the Ansible inventory file and used during the
link:advanced_install.html#configuring-ansible[advanced installation]
method to modify the `*servicesSubnet*` variable.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
After the initial OpenShift installation is complete, you can choose to
link:docker_registry.html#securing-the-registry[secure the integrated Docker
registry], which involves adjusting the `--insecure-registry` option
accordingly.
====

[[configuring-docker-storage]]

=== Configuring Docker Storage

Docker containers and the images they are created from are stored in Docker's
storage back end. This storage is ephemeral and separate from any
link:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html[persistent storage] allocated to
meet the needs of your applications.

*For RHEL Atomic Host*

The default storage back end for Docker on RHEL Atomic Host is a thin pool
logical volume, which is supported for production environments. You must ensure
that enough space is allocated for this volume per the Docker storage
requirements mentioned in
link:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.html#system-requirements[System
Requirements].

If you do not have enough allocated, see
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/getting-started-with-containers/#managing_storage_with_docker_formatted_containers[Managing
Storage with Docker Formatted Containers] for details on using
*docker-storage-setup* and basic instructions on storage management in RHEL
Atomic Host.

*For RHEL*

The default storage back end for Docker on RHEL 7 is a thin pool on loopback
devices, which is not supported for production use and only appropriate for
proof of concept environments. For production environments, you must create a
thin pool logical volume and re-configure Docker to use that volume.

You can use the *docker-storage-setup* script included with Docker to create a
thin pool device and configure Docker's storage driver. This can be done after
installing Docker and should be done before creating images or containers. The
script reads configuration options from the
*_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_* file and supports three options for
creating the logical volume:

- *Option A)* Use an additional block device.
- *Option B)* Use an existing, specified volume group.
- *Option C)* Use the remaining free space from the volume group where your root
file system is located.

Option A is the most robust option, however it requires adding an additional
block device to your host before configuring Docker storage. Options B and C
both require leaving free space available when provisioning your host.

. Create the *docker-pool* volume using one of the following three options:

** [[docker-storage-a]]*Option A) Use an additional block device.*
+
In *_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_*, set *DEVS* to the path of the block
device you wish to use. Set *VG* to the volume group name you wish to create;
*docker-vg* is a reasonable choice. For example:
+
====
----
# cat <<EOF > /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup
DEVS=/dev/vdc
VG=docker-vg
EOF
----
====
+
Then run *docker-storage-setup* and review the output to ensure the
*docker-pool* volume was created:
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before using Docker or OpenShift, verify that the *docker-pool* logical volume
is large enough to meet your needs. The *docker-pool* volume should be 60% of
the available volume group and will grow to fill the volume group via LVM
monitoring.
====

. Check if Docker is running:
+
----
# systemctl is-active docker
----

. If Docker has not yet been started on the host, enable and start the service:
+
----
# systemctl enable docker
# systemctl start docker
----
+
If Docker is already running, re-initialize Docker:
+
[WARNING]
====
This will destroy any Docker containers or images currently on the host.
====
+
----
# systemctl stop docker
# rm -rf /var/lib/docker/*
# systemctl restart docker
----
+
If there is any content in *_/var/lib/docker/_*, it must be deleted. Files
will be present if Docker has been used prior to the installation of OpenShift.

[[reconfiguring-docker-storage]]
*Reconfiguring Docker Storage*

Should you need to reconfigure Docker storage after having created the
*docker-pool*, you should first remove the *docker-pool* logical volume. If you
are using a dedicated volume group, you should also remove the volume group and
any associated physical volumes before reconfiguring *docker-storage-setup*
according to the instructions above.

See
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Logical_Volume_Manager_Administration/index.html[Logical
Volume Manager Administration] for more detailed information on LVM management.

[[managing-docker-container-logs]]
*Managing Docker Container Logs*

Sometimes a container's log file (the
*_/var/lib/docker/containers/<hash>/<hash>-json.log_* file on the node where the
container is running) can increase to a problematic size. You can manage this by
configuring Docker's `json-file` logging driver to restrict the size and number
of log files.

[options="header"]
|===

|Option |Purpose

|`--log-opt max-size`
|Sets the size at which a new log file is created.

|`--log-opt max-file`
|Sets the file on each host to configure the options.
|===

For example, to set the maximum file size to 1MB and always keep the last three
log files, edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file to configure `max-size=1M`
and `max-file=3`:
====
----
OPTIONS='--insecure-registry=172.30.0.0/16 --selinux-enabled --log-opt max-size=1M --log-opt max-file=3'
----
====

Next, restart the Docker service:
----
# systemctl restart docker
----

[[viewing-available-container-logs]]
*Viewing Available Container Logs*

Container logs are stored in the *_/var/lib/docker/containers/<hash>/_*
directory on the node where the container is running. For example:
====

The link:quick_install.html[quick] and link:advanced_install.html[advanced
installation] methods require

a user that has access to all hosts. If you want to run the installer as a
non-root user, passwordless *sudo* rights must be configured on each destination
host.

For example, you can generate an SSH key on the host where you will invoke the
installation process:

----
# ssh-keygen
----

Do *not* use a password.

An easy way to distribute your SSH keys is by using a `bash` loop:

----
# for host in master.example.com \
    node1.example.com \
    node2.example.com; \
    do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub $host; \
    done
----

Modify the host names in the above command according to your configuration.
