[[system-requirements]]

== System Requirements

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
You must have an active OpenShift Enterprise subscription on your Red Hat
account to proceed. If you do not, contact your sales representative for more
information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
OpenShift Enterprise (OSE) 3.x supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.1 or
later. Starting in OSE 3.1.1, RHEL Atomic Host 7.1.6 or later is also supported,
as it requires the
xref:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[containerized
method] introduced in OSE 3.1.1.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
OSE 3.1.x requires Docker 1.8.2, however Docker 1.9 is currently not supported
due to performance issues. See the
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2214221[Red Hat Knowledgebase] for details,
including steps on how to configure *yum* so that later Docker versions are not
installed via `yum update`. Otherwise, running `yum update` after installing
{product-title} will upgrade Docker and put your cluster in an unsupported
configuration. Follow this topic to ensure you have the correct version of
Docker installed on your hosts before installing or upgrading to OSE 3.1.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} only supports servers with x86_64 architecture.
====

[NOTE]
====
Meeting the *_/var/_* file system sizing requirements in RHEL Atomic Host
requires making changes to the default configuration. See
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/getting-started-with-containers/#managing_storage_in_red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host[Managing
Storage in Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host] for instructions on configuring
this during or after installation.
====

[[host-recommendations]]
=== Host Recommendations
The following apply to production environments. Test or sample environments will
function with the minimum requirements.

Master Hosts::
In a highly-available {product-title} cluster with external etcd, a master host
should have 1 CPU core and 2.5 GB of memory, on top of the defaults in the table
above, for each 1000 pods. Therefore, the recommended size of master host in an
{product-title} cluster of 2000 pods would be 2 CPU cores and 5 GB of RAM, as
well as the minimum requirements for a master host of 2 CPU cores and 8 GB of
RAM.

When planning an environment with multiple masters, a minimum of three etcd
hosts as well as a load-balancer between the master hosts, is required.


Node Hosts::
The size of a node host depends on the expected size of its workload. As an
{product-title} cluster administrator, you will need to calculate the expected
workload, then add about 10% for overhead. For production environments, allocate
enough resources so that node host failure does not affect your maximum
capacity.

Use the above with the following table to plan the maximum loads for nodes and
pods:

[cols="4,2",options="header"]
|===
|Host |Sizing Recommendation

|Maximum nodes per cluster |300

|Maximum pods per nodes |110
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
Oversubscribing the physical resources on a node affects resource guarantees the
Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod placement. Learn what measures you can
take to xref:../../admin_guide/overcommit.adoc#disabling-swap-memory[avoid memory swapping].
====

[[configuring-core-usage]]

=== Configuring Core Usage

By default, OpenShift masters and nodes use all available cores in the system they run on.
You can choose the number of cores you want OpenShift to use by setting the
https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/[`*GOMAXPROCS*` environment variable].

For example, run the following before starting the server to make OpenShift only
run on one core:

====
----
# export GOMAXPROCS=1
----
====

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Alternatively, if you plan to
xref:../../getting_started/administrators.adoc#running-in-a-docker-container[run
OpenShift in a Docker container], add `-e GOMAXPROCS=1` to the `docker run`
command when launching the server.
endif::[]

[[security-warning]]

=== Security Warning

OpenShift runs
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#containers[Docker
containers] on your hosts, and in some cases, such as build operations and the
registry service, it does so using privileged containers. Furthermore, those
containers access your host's Docker daemon and perform `docker build` and
`docker push` operations. As such, you should be aware of the inherent security
risks associated with performing `docker run` operations on arbitrary images as
they effectively have root access.

For more information, see these articles:

- http://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux
- https://docs.docker.com/articles/security/

To address these risks, OpenShift uses
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#security-context-constraints[security
context constraints] that control the actions that pods can perform and what it
has the ability to access.

[[envirornment-requirements]]

== Environment Requirements

The following must be set up in your environment before OpenShift can be
installed.

[[prereq-dns]]

=== DNS

A wildcard for a DNS zone must ultimately resolve to the IP address of the
OpenShift xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#routers[router].

For example, create a wildcard DNS entry for *cloudapps*, or something similar,
that has a low TTL and points to the public IP address of the host where the
router will be deployed:

----
*.cloudapps.example.com. 300 IN  A 192.168.133.2
----

In almost all cases, when referencing VMs you must use host names, and the host
names that you use must match the output of the `hostname -f` command on each
node.

[WARNING]
====
In your *_/etc/resolv.conf_* file on each node host, ensure that the DNS server
that has the wildcard entry is not listed as a nameserver or that the wildcard
domain is not listed in the search list. Otherwise, containers managed by
OpenShift may fail to resolve host names properly.
====

[[prereq-network-access]]

=== Network Access

A shared network must exist between the master and node hosts. If you plan to
configure
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#high-availability-masters[multiple
masters for high-availability] using the xref:advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced
installation method], you must also select an IP to be configured as your
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master-components[virtual
IP] (VIP) during the installation process. The IP that you select must be
routable between all of your nodes, and if you configure using a FQDN it should
resolve on all nodes.

[[required-ports]]

*Required Ports*

OpenShift infrastructure components communicate with each other using ports,
which are communication endpoints that are identifiable for specific processes
or services. Ensure the following ports required by OpenShift are open between hosts,
for example if you have a firewall in your environment. Some ports are optional
depending on your configuration and usage.

.Node to Node
[cols='2,1,8']
|===

*(L)* indicates the marked port is also used in _loopback mode_,
enabling the master to communicate with itself.

In a single-master cluster:

- Ports marked with *(L)* must be open.
- Ports not marked with *(L)* need not be open.

In a multiple-master cluster, all the listed ports must be open.

| *24224*
|TCP/UDP
| For use by Fluentd. Required to be open on master hosts for internal
connections to node hosts.
|===

*Notes*

* In the above examples, port *4789* is used for User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
* When deployments are using the SDN, the pod network is accessed via a service proxy, unless it is accessing the registry from the same node the registry is deployed on.
* OpenShift internal DNS cannot be received over SDN. Depending on the detected values of `*openshift_facts*`, or if the `*openshift_ip*` and `*openshift_public_ip*` values are overridden, it will be the computed value of `*openshift_ip*`. For non-cloud deployments, this will default to the IP address associated with the default route on the master host. For cloud deployments, it will default to the IP address associated with the first internal interface as defined by the cloud metadata.
* The master host uses port *10250* to reach the nodes and does not go over SDN. It depends on the target host of the deployment and uses the computed values of `*openshift_hostname*` and `*openshift_public_hostname*`.

[[prereq-git]]

=== Git Access

You must have either Internet access and a GitHub account, or read and write
access to an internal, HTTP-based Git server.

[[prereq-persistent-storage]]

=== Persistent Storage

The Kubernetes
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume]
framework allows you to provision an OpenShift cluster with persistent storage
using networked storage available in your environment. This can be done after
completing the initial OpenShift installation depending on your application
needs, giving users a way to request those resources without having any
knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

The xref:../../install_config/index.adoc#install-config-index[Installation and Configuration Guide]
provides instructions for cluster administrators on provisioning an OpenShift
cluster with persistent storage using
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-nfs[NFS],
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_glusterfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-glusterfs[GlusterFS],
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_ceph_rbd.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-ceph-rbd[Ceph
RBD],
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_cinder.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-cinder[OpenStack
Cinder],

Persistent Disks], and
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_iscsi.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-iscsi[iSCSI].

[[prereq-selinux]]

=== SELinux

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) must be enabled on all of the servers before
installing OpenShift or the installer will fail. Also, configure
`*SELINUXTYPE=targeted*` in the *_/etc/selinux/config_* file:

----
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these three values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
----

[[prereq-cloud-provider-considerations]]

=== Cloud Provider Considerations

*Set up the Security Group*

When installing on AWS or OpenStack, ensure that you set up the appropriate
security groups. These are some ports that you should have in your security
groups, without which the installation will fail. You may need more depending on
the cluster configuration you want to install. For more information and to
adjust your security groups accordingly, see xref:required-ports[Required Ports]
for more information.


[cols="1,2"]
|===
|*All OpenShift Hosts*
a|tcp/22 from host running the installer/Ansible

|*etcd Security Group*
a| - tcp/2379 from masters
- tcp/2380 from etcd hosts

|*Master Security Group*
a| - tcp/8443 from 0.0.0.0/0
- tcp/53 from all OpenShift hosts
- udp/53 from all OpenShift hosts

|*Node Security Group*
a| - tcp/10250 from masters
- tcp/4789 from nodes

|*Infrastructure Nodes*
(ones that can host the `*openshift-router*`)
a|- tcp/443 from 0.0.0.0/0
- tcp/80 from 0.0.0.0/0

|===

If configuring ELBs for load balancing the masters and/or routers, you also need
to configure Ingress and Egress security groups for the ELBs appropriately.

*Override Detected IP Addresses and Host Names*

Some deployments require that the user override the detected host names and IP
addresses for the hosts. To see the default values, run the `*openshift_facts*`
playbook:

====
----
# ansible-playbook playbooks/byo/openshift_facts.yml
----
====

Now, verify the detected common settings. If they are not what you expect them
to be, you can override them.

The xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-ansible[Advanced Installation] topic discusses the available Ansible variables in greater detail.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|`*hostname*`
a| - Should resolve to the internal IP from the instances themselves.
- `*openshift_hostname*` overrides.

|`*ip*`
a| - Should be the internal IP of the instance.
- `*openshift_ip*` will overrides.

|`*public_hostname*`
a| - Should resolve to the external IP from hosts outside of the cloud.
- Provider `*openshift_public_hostname*` overrides.

|`*public_ip*`
a| - Should be the externally accessible IP associated with the instance.
- `*openshift_public_ip*` overrides.

|`*use_openshift_sdn*`
a| - Should be true unless the cloud is GCE.
- `*openshift_use_openshift_sdn*` overrides.

|===

[WARNING]
====
If `*openshift_hostname*` is set to a value other than the metadata-provided
`*private-dns-name*` value, the native cloud integration for those providers
will no longer work.
====

In AWS, situations that require overriding the variables include:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|`*hostname*`
a|The user is installing in a VPC that is not configured for both `*DNS hostnames*` and `*DNS resolution*`.

|`*ip*`
a|Possibly if they have multiple network interfaces configured and they want to
use one other than the default. You must first set
`*openshift_node_set_node_ip*` to `True`. Otherwise, the SDN would attempt to
use the `*hostname*` setting or try to resolve the host name for the IP.

|`*public_hostname*`
a| - A master instance where the VPC subnet is not configured for `*Auto-assign
Public IP*`. For external access to this master, you need to have an ELB or
other load balancer configured that would provide the external access needed, or
you need to connect over a VPN connection to the internal name of the host.
- A master instance where metadata is disabled.
- This value is not actually used by the nodes.

|`*public_ip*`
a| - A master instance where the VPC subnet is not configured for `*Auto-assign Public IP*`.
- A master instance where metadata is disabled.
- This value is not actually used by the nodes.

|===

If setting `*openshift_hostname*` to something other than the metadata-provided
`*private-dns-name*` value, the native cloud integration for those providers
will no longer work.

For EC2 hosts in particular, they must be deployed in a VPC that has both
`*DNS host names*` and `*DNS resolution*` enabled, and `*openshift_hostname*`
should not be overridden.

*Post-Installation Configuration for Cloud Providers*

Following the installation process, you can configure OpenShift for
xref:../../install_config/configuring_aws.adoc#install-config-configuring-aws[AWS],
xref:../../install_config/configuring_openstack.adoc#install-config-configuring-openstack[OpenStack], or
xref:../../install_config/configuring_gce.adoc#install-config-configuring-gce[GCE].

[[host-preparation]]

== Host Preparation

Before installing OpenShift, you must first prepare each host per the following.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
If you are using https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant] to run OpenShift Origin, you
do not need to go through the following sections. These changes are only
necessary when you are setting up the host yourself. If you are using Vagrant,
see the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.html#develop-on-virtual-machine-using-vagrant[Contributing
Guide], then you can skip directly to trying out the
xref:../../getting_started/administrators.adoc#try-it-out[sample applications].
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

[[software-prerequisites]]

=== Software Prerequisites

*Installing an Operating System*

A base installation of RHEL 7.1 or later or RHEL Atomic Host 7.1.6 or later is
required for master and node hosts. See the following documentation for the
respective installation instructions, if required:

- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/index.html[Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide]
- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/installation-and-configuration-guide/[Red
Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host 7 Installation and Configuration Guide]

*Registering the Hosts*

Each host must be registered using Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM) and have
an active OpenShift Enterprise subscription attached to access the required
packages.

. On each host, register with RHSM:
+
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<user_name> --password=<password>
----

. List the available subscriptions:
+
----
# subscription-manager list --available
----

. In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for an OpenShift
Enterprise subscription and attach it:
+
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When finding the pool ID, the related subscription name might include either
"OpenShift Enterprise" or "OpenShift Container Platform", due to the product
name change introduced with version 3.3.
====
+
If you plan to configure
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#high-availability-masters[multiple
masters] with the xref:advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation] using the
`pacemaker` HA method, you must also attach a subscription for
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/High_Availability_Add-On_Overview/index.html[High
Availability Add-on for Red Hat Enterprise Linux]:
+
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id_for_rhel_ha>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The High Availability Add-on for Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription is
provided separately from the OpenShift Enterprise subscription.
====

. Disable all repositories and enable only the required ones:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms"
----
+
If you plan to use the `pacemaker` HA method, enable the following repository as
well:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-ha-for-rhel-7-server-rpms"
----
endif::[]

*Managing Packages*

For RHEL 7 systems:

. Install the following base packages:
+
----
# yum install wget git net-tools bind-utils iptables-services bridge-utils bash-completion
----

. Update the system to the latest packages:
+
----
# yum update
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Install the following package, which provides OpenShift utilities and pulls in
other tools required by the
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick] and
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
methods, such as Ansible and related configuration files:
+
----
# yum install atomic-openshift-utils
----

. Install the following **-excluder* packages on each RHEL 7 system, which helps
ensure your systems stay on the correct versions of *atomic-openshift* and
*docker* packages when you are not trying to upgrade, according to the
{product-title} version:
+
----
# yum install atomic-openshift-excluder atomic-openshift-docker-excluder
----

. The **-excluder* packages add entries to the `exclude` directive in the host's
*_/etc/yum.conf_* file when installed. Run the following command on each host to
remove the *atomic-openshift* packages from the list for the duration of the
installation.
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder unexclude
----
endif::[]

For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems:

. Ensure the host is up to date by upgrading to the latest Atomic tree if one is
available:
+
----
# atomic host upgrade
----

. After the upgrade is completed and prepared for the next boot, reboot the
host:
+
----
# systemctl reboot
----

[[preparing-for-advanced-installations-origin]]

*Preparing for Advanced Installations*

If you plan to use the
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
method, you must install Ansible and clone the *openshift-ansible* repository from
GitHub, which provides the required playbooks and configuration files.

For convenience, the following steps are provided if you want to use EPEL as a
package source for Ansible:

. Install the EPEL repository:

*Installing Docker*

At this point, you should install Docker on all master and node hosts. This
allows you to configure your xref:configuring-docker-storage[Docker storage
options] before installing OpenShift.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Docker 1.9 is currently not supported due to performance issues. See the
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2214221[Red Hat Knowledgebase] for details,
including steps on how to configure *yum* so that later Docker versions are not
installed via `yum update`. Otherwise, running `yum update` after installing
{product-title} will upgrade Docker and put your cluster in an unsupported
configuration.
====
endif::[]

. For RHEL 7 systems, install Docker 1.8.
+
[NOTE]
====
Docker should already be installed, configured, and running by default on RHEL
Atomic Host 7 systems.
====
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The *atomic-openshift-docker-excluder* package that was installed in
xref:software-prerequisites[Software Prerequisites] should ensure that the
correct version of Docker is installed in this step:
+
----
# yum install docker
----
+
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# yum install docker-1.8.2
----
+
endif::[]
After the package installation is complete, verify that version 1.8.2 was
installed:
+
----
# docker version
----

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file and add `--insecure-registry
172.30.0.0/16` to the `*OPTIONS*` parameter. For example:
+
----
OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled --insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16'
----
+
The `--insecure-registry` option instructs the Docker daemon to trust any Docker
registry on the indicated subnet, rather than
xref:docker_registry.adoc#securing-the-registry[requiring a certificate].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
172.30.0.0/16 is the default value of the `*servicesSubnet*` variable in the
*_master-config.yaml_* file. If this has changed, then the `--insecure-registry`
value in the above step should be adjusted to match, as it is indicating the
subnet for the registry to use. Note that the `*openshift_master_portal_net*`
variable can be set in the Ansible inventory file and used during the
xref:advanced_install.adoc#configuring-ansible[advanced installation]
method to modify the `*servicesSubnet*` variable.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
After the initial OpenShift installation is complete, you can choose to
xref:docker_registry.adoc#securing-the-registry[secure the integrated Docker
registry], which involves adjusting the `--insecure-registry` option
accordingly.

[[configuring-docker-storage]]

=== Configuring Docker Storage

Docker containers and the images they are created from are stored in Docker's
storage back end. This storage is ephemeral and separate from any
xref:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[persistent storage] allocated to
meet the needs of your applications.

*For RHEL Atomic Host*

The default storage back end for Docker on RHEL Atomic Host is a thin pool
logical volume, which is supported for production environments. You must ensure
that enough space is allocated for this volume per the Docker storage
requirements mentioned in
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#system-requirements[System
Requirements].

If you do not have enough allocated, see
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/getting-started-with-containers/#managing_storage_with_docker_formatted_containers[Managing
Storage with Docker Formatted Containers] for details on using
*docker-storage-setup* and basic instructions on storage management in RHEL
Atomic Host.

*For RHEL*

The default storage back end for Docker on RHEL 7 is a thin pool on loopback
devices, which is not supported for production use and only appropriate for
proof of concept environments. For production environments, you must create a
thin pool logical volume and re-configure Docker to use that volume.

You can use the *docker-storage-setup* script included with Docker to create a
thin pool device and configure Docker's storage driver. This can be done after
installing Docker and should be done before creating images or containers. The
script reads configuration options from the
*_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_* file and supports three options for
creating the logical volume:

- *Option A)* Use an additional block device.
- *Option B)* Use an existing, specified volume group.
- *Option C)* Use the remaining free space from the volume group where your root
file system is located.

Option A is the most robust option, however it requires adding an additional
block device to your host before configuring Docker storage. Options B and C
both require leaving free space available when provisioning your host.

. Create the *docker-pool* volume using one of the following three options:

** [[docker-storage-a]]*Option A) Use an additional block device.*
+
In *_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_*, set *DEVS* to the path of the block
device you wish to use. Set *VG* to the volume group name you wish to create;
*docker-vg* is a reasonable choice. For example:
+
====
----
# cat <<EOF > /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup
DEVS=/dev/vdc
VG=docker-vg
EOF
----
====
+
Then run *docker-storage-setup* and review the output to ensure the
*docker-pool* volume was created:
+
====
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before using Docker or OpenShift, verify that the *docker-pool* logical volume
is large enough to meet your needs. The *docker-pool* volume should be 60% of
the available volume group and will grow to fill the volume group via LVM
monitoring.
====

. Check if Docker is running:

If Docker is already running, re-initialize Docker:
+
[WARNING]
====

====
+
----
# systemctl stop docker
# rm -rf /var/lib/docker/*
# systemctl restart docker
----

If there is any content in *_/var/lib/docker/_*, it must be deleted. Files
will be present if Docker has been used prior to the installation of OpenShift.

[[reconfiguring-docker-storage]]
*Reconfiguring Docker Storage*

Should you need to reconfigure Docker storage after having created the
*docker-pool*, you should first remove the *docker-pool* logical volume. If you
are using a dedicated volume group, you should also remove the volume group and
any associated physical volumes before reconfiguring *docker-storage-setup*
according to the instructions above.

See
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Logical_Volume_Manager_Administration/index.html[Logical
Volume Manager Administration] for more detailed information on LVM management.

[[managing-docker-container-logs]]
*Managing Docker Container Logs*

Sometimes a container's log file (the
*_/var/lib/docker/containers/<hash>/<hash>-json.log_* file on the node where the
container is running) can increase to a problematic size. You can manage this by
configuring Docker's `json-file` logging driver to restrict the size and number
of log files.

[options="header"]
|===

|Option |Purpose

|`--log-opt max-size`
|Sets the size at which a new log file is created.

|`--log-opt max-file`
|Sets the file on each host to configure the options.
|===

For example, to set the maximum file size to 1MB and always keep the last three
log files, edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file to configure `max-size=1M`
and `max-file=3`:
====
----
OPTIONS='--insecure-registry=172.30.0.0/16 --selinux-enabled --log-opt max-size=1M --log-opt max-file=3'
----
====

Next, restart the Docker service:
----
# systemctl restart docker
----

[[viewing-available-container-logs]]
*Viewing Available Container Logs*

Container logs are stored in the *_/var/lib/docker/containers/<hash>/_*

a user that has access to all hosts. If you want to run the installer as a
non-root user, passwordless *sudo* rights must be configured on each destination
host.

For example, you can generate an SSH key on the host where you will invoke the
installation process:

----
# ssh-keygen
----

Do *not* use a password.

An easy way to distribute your SSH keys is by using a `bash` loop:

----
# for host in master.example.com \
    node1.example.com \
    node2.example.com; \
    do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub $host; \
    done
----

Modify the host names in the above command according to your configuration.

[[setting-global-proxy]]
== Setting Global Proxy Values

The {product-title} installer uses the proxy settings
in the *_/etc/environment _* file.

Ensure the following domain suffixes and IP addresses are in the *_/etc/environment_* file in the `no_proxy` parameter:

* Master and node host names (domain suffix).
* Other internal host names (domain suffix).
* Etcd IP addresses (must be IP addresses and not host names, as *etcd* access is done by IP address).
* Docker registry IP address.
* Kubernetes IP address, by default 172.30.0.1. Must be the value set in the
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#advanced-install-networking-variables-table[`openshift_portal_net`] parameter in the 
Ansible inventory file, by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.
* Kubernetes internal domain suffix: `cluster.local`. 
* Kubernetes internal domain suffix: `.svc`.

The following example assumes `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` values are set:

----
no_proxy=.internal.example.com,10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2,10.0.0.3,.cluster.local,.svc,localhost,127.0.0.1,172.30.0.1
----

[NOTE]
====
Because `noproxy` does not support CIDR, you can use domain suffixes.
