== Overview

Frequently, portions of a datacenter may not have access to the Internet, even
via proxy servers. Installing {product-title} in these environments is
considered a disconnected installation.

An {product-title} disconnected installation differs from a regular
installation in two primary ways:

- The {product-title} software channels and repositories are not available via Red Hat’s
content distribution network.
- {product-title} uses several containerized components. Normally, these images
are pulled directly from Red Hat’s Docker registry. In a disconnected
environment, this is not possible.

A disconnected installation ensures the {product-title} software is made
available to the relevant servers, then follows the same installation process as
a standard connected installation. This topic additionally details how to
manually download the container images and transport them onto the relevant
servers.

Once installed, in order to use {product-title}, you will need source code in a
source control repository (for example, Git). This topic assumes that an
internal Git repository is available that can host source code and this
repository is accessible from the {product-title} nodes. Installing the source
control repository is outside the scope of this document.

Also, when building applications in {product-title}, your build may have some
external dependencies, such as a Maven Repository or Gem files for Ruby
applications. For this reason, and because they might require certain tags, many
of the Quickstart templates offered by {product-title} may not work on a
disconnected environment. However, while Red Hat container images try to reach out
to external repositories by default, you can configure {product-title} to use
your own internal repositories. For the purposes of this document, we assume
that such internal repositories already exist and are accessible from the
{product-title} nodes hosts. Installing such repositories is outside the scope
of this document.

[NOTE]
====
You can also have a
http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/satellite[Red Hat
Satellite] server that provides access to Red Hat content via an intranet or
LAN. For environments with Satellite, you can synchronize the {product-title}
software onto the Satellite for use with the {product-title} servers.

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-satellite/[Red Hat Satellite
6.1] also introduces the ability to act as a Docker registry, and it can be used
to host the {product-title} containerized components. Doing so is outside of the
scope of this document.
====

[[disconnected-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you understand
xref:../../architecture/index.adoc#architecture-index[{product-title}'s overall architecture] and that
you have already planned out what the topology of your environment will look
like.

[[disconnected-required-software-and-components]]
== Required Software and Components

In order to pull down the required software repositories and container images, you
will need a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 server with access to the Internet
and at least 100GB of additional free space. All steps in this section should be
performed on the Internet-connected server as the root system user.

[[disconnected-syncing-repos]]
=== Syncing Repositories

Before you sync with the required repositories, you may need to import the
appropriate GPG key:

----
# rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
----

If the key is not imported, the indicated package is deleted after syncing the repository.

To sync the required repositories:

. Register the server with the Red Hat Customer Portal. You must use the login
and password associated with the account that has access to the {product-title}
subscriptions:
+
----
# subscription-manager register
----

. Attach to a subscription that provides {product-title} channels. You can find
the list of available subscriptions using:
+
----
# subscription-manager list --available --matches '*OpenShift*'
----
+
Then, find the pool ID for the subscription that provides {product-title}, and
attach it:
+
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-fast-datapath-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.7-rpms"
----

. The `yum-utils` command provides the *reposync* utility, which lets you mirror
yum repositories, and `createrepo` can create a usable `yum` repository from a
directory:
+
----
# yum -y install yum-utils createrepo docker git
----
+
You will need up to 110GB of free space in order to sync the software. Depending
on how restrictive your organization’s policies are, you could re-connect this
server to the disconnected LAN and use it as the repository server. You could
use USB-connected storage and transport the software to another server that will
act as the repository server. This topic covers these options.

. Make a path to where you want to sync the software (either locally or on your
USB or other device):
+
----
# mkdir -p </path/to/repos>
----

. Sync the packages and create the repository for each of them. You will need to
modify the command for the appropriate path you created above:
+
----
# for repo in \
rhel-7-server-rpms \
rhel-7-server-extras-rpms \
rhel-7-fast-datapath-rpms \
rhel-7-server-ose-3.7-rpms
do
  reposync --gpgcheck -lm --repoid=${repo} --download_path=/path/to/repos
  createrepo -v </path/to/repos/>${repo} -o </path/to/repos/>${repo}
done
----

See the S2I table in the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2176281[OpenShift and Atomic Platform Tested Integrations page]
for details about OpenShift image version compatibility. 

. If you are using a stand-alone registry or plan to enable the registry console
with the integrated registry, you must pull the *registry-console* image.

[[disconnected-preparing-images-for-export]]
=== Preparing Images for Export

Container images can be exported from a system by first saving them to a tarball
and then transporting them:

. Make and change into a repository home directory:
+
----
# mkdir </path/to/repos/images>
# cd </path/to/repos/images>
----

. Export the {product-title} containerized components:

[[disconnected-repo-server]]
== Repository Server

During the installation (and for later updates, should you so choose), you will
need a webserver to host the repositories. RHEL 7 can provide the Apache
webserver.

*Option 1*: Re-configuring as a Web server

If you can re-connect the server where you synchronized the software and images
to your LAN, then you can simply install Apache on the server:

----
# yum install httpd
----

Skip to xref:disconnected-placing-the-software[Placing the Software].

*Option 2*: Building a Repository Server

If you need to build a separate server to act as the repository server, install
a new RHEL 7 system with at least 110GB of space. On this repository server
during the installation, make sure you select the *Basic Web Server* option.

[[disconnected-placing-the-software]]
=== Placing the Software

. If necessary, attach the external storage, and then copy the repository
files into Apache’s root folder. Note that the below copy step (`cp -a`) should
be substituted with move (`mv`) if you are repurposing the server you used to
sync:
+
----
# cp -a /path/to/repos /var/www/html/
# chmod -R +r /var/www/html/repos
# restorecon -vR /var/www/html
----

. Add the firewall rules:
+
----
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
# firewall-cmd --reload
----

. Enable and start Apache for the changes to take effect:
+
----
# systemctl enable httpd
# systemctl start httpd
----

== {product-title} Systems

[[disconnected-building-your-hosts]]
=== Building Your Hosts

At this point you can perform the initial creation of the hosts that will be
part of the {product-title} environment. It is recommended to use the latest version
of RHEL 7 and to perform a minimal installation. You will also
want to pay attention to the other
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[{product-title}-specific
prerequisites].

Once the hosts are initially built, the repositories can be set up.

[[disconnected-connecting-repos]]
=== Connecting the Repositories

On all of the relevant systems that will need {product-title} software
components, create the required repository definitions. Place the following text
in the *_/etc/yum.repos.d/ose.repo_* file, replacing `<server_IP>` with the IP
or host name of the Apache server hosting the software repositories:

====
----
[rhel-7-server-rpms]

=== Host Preparation

At this point, the systems are ready to continue to be prepared
xref:../../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#install-config-install-host-preparation[following

Skip the section titled *Host Registration* and start with *Installing Base Packages*.

[[disconnected-installing-openshift]]
== Installing {product-title}

[[disconnected-importing-containerized-components]]
=== Importing {product-title} Containerized Components

To import the relevant components, securely copy the images from the connected
host to the individual {product-title} hosts:

----
# scp /var/www/html/repos/images/ose3-images.tar root@<openshift_host_name>:
# ssh root@<openshift_host_name> "docker load -i ose3-images.tar"
----

If you prefer, you could use `wget` on each {product-title} host to fetch the
tar file, and then perform the Docker import command locally. Perform the same
steps for the metrics and logging images, if you synchronized them.

On the host that will act as an {product-title} master, copy and import the
builder images:

----
# scp /var/www/html/images/ose3-builder-images.tar root@<openshift_master_host_name>:
# ssh root@<openshift_master_host_name> "docker load -i ose3-builder-images.tar"

[[disconnected-running-the-openshift-installer]]
=== Running the {product-title} Installer

You can now choose to follow the
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick] or
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced]
{product-title} installation instructions in the documentation.

[[disconnected-creating-the-internal-docker-registry]]
=== Creating the Internal Docker Registry

You now need to xref:../../install_config/registry/index.adoc#install-config-registry-overview[create
the internal Docker registry].

If you want to
xref:../../install_config/install/stand_alone_registry.adoc#install-config-installing-stand-alone-registry[install
a stand-alone registry], you must xref:disconnected-syncing-images[pull the
*registry-console* container image] and set `deployment_subtype=registry` in the
inventory file.

[[disconnected-post-installation-changes]]
== Post-Installation Changes

In one of the previous steps, the S2I images were imported into the Docker
daemon running on one of the {product-title} master hosts. In a connected
installation, these images would be pulled from Red Hat’s registry on demand.
Since the Internet is not available to do this, the images must be made
available in another Docker registry.

{product-title} provides an internal registry for storing the images that are
built as a result of the S2I process, but it can also be used to hold the S2I
builder images. The following steps assume you did not customize the service IP
subnet (172.30.0.0/16) or the Docker registry port (5000).

[[disconnected-re-tagging-s2i-builder-images]]
=== Re-tagging S2I Builder Images

. On the master host where you imported the S2I builder images, obtain the
service address of your Docker registry that you installed on the master:
+
----
# export REGISTRY=$(oc get service docker-registry -t '{{.spec.clusterIP}}{{"\n"}}')
----

. Next, tag all of the builder images that you synced and exported before
pushing them into the {product-title} Docker registry. For example, if you
synced and exported only the Tomcat image:
+
----
# docker tag \
registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-webserver-3/webserver30-tomcat7-openshift:1.1 \
$REGISTRY:5000/openshift/webserver30-tomcat7-openshift:1.1
# docker tag \
registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-webserver-3/webserver30-tomcat7-openshift:latest \
$REGISTRY:5000/openshift/webserver30-tomcat7-openshift:1.2
# docker tag \

[[diconnected-configuring-registry-location]]
=== Configuring a Registry Location

If you are using an image registry other than the default at
`registry.access.redhat.com`, specify the desired registry within the
*_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file.

----
oreg_url=example.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}
openshift_examples_modify_imagestreams=true
----

Depending on your registry, you may need to configure:
----
openshift_docker_additional_registries=example.com
oopenshift_docker_insecure_registries=example.com
----

.Registry Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose
|`oreg_url`
|Set to the alternate image location. Necessary if you are not using the default
registry at `registry.access.redhat.com`.

|`openshift_examples_modify_imagestreams`
|Set to `true` if pointing to a registry other than the default. Modifies the
image stream location to the value of `oreg_url`.

|`openshift_docker_additional_registries`
|Set `openshift_docker_additional_registries` to add its value in the
`add_registry` line in *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_*. With `add_registry`, you can add
your own registry to be used for Docker search and Docker pull. Use the
`add_registry` option to list a set of registries, each prepended with
`--add-registry` flag. The first registry added will be the first registry
searched. For example, `add_registry=--add-registry registry.access.redhat.com
--add-registry example.com`.

|`openshift_docker_insecure_registries`
|Set `openshift_docker_insecure_registries` to add its value in the
`insecure_registry` line in *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_*. If you have a registry
secured with HTTPS but do not have proper certificates distributed, you can tell
Docker not to look for full authorization by adding the registry to the
`insecure_registry` line and uncommenting it. For example,
`insecure_registry--insecure-registry example.com`.
|===

[[disconnected-creating-an-admin-user]]
=== Creating an Administrative User

Pushing the container images into {product-title}'s Docker registry requires a user
with *cluster-admin* privileges. Because the default {product-title} system
administrator does not have a standard authorization token, they cannot be used
to log in to the Docker registry.

To create an administrative user:

. Create a new user account in the authentication system you are using with
{product-title}. For example, if you are using local `htpasswd`-based
authentication:
+
----
# htpasswd -b /etc/openshift/openshift-passwd <admin_username> <password>
----

. The external authentication system now has a user account, but a user must log
in to {product-title} before an account is created in the internal database. Log
in to {product-title} for this account to be created. This assumes you are using
the self-signed certificates generated by {product-title} during the
installation:
+
----
# oc login --certificate-authority=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
    -u <admin_username> https://<openshift_master_host>:8443
----

. Get the user’s authentication token:
+
----
# MYTOKEN=$(oc whoami -t)
# echo $MYTOKEN
iwo7hc4XilD2KOLL4V1O55ExH2VlPmLD-W2-JOd6Fko
----

[[disconnected-modifying-the-securitry-policies]]
=== Modifying the Security Policies

. Using `oc login` switches to the new user. Switch back to the {product-title}
system administrator in order to make policy changes:
+
----
# oc login -u system:admin
----

. In order to push images into the {product-title} Docker registry, an account
must have the `image-builder` security role. Add this to your {product-title}
administrative user:
+
----
# oadm policy add-role-to-user system:image-builder <admin_username>
----

. Next, add the administrative role to the user in the *openshift* project. This
allows the administrative user to edit the *openshift* project, and, in this
case, push the container images:
+
----
# oadm policy add-role-to-user admin <admin_username> -n openshift
----

[[disconnected-editing-the-image-stream-definitions]]
=== Editing the Image Stream Definitions

The *openshift* project is where all of the image streams for builder images are
created by the installer. They are loaded by the installer from the
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples_* directory. Change all of the definitions by
deleting the image streams which had been loaded into {product-title}'s
database, then re-create them:

. Delete the existing image streams:
+
----
# oc delete is -n openshift --all
----

. Make a backup of the files in *_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_* if you
desire. Next, edit the file *_image-streams-rhel7.json_* in the
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples/image-streams_* folder. You will find an image
stream section for each of the builder images. Edit the `*spec*` stanza to point
to your internal Docker registry.
+
For example, change:
+
====
----
"spec": {
  "dockerImageRepository": "registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7",
----
====
+
to:
+
====
----
"spec": {
  "dockerImageRepository": "172.30.69.44:5000/openshift/mongodb-26-rhel7",
----
====
+
In the above, the repository name was changed from *rhscl* to *openshift*. You
will need to ensure the change, regardless of whether the repository is *rhscl*,
*openshift3*, or another directory. Every definition should have the following
format:
+
----
<registry_ip>:5000/openshift/<image_name>
----
+
Repeat this change for every image stream in the file. Ensure you use the
correct IP address that you determined earlier. When you are finished, save and
exit. Repeat the same process for the JBoss image streams in the
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples/xpaas-streams/jboss-image-streams.json_* file.

. Load the updated image stream definitions:
+
----
# oc create -f /usr/share/openshift/examples/image-streams/image-streams-rhel7.json -n openshift
# oc create -f /usr/share/openshift/examples/xpaas-streams/jboss-image-streams.json -n openshift

=== Loading the Container Images

At this point the system is ready to load the container images.

. Log in to the Docker registry using the token and registry service IP obtained
earlier:
+
----
# docker login -u adminuser -e mailto:adminuser@abc.com \
   -p $MYTOKEN $REGISTRY:5000
----

. Push the Docker images:
+
----
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/webserver30-tomcat7-openshift:1.1
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/webserver30-tomcat7-openshift:1.2
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/webserver30-tomcat7-openshift:latest
----

. Verify that all the image streams now have the tags populated:
+
====
----
# oc get imagestreams -n openshift
