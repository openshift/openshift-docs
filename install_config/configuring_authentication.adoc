== Overview
The OpenShift
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master]
includes a built-in
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html#oauth[OAuth
server]. Developers and administrators obtain
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html#api-authentication[OAuth
access tokens] to authenticate themselves to the API.

As an administrator, you can configure OAuth using the
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html[master configuration file] to specify an
link:#identity-providers[identity provider]. If you installed OpenShift using
the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
link:../install_config/install/quick_install.html[Quick Installation] or
endif::[]
link:../install_config/install/advanced_install.html[Advanced Installation] method, the
link:#DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Deny All] identity provider is used by
default, which denies access for all user names and passwords. To allow access,
you must choose a different identity provider and configure the master
configuration file appropriately (located at
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* by default).

When running a master without a configuration file, the
link:#AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Allow All] identity provider is used by
default, which allows any non-empty user name and password to log in. This is
useful for testing purposes. To use other identity providers, or to modify any
link:#token-options[token], link:#grant-options[grant], or
link:#session-options[session options], you must run the master from a
configuration file.

[[identity-providers]]

== Identity Providers
You can configure the master host for authentication using your desired identity
provider by modifying the
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html[master configuration
file]. The following sections detail the identity providers supported by
OpenShift.

There are three parameters common to all identity providers:

[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter     | Description
|`name`      | The provider name is prefixed to provider user names to form an
identity name.
|`challenge` | When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from non-web
clients (like the CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header. Not
supported by all identity providers.

To prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against browser clients
Basic authentication challenges are only sent if a `X-CSRF-Token` header is
present on the request. Clients that expect to receive Basic `WWW-Authenticate`
challenges should set this header to a non-empty value.

|`login`     | When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from web clients
(like the web console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
Not supported by all identity providers.

|`mappingMethod`  | Defines how new identities are mapped to users when they login. See link:#mapping-identities-to-users[Mapping Identities to Users] for more information.
|===

[NOTE]
When adding or changing identity providers, you can map identities from the new
provider to existing users by setting the `*mappingMethod*` parameter to
`*add*`.

[[mapping-identities-to-users]]

=== Mapping Identities to Users

Setting the `*mappingMethod*` parameter in a
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html[master configuration file]
determines how identities are mapped to users:

====
----
...
oauthConfig:
  identityProviders:
  - name: htpasswd_auth
    challenge: true
    login: false
    mappingMethod: "claim"
...
----
====

When set to the default `*claim*` value, OAuth will fail if the identity is
mapped to a previously-existing user name. The following table outlines the use
cases for the available `*mappingMethod*` parameter values:

[cols="2,8"]
|===
|Parameter  | Description

|`*claim*` | The default value. Provisions a user with the identity's preferred
user name. Fails if a user with that user name is already mapped to another
identity.

|`*lookup*` | Looks up an existing identity, user identity mapping, and user,
but does not automatically provision users or identities. This allows cluster
administrators to set up identities and users manually, or using an external
process.

|`*generate*` | Provisions a user with the identity's preferred user name. If a
user with the preferred user name is already mapped to an existing identity, a
unique user name is generated. For example, *myuser2*. This method should not be
used in combination with external processes that require exact matches between
OpenShift user names and identity provider user names, such as LDAP group
sync.

|`*add*` | Provisions a user with the identity's preferred user name. If a user
with that user name already exists, the identity is mapped to the existing user,
adding to any existing identity mappings for the user. Required when multiple
identity providers are configured that identify the same set of users and map to
the same user names.
|===

[[AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== Allow All
Set *AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
allow any non-empty user name and password to log in. This is the default
identity provider when running OpenShift without a
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html[master configuration file].

.Master Configuration Using *AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider*
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_allow_provider <1>

      kind: AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to provider user names to form an identity
name.
<2> When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like
the CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header for this provider.
<3> When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web
console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
====

[[DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== Deny All
Set *DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
deny access for all user names and passwords.

.Master Configuration Using *DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider*
====

----

      kind: DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to provider user names to form an identity
name.
<2> When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like the
CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header for this provider.
<3> When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web
console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
====

[[HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== HTPasswd

Set *HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against a flat file generated using
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html[`htpasswd`].

Only MD5, bcrypt, and SHA encryption types are supported. MD5 encryption is recommended,
and is the default for `htpasswd`. Plaintext and crypt hashes are not currently supported.

The flat file is re-read if its modification time changes, without requiring a
server restart.

To create the file, run:

----
$ htpasswd -c </path/to/users.htpasswd> <user_name>
----

To add or update a login to the file, run:

----
$ htpasswd </path/to/users.htpasswd> <user_name>
----

To remove a login from the file, run:

----
$ htpasswd -D </path/to/users.htpasswd> <user_name>
----

.Master Configuration Using *HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider*

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:

    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider
      file: /path/to/users.htpasswd <4>
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to provider user names to form an identity
name.
<2> When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like the
CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header for this provider.
<3> When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web
console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
<4> File generated using
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html[`htpasswd`].
====

[[LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== LDAP Authentication

Set *LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against an LDAPv3 server, using simple bind
authentication.

During authentication, the LDAP directory is searched for an entry that matches
the provided user name. If a single unique match is found, a simple bind is
attempted using the distinguished name (DN) of the entry plus the provided
password. Here are the steps taken:

. Generate a search filter by combining the attribute and filter in the
configured `*url*` with the user-provided user name.
. Search the directory using the generated filter. If the search does not return
exactly one entry, deny access.
. Attempt to bind to the LDAP server using the DN of the entry retrieved from
the search, and the user-provided password.
. If the bind is unsuccessful, deny access.
. If the bind is successful, build an identity using the configured attributes
as the identity, email address, display name, and preferred user name.

[[ldap-url]]
The configured `*url*` is an RFC 2255 URL, which specifies the LDAP host and
search parameters to use. The syntax of the URL is:

----
ldap://host:port/basedn?attribute?scope?filter
----

For the above example:

[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|URL Component | Description
.^|`ldap`      | For regular LDAP, use the string `ldap`. For secure LDAP
(LDAPS), use `ldaps` instead.
.^|`host:port` | The name and port of the LDAP server. Defaults to
`localhost:389` for ldap and `localhost:636` for LDAPS.
.^|`basedn`    | The DN of the branch of the directory where all searches should
start from. At the very least, this must be the top of your directory tree, but
it could also specify a subtree in the directory.
.^|`attribute` | The attribute to search for. Although RFC 2255 allows a
comma-separated list of attributes, only the first attribute will be used, no
matter how many are provided. If no attributes are provided, the default is to
use `uid`. It is recommended to choose an attribute that will be unique across
all entries in the subtree you will be using.
.^|`scope`     | The scope of the search. Can be either either `one` or `sub`.
If the scope is not provided, the default is to use a scope of `sub`.
.^|`filter`    | A valid LDAP search filter. If not provided, defaults to
`(objectClass=*)`
|===

When doing searches, the attribute, filter, and provided user name are combined
to create a search filter that looks like:

----
(&(<filter>)(<attribute>=<username>))
----

For example, consider a URL of:

====
----
ldap://ldap.example.com/o=Acme?cn?sub?(enabled=true)
----
====

When a client attempts to connect using a user name of `bob`, the resulting
search filter will be `(&(enabled=true)(cn=bob))`.

If the LDAP directory requires authentication to search, specify a `bindDN` and
`bindPassword` to use to perform the entry search.

----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the returned user ID to form an identity
name.
<2> When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like the
CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header for this provider.
<3> When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web
console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
<4> List of attributes to use as the identity. First non-empty attribute is
used. At least one attribute is required. If none of the listed attribute have a
value, authentication fails.
<5> List of attributes to use as the email address. First non-empty attribute is
used.
<6> List of attributes to use as the display name. First non-empty attribute is
used.
<7> List of attributes to use as the preferred user name when provisioning a
user for this identity. First non-empty attribute is used.
<8> Optional DN to use to bind during the search phase.
<9> Optional password to use to bind during the search phase.
<10> Certificate bundle to use to validate server certificates for the
configured URL. If empty, system trusted roots are used. Only applies if
*insecure: false*.
<11> When *true*, no TLS connection is made to the server. When *false*,
`ldaps://` URLs connect using TLS, and `ldap://` URLs are upgraded to TLS.
<12> An RFC 2255 URL which specifies the LDAP host and search parameters to use,
link:#ldap-url[as described above].
====

[[BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== Basic Authentication (Remote)

Set *BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against a remote server using a
server-to-server Basic authentication request. User names and passwords are
validated against a remote URL that is protected by Basic authentication and
returns JSON.

A `401` response indicates failed authentication.

A non-`200` status, or the presence of a non-empty "error" key, indicates an
error:

----
{"error":"Error message"}
----

A `200` status with a `sub` (subject) key indicates success:

----
{"sub":"userid"} <1>
----
<1> The subject must be unique to the authenticated user and must not be able to
be modified.

A successful response may optionally provide additional data, such as:

* A display name using the `name` key. For example:
+
----
{"sub":"userid", "name": "User Name", ...}
----
+
* An email address using the `email` key. For example:
+
----
{"sub":"userid", "email":"user@example.com", ...}
----
+
* A preferred user name using the `preferred_username` key. This is useful when
the unique, unchangeable subject is a database key or UID, and a more
human-readable name exists. This is used as a hint when provisioning the
OpenShift user for the authenticated identity. For example:
+
----
{"sub":"014fbff9a07c", "preferred_username":"bob", ...}
----

.Master Configuration Using *BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider*

      certFile: /path/to/client.crt <6>
      keyFile: /path/to/client.key <7>
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the returned user ID to form an identity
name.
<2> When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like the
CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header for this provider.
<3> When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web
console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
<4> URL accepting credentials in Basic authentication headers.
<5> Optional: Certificate bundle to use to validate server certificates for the
configured URL.
<6> Optional: Client certificate to present when making requests to the
configured URL.
<7> Key for the client certificate. Required if `*certFile*` is specified.
====

[[RequestHeaderIdentityProvider]]

=== Request Header

Set *RequestHeaderIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
identify users from request header values, such as `X-Remote-User`. It is
typically used in combination with an authenticating proxy, which sets the
request header value. This is similar to how
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Enterprise/2/html/Deployment_Guide/Configuring_OpenShift_Enterprise_Authentication.html[the
remote user plug-in in OpenShift Enterprise 2] allowed administrators to
provide Kerberos, LDAP, and many other forms of enterprise authentication.

For users to authenticate using this identity provider, they must access
_<master>/oauth/authorize_ via an authenticating proxy. You can either proxy the
entire master API server so that all access goes through the proxy, or you can
configure the OAuth server to redirect unauthenticated requests to the proxy.

To redirect unauthenticated requests from clients expecting login flows:

1. Set the `*login*` parameter to *true*.
2. Set the `*provider.loginURL*` parameter to the proxy URL to send those clients to.

To redirect unauthenticated requests from clients expecting `WWW-Authenticate`
challenges:

1. Set the `*challenge*` parameter to *true*.
2. Set the `*provider.challengeURL*` parameter to the proxy URL to send those
clients to.

The `*provider.challengeURL*` and `*provider.loginURL*` parameters can include
the following tokens in the query portion of the URL:

* `${url}` is replaced with the current URL, escaped to be safe in a query parameter.
+
For example: `https://www.example.com/sso-login?then=${url}`

* `${query}` is replaced with the current query string, unescaped.
+
For example: `https://www.example.com/auth-proxy/oauth/authorize?${query}`

[WARNING]
====
If you expect unauthenticated requests to reach the OAuth server, a `*clientCA*`
parameter should be set for this identity provider, so that incoming requests
are checked for a valid client certificate before the request's headers are
checked for a user name. Otherwise, any direct request to the OAuth server can
impersonate any identity from this provider, merely by setting a request header.
====

----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the user name in the request header to

<2> *RequestHeaderIdentityProvider* can only respond to clients that request
`WWW-Authenticate` challenges by redirecting to a configured `challengeURL`. The
configured URL should respond with a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge.
<3> *RequestHeaderIdentityProvider* can only respond to clients requesting a
login flow by redirecting to a configured `loginURL`. The configured URL should
respond with a login flow.
<4> Optional: URL to redirect unauthenticated _/oauth/authorize_ requests to,
for clients which expect interactive logins. _${url}_ is replaced with the
current URL, escaped to be safe in a query parameter. _${query}_ is replaced
with the current query string.
<5> Optional: URL to redirect unauthenticated _/oauth/authorize_ requests to,
for clients which expect `WWW-Authenticate` challenges. _${url}_ is replaced
with the current URL, escaped to be safe in a query parameter. _${query}_ is
replaced with the current query string.
<6> Optional: PEM-encoded certificate bundle. If set, a valid client certificate
must be presented and validated against the certificate authorities in the
specified file before the request headers are checked for user names.
<7> Header names to check, in order, for user names. The first header containing
a value is used as the user name. Required, case-insensitive.
====

.Apache Authentication Using *RequestHeaderIdentityProvider*
====
This example configures an authentication proxy on the same host as the master.
Having the proxy and master on the same host is merely a convenience and may not
be suitable for your environment. For example, if you were already
link:../install_config/install/deploy_router.html[running a router] on the
master, port 443 would not be available.

It is also important to note that while this reference configuration uses
Apache's *mod_auth_form*, it is by no means required and other proxies can
easily be used if the following requirements are met:

1. Block the `X-Remote-User` header from client requests to prevent spoofing.
2. Enforce client certificate authentication in the
*RequestHeaderIdentityProvider* configuration.
3. Require the `X-Csrf-Token` header be set for all authentication request using
the challenge flow.
4. Only the _/oauth/authorize_ endpoint should be proxied, and redirects should
not be rewritten to allow the backend server to send the client to the correct
location.

*Installing the Prerequisites*

The *mod_auth_form* module is shipped as part of the *mod_session* package that
is found in the https://access.redhat.com/solutions/392003[Optional channel]:

----
# yum install -y httpd mod_ssl mod_session apr-util-openssl
----

Generate a CA for validating requests that submit the trusted header. This CA
should be used as the file name for `*clientCA*` in the
link:#requestheader-master-ca-config[master's identity provider configuration].

----
# oadm ca create-signer-cert \
  --cert='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.crt' \
  --key='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.key' \
  --name='openshift-proxy-signer@1432232228' \
  --serial='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.serial.txt'
----

Generate a client certificate for the proxy. This can be done using any x509
certificate tooling. For convenience, the `oadm` CLI can be used:

----
# oadm create-api-client-config \
  --certificate-authority='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.crt' \
  --client-dir='/etc/origin/master/proxy' \
  --signer-cert='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.crt' \
  --signer-key='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.key' \
  --signer-serial='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.serial.txt' \
  --user='system:proxy' <1>

# pushd /etc/origin/master
# cp master.server.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt <2>
# cp master.server.key /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
# cp ca.crt /etc/pki/CA/certs/ca.crt
# cat proxy/system\:proxy.crt \
  proxy/system\:proxy.key > \
  /etc/pki/tls/certs/authproxy.pem
# popd
----
<1> The user name can be anything, however it is useful to give it a descriptive
name as it will appear in logs.
<2> When running the authentication proxy on a different host name than the
master, it is important to generate a certificate that matches the host name
instead of using the default master certificate as shown above. The value for
`*masterPublicURL*` in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file
must be included in the `X509v3 Subject Alternative Name` in the certificate
that is specified for `*SSLCertificateFile*`. If a new certificate needs to be
created, the `oadm ca create-server-cert` command can be used.

*Configuring Apache*

Unlike OpenShift Enterprise 2, this proxy does not need to reside on the same
host as the master. It uses a client certificate to connect to the master, which
is configured to trust the `X-Remote-User` header.

Configure Apache per the following:

----
LoadModule auth_form_module modules/mod_auth_form.so
LoadModule session_module modules/mod_session.so
LoadModule request_module modules/mod_request.so

*Additional mod_auth_form Requirements*

A sample login page is available from the
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/tree/master/misc/form_auth[openshift_extras]
repository. This file should be placed in the `*DocumentRoot*` location
(*_/var/www/html_* by default).

*Creating Users*

At this point, you can create the users in the system Apache is using to store
accounts information. In this example, file-backed authentication is used:

----
# yum -y install httpd-tools
# touch /etc/origin/htpasswd
# htpasswd -c /etc/origin/htpasswd <user_name>
----

*Configuring the Master*

[[requestheader-master-ca-config]]
The `*identityProviders*` stanza in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file must be updated as well:

----

    challenge: true
    login: true
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: RequestHeaderIdentityProvider

      clientCA: /etc/origin/master/proxyca.crt
      headers:
      - X-Remote-User
----

*Restarting Services*

Finally, restart the following services:

----
# systemctl restart httpd
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# systemctl restart origin-master
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
endif::[]
----

*Verifying the Configuration*

. Test by bypassing the proxy. You should be able to request a token if you
supply the correct client certificate and header:
+
----
# curl -L -k -H "X-Remote-User: joe" \
   --cert /etc/pki/tls/certs/authproxy.pem \
   https://[MASTER]:8443/oauth/token/request
----

. If you do not supply the client certificate, the request should be denied:
+
----
# curl -L -k -H "X-Remote-User: joe" \
   https://[MASTER]:8443/oauth/token/request
----

. This should show a redirect to the configured `*challengeURL*` (with
additional query parameters):
+
----
# curl -k -v -H 'X-Csrf-Token: 1' \
   '<masterPublicURL>/oauth/authorize?client_id=openshift-challenging-client&response_type=token'
----

. This should show a 401 response with a `WWW-Authenticate` basic challenge:
+
----
#  curl -k -v -H 'X-Csrf-Token: 1' \
    '<redirected challengeURL from step 3 +query>'
----

. This should show a redirect with an access token:
+
----
#  curl -k -v -u <your_user>:<your_password> \
    -H 'X-Csrf-Token: 1' '<redirected_challengeURL_from_step_3 +query>'

[[OpenID]]

=== OpenID Connect

Set *OpenIDIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to integrate
with an OpenID Connect identity provider using an
link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authorization
Code Flow].

[NOTE]
====
*ID Token* and *UserInfo* decryptions are not supported.
====

By default, the *openid* scope is requested. If required, extra scopes can be
specified in the `*extraScopes*` field.

Claims are read from the JWT `id_token` returned from the OpenID identity
provider and, if specified, from the JSON returned by the `*UserInfo*` URL.

At least one claim must be configured to use as the user's identity. The
link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[standard
identity claim] is `sub`.

You can also indicate which claims to use as the user's preferred user name,
display name, and email address. If multiple claims are specified, the first one
with a non-empty value is used. The
link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[standard
claims] are:

[horizontal]
`sub`:: The user identity.
`preferred_username`:: The preferred user name when provisioning a user.
`email`:: Email address.
`name`:: Display name.

[[token-options]]

== Token Options

The OAuth server generates two kinds of tokens:

[horizontal]
Access tokens:: Longer-lived tokens that grant access to the API.
Authorize codes:: Short-lived tokens whose only use is to be exchanged for
an access token.

Use the `*tokenConfig*` stanza to set token options:

.Master Configuration Token Options
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  tokenConfig:
    accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 86400 <1>
    authorizeTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 300 <2>
----
<1> Set `*accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds*` to control the lifetime of access tokens.
The default lifetime is 24 hours.
<2> Set `*authorizeTokenMaxAgeSeconds*` to control the lifetime of authorize
codes. The default lifetime is five minutes.
====

[[grant-options]]

== Grant Options

To configure how the OAuth server responds to token requests for a client the
user has not previously granted permission, set the `*method*` value in the
`*grantConfig*` stanza. Valid values for `*method*` are:

[horizontal]
`auto`:: Auto-approve the grant and retry the request.
`prompt`:: Prompt the user to approve or deny the grant.
`deny`:: Auto-deny the grant and return a failure error to the client.

.Master Configuration Grant Options
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  grantConfig:
    method: auto
----
====

[[session-options]]

== Session Options

The OAuth server uses a signed and encrypted cookie-based session during login
and redirect flows.

Use the `*sessionConfig*` stanza to set session options:

.Master Configuration Session Options
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  sessionConfig:
    sessionMaxAgeSeconds: 300 <1>
    sessionName: ssn <2>
    sessionSecretsFile: "..." <3>
----
<1> Controls the maximum age of a session; sessions auto-expire once a token
request is complete. If link:#grant-options[auto-grant] is not enabled, sessions
must last as long as the user is expected to take to approve or reject a client
authorization request.
<2> Name of the cookie used to store the session.
<3> File name containing serialized `*SessionSecrets*` object. If empty, a
random signing and encryption secret is generated at each server start.
====

If no `*sessionSecretsFile*` is specified, a random signing and encryption
secret is generated at each start of the master server. This means that any
logins in progress will have their sessions invalidated if the master is
restarted. It also means that if multiple masters are configured, they will not
be able to decode sessions generated by one of the other masters.

To specify the signing and encryption secret to use, specify a
`*sessionSecretsFile*`. This allows you separate secret values from the
configuration file and keep the configuration file distributable, for example
for debugging purposes.

Multiple secrets can be specified in the `*sessionSecretsFile*` to enable
rotation. New sessions are signed and encrypted using the first secret in the
list. Existing sessions are decrypted and authenticated by each secret until one
succeeds.

.Session Secret Configuration:
====

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: SessionSecrets
secrets: <1>
- authentication: "..." <2>
  encryption: "..." <3>
- authentication: "..."
  encryption: "..."
...
----
<1> List of secrets used to authenticate and encrypt cookie sessions. At least
one secret must be specified. Each secret must set an authentication and
encryption secret.
<2> Signing secret, used to authenticate sessions using HMAC. Recommended to use
a secret with 32 or 64 bytes.
<3> Encrypting secret, used to encrypt sessions. Must be 16, 24, or 32
characters long, to select AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256.
