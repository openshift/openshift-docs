== Overview
The {product-title}
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master]
includes a built-in
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#oauth[OAuth
server]. Developers and administrators obtain
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#api-authentication[OAuth
access tokens] to authenticate themselves to the API.

As an administrator, you can configure OAuth using the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[master configuration file] to specify an
xref:identity-providers[identity provider].
This can be done during an
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-cluster-variables[advanced installation] or configured after installation.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} user names containing `/`, `:`, and `%` are not supported. 
====

If you installed {product-title} using
the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
xref:../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[Quick Installation] or
endif::[]
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced Installation]
method, the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
xref:DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Deny All] identity provider is
used by default, which denies access for all user names and
passwords. To allow access, you must choose a different identity provider and
configure the master configuration file appropriately (located at
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* by default).
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
xref:AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Allow All] identity provider is
used by default, which allows access for all user names and
passwords.
endif::[]

When running a master without a configuration file, the
xref:AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Allow All] identity provider is used by
default, which allows any non-empty user name and password to log in. This is
useful for testing purposes. To use other identity providers, or to modify any
xref:token-options[token], xref:grant-options[grant], or
xref:session-options[session options], you must run the master from a
configuration file.

[NOTE]
====
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[Roles] need
to be assigned to administer the setup with an external user.
====

[NOTE]
====
After making changes to an identity provider, you must restart the master services for the changes to take effect:

----
# systemctl systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers

== Configuring Identity Providers with Ansible

For initial xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installations], the
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Deny All] identity provider is configured by default,
though it can be
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-ansible[overridden during installation] using the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-cluster-variables[`*openshift_master_identity_providers*` parameter], which is configurable in the inventory file.
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#advanced-install-session-options[Session options in the OAuth configuration] are also configurable in the inventory file.

[[identity-providers]]
== Identity Providers
You can configure the master host for authentication using your desired identity
provider by modifying the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[master configuration
file]. The following sections detail the identity providers supported by
{product-title}.

There are four parameters common to all identity providers:

[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter     | Description
|`name`      | The provider name is prefixed to provider user names to form an
identity name.
|`challenge` | When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from non-web
clients (like the CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header. Not
supported by all identity providers.

To prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against browser clients
Basic authentication challenges are only sent if a `X-CSRF-Token` header is
present on the request. Clients that expect to receive Basic `WWW-Authenticate`
challenges should set this header to a non-empty value.

|`login`     | When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from web clients
(like the web console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
Not supported by all identity providers.

If you want users to be sent to a branded page before being redirected to
the identity provider's login, then set `*oauthConfig -> alwaysShowProviderSelection: true*`
in the master configuration file. This provider selection page can be
xref:../install_config/web_console_customization.adoc#customizing-the-login-page[customized].

|`mappingMethod`  | Defines how new identities are mapped to users when they login. See xref:mapping-identities-to-users[Mapping Identities to Users] for more information.
|===

[NOTE]
When adding or changing identity providers, you can map identities from the new
provider to existing users by setting the `*mappingMethod*` parameter to
`*add*`.

[[mapping-identities-to-users]]

=== Mapping Identities to Users

Setting the `*mappingMethod*` parameter in a
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[master configuration file]
determines how identities are mapped to users:

====
----
...
oauthConfig:
  identityProviders:
  - name: htpasswd_auth
    challenge: true
    login: false
    mappingMethod: "claim"
...
----
====

When set to the default `*claim*` value, OAuth will fail if the identity is
mapped to a previously-existing user name. The following table outlines the use
cases for the available `*mappingMethod*` parameter values:

[cols="2,8"]
|===
|Parameter  | Description

|`*claim*` | The default value. Provisions a user with the identity's preferred
user name. Fails if a user with that user name is already mapped to another
identity.

|`*lookup*` | Looks up an existing identity, user identity mapping, and user,
but does not automatically provision users or identities. This allows cluster
administrators to set up identities and users manually, or using an external
process. Using this method requires you to manually provision users. See
xref:LookupMappingMethod[Manually Provisioning a User When Using the Lookup Mapping Method].

|`*generate*` | Provisions a user with the identity's preferred user name. If a
user with the preferred user name is already mapped to an existing identity, a
unique user name is generated. For example, *myuser2*. This method should not be
used in combination with external processes that require exact matches between
{product-title} user names and identity provider user names, such as LDAP group
sync.

|`*add*` | Provisions a user with the identity's preferred user name. If a user
with that user name already exists, the identity is mapped to the existing user,
adding to any existing identity mappings for the user. Required when multiple
identity providers are configured that identify the same set of users and map to
the same user names.
|===

[[LookupMappingMethod]]
==== Manually Provisioning a User When Using the Lookup Mapping Method

When using the `lookup` mapping method, user provisioning is done by an external system, via the API.
Typically, identities are automatically mapped to users during login. The 'lookup' mapping method automatically
disables this automatic mapping, which requires you to provision users manually.

For more information on identity objects, see the xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/other_api_objects.adoc#identity[Identity]
user API obejct.

If you are using the `lookup` mapping method, use the following steps for each user after configuring
the identity provider:

. Create an {product-title} User, if not created already:
+
----
$ oc create user <username>
----
+
For example, the following command creates a {product-title} User `bob`:
+
----
$ oc create user bob
----

. Create an {product-title} Identity, if not created already. Use the name of the identity provider and
the name that uniquely represents this identity in the scope of the identity provider:
+
----
$ oc create identity <identity-provider>:<user-id-from-identity-provider>
----
+
The `<identity-provider>` is the name of the identity provider in the master configuration,
as shown in the appropriate identity provider section below.
+
For example, the following commands creates an Identity with identity provider `ldap_provider` and the identity provider user name `bob_s`.
+
----
$ oc create identity ldap_provider:bob_s
----

. Create a user/identity mapping for the created user and identity:
+
----
$ oc create useridentitymapping <identity-provider>:<user-id-from-identity-provider> <username>
----
+
For example, the following command maps the identity to the user:
+
----
$ oc create useridentitymapping ldap_provider:bob_s bob
----

[[AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== Allow All
Set *AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
allow any non-empty user name and password to log in. This is the default
identity provider when running {product-title} without a
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[master configuration file].

====

[[HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== HTPasswd

Set *HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against a flat file generated using
link:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html[`htpasswd`].

[NOTE]
====
The `htpasswd` utility is in the `httpd-tools` package:

----
# yum install httpd-tools
----
====

{product-title} supports the Bcrypt, SHA-1, and MD5 cryptographic hash
functions, and MD5 is the default for `htpasswd`. Plaintext, encrypted text, and
other hash functions are not currently supported.

The flat file is reread if its modification time changes, without requiring a
server restart.

To use the htpasswd command:

// tag::htpasswd[]

* To create a flat file with a user name and hashed password, run:
+
----
$ htpasswd -c </path/to/users.htpasswd> <user_name>
----
+
Then, enter and confirm a clear-text password for the user. The command generates a hashed version of the password.
+
For example:
+
----
htpasswd -c users.htpasswd user1
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user user1
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can include the `-b` option to supply the password on the command line:

----
$ htpasswd -c -b <user_name> <password>
----

For example:
----
$ htpasswd -c -b file user1 MyPassword!
Adding password for user user1
----
====

// end::htpasswd[]

* To add or update a login to the file, run:
+
----
$ htpasswd </path/to/users.htpasswd> <user_name>
----

* To remove a login from the file, run:
+
----
$ htpasswd -D </path/to/users.htpasswd> <user_name>
----

[[KeystonePasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== Keystone

Set *KeystonePasswordIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against an OpenStack Keystone v3 server.
This enables shared authentication with an OpenStack server configured to store
users in an internal Keystone database.

.Master Configuration Using *KeystonePasswordIdentityProvider*

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_keystone_provider <1>

----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to provider user names to form an identity name.
<2> When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like the
CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header for this provider.
<3> When *true*, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web

<4> Controls how mappings are established between this provider's identities and user objects,
xref:mapping-identities-to-users[as described above].
<5> Keystone domain name. In Keystone, usernames are domain-specific. Only a single domain is supported.
<6> The URL to use to connect to the Keystone server (required). 
<7> Optional: Certificate bundle to use to validate server certificates for the configured URL.
<8> Optional: Client certificate to present when making requests to the configured URL.
<9> Key for the client certificate. Required if `*certFile*` is specified.
====

[[LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== LDAP Authentication

Set *LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against an LDAPv3 server, using simple bind
authentication.

// tag::ldapblurb[]

During authentication, the LDAP directory is searched for an entry that matches
the provided user name. If a single unique match is found, a simple bind is
attempted using the distinguished name (DN) of the entry plus the provided
password.

// end::ldapblurb[]

These are the steps taken:

. Generate a search filter by combining the attribute and filter in the
configured `*url*` with the user-provided user name.
. Search the directory using the generated filter. If the search does not return
exactly one entry, deny access.
. Attempt to bind to the LDAP server using the DN of the entry retrieved from
the search, and the user-provided password.
. If the bind is unsuccessful, deny access.
. If the bind is successful, build an identity using the configured attributes
as the identity, email address, display name, and preferred user name.

[[ldap-url]]
The configured `*url*` is an RFC 2255 URL, which specifies the LDAP host and
search parameters to use. The syntax of the URL is:

----
ldap://host:port/basedn?attribute?scope?filter
----

For the above example:

[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|URL Component | Description
.^|`ldap`      | For regular LDAP, use the string `ldap`. For secure LDAP
(LDAPS), use `ldaps` instead.
.^|`host:port` | The name and port of the LDAP server. Defaults to
`localhost:389` for ldap and `localhost:636` for LDAPS.
.^|`basedn`    | The DN of the branch of the directory where all searches should
start from. At the very least, this must be the top of your directory tree, but
it could also specify a subtree in the directory.
.^|`attribute` | The attribute to search for. Although RFC 2255 allows a
comma-separated list of attributes, only the first attribute will be used, no
matter how many are provided. If no attributes are provided, the default is to
use `uid`. It is recommended to choose an attribute that will be unique across
all entries in the subtree you will be using.
.^|`scope`     | The scope of the search. Can be either either `one` or `sub`.
If the scope is not provided, the default is to use a scope of `sub`.
.^|`filter`    | A valid LDAP search filter. If not provided, defaults to
`(objectClass=*)`
|===

When doing searches, the attribute, filter, and provided user name are combined
to create a search filter that looks like:

----
(&(<filter>)(<attribute>=<username>))
----

For example, consider a URL of:

----
ldap://ldap.example.com/o=Acme?cn?sub?(enabled=true)
----

When a client attempts to connect using a user name of `bob`, the resulting
search filter will be `(&(enabled=true)(cn=bob))`.

If the LDAP directory requires authentication to search, specify a `bindDN` and
`bindPassword` to use to perform the entry search.

[NOTE]
====
To whitelist users for an LDAP integration, use the `lookup` mapping method.
Before a login from LDAP would be allowed, a cluster administrator must create
an identity and user object for each LDAP user.
====

[[BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== Basic Authentication (Remote)

Set *BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against a remote server using a
server-to-server Basic authentication request. User names and passwords are
validated against a remote URL that is protected by Basic authentication and
returns JSON.

A `401` response indicates failed authentication.

A non-`200` status, or the presence of a non-empty "error" key, indicates an
error:

----
{"error":"Error message"}
----

A `200` status with a `sub` (subject) key indicates success:

----
{"sub":"userid"} <1>
----
<1> The subject must be unique to the authenticated user and must not be able to
be modified.

A successful response may optionally provide additional data, such as:

* A display name using the `name` key. For example:
+
----
{"sub":"userid", "name": "User Name", ...}
----
+
* An email address using the `email` key. For example:
+
----
{"sub":"userid", "email":"user@example.com", ...}
----
+
* A preferred user name using the `preferred_username` key. This is useful when
the unique, unchangeable subject is a database key or UID, and a more
human-readable name exists. This is used as a hint when provisioning the
{product-title} user for the authenticated identity. For example:
+
----
{"sub":"014fbff9a07c", "preferred_username":"bob", ...}

====

[[RequestHeaderIdentityProvider]]
=== Request Header

Set *RequestHeaderIdentityProvider* in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
identify users from request header values, such as `X-Remote-User`. It is
typically used in combination with an authenticating proxy, which sets the
request header value. This is similar to how
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Enterprise/2/html/Deployment_Guide/Configuring_OpenShift_Enterprise_Authentication.html[the remote user plug-in in OpenShift Enterprise 2] allowed administrators to
provide Kerberos, LDAP, and many other forms of enterprise authentication.

For users to authenticate using this identity provider, they must access
`\https://<master>/oauth/authorize` (and subpaths) via an authenticating proxy.
To accomplish this, configure the OAuth server to redirect unauthenticated
requests for OAuth tokens to the proxy endpoint that proxies to `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize`.

To redirect unauthenticated requests from clients expecting browser-based login flows:

1. Set the `*login*` parameter to *true*.
2. Set the `*provider.loginURL*` parameter to the authenticating proxy URL that
will authenticate interactive clients and then proxy the request to `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize`.

To redirect unauthenticated requests from clients expecting `WWW-Authenticate` challenges:

1. Set the `*challenge*` parameter to *true*.
2. Set the `*provider.challengeURL*` parameter to the authenticating proxy URL that
will authenticate clients expecting `WWW-Authenticate` challenges and then proxy
the request to `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize`.

[[RequestHeaderIDP-urlquerytokens]]

The `*provider.challengeURL*` and `*provider.loginURL*` parameters can include
the following tokens in the query portion of the URL:

* `${url}` is replaced with the current URL, escaped to be safe in a query parameter.
+
For example: `\https://www.example.com/sso-login?then=${url}`

* `${query}` is replaced with the current query string, unescaped.
+
For example: `\https://www.example.com/auth-proxy/oauth/authorize?${query}`

[WARNING]
====
If you expect unauthenticated requests to reach the OAuth server, a `*clientCA*`
parameter MUST be set for this identity provider, so that incoming requests
are checked for a valid client certificate before the request's headers are
checked for a user name. Otherwise, any direct request to the OAuth server can
impersonate any identity from this provider, merely by setting a request header.

.Apache Authentication Using *RequestHeaderIdentityProvider*
====
This example configures an authentication proxy on the same host as the master.
Having the proxy and master on the same host is merely a convenience and may not
be suitable for your environment. For example, if you were already
xref:../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[running a router] on the
master, port 443 would not be available.

It is also important to note that while this reference configuration uses
Apache's *mod_auth_form*, it is by no means required and other proxies can
easily be used if the following requirements are met:

1. Block the `X-Remote-User` header from client requests to prevent spoofing.
2. Enforce client certificate authentication in the *RequestHeaderIdentityProvider* configuration.
3. Require the `X-Csrf-Token` header be set for all authentication request using the challenge flow.
4. Only the `/oauth/authorize` endpoint and its subpaths should be proxied,
and redirects should not be rewritten to allow the backend server to send the client to the correct
location.
5. The URL that proxies to `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize` must end with `/authorize` (with no trailing slash). For example:
  * `\https://proxy.example.com/login-proxy/authorize?...` -> `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize?...`
6. Subpaths of the URL that proxies to `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize` must proxy to subpaths of `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize`. For example:
  * `\https://proxy.example.com/login-proxy/authorize/approve?...` -> `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize/approve?...`

*Installing the Prerequisites*

The *mod_auth_form* module is shipped as part of the *mod_session* package that
is found in the link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/392003[Optional channel]:

----
# yum install -y httpd mod_ssl mod_session apr-util-openssl
----

Generate a CA for validating requests that submit the trusted header. This CA
should be used as the file name for `*clientCA*` in the
xref:requestheader-master-ca-config[master's identity provider configuration].

----
# oc adm ca create-signer-cert \
  --cert='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.crt' \
  --key='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.key' \
  --name='openshift-proxy-signer@1432232228' \
  --serial='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.serial.txt'
----

[NOTE]
The `oc adm ca create-signer-cert` command generates a certificate that is valid
for five years. This can be altered with the `--expire-days` option, but for
security reasons, it is recommended to not make it greater than this
value.

Generate a client certificate for the proxy. This can be done using any x509
certificate tooling. For convenience, the `oc adm` CLI can be used:

----
# oc adm create-api-client-config \
  --certificate-authority='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.crt' \
  --client-dir='/etc/origin/master/proxy' \
  --signer-cert='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.crt' \
  --signer-key='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.key' \
  --signer-serial='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.serial.txt' \
  --user='system:proxy' <1>

# pushd /etc/origin/master
# cp master.server.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt <2>
# cp master.server.key /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
# cp ca.crt /etc/pki/CA/certs/ca.crt
# cat proxy/system\:proxy.crt \
  proxy/system\:proxy.key > \
  /etc/pki/tls/certs/authproxy.pem
# popd
----
<1> The user name can be anything, however it is useful to give it a descriptive
name as it will appear in logs.
<2> When running the authentication proxy on a different host name than the
master, it is important to generate a certificate that matches the host name
instead of using the default master certificate as shown above. The value for
`*masterPublicURL*` in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file
must be included in the `X509v3 Subject Alternative Name` in the certificate
that is specified for `*SSLCertificateFile*`. If a new certificate needs to be
created, the `oc adm ca create-server-cert` command can be used.

[NOTE]
The `oc adm create-api-client-config` command generates a certificate that is
valid for two years. This can be altered with the `--expire-days` option, but
for security reasons, it is recommended to not make it greater than
this value.

*Configuring Apache*

Unlike OpenShift Enterprise 2, this proxy does not need to reside on the same
host as the master. It uses a client certificate to connect to the master, which
is configured to trust the `X-Remote-User` header.

Configure Apache per the following:

----
LoadModule auth_form_module modules/mod_auth_form.so
LoadModule session_module modules/mod_session.so
LoadModule request_module modules/mod_request.so

# Nothing needs to be served over HTTP.  This virtual host simply redirects to
# HTTPS.

  RewriteRule     ^(.*)$     https://%{HTTP_HOST}$1 [R,L]
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
  # This needs to match the certificates you generated.  See the CN and X509v3
  # Subject Alternative Name in the output of:

  SSLProxyEngine on
  SSLProxyCACertificateFile /etc/pki/CA/certs/ca.crt
  # It's critical to enforce client certificates on the Master.  Otherwise
  # requests could spoof the X-Remote-User header by accessing the Master's
  # /oauth/authorize endpoint directly.
  SSLProxyMachineCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/authproxy.pem

  # Send all requests to the console
  RewriteEngine              On
  RewriteRule     ^/console(.*)$     https://%{HTTP_HOST}:8443/console$1 [R,L]

  # In order to using the challenging-proxy an X-Csrf-Token must be present.
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/challenging-proxy
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Csrf-Token} ^$ [NC]
  RewriteRule ^.* - [F,L]

    # For ldap:
    # AuthBasicProvider ldap
    # AuthLDAPURL "ldap://ldap.example.com:389/ou=People,dc=my-domain,dc=com?uid?sub?(objectClass=*)"

    # It's possible to remove the mod_auth_form usage and replace it with
    # something like mod_auth_kerb, mod_auth_gssapi or even mod_auth_mellon.
    # The former would be able to support both the login and challenge flows
    # from the Master.  Mellon would likely only support the login flow.

    # For Kerberos
    # yum install mod_auth_gssapi
    # AuthType GSSAPI
    # GssapiCredStore keytab:/etc/httpd.keytab
  </ProxyMatch>

</VirtualHost>

RequestHeader unset X-Remote-User
----

*Additional mod_auth_form Requirements*

A sample login page is available from the
link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/tree/master/misc/form_auth[openshift_extras]
repository. This file should be placed in the `*DocumentRoot*` location
(*_/var/www/html_* by default).

*Creating Users*

At this point, you can create the users in the system Apache is using to store
accounts information. In this example, file-backed authentication is used:

----
# yum -y install httpd-tools
# touch /etc/origin/master/htpasswd
# htpasswd /etc/origin/master/htpasswd <user_name>
----

*Configuring the Master*

[[requestheader-master-ca-config]]
The `*identityProviders*` stanza in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file must be updated as well:

----
  identityProviders:
  - name: requestheader
    challenge: true
    login: true
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: RequestHeaderIdentityProvider
      challengeURL: "https://[MASTER]/challenging-proxy/oauth/authorize?${query}"
      loginURL: "https://[MASTER]/login-proxy/oauth/authorize?${query}"
      clientCA: /etc/origin/master/proxyca.crt
      headers:
      - X-Remote-User
----

*Restarting Services*

Finally, restart the following services:

----
# systemctl restart httpd
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers
endif::[]
----

*Verifying the Configuration*

. Test by bypassing the proxy. You should be able to request a token if you
supply the correct client certificate and header:
+
----
# curl -L -k -H "X-Remote-User: joe" \
   --cert /etc/pki/tls/certs/authproxy.pem \
   https://[MASTER]:8443/oauth/token/request
----

. If you do not supply the client certificate, the request should be denied:
+
----
# curl -L -k -H "X-Remote-User: joe" \
   https://[MASTER]:8443/oauth/token/request
----

. This should show a redirect to the configured `*challengeURL*` (with
additional query parameters):
+
----
# curl -k -v -H 'X-Csrf-Token: 1' \
   '<masterPublicURL>/oauth/authorize?client_id=openshift-challenging-client&response_type=token'
----

. This should show a 401 response with a `WWW-Authenticate` basic challenge:
+
----
#  curl -k -v -H 'X-Csrf-Token: 1' \
    '<redirected challengeURL from step 3 +query>'
----

. This should show a redirect with an access token:
+
----
#  curl -k -v -u <your_user>:<your_password> \
    -H 'X-Csrf-Token: 1' '<redirected_challengeURL_from_step_3 +query>'
----

[[token-options]]

== Token Options

The OAuth server generates two kinds of tokens:

[horizontal]
Access tokens:: Longer-lived tokens that grant access to the API.
Authorize codes:: Short-lived tokens whose only use is to be exchanged for
an access token.

Use the `*tokenConfig*` stanza to set token options:

.Master Configuration Token Options
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  tokenConfig:
    accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 86400 <1>
    authorizeTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 300 <2>
----
<1> Set `*accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds*` to control the lifetime of access tokens.
The default lifetime is 24 hours.
<2> Set `*authorizeTokenMaxAgeSeconds*` to control the lifetime of authorize
codes. The default lifetime is five minutes.
====

[[grant-options]]

== Grant Options

When the OAuth server receives token requests for a client to which the user
has not previously granted permission, the action that the OAuth server takes
is dependent on the OAuth client's grant strategy.

When the OAuth client requesting token does not provide its own grant strategy,
the server-wide default strategy is used. To configure the default strategy,
set the `*method*` value in the `*grantConfig*` stanza. Valid values for
`*method*` are:

[horizontal]
`auto`:: Auto-approve the grant and retry the request.
`prompt`:: Prompt the user to approve or deny the grant.
`deny`:: Auto-deny the grant and return a failure error to the client.

.Master Configuration Grant Options
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  grantConfig:
    method: auto
----
====

[[session-options]]

== Session Options

The OAuth server uses a signed and encrypted cookie-based session during login
and redirect flows.

Use the `*sessionConfig*` stanza to set session options:

.Master Configuration Session Options
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  sessionConfig:
    sessionMaxAgeSeconds: 300 <1>
    sessionName: ssn <2>
    sessionSecretsFile: "..." <3>
----
<1> Controls the maximum age of a session; sessions auto-expire once a token
request is complete. If xref:grant-options[auto-grant] is not enabled, sessions
must last as long as the user is expected to take to approve or reject a client
authorization request.
<2> Name of the cookie used to store the session.
<3> File name containing serialized `*SessionSecrets*` object. If empty, a
random signing and encryption secret is generated at each server start.
====

If no `*sessionSecretsFile*` is specified, a random signing and encryption
secret is generated at each start of the master server. This means that any
logins in progress will have their sessions invalidated if the master is
restarted. It also means that if multiple masters are configured, they will not
be able to decode sessions generated by one of the other masters.

To specify the signing and encryption secret to use, specify a
`*sessionSecretsFile*`. This allows you separate secret values from the
configuration file and keep the configuration file distributable, for example
for debugging purposes.

Multiple secrets can be specified in the `*sessionSecretsFile*` to enable
rotation. New sessions are signed and encrypted using the first secret in the
list. Existing sessions are decrypted and authenticated by each secret until one
succeeds.

.Session Secret Configuration:
====

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: SessionSecrets
secrets: <1>
- authentication: "..." <2>
  encryption: "..." <3>
- authentication: "..."
  encryption: "..."
...
----
<1> List of secrets used to authenticate and encrypt cookie sessions. At least
one secret must be specified. Each secret must set an authentication and
encryption secret.
<2> Signing secret, used to authenticate sessions using HMAC. Recommended to use
a secret with 32 or 64 bytes.
<3> Encrypting secret, used to encrypt sessions. Must be 16, 24, or 32
characters long, to select AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256.

[[configuring-user-agent]]
== Preventing CLI Version Mismatch With User Agent

{product-title} implements a user agent that can be used to prevent an
application developer's CLI accessing the {product-title} API.

User agents for the {product-title} CLI are constructed from a set of values
within {product-title}:

----
<command>/<version> (<platform>/<architecture>) <client>/<git_commit>
----

So, for example, when:

* <command> = `oc`
* <version> = The client version. For example, `v3.3.0`. Requests made against the Kubernetes
API at `/api` receive the Kubernetes version, while requests made against the
{product-title} API at `/oapi` receive the {product-title} version (as specified
by `oc version`)
* <platform> = `linux`
* <architecture> = `amd64`
* <client> = `openshift`, or `kubernetes` depending on if the request is made against the Kubernetes API at `/api`, or the {product-title} API at `/oapi`
* <git_commit> = The Git commit of the client version (for example, `f034127`)

the user agent will be:

----
oc/v3.3.0 (linux/amd64) openshift/f034127
----

As an {product-title} administrator, you can prevent clients from accessing the
API with the `*userAgentMatching*` configuration setting of a master
configuration. So, if a client is using a particular library or
binary, they will be prevented from accessing the API.

The following user agent example denies the Kubernetes 1.2 client binary,
OpenShift Origin 1.1.3 binary, and the POST and PUT *httpVerbs*:

====
----
policyConfig:
  userAgentMatchingConfig:
    defaultRejectionMessage: "Your client is too old.  Go to https://example.org to update it."
    deniedClients:
    - regex: '\w+/v(?:(?:1\.1\.1)|(?:1\.0\.1)) \(.+/.+\) openshift/\w{7}'
    - regex: '\w+/v(?:1\.1\.3) \(.+/.+\) openshift/\w{7}'
      httpVerbs:
      - POST
      - PUT
    - regex: '\w+/v1\.2\.0 \(.+/.+\) kubernetes/\w{7}'
      httpVerbs:
      - POST
      - PUT
    requiredClients: null
----
====

Administrators can also deny clients that do not exactly match the expected
clients:

====
----
policyConfig:
  userAgentMatchingConfig:
    defaultRejectionMessage: "Your client is too old.  Go to https://example.org to update it."
    deniedClients: []
    requiredClients:
    - regex: '\w+/v1\.1\.3 \(.+/.+\) openshift/\w{7}'
    - regex: '\w+/v1\.2\.0 \(.+/.+\) kubernetes/\w{7}'
      httpVerbs:
      - POST
      - PUT
----
====

[NOTE]
====
When the client's user agent mismatches the configuration, errors occur. To
ensure that mutating requests match, enforce a whitelist. Rules are mapped to
specific verbs, so you can ban mutating requests while allowing non-mutating
requests.
