== Overview
OpenShift can be configured to access an
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[AWS EC2
infrastructure], including
link:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_aws.html[using AWS
volumes as persistent storage] for application data. After AWS is configured
properly, some additional configurations will need to be completed on the
OpenShift hosts.


== Configuring AWS Variables
To set the required AWS variables, create a *_/etc/aws/aws.conf_* file with
the following contents on all of your OpenShift hosts, both masters and nodes:

====
----
[Global]
Zone = us-east-1c  <1>
----

<1> This is the Availability Zone of your AWS Instance and where your EBS Volume resides; this information is obtained from the AWS Managment Console.
====



== Configuring Masters

Edit or
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html#creating-new-configuration-files[create]
the master configuration file on all masters
(*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* by default) and update the contents
of the `*apiServerArguments*` and `*controllerArguments*` sections:

====
[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  ...
  apiServerArguments:
    cloud-provider:
      - "aws"
    cloud-config:
      - "/etc/aws/aws.conf"
  controllerArguments:
    cloud-provider:
      - "aws"
    cloud-config:
      - "/etc/aws/aws.conf"
----
====

== Configuring Nodes

Edit or
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html#creating-new-configuration-files[create]
the node configuration file on all nodes
(*_/etc/origin/node-<hostname>/node-config.yaml_* by default) and update the
contents of the `*kubeletArguments*` section:

====
[source,yaml]
----
kubeletArguments:
  cloud-provider:
    - "aws"
  cloud-config:
    - "/etc/aws/aws.conf"
----
====



== Exporting Key Value Access Pairs

Make sure the following environment variables are exported and start or restart OpenShift services on the master and all nodes:

====
----
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key id>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret key>
----
====

These access keys are obtained when setting up your AWS instances.
