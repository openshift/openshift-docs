== Overview
The xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging[Elasticsearch,
Fluentd, and Kibana] (EFK) stack aggregates logs from nodes and applications
running inside your {product-title} installation. Once deployed it uses
link:http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd] to aggregate logs from
all nodes, and pods into
link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch (ES)]. It also
provides a centralized
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana]
web UI where users and administrators can create rich visualizations and
dashboards with the aggregated data.

== Installation

The general procedure for installing an aggregate logging stack in
{product-title} is described in
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging[Aggregating
Container Logs]. There are some important things to keep in mind while going
through the installation guide:

In order for the logging pods to spread evenly across your cluster, an empty
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#using-node-selectors[node selector]
should be used when creating the project.

----
$ oc adm new-project logging --node-selector=""
----

In conjunction with node labeling, which is done later, this controls pod
placement across the logging project.  

Elasticsearch (ES) should be deployed with a cluster size of at least three for
resiliency to node failures. This is specified by setting the
`*openshift_logging_es_cluster_size*` parameter in the inventory host file.

Refer to
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[Ansible
Variables] for a full list of parameters.

Kibana requires a hostname that can be resolved from wherever the browser will be used to access it.  
For example, you might need to add a DNS alias for Kibana to your corporate name service in order to access Kibana 
from the web browser running on your laptop.  Logging deployment creates a Route to Kibana on one of your "infra" nodes 
or wherever the OpenShift router is running.  The Kibana hostname alias should point to this machine.  
This hostname is specified as the Ansible `openshift_logging_kibana_hostname` variable.

Installation can take some time depending on whether the images were already
retrieved from the registry or not, and on the size of your cluster.

Inside the *openshift-logging* project, you can check your deployment with `oc get all`.

By default the amount of RAM allocated to each ES instance is 16GB.
`*openshift_logging_es_memory_limit*` is the parameter used in the *openshift-ansible*
host inventory file.
Keep in mind that *half* of this value will be passed to the individual
elasticsearch pods java processes

[[install-config-aggregate-logging-sizing-guidelines-large-cluster-installation]]
=== Large Clusters

At 100 nodes or more, it is recommended to first pre-pull the logging images
from `docker pull registry.redhat.io/openshift3/logging-fluentd:v{product-version}`.
After deploying the logging infrastructure pods (Elasticsearch, Kibana, and
Curator), node labeling should be done in steps of 20 nodes at a time. For
example:

Using a simple loop:

----
$ while read node; do oc label nodes $node logging-infra-fluentd=true; done < 20_fluentd.lst
----

The following also works:

----
$ oc label nodes 10.10.0.{100..119} logging-infra-fluentd=true
----

Labeling nodes in groups paces the DaemonSets used by OpenShift logging, helping to avoid contention on shared resources such as the image registry.


[NOTE]
====
Check for the occurence of any "CrashLoopBackOff | ImagePullFailed | Error" issues.
`oc logs <pod>`, `oc describe pod <pod>` and `oc get event` are helpful diagnostic commands.

[[install-config-aggregate-logging-sizing-guidelines-rate-limiting]]
== Systemd-journald and rsyslog

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 the *systemd-journald.socket* unit creates
*_/dev/log_* during the boot process, and then passes input to
*systemd-journald.service*. Every *syslog()* call goes to the journal.

The default rate limiting for *systemd-journald* causes some system logs to be dropped before 
Fluentd can read them. To prevent this add the following to the *_/etc/systemd/journald.conf_* file:

----
# Disable rate limiting
RateLimitInterval=1s
RateLimitBurst=10000
Storage=volatile
Compress=no
MaxRetentionSec=30s
----

Then restart the services.

----
$ systemctl restart systemd-journald.service
$ systemctl restart rsyslog.service
----

These settings account for the bursty nature of uploading in bulk.

After removing the rate limit, you may see increased CPU utilization on the
system logging daemons as it processes any messages that would have previously
been throttled.

[[install-config-aggregate-logging-sizing-guidelines-scaling-up]]
== Scaling up EFK Logging

If you do not indicate the desired scale at first deployment, the least
disruptive way of adjusting your cluster is by re-running the Ansible logging playbook
after updating the inventory file with an updated `openshift_logging_es_cluster_size` value.
parameter. Refer to the

Administrative Elasticsearch Operations] section for more in-depth information.

[[install-config-aggregate-logging-sizing-guidelines-storage]]
== Storage Considerations

An Elasticsearch index is a collection of shards and their corresponding replicas. 
This is how ES implements high availability internally, so there
is little need to use hardware based mirroring RAID variants. RAID 0 can still
be used to increase overall disk performance.

A
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[persistent
volume] is added to each Elasticsearch deployment configuration. On {product-title} this is usually achieved through
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volume-claims[Persistent
Volume Claims].

The PVCs is named based on the *openshift_logging_es_pvc_prefix* setting. Refer to
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregated-logging-persistent-storage[Persistent Elasticsearch Storage]
for more details.

Fluentd ships any logs from *systemd journal* and **/var/lib/docker/containers/*.log** to Elasticsearch.
xref:../install/host_preparation.adoc#managing-docker-container-logs[Learn more].

Local SSD drives are recommended in order to achieve the best performance. In
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7, the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/425823[deadline] IO scheduler is the
default for all block devices except SATA disks. For SATA disks, the default IO
scheduler is *cfq*.

Sizing storage for ES is greatly dependent on how you optimize your indices.
Therefore, consider how much data you need in advance and that you are
aggregating application log data. Some Elasticsearch users have found that it
is necessary to
link:https://signalfx.com/blog/how-we-monitor-and-run-elasticsearch-at-scale/[keep
absolute storage consumption around 50% and below 70% at all times]. This
helps to avoid Elasticsearch becoming unresponsive during large merge
operations.
