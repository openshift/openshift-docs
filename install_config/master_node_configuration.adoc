== Customizing master and node configuration after installation

The `openshift start` command (for master servers) and `hyperkube` command (for
node servers) take a limited set of arguments that are sufficient for launching
servers in a development or experimental environment. However, these arguments
are insufficient to describe and control the full set of configuration and
security options that are necessary in a production environment.

You must provide these options in the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master configuration file],
at *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*, and the
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#modifying-nodes[node configuration maps].
These files define options including overriding the default plug-ins, connecting
to etcd, automatically creating service accounts, building image names,
customizing project requests, configuring volume plug-ins, and much more.

This topic covers the available options for customizing your {product-title}
master and node hosts, and shows you how to make changes to the configuration
after installation.

These files are fully specified with no default values. Therefore, an empty
value indicates that you want to start up with an empty value for that
parameter. This makes it easy to reason about exactly what your configuration
is, but it also makes it difficult to remember all of the options to specify. To
make this easier, the configuration files can be created with the
`--write-config` option and then used with the `--config` option.

[[master-node-config-prereq]]
== Installation dependencies

Production environments should be installed using the standard xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[cluster installation]
process. In production environments, it is a good idea to use
xref:../install/example_inventories.adoc#multiple-masters[multiple masters] for the purposes of
xref:../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#admin-guide-high-availability[high availability] (HA).
A cluster architecture of three masters is recommended, and
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[HAproxy] is the recommended solution for this.

[CAUTION]
====
If etcd is installed on the _master hosts_, you must configure your cluster to
use at least three masters, because etcd would not be able to decide which one
is authoritative. The only way to successfully run only two masters is if you
install etcd on hosts other than the masters.
====

[[master-node-config-masters-nodes]]
== Configuring masters and nodes

The method you use to configure your master and node configuration files must
match the method that was used to install your {product-title} cluster. If you
followed the standard xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[cluster
installation] processe, then make your configuration changes in the Ansible
inventory file.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
If you followed the
link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/getting_started/administrators.html[Manual installation] method, then make your changes
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-manual[manually
in the configuration files] themselves.

[NOTE]
====
To modify a node in your cluster, update the xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#modifying-nodes[node configuration maps] as needed.
Do not manually edit the *_node-config.yaml_* file.

[[master-node-config-ansible]]
== Making configuration changes using Ansible

For this section, familiarity with Ansible is assumed.

Only a portion of the available host configuration options are
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/master/inventory/hosts.example[exposed to Ansible].
After an {product-title} install, Ansible creates an
inventory file with some substituted values. Modifying this inventory file and re-running the Ansible installer playbook is how you customize your {product-title} cluster.

While {product-title} supports using Ansible for cluster installation, using an
Ansible playbook and inventory file, you can also use other management tools,
such as https://puppet.com/[Puppet], https://www.chef.io/[Chef], or
http://saltstack.com/[Salt].

[[config-htpasswd]]
*Use Case: Configuring the cluster to use HTPasswd authentication*

[NOTE]
====
* This use case assumes you have already set up
xref:../install/host_preparation.adoc#ensuring-host-access[SSH keys] to all the nodes referenced in the playbook.

* The `htpasswd` utility is in the `httpd-tools` package:
+
----
# yum install httpd-tools
----
====

To modify the Ansible inventory and make configuration changes:

. Open the *_./hosts_* inventory file.

. Add the following new variables to the `[OSEv3:vars]` section of the file:
+
----
# htpasswd auth
openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'htpasswd_auth', 'login': 'true', 'challenge': 'true', 'kind': 'HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider'}]
# Defining htpasswd users
#openshift_master_htpasswd_users={'<name>': '<hashed-password>', '<name>': '<hashed-password>'}
# or
#openshift_master_htpasswd_file=/etc/origin/master/htpasswd
----
+
--
For HTPasswd authentication the `openshift_master_identity_providers` variable
enables the authentication type.
You can configure three different authentication options that use HTPasswd:

* Specify only `openshift_master_identity_providers` if `/etc/origin/master/htpasswd` is already configured and present on the host.
* Specify both `openshift_master_identity_providers` and `openshift_master_htpasswd_file` to copy a local htpasswd file to the host.
* Specify both `openshift_master_identity_providers` and `openshift_master_htpasswd_users` to generate a new htpasswd file on the host.
--
+
Because {product-title} requires a hashed password to configure HTPasswd authentication, you can use the `htpasswd` command, xref:htpasswd[as shown in the following section], to generate the hashed password(s) for your user(s) or to create the flat file with the users and associated hashed passwords.
+
The following example changes the authentication method from the default `deny all` setting to `htpasswd` and uses the specified file to generate user IDs and passwords for the `jsmith` and `bloblaw` users.
+
----
# htpasswd auth
openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'htpasswd_auth', 'login': 'true', 'challenge': 'true', 'kind': 'HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider'}]
# Defining htpasswd users
openshift_master_htpasswd_users={'jsmith': '$apr1$wIwXkFLI$bAygtKGmPOqaJftB', 'bloblaw': '7IRJ$2ODmeLoxf4I6sUEKfiA$2aDJqLJe'}
# or
#openshift_master_htpasswd_file=/etc/origin/master/htpasswd
----

. Re-run the ansible playbook for these modifications to take effect:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -b -i ./hosts ~/src/openshift-ansible/playbooks/deploy_cluster.yml
----
+
The playbook updates the configuration, and restarts the {product-title} master service to apply the changes.

You have now modified the master and node configuration files using Ansible, but this is just a simple use case. From here you can see which
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master] and
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#node-configuration-files[node configuration] options are
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/master/inventory/hosts.example[exposed to Ansible] and customize your own Ansible inventory.

[[htpasswd]]
=== Using the `htpasswd` command

To configure the {product-title} cluster to use HTPasswd authentication, you need at least one user with a hashed password to include in the xref:config-htpasswd[inventory file].

You can:

* xref:htpasswd-user[Generate the username and password] to add directly to the *_./hosts_* inventory file.
* xref:htpasswd-file[Create a flat file] to pass the credentials to the *_./hosts_* inventory file.


[[htpasswd-user]]
To create a user and hashed password:

. Run the following command to add the specified user:
+
----
$ htpasswd -n <user_name>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can include the `-b` option to supply the password on the command line:

----
$ htpasswd -nb <user_name> <password>
----
====

. Enter and confirm a clear-text password for the user.
+
For example:
+
----
$ htpasswd -n myuser
New password:
Re-type new password:
myuser:$apr1$vdW.cI3j$WSKIOzUPs6Q
----
+
The command generates a hashed version of the password.

You can then use the hashed password when configuring xref:config-htpasswd[HTPasswd authentication]. The hashed password is the string after the `:`. In the above example,you would enter:

----
openshift_master_htpasswd_users={'myuser': '$apr1$wIwXkFLI$bAygtISk2eKGmqaJftB'}
----

[[htpasswd-file]]
To create a flat file with a user name and hashed password:

. Execute the following command:
+
----
$ htpasswd -c /etc/origin/master/htpasswd <user_name>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can include the `-b` option to supply the password on the command line:

----
$ htpasswd -c -b <user_name> <password>
----
====

. Enter and confirm a clear-text password for the user.
+
For example:
+
----
htpasswd -c /etc/origin/master/htpasswd user1
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user user1
----
+
The command generates a file that includes the user name and a hashed version of the user's password.

You can then use the password file when configuring xref:config-htpasswd[HTPasswd authentication].

[NOTE]
====
For more information on the `htpasswd` command, see xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider[HTPasswd Identity Provider].
====

[[master-node-config-manual]]
== Making manual configuration changes

*Use Case: Configure the cluster to use HTPasswd authentication*

To manually modify a configuration file:

. Open the configuration file you want to modify, which in this case is the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file:
+
. Add the following new variables to the `*identityProviders*` stanza of the file:
+
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_htpasswd_provider
    challenge: true
    login: true
    mappingMethod: claim
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider
      file: /etc/origin/master/htpasswd
----
. Save your changes and close the file.
. Restart the master for the changes to take effect:
+
----
# master-restart api
# master-restart controllers
----

You have now manually modified the master and node configuration files,
but this is just a simple use case.
From here you can see all the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master] and
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#node-configuration-files[node configuration] options, and further customize your own cluster by making further modifications.

[NOTE]
====
To modify a node in your cluster, update the xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#modifying-nodes[node configuration maps] as needed.
Do not manually edit the *_node-config.yaml_* file.
====

[[master-configuration-files]]
== Master Configuration Files
This section reviews parameters mentioned in the *_master-config.yaml_* file.

You can xref:creating-new-configuration-files[create a new master configuration
file] to see the valid options for your installed version of {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Whenever you modify the *_master-config.yaml_* file, you must restart the master
for the changes to take effect. See xref:master-node-config-restart-services[Restarting {product-title} services].

[[master-config-admission-control-config]]
=== Admission Control Configuration

.Admission Control Configuration Parameters
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Parameter Name | Description

|`*AdmissionConfig*`
|Contains the xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/admission_controllers.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-admission-controllers[admission control plug-in] configuration. {product-title} has a configurable list of admission controller plug-ins that are triggered whenever API objects are created or modified. This option allows you to override the default list of plug-ins; for example, disabling some plug-ins, adding others, changing the ordering, and specifying configuration. Both the list of plug-ins and their configuration can be controlled from Ansible.

|`*APIServerArguments*`
|Key-value pairs that will be passed directly to the Kube API server that match
the API servers' command line arguments. These are not migrated, but if you
reference a value that does not exist the server will not start. These values
may override other settings in `*KubernetesMasterConfig*`, which may cause
invalid configurations. Use `APIServerArguments` with the `event-ttl` value to store events in etcd. The default is `2h`, but it can be set to less to prevent memory growth:

----
apiServerArguments:
  event-ttl:
  - "15m"
----

|`*ControllerArguments*`
|Key-value pairs that will be passed directly to the Kube controller manager
that match the controller manager's command line arguments. These are not
migrated, but if you reference a value that does not exist the server will not
start. These values may override other settings in `*KubernetesMasterConfig*`,
which may cause invalid configurations.

|`*DefaultAdmissionConfig*`
|Used to enable or disable various admission plug-ins. When this type is present
as the *configuration* object under `*pluginConfig*` and if the admission
plug-in supports it, this will cause an *off by default* admission plug-in to be
enabled.

|`*PluginConfig*`
|Allows specifying a configuration file per admission control plug-in.

|`*PluginOrderOverride*`
|A list of admission control plug-in names that will be installed on the master.
Order is significant. If empty, a default list of plug-ins is used.

|`*SchedulerArguments*`
|Key-value pairs that will be passed directly to the Kube scheduler that match
the scheduler's command line arguments. These are not migrated, but if you
reference a value that does not exist the server will not start. These values
may override other settings in `*KubernetesMasterConfig*`, which may cause
invalid configurations.

    maxRequestsInFlight: 0
    requestTimeoutSeconds: 0
----

|`*corsAllowedOrigins*`
|To access the API server from a web application using a different host name, you
must whitelist that host name by specifying `corsAllowedOrigins` in the
configuration field or by specifying the `--cors-allowed-origins` option on
`openshift start`. No pinning or escaping is done to the value. See
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#corsAllowedOrigins[Web
Console] for example usage.

|`*DisabledFeatures*`
|A list of features that should not be started. You will likely want to set this
as *null*. It is very unlikely that anyone will want to manually disable
features and that is not encouraged.

|`*Extensions*`
|Files to serve from the asset server file system under a subcontext.

|`*ExtensionDevelopment*`
|When  set to *true*, tells the asset server to reload extension scripts and
stylesheets for every request rather than only at startup. It lets you develop
extensions without having to restart the server for every change.

|`*ExtensionProperties*`
|Key- (string) and value- (string) pairs that will be injected into the console under
the global variable `*OPENSHIFT_EXTENSION_PROPERTIES*`.

|`*ExtensionScripts*`

.Controller Configuration Parameters
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Parameter Name | Description

|`*Controllers*`
|List of the controllers that should be started. If set to *none*, no
controllers will start automatically. The default value is * which will start
all controllers. When using *, you may exclude controllers by prepending a `-`
in front of their name. No other values are recognized at this time.

|`*ControllerLeaseTTL*`
|Enables controller election, instructing the master to attempt to acquire a
lease before controllers start and renewing it within a number of seconds
defined by this value. Setting this value non-negative forces
`*pauseControllers=true*`. This value defaults off (0, or omitted) and controller
election can be disabled with -1.

|`*PauseControllers*`
|Instructs the master to not automatically start controllers, but instead to
wait until a notification to the server is received before launching them.

permission to create Images or ImageStreamMappings via the API are not affected by
this policy - typically only administrators or system integrations will have those
permissions.

|`*AdditionalTrustedCA*`
|Specified a filepath to a PEM-encoded file listing additional certificate authorities
that should be trusted during imagestream import.  This file needs to be accessible
to the API server process.  Depending how your cluster is installed, this may require
mounting the file into the API server pod.

|`*InternalRegistryHostname*`

[[master-node-config-network-config]]
=== Network Configuration

Choose the CIDRs in the following parameters carefully, because the IPv4 address
space is shared by all users of the nodes. {product-title} reserves CIDRs from
the IPv4 address space for its own use, and reserves CIDRs from the IPv4
address space for addresses that are shared between the external user and the
cluster.

.Network Configuration Parameters
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Parameter Name | Description

|`*ClusterNetworkCIDR*`
|The CIDR string to specify the global overlay network's L3 space. This is
reserved for the internal use of the cluster networking.

|`*externalIPNetworkCIDRs*`
|Controls what values are acceptable for the service external IP field. If
empty, no `*externalIP*` may be set. It may contain a list of CIDRs which are
checked for access. If a CIDR is prefixed with *!*, IPs in that CIDR will be
rejected. Rejections will be applied first, then the IP checked against one of
the allowed CIDRs. You must ensure this range does not overlap with your nodes,
pods, or service CIDRs for security reasons.

|`*HostSubnetLength*`
|The number of bits to allocate to each host's subnet. For example, 8 would mean a
/24 network on the host.

|`*ingressIPNetworkCIDR*`
|Controls the range to assign ingress IPs from for services of type
*LoadBalancer* on bare metal. It may contain a single CIDR that it will be
allocated from. By default `172.46.0.0/16` is configured. For security reasons,
you should ensure that this range does not overlap with the CIDRs reserved for
external IPs, nodes, pods, or services.

|`*HostSubnetLength*`
|The number of bits to allocate to each host's subnet. For example, 8 would mean a
/24 network on the host.

|`*NetworkConfig*`
|To be passed to the compiled-in-network plug-in. Many of the options here can be controlled in the Ansible inventory.

- `*NetworkPluginName*` (string)
- `*ClusterNetworkCIDR*` (string)
- `*HostSubnetLength*` (unsigned integer)
- `*ServiceNetworkCIDR*` (string)
- `*externalIPNetworkCIDRs*` (string array): Controls which values are acceptable for the service external IP field. If empty, no external IP may be set. It can contain a list of CIDRs which are checked for access. If a CIDR is prefixed with `!`, then IPs in that CIDR are rejected. Rejections are applied first, then the IP is checked against one of the allowed CIDRs. For security purposes, you should ensure this range does not overlap with your nodes, pods, or service CIDRs.

For Example:
----
networkConfig:
  clusterNetworks
  - cidr: 10.3.0.0/16
    hostSubnetLength: 8
  networkPluginName: example/openshift-ovs-subnet
# serviceNetworkCIDR must match kubernetesMasterConfig.servicesSubnet
  serviceNetworkCIDR: 179.29.0.0/16
----

|`*NetworkPluginName*`
|The name of the network plug-in to use.

|`*ServiceNetwork*`

[[master-node-config-project-config]]
=== Project Configuration

.Project Configuration Parameters
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Parameter Name | Description

|`*DefaultNodeSelector*`
|Holds default project node label selector.

|`*ProjectConfig*`
|Holds information about project creation and defaults:

- `*DefaultNodeSelector*` (string): Holds the default project node label selector.
- `*ProjectRequestMessage*` (string): The string presented to a user if they are unable to request a project via the projectrequest API endpoint.
- `*ProjectRequestTemplate*` (string): The template to use for creating projects in response to projectrequest. It is in the format `<namespace>/<template>`. It is optional, and if it is not specified, a default template is used.
- `*SecurityAllocator*`: Controls the automatic allocation of UIDs and MCS labels to a project. If nil, allocation is disabled:
  * `*mcsAllocatorRange*` (string): Defines the range of MCS categories that will be assigned to namespaces. The format is `<prefix>/<numberOfLabels>[,<maxCategory>]`. The default is `s0/2` and will allocate from c0 -> c1023, which means a total of 535k labels are available. If this value is changed after startup, new projects may receive labels that are already allocated to other projects. The prefix may be any valid SELinux set of terms (including user, role, and type). However, leaving the prefix at its default allows the server to set them automatically. For example, `s0:/2` would allocate labels from s0:c0,c0 to s0:c511,c511 whereas `s0:/2,512` would allocate labels from s0:c0,c0,c0 to s0:c511,c511,511.
  * `*mcsLabelsPerProject*` (integer): Defines the number of labels to reserve per project. The default is `5` to match the default UID and MCS ranges.
  * `*uidAllocatorRange*` (string): Defines the total set of Unix user IDs (UIDs) automatically allocated to projects, and the size of the block that each namespace gets. For example, `1000-1999/10` would allocate ten UIDs per namespace, and would be able to allocate up to 100 blocks before running out of space. The default is to allocate from 1 billion to 2 billion in 10k blocks, which is the expected size of ranges for container images when user namespaces are started.

|`*ProjectRequestMessage*`
|The string presented to a user if they are unable to request a project via the
project request API endpoint.

|`*ProjectRequestTemplate*`
|The template to use for creating projects in response to a *projectrequest*. It
is in the format namespace/template and it is optional. If it is not specified,
a default template is used.

will allocate from c0 to c1023, which means a total of 535k labels are available
(1024 choose 2 ~ 535k). If this value is changed after startup, new projects may
receive labels that are already allocated to other projects. Prefix may be any
valid SELinux set of terms (including user, role, and type), although leaving
them as the default will allow the server to set them automatically.

|`*SecurityAllocator*`
|Controls the automatic allocation of UIDs and MCS labels to a project. If nil,
allocation is disabled.

|`*UIDAllocatorRange*`
|Defines the total set of Unix user IDs (UIDs) that will be allocated to

[[master-node-config-audit-config]]
=== Basic Audit

Audit provides a security-relevant chronological set of records documenting the
sequence of activities that have affected system by individual users,
administrators, or other components of the system.

Audit works at the API server level, logging all requests coming to the server.
Each audit log contains two entries:

. The request line containing:
.. A Unique ID allowing to match the response line (see #2)
.. The source IP of the request
.. The HTTP method being invoked
.. The original user invoking the operation
.. The impersonated user for the operation (`self` meaning himself)
.. The impersonated group for the operation (`lookup` meaning user's group)
.. The namespace of the request or <none>
.. The URI as requested

. The response line containing:
.. The unique ID from #1
.. The response code

Example output for user *admin* asking for a list of pods:

----
AUDIT: id="5c3b8227-4af9-4322-8a71-542231c3887b" ip="127.0.0.1" method="GET" user="admin" as="<self>" asgroups="<lookup>" namespace="default" uri="/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods"
AUDIT: id="5c3b8227-4af9-4322-8a71-542231c3887b" response="200"
----

To enable and configure audit, edit the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*
file or use a command similar to the following:

----
$ openshift_master_audit_config={"enabled": true, "auditFilePath": "/var/log/origin/audit-ocp.log", "maximumFileRetentionDays": 14, "maximumFileSizeMegabytes": 500, "maximumRetainedFiles": 15}
----

The audit configuration takes the following parameters:

.Audit Configuration Parameters
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Parameter Name | Description

|`enabled`
|A boolean to enable or disable audit logs. Default is `false`.

|`auditFilePath`
|File path where the requests should be logged to. If not set, logs are printed
to master logs.

|`maximumFileRetentionDays`
|Specifies maximum number of days to retain old audit log files based on the time
stamp encoded in their filename.

|`maximumRetainedFiles`
|Specifies the maximum number of old audit log files to retain.

|`maximumFileSizeMegabytes`
|Specifies maximum size in megabytes of the log file before it gets rotated.
Defaults to 100MB.
|===

----
auditConfig:
  auditFilePath: "/var/log/origin/audit-ocp.log"
  enabled: true
  maximumFileRetentionDays: 14
  maximumFileSizeMegabytes: 500
  maximumRetainedFiles: 15
----

When you define the `auditFilePath` parameter, the directory is created if it does not exist.

[[master-node-config-advanced-audit]]
=== Advanced Audit

The advanced audit feature provides several improvements over the
xref:master-node-config-audit-config[basic audit functionality], including
fine-grained events filtering and multiple output back ends.

To enable the advanced audit feature, you create an audit policy file and specify the following values in the
`openshift_master_audit_config` and `openshift_master_audit_policyfile` parameters:

----
openshift_master_audit_config={"enabled": true, "auditFilePath": "/var/log/origin/audit-ocp.log", "maximumFileRetentionDays": 14, "maximumFileSizeMegabytes": 500, "maximumRetainedFiles": 5, "policyFile": "/etc/origin/master/adv-audit.yaml", "logFormat":"json"}
openshift_master_audit_policyfile="/<path>/adv-audit.yaml"
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create the *_adv-audit.yaml_* file before you install the cluster and specify its location in the cluster inventory file.
====

The following table contains additional options you can use.

.Advanced Audit Configuration Parameters

[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter Name | Description

|`policyFile`
|Path to the file that defines the audit policy configuration.

|`policyConfiguration`

* `Request` - Log event metadata and request body, but not response body.
+
* `RequestResponse` - Log event metadata, request, and response bodies.
<2> A list of users the rule applies to. An empty list implies every user.
<3> A list of verbs this rule applies to. An empty list implies every verb. This is
 Kubernetes verb associated with API requests (including `get`, `list`, `watch`,
 `create`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`, `deletecollection`, and `proxy`).
<4> A list of resources the rule applies to. An empty list implies every resource.
Each resource is specified as a group it is assigned to (for example, an empty for
Kubernetes core API, batch, build.openshift.io, etc.), and a resource list from
that group.
<5> A list of groups the rule applies to. An empty list implies every group.
<6> A list of non-resources URLs the rule applies to.
<7> A list of namespaces the rule applies to. An empty list implies every namespace.
<8> Endpoint used by the web console.
<9> Endpoint used by the CLI.

[[node-config-volume-config]]
=== Local Storage Configuration

You can use the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/storage_administration_guide/ch-xfs[XFS quota subsystem]
to limit the size of `emptyDir` volumes and volumes based on an `emptyDir` volume, such as secrets and configuration maps, on each node.

To limit the size of `emptyDir` volumes in an XFS filesystem, configure local volume quota for each unique
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/pod_security_context.adoc#fsgroup[FSGroup] using the *_node-config-compute_* configuration map in the *openshift-node* project.

----
apiVersion: kubelet.config.openshift.io/v1
kind: VolumeConfig
  localQuota: <1>
    perFSGroup: 1Gi <2>
----

<1> Contains options for controlling local volume quota on the node.
<2> Set this value to a resource quantity representing the desired quota per
[FSGroup], per node, such as `1Gi`, `512Mi`, and so forth.
Requires the *volumeDirectory* to be on an XFS filesystem mounted with the `grpquota` option. The matching security context constraint *fsGroup* type must be
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#authorization-FSGroup[set to `MustRunAs`].

If no FSGroup is specified, indicating the request matched an SCC with `RunAsAny`, the quota
application is skipped.

[[master-node-configuration-parallel-image-pulls-with-docker]]
=== Parallel Image Pulls with Docker 1.9+

If you are using Docker 1.9+, you may want to consider enabling parallel image
pulling, as the default is to pull images one at a time.

[NOTE]
====
There is a potential issue with data corruption prior to Docker 1.9. However,
starting with 1.9, the corruption issue is resolved and it is safe to switch to
parallel pulls.
====

[source,yaml]
----
kubeletArguments:
  serialize-image-pulls:
  - "false" <1>
----
<1> Change to `true` to disable parallel pulls. This is the default configuration.

[[master-node-configuration-passwords-and-other-data]]
== Passwords and Other Sensitive Data

For some xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[authentication configurations],
an LDAP `bindPassword` or OAuth `clientSecret` value is required.
Instead of specifying these values directly in the master configuration file,
these values may be provided as environment variables, external files,
or in encrypted files.

.Environment Variable Example
[source,yaml]
----
  bindPassword:
    env: BIND_PASSWORD_ENV_VAR_NAME
----

.External File Example
[source,yaml]
----
  bindPassword:
    file: bindPassword.txt
----

.Encrypted External File Example
[source,yaml]
----
  bindPassword:
    file: bindPassword.encrypted
    keyFile: bindPassword.key
----

To create the encrypted file and key file for the above example:

----
$ oc adm ca encrypt --genkey=bindPassword.key --out=bindPassword.encrypted
> Data to encrypt: B1ndPass0rd!
----

Run `oc adm` commands only from the first master listed in the Ansible host inventory file,
by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.

[WARNING]
====
Encrypted data is only as secure as the decrypting key. Care should be taken
to limit filesystem permissions and access to the key file.
====

[[creating-new-configuration-files]]

== Creating New Configuration Files

When defining an {product-title} configuration from scratch, start by creating
new configuration files.

For master host configuration files, use the `openshift start` command with the
`--write-config` option to write the configuration files. For node hosts, use
the `oc adm create-node-config` command to write the configuration files.

The following commands write the relevant launch configuration file(s),
certificate files, and any other necessary files to the specified
`--write-config` or `--node-dir` directory.

Generated certificate files are valid for two years, while the certification
authority (CA) certificate is valid for five years. This can be altered with the
`--expire-days` and `--signer-expire-days` options, but for security reasons, it
is recommended to not make them greater than these values.

To create configuration files for an all-in-one server (a master and a node on
the same host) in the specified directory:

----
$ openshift start --write-config=/openshift.local.config
----

To create a xref:master-configuration-files[master configuration file] and
other required files in the specified directory:

----
$ openshift start master --write-config=/openshift.local.config/master
----

To create a xref:node-configuration-files[node configuration file] and other
related files in the specified directory:

----
$ oc adm create-node-config \
    --node-dir=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname> \
    --node=<node_hostname> \
    --hostnames=<node_hostname>,<ip_address> \
    --certificate-authority="/path/to/ca.crt" \
    --signer-cert="/path/to/ca.crt" \
    --signer-key="/path/to/ca.key"
    --signer-serial="/path/to/ca.serial.txt"
    --node-client-certificate-authority="/path/to/ca.crt"
----

When creating node configuration files, the `--hostnames` option accepts a
comma-delimited list of every host name or IP address you want server
certificates to be valid for.

[[launching-servers-using-configuration-files]]
== Launching Servers Using Configuration Files

After you have modified the master and node configuration files to your
specifications, you can use them when launching servers by specifying them as an
argument. If you specify a configuration file, none of the other command line
options you pass are respected.

[NOTE]
====
To modify a node in your cluster, update the xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#modifying-nodes[node configuration maps] as needed.
Do not manually edit the *_node-config.yaml_* file.
====

. Launch a master server using a master configuration file:
+
----
$ openshift start master \
    --config=/openshift.local.config/master/master-config.yaml
----

. Start the network proxy and SDN plug-ins using a node configuration file and a
*_node.kubeconfig_* file:
+
----
$ openshift start network \
    --config=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname>/node-config.yaml \
    --kubeconfig=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname>/node.kubeconfig
----

. Launch a node server using a node configuration file:
+
----
$ hyperkube kubelet \
    $(/usr/bin/openshift-node-config \
    --config=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname>/node-config.yaml)
----

[[master-node-view-logs]]
== Viewing Master and Node Logs

{product-title} collects log messages for debugging, using the
`systemd-journald.service` for nodes and a script, called `master-logs`, for
masters.

[NOTE]
====
The number of lines displayed in the web console is hard-coded at 5000 and
cannot be changed. To see the entire log, use the CLI.
====

The logging uses five log message severities based on Kubernetes logging
conventions, as follows:

.Log Level Options
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

|0|Errors and warnings only
|2|Normal information
|4|Debugging-level information
|6|API-level debugging information (request / response)
|8|Body-level API debugging information
|===

You can xref:master-node-config-logging-levels[change the log levels independently for masters or nodes] as needed.

*View node logs*

To view logs for the node system, run the following command:

----
# journalctl -r -u <journal_name>
----

Use the `-r` option to show the newest entries first.

*View master logs*

To view logs for the master components, run the following command:

----
# /usr/local/bin/master-logs <component> <container>
----

For example:

----
# /usr/local/bin/master-logs controllers controllers
# /usr/local/bin/master-logs api api
# /usr/local/bin/master-logs etcd etcd
----

*Redirect master log to a file*

To redirect the output of master log in to a file, run the following command:

----
master-logs api api 2> file
----

[[master-node-config-logging-levels]]
=== Configuring Logging Levels

You can control which INFO messages are logged by setting the `DEBUG_LOGLEVEL`
option in the *_/etc/origin/master/master.env_* file for the master or
*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* file for the nodes. Configuring the
logs to collect all messages can lead to large logs that are difficult to
interpret and can take up excessive space. Only collect all messages when you
need to debug your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Messages with FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, and some INFO severities appear in the logs
regardless of the log configuration.
====

To change the logging level:

. Edit the *_/etc/origin/master/master.env_* file for the master or *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* file for the nodes.
. Enter a value from the *Log Level Options* table in the `DEBUG_LOGLEVEL` field.
+
For example:
+
----
DEBUG_LOGLEVEL=4
----
. Restart the master or node host as appropriate.  See xref:master-node-config-restart-services[Restarting {product-title} services].

After the restart, all new log messages will conform to the new setting. Older messages do not change.

[NOTE]
====
The default log level can be set using the standard cluster installation
process. For more information, see
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#cluster-variables-table[Cluster Variables].
====

The following examples are excerpts of redirected master log files at various
log levels. System information has been removed from these examples.

[[master-node-config-restart-services]]
== Restarting master and node services

To apply master or node configuration changes, you must restart the respective
services.

To reload master configuration changes, restart master services running in control plane static pods using the `master-restart` command:

----
# master-restart api
# master-restart controllers
----

To reload node configuration changes, restart the node service on the node host:

----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
