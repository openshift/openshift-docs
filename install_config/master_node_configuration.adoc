== Overview
The `openshift start` command is used to launch {product-title} servers. The command
and its subcommands (`master` to launch a
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master
server] and `node` to launch a
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[node
server]) all take a limited set of arguments that are sufficient for launching
servers in a development or experimental environment.

However, these arguments are insufficient to describe and control the full set
of configuration and security options that are necessary in a production
environment. To provide those options, it is necessary to use the dedicated
master and node configuration files.

xref:master-configuration-files[Master configuration files] and
xref:node-configuration-files[node configuration files] are fully specified
with no default values. Therefore, any empty value indicates that you want to
start up with an empty value for that parameter. This makes it easy to reason
about exactly what your configuration is, but it also makes it difficult to
remember all of the options to specify. To make this easier, the configuration
files can be created with the `--write-config` option and then used with the
`--config` option.

[[master-configuration-files]]
== Master Configuration Files
This section reviews parameters mentioned in the *_master-config.yaml_* file.

You can xref:creating-new-configuration-files[create a new master configuration
file] to see the valid options for your installed version of {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Whenever you modify the *_master-config.yaml_* file, you must restart the master
for the changes to take effect. See xref:master-node-config-restart-services[Restarting {product-title} services].

[[master-config-admission-control-config]]
=== Admission Control Configuration

.Admission Control Configuration Parameters
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Parameter Name | Description

|`*AdmissionConfig*`
|Contains admission control plug-in configuration.

|`*APIServerArguments*`
|Key-value pairs that will be passed directly to the Kube API server that match
the API servers' command line arguments. These are not migrated, but if you
reference a value that does not exist the server will not start. These values
may override other settings in `*KubernetesMasterConfig*`, which may cause
invalid configurations.

|`*ControllerArguments*`
|Key-value pairs that will be passed directly to the Kube controller manager
that match the controller manager's command line arguments. These are not
migrated, but if you reference a value that does not exist the server will not
start. These values may override other settings in `*KubernetesMasterConfig*`,
which may cause invalid configurations.

|`*DefaultAdmissionConfig*`
|Used to enable or disable various admission plug-ins. When this type is present
as the *configuration* object under `*pluginConfig*` and if the admission
plug-in supports it, this will cause an *off by default* admission plug-in to be
enabled.

|`*PluginConfig*`
|Allows specifying a configuration file per admission control plug-in.

|`*PluginOrderOverride*`
|A list of admission control plug-in names that will be installed on the master.
Order is significant. If empty, a default list of plug-ins is used.

|`*SchedulerArguments*`
|Key-value pairs that will be passed directly to the Kube scheduler that match
the scheduler's command line arguments. These are not migrated, but if you
reference a value that does not exist the server will not start. These values
may override other settings in `*KubernetesMasterConfig*`, which may cause
invalid configurations.

[[master-node-config-audit-config]]
=== Audit Configuration

Audit provides a security-relevant chronological set of records documenting the
sequence of activities that have affected system by individual users,
administrators, or other components of the system.

Audit works at the API server level, logging all requests coming to the server.
Each audit log contains two entries:

. The request line containing:
.. A Unique ID allowing to match the response line (see #2)
.. The source IP of the request
.. The HTTP method being invoked
.. The original user invoking the operation
.. The impersonated user for the operation (`self` meaning himself)
.. The impersonated group for the operation (`lookup` meaning user's group)
.. The namespace of the request or <none>
.. The URI as requested

. The response line containing:
.. The the unique ID from #1
.. The response code

Example output for user *admin* asking for a list of pods:

----
AUDIT: id="5c3b8227-4af9-4322-8a71-542231c3887b" ip="127.0.0.1" method="GET" user="admin" as="<self>" asgroups="<lookup>" namespace="default" uri="/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods"
AUDIT: id="5c3b8227-4af9-4322-8a71-542231c3887b" response="200"

# yum update etcd iptables-services
----

. Confirm that your etcd version is 3.2.22 or later:
+
----
# etcd --version
etcd Version: 3.2.22
----

. On each master host, specify the ciphers to enable in the
`/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` file:

<2> Allows pods to be placed directly on certain set of nodes, or on all nodes
without going through the scheduler. You can then use pods to perform the same
administrative tasks and support the same services on each node.
<3> Specifies the path for the
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pod manifest file]
or directory. If it is a directory, then it is expected to contain one or more
manifest files. This is used by the Kubelet to create pods on the node.
<4> This is the interval (in seconds) for checking the manifest file for new
data. The interval must be a positive value.
<5> The xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#service-proxy-mode[service
proxy implementation] to use.
<6> Preliminary support for local emptyDir volume quotas, set this value to a resource
quantity representing the desired quota per FSGroup, per node. (i.e. 1Gi, 512Mi, etc)
Currently requires that the *_volumeDirectory_* be on an XFS filesystem mounted
with the 'gquota' option, and the matching security context contraint's fsGroup
type set to 'MustRunAs'.
====

The node configuration file determines the resources of a node. See the
xref:../admin_guide/allocating_node_resources.adoc#admin-guide-allocating-node-resources[Allocating
node resources section in the Cluster Administrator guide] for more information.

[[node-config-pod-and-node-config]]
=== Pod and Node Configuration

.Pod and Node Configuration Parameters
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Parameter Name | Description

|`*NodeConfig*`
|The fully specified configuration starting an {product-title} node.

|`*NodeIP*`
|Node may have multiple IPs, so this specifies the IP to use for pod traffic
routing. If not specified, network parse/lookup on the *nodeName* is performed
and the first non-loopback address is used.

|`*NodeName*`
|The value used to identify this particular node in the cluster. If possible,
this should be your fully qualified hostname. If you are describing a set of
static nodes to the master, this value must match one of the values in the list.

|`*PodEvictionTimeout*`
|Controls grace period for deleting pods on failed nodes. It takes valid time
duration string. If empty, you get the default pod eviction timeout.

|`*ProxyClientInfo*`
|Specifies the client cert/key to use when proxying to pods.

|===


[[node-config-docker-config]]
=== Docker Configuration

.Docker Configuration Parameters
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Parameter Name | Description

|`*AllowDisabledDocker*`
|If true, the kubelet will ignore errors from Docker. This means that a node can
start on a machine that does not have docker started.

|`*DockerConfig*`
|Holds Docker related configuration options

|`*ExecHandlerName*`
|The handler to use for executing commands in Docker containers.

|===

[[master-node-configuration-node-qps-burst]]
=== Setting Node Queries per Second (QPS) Limits and Burst Values

The rate at which Kubelet talks to API server depends on Queries per Second (QPS) and burst values.
The default values are good enough if there are limited pods running on each node.
Provided there are enough CPU and memory resources on the node, the QPS and burst
values can be tweaked in the  *_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file:

----
kubeletArguments:
  kube-api-qps:
  - "20"
  kube-api-burst:
  - "40"
----

[NOTE]
====
The QPS and burst values above are defaults for {product-title}.
====

Then xref:master-node-config-restart-services[restart {product-title} node services].

[[master-node-configuration-parallel-image-pulls-with-docker]]
=== Parallel Image Pulls with Docker 1.9+

If you are using Docker 1.9+, you may want to consider enabling parallel image
pulling, as the default is to pull images one at a time.

[NOTE]
====
There is a potential issue with data corruption prior to Docker 1.9. However,
starting with 1.9, the corruption issue is resolved and it is safe to switch to
parallel pulls.
====

====
[source,yaml]
----
kubeletArguments:
  serialize-image-pulls:
  - "false" <1>
----
<1> Change to true to disable parallel pulls. (This is the default config)
====

[[master-node-configuration-passwords-and-other-data]]
== Passwords and Other Sensitive Data

For some xref:configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[authentication configurations],
an LDAP `bindPassword` or OAuth `clientSecret` value is required.
Instead of specifying these values directly in the master configuration file,
these values may be provided as environment variables, external files,
or in encrypted files.

.Environment Variable Example
[source,yaml]
----
  ...
  bindPassword:
    env: BIND_PASSWORD_ENV_VAR_NAME
----

.External File Example
[source,yaml]
----
  ...
  bindPassword:
    file: bindPassword.txt
----

.Encrypted External File Example
[source,yaml]
----
  ...
  bindPassword:
    file: bindPassword.encrypted
    keyFile: bindPassword.key
----

To create the encrypted file and key file for the above example:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc adm ca encrypt --genkey=bindPassword.key --out=bindPassword.encrypted
> Data to encrypt: B1ndPass0rd!
----

Run `oc adm` commands only from the first master listed in the Ansible host inventory file,
by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.

[WARNING]
====
Encrypted data is only as secure as the decrypting key. Care should be taken
to limit filesystem permissions and access to the key file.
====

[[creating-new-configuration-files]]

== Creating New Configuration Files

When defining an {product-title} configuration from scratch, start by creating
new configuration files.

For master host configuration files, use the `openshift start` command with the
`--write-config` option to write the configuration files. For node hosts, use
the `oc adm create-node-config` command to write the configuration files.

The following commands write the relevant launch configuration file(s),
certificate files, and any other necessary files to the specified
`--write-config` or `--node-dir` directory.

Generated certificate files are valid for two years, while the certification
authority (CA) certificate is valid for five years. This can be altered with the
`--expire-days` and `--signer-expire-days` options, but for security reasons, it
is recommended to not make them greater than these values.

To create configuration files for an all-in-one server (a master and a node on
the same host) in the specified directory:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start --write-config=/openshift.local.config
----

To create a xref:master-configuration-files[master configuration file] and
other required files in the specified directory:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start master --write-config=/openshift.local.config/master
----

To create a xref:node-configuration-files[node configuration file] and other
related files in the specified directory:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc adm create-node-config \
    --node-dir=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname> \
    --node=<node_hostname> \
    --hostnames=<node_hostname>,<ip_address> \
    --certificate-authority="/path/to/ca.crt" \
    --signer-cert="/path/to/ca.crt" \
    --signer-key="/path/to/ca.key"
    --signer-serial="/path/to/ca.serial.txt"
    --node-client-certificate-authority="/path/to/ca.crt"
----

When creating node configuration files, the `--hostnames` option accepts a
comma-delimited list of every host name or IP address you want server
certificates to be valid for.

[[launching-servers-using-configuration-files]]

== Launching Servers Using Configuration Files
Once you have modified the master and/or node configuration files to your
specifications, you can use them when launching servers by specifying them as an
argument. Keep in mind that if you specify a configuration file, none of the
other command line options you pass are respected.

To launch an all-in-one server using a master configuration and a node
configuration file:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start --master-config=/openshift.local.config/master/master-config.yaml --node-config=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname>/node-config.yaml
----

To launch a master server using a master configuration file:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start master --config=/openshift.local.config/master/master-config.yaml
----

To launch a node server using a node configuration file:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start node --config=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname>/node-config.yaml
----

[[master-node-config-logging-levels]]
== Configuring Logging Levels

{product-title} uses the `systemd-journald.service` to collect log messages for debugging.

[NOTE]
====
The number of lines displayed in the web console is hard-coded at 5000 and cannot be changed. 
To see the entire log, use the CLI.
====

The logging uses five log message severities based on Kubernetes logging conventions, as follows:

.Log Level Options
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

|0|Errors and warnings only
|2|Normal information
|4|Debugging-level information
|6|API-level debugging information (request / response)
|8|Body-level API debugging information
|===

You can control which INFO messages are logged by setting the loglevel option in the in *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_*, the *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-api_* file
and the *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-controllers_* file. Configuring the logs to collect all messages can lead to large logs that are difficult to interpret and can take up excessive space. Collecting all messages should only be used in debug situations.

[NOTE]
====
Messages with FATAL, ERROR, WARNING and some INFO severities appear in the logs regardless of the log configuration.
====

You can view logs for the master or the node system using the following command:

----
# journalctl -r -u <journal_name>
----

Use the `-r` option to show the newest entries first.

For example:

----
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master-controllers
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master-api
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-node.service
----

To change the logging level:

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master_* file for the master or *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* file for the nodes.
. Enter a value from the *Log Level Options* table above in the `OPTIONS=--loglevel=` field.
+
For example:
+
----
OPTIONS=--loglevel=4
----
. Restart the master or node host as appropriate.  See xref:master-node-config-restart-services[Restarting {product-title} services].

After the restart, all new log messages will conform to the new setting. Older messages do not change.

[NOTE]
====
The default log level can be set using the Advanced Install. For more information, see xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#cluster-variables-table[Cluster Variables].
====

The following examples are excerpts from a master *journald* log at various log levels. Timestamps and system information have been removed from these examples.
