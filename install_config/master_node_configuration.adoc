== Overview
The `openshift start` command is used to launch {product-title} servers. The command
and its subcommands (`master` to launch a
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master
server] and `node` to launch a
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[node
server]) all take a limited set of arguments that are sufficient for launching
servers in a development or experimental environment.

However, these arguments are insufficient to describe and control the full set
of configuration and security options that are necessary in a production
environment. To provide those options, it is necessary to use the dedicated
master and node configuration files.

xref:master-configuration-files[Master configuration files] and
xref:node-configuration-files[node configuration files] are fully specified
with no default values. Therefore, any empty value indicates that you want to
start up with an empty value for that parameter. This makes it easy to reason
about exactly what your configuration is, but it also makes it difficult to
remember all of the options to specify. To make this easier, the configuration
files can be created with the `--write-config` option and then used with the
`--config` option.

[[master-configuration-files]]
== Master Configuration Files
This section reviews parameters mentioned in the *_master-config.yaml_* file.

You can xref:creating-new-configuration-files[create a new master configuration
file] to see the valid options for your installed version of {product-title}.

.Admission Control Configuration Parameters
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Parameter Name | Description

|`*AdmissionConfig*`
|Contains admission control plug-in configuration.

|`*APIServerArguments*`
|Key-value pairs that will be passed directly to the Kube API server that match
the API servers' command line arguments. These are not migrated, but if you
reference a value that does not exist the server will not start. These values
may override other settings in `*KubernetesMasterConfig*`, which may cause
invalid configurations.

|`*ControllerArguments*`
|Key-value pairs that will be passed directly to the Kube controller manager
that match the controller manager's command line arguments. These are not
migrated, but if you reference a value that does not exist the server will not
start. These values may override other settings in `*KubernetesMasterConfig*`,
which may cause invalid configurations.

|`*DefaultAdmissionConfig*`
|Used to enable or disable various admission plug-ins. When this type is present
as the *configuration* object under `*pluginConfig*` and if the admission
plug-in supports it, this will cause an *off by default* admission plug-in to be
enabled.

|`*PluginConfig*`
|Allows specifying a configuration file per admission control plug-in.

|`*PluginOrderOverride*`
|A list of admission control plug-in names that will be installed on the master.

|`*SchedulerArguments*`
|Key-value pairs that will be passed directly to the Kube scheduler that match
the scheduler's command line arguments. These are not migrated, but if you
reference a value that does not exist the server will not start. These values
may override other settings in `*KubernetesMasterConfig*`, which may cause
invalid configurations.

== Creating New Configuration Files

When defining an {product-title} configuration from scratch, start by creating
new configuration files.

For master host configuration files, use the `openshift start` command with the
`--write-config` option to write the configuration files. For node hosts, use
the `oadm create-node-config` command to write the configuration files.

The following commands write the relevant launch configuration file(s),
certificate files, and any other necessary files to the specified
`--write-config` or `--node-dir` directory.

Generated certificate files are valid for two years, while the certification
authority (CA) certificate is valid for five years. This can be altered with the
`--expire-days` and `--signer-expire-days` options, but for security reasons, it
is recommended to not make them greater than these values.

To create configuration files for an all-in-one server (a master and a node on
the same host) in the specified directory:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start --write-config=/openshift.local.config
----

To create a xref:master-configuration-files[master configuration file] and
other required files in the specified directory:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start master --write-config=/openshift.local.config/master
----

To create a xref:node-configuration-files[node configuration file] and other
related files in the specified directory:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oadm create-node-config \ 
    --node-dir=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname> \
    --node=<node_hostname> \
    --hostnames=<node_hostname>,<ip_address> \
    --certificate-authority="/path/to/ca.crt" \
    --signer-cert="/path/to/ca.crt" \
    --signer-key="/path/to/ca.key" 
    --signer-serial="/path/to/ca.serial.txt"
    --node-client-certificate-authority="/path/to/ca.crt" 
----

When creating node configuration files, the `--hostnames` option accepts a
comma-delimited list of every host name or IP address you want server
certificates to be valid for.

[[launching-servers-using-configuration-files]]

== Launching Servers Using Configuration Files
Once you have modified the master and/or node configuration files to your
specifications, you can use them when launching servers by specifying them as an
argument. Keep in mind that if you specify a configuration file, none of the
other command line options you pass are respected.

To launch an all-in-one server using a master configuration and a node
configuration file:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start --master-config=/openshift.local.config/master/master-config.yaml --node-config=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname>/node-config.yaml
----

To launch a master server using a master configuration file:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start master --config=/openshift.local.config/master/master-config.yaml
----

To launch a node server using a node configuration file:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start node --config=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname>/node-config.yaml
----

[[master-node-config-logging-levels]]
== Configuring Logging Levels

{product-title} uses the `systemd-journald.service` to collect log messages for debugging, using five log message severities. The logging levels are based on Kubernetes logging conventions, as follows:

.Log Level Options
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

|0|Errors and warnings only
|2|Normal information
|4|Debugging-level information 
|6|API-level debugging information (request / response)
|8|Body-level API debugging information
|===

You can control which INFO messages are logged by setting the loglevel option in the in *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* or *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master_* file. Configuring the logs to collect all messages can lead to large logs that are difficult to interpret and can take up excessive space. Collecting all messages should only be used in debug situations.

[NOTE]
====	
Messages with FATAL, ERROR, WARNING and some INFO severities appear in the logs regardless of the log configuration.
====

You can view logs for the master or the node system using the following command:

----
# journalctl -r -u <journal_name>
----
	
Use the `-r` option to show the newest entries first.

For example:

----
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master.service
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-node.service
----

To change the logging level:

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master_* file for the master or *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* file for the nodes.
. Enter a value from the *Log Level Options* table above in the `OPTIONS=--loglevel=` field.
+
For example:
+
----
OPTIONS=--loglevel=4
----
. Restart the master or node host as appropriate:

----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----

After the restart, all new log messages will conform to the new setting. Older messages do not change.

[NOTE]
====
The default log level can be set using the Advanced Install. For more information, see xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#cluster-variables-table[Cluster Variables].
====

The following examples are excerpts from a master *journald* log at various log levels. Timestamps and system information have been removed from these examples.
