:description: How to configure OpenShift master, node, registry, builds, and pods to work with a proxy
:keywords: proxy, firewall, HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY

toc::[]

== Overview
Production environments can deny direct access to the Internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. Configuring OpenShift to use these proxies can
be as simple as setting standard environment variables in configuration or JSON
files.

[[configuring-hosts-for-proxies]]

== Configuring Hosts for Proxies

. Add the `*NO_PROXY*`, `*HTTP_PROXY*`, and `*HTTPS_PROXY*` environment variables
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
to each host's *_/etc/sysconfig/origin-master_* file (for single master
configuration), *_/etc/sysconfig/origin-master-api_*, or
*_/etc/sysconfig/origin-master-controllers_* files (for multi-master
configuration) and *_/etc/sysconfig/origin-node_* file (for node configuration)
depending on the type of host:
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
to each host's *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master_* file (for single
master configuration), *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-api_*, or
*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-controllers_* files (for multi-master
configuration) and *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* file (for node
configuration) depending on the type of host:
endif::[]
+
====
----
HTTP_PROXY=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.1.1:8080/
HTTPS_PROXY=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.0.1:8080/
NO_PROXY=master.hostname.example.com,10.1.0.0/16,172.30.0.0/16 <1>
----
<1> Supports host names and CIDRs. Must include the SDN and service IP ranges `10.1.0.0/16,172.30.0.0/16` by default.
====

. Restart the master or node host as appropriate:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# systemctl restart origin-master
# systemctl restart origin-node
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
endif::[]
----
+
For multi-master installations:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# systemctl restart origin-master-controllers
# systemctl restart origin-master-api
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-controllers
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
endif::[]
----

OpenShift does not accept `*` as a wildcard attached to a domain suffix. For
example, this works:

----
NO_PROXY=.example.com
----

However, this does not:

----
NO_PROXY=*.example.com
----

`*NO_PROXY*` takes a comma-separated list of hosts. The only wildcard is a
single `*` character, which matches all hosts, and effectively disables the
proxy. Each name in this list is matched as either a domain which contains the
host name as a suffix, or the host name itself.

For instance, *example.com* would match *example.com*, *example.com:80*, and *www.example.com*.

[[proxying-docker-pull]]

== Proxying Docker Pull

OpenShift node hosts need to perform push and pull operations to Docker
registries. If you have a registry that does not need a proxy for nodes to
access, include the `*NO_PROXY*` parameter with the registry's host name, the
registry service's IP address, and service name. This blacklists that registry,
leaving the external HTTP proxy as the only option.

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file and add the variables in shell format:
+
====
----
HTTP_PROXY=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.1.1:8080/
HTTPS_PROXY=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.0.1:8080/
NO_PROXY=master.hostname.example.com,172.30.123.45,docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local
----
====

. Restart the Docker service:
+
----
# systemctl restart docker
----

////
. If you had already imported ImageStreams before creating the proxy
configuration, delete, then re-run the process:
+
----
# oc delete imagestreams -n openshift --all
# oc create -f image-streams.json -n openshift
----
////

[[s2i-builds]]

== Configuring S2I Builds for Proxies

S2I builds fetch dependencies from various locations. You can
link:../dev_guide/builds.html#environment-files[use a *_.s2i/environment_* file]
to specify simple shell variables and OpenShift will react accordingly when
seeing build images.

The following are the supported proxy environment variables with example values:

====
----
HTTP_PROXY=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.1.1:8080/
HTTPS_PROXY=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.0.1:8080/
NO_PROXY=master.hostname.example.com
----
====

[[configuring-default-templates-for-proxies]]
== Configuring Default Templates for Proxies

The
link:../install_config/imagestreams_templates.html#creating-instantapp-templates[example templates]
available in OpenShift by default do not include settings for HTTP
proxies. For existing applications based on these templates, modify the
`*source*` section of the application's build configuration and add proxy
settings:

====
----
...
source:
  type: Git
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world
    httpProxy: http://proxy.example.com
    httpsProxy: https://proxy.example.com
...
----
====

This is similar to the process for link:#git-repository-access[using proxies for Git cloning].

[[setting-environment-variables-in-pods]]

== Setting Proxy Environment Variables in Pods

You can set the `*NO_PROXY*`, `*HTTP_PROXY*`, and `*HTTPS_PROXY*` environment
variables in the `*templates.spec.containers*` stanza in a deployment
configuration to pass proxy connection information. The same can be done for
configuring a Pod's proxy at runtime:

====
----
...
containers:
- env:
  - name: "HTTP_PROXY"
    value: "http://USER:PASSWORD@IPADDR:PORT"
...
----
====

You can also use the `oc env` command to update an existing deployment
configuration with a new environment variable:

====
----
$ oc env dc/frontend HTTP_PROXY=http://USER:PASSWORD@IPADDR:PORT
----
====

If you have a link:../dev_guide/deployments.html#triggers[ConfigChange trigger]
set up in your OpenShift instance, the changes happen automatically. Otherwise,
manually redeploy your application for the changes to take effect.
