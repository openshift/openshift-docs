:description: How to configure OpenShift master, node, registry, builds, and pods to work with a proxy
:keywords: proxy, firewall, HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY

toc::[]

== Overview
Production environments can deny direct access to the Internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. Configuring {product-title} to use these
proxies can be as simple as setting standard environment variables in
configuration or JSON files.
This can be done during an
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-configuring-global-proxy[cluster installation] or configured after installation.

The proxy configuration must be the same on each host in the cluster. Therefore,
when setting up the proxy or modifying it, you must update the files on each
{product-title} host to the same values. Then, you must restart {product-title}
services on each host in the cluster.

The `NO_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables are found in
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
each host's *_/etc/sysconfig/origin-master-api_* or
*_/etc/sysconfig/origin-master-controllers_* files and *_/etc/sysconfig/origin-node_* file.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
each host's *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-api_* or
*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-controllers_* files
and *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* file.
endif::[]

[[configuring-no-proxy]]
== Configuring NO_PROXY
The `NO_PROXY` environment variable lists all of the {product-title}
components and all IP addresses that are managed by {product-title}.

On the OpenShift service accepting the CIDR, `NO_PROXY` accepts a
comma-separated list of hosts, IP addresses, or IP ranges in CIDR format:

For master hosts::
* Node host name
* Master IP or host name
* IP address of etcd hosts
For node hosts::
* Master IP or host name
For the Docker service::
* Registry service IP and host name
* Registry service URL `docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local`
* Registry route host name (if created)

[NOTE]
====
When using Docker, Docker accepts a comma-separated list of hosts,
domain extensions, or IP addresses, but does not accept IP ranges in CIDR
format, which are only accepted by OpenShift services. The `no_proxy' variable
should contain a comma-separated list of domain extensions that the proxy should
_not_ be used for.

For example, if `no_proxy` is set to `.school.edu`, the proxy will not be used
to retrieve documents from the specific school.
====

`NO_PROXY` also includes the SDN network and service IP addresses as found
in the *_master-config.yaml_* file.

.*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*
----
networkConfig:
  clusterNetworks:
  - cidr: 10.1.0.0/16
    hostSubnetLength: 9
  serviceNetworkCIDR: 172.30.0.0/16
----

{product-title} does not accept `*` as a wildcard attached to a domain suffix.
For example, the following would be accepted:

----
NO_PROXY=.example.com
----

However, the following would not be:

----
NO_PROXY=*.example.com
----

The only wildcard `NO_PROXY` accepts is a single `*` character, which matches
all hosts, and effectively disables the proxy.

Each name in this list is matched as either a domain which contains the host
name as a suffix, or the host name itself.

[NOTE]
====
When scaling up nodes, use a domain name rather than a list of hostnames.
====

For instance, *example.com* would match *example.com*, *example.com:80*, and *www.example.com*.

[[configuring-hosts-for-proxies-using-ansible]]
== Configuring Hosts for Proxies Using Ansible

During cluster installations, the `NO_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY`
environment variables can be configured using the `openshift_no_proxy`,
`openshift_http_proxy`, and `openshift_https_proxy` parameters, which are
configurable in the
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[inventory file].

.Example Proxy Configuration with Ansible

----
# Global Proxy Configuration
# These options configure HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and NOPROXY environment
# variables for docker and master services.
openshift_http_proxy=http://<user>:<password>@<ip_addr>:<port>
openshift_https_proxy=https://<user>:<password>@<ip_addr>:<port>
openshift_no_proxy='.hosts.example.com,some-host.com'
#
# Most environments do not require a proxy between OpenShift masters, nodes, and
# etcd hosts. So automatically add those host names to the openshift_no_proxy list.
# If all of your hosts share a common domain you may wish to disable this and
# specify that domain above.
# openshift_generate_no_proxy_hosts=True
----

[NOTE]
====
There are
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-configuring-global-proxy[additional proxy settings]
that can be
xref:../install_config/build_defaults_overrides.adoc#setting-global-build-defaults[configured for builds] using Ansible parameters. For
example:

The `openshift_builddefaults_git_http_proxy` and
`openshift_builddefaults_git_https_proxy` parameters allow you to
xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_inputs.adoc#using-a-proxy-for-git-cloning[use a proxy for Git
cloning]

The `openshift_builddefaults_http_proxy` and
`openshift_builddefaults_https_proxy` parameters can make environment variables
available to the
xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#docker-strategy-environment[Docker build strategy]
and xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#custom-strategy-environment[Custom build
strategy] processes.

[[proxying-docker-pull]]
== Proxying Docker Pull

{product-title} node hosts need to perform push and pull operations to Docker
registries. If you have a registry that does not need a proxy for nodes to
access, include the `NO_PROXY` parameter with:

- the registry's host name,
- the registry service's IP address, and
- the service name.

This blacklists that registry, leaving the external HTTP proxy as the only
option.

. Retrieve the registry service's IP address `docker_registy_ip` by running:
+
----
$ oc describe svc/docker-registry -n default

Name:			docker-registry
Namespace:		default
Labels:			docker-registry=default
Selector:		docker-registry=default
Type:			ClusterIP
IP:			172.30.163.183 <1>
Port:			5000-tcp	5000/TCP
Endpoints:		10.1.0.40:5000
Session Affinity:	ClientIP
No events.
----
<1> Registry service IP.

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file and add the `NO_PROXY` variables in
shell format, replacing `<docker_registry_ip>` with the IP address from the
previous step.
+
----
HTTP_PROXY=http://<user>:<password>@<ip_addr>:<port>/
HTTPS_PROXY=https://<user>:<password>@<ip_addr>:<port>/
NO_PROXY=master.hostname.example.com,<docker_registry_ip>,docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local
----

. Restart the Docker service:
+
----
# systemctl restart docker
----

////
. If you had already imported ImageStreams before creating the proxy
configuration, delete, then re-run the process:
+
----
# oc delete imagestreams -n openshift --all
# oc create -f image-streams.json -n openshift
----

== Using Maven Behind a Proxy

There are three options for using Maven behind a proxy on {product-title}:

- Generate the *_settings.xml_* file for the user by setting the
`$HTTP_PROXY_HOST` and `$HTTP_PROXY_PORT` environment variables in the
*_.s2i/environment_* file:
+
====
----
HTTP_PROXY_HOST=<hostname>
HTTP_PROXY_PORT=<port_number>
----
====
+
Optionally, you can also set the `$HTTP_PROXY_USERNAME`, `HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD`, and `HTTP_PROXY_NONPROXYHOSTS` variables:
+
====
----
HTTP_PROXY_USERNAME=<user_name>
HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD=<password>
HTTP_PROXY_NONPROXYHOSTS=<hostname>
----
====

- Move the *_settings.xml_* file into your application's local Git repository:
+
====
----
$ mv settings.xml <git_repo>/configuration/settings.xml
----
====

- Point the `MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND` environment variable to the location of the
*_settings.xml_* file:
+
====
----
MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND=" -s path/to/file"
----
====
////

[[using-maven-behind-a-proxy]]
== Using Maven Behind a Proxy

Using Maven with proxies requires using the `HTTP_PROXY_NONPROXYHOSTS` variable.

See the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_middleware_for_openshift/3/html-single/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform_for_openshift/#configuring_eap_for_openshift[Red
Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform for OpenShift documentation] for
information about configuring your {product-title} environment for Red Hat
JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, including the step for setting up Maven
behind a proxy.

[[s2i-builds]]

== Configuring S2I Builds for Proxies

S2I builds fetch dependencies from various locations. You can
xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#environment-files[use a *_.s2i/environment_* file]
to specify simple shell variables and {product-title} will react accordingly when
seeing build images.

The following are the supported proxy environment variables with example values:

----
HTTP_PROXY=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.1.1:8080/
HTTPS_PROXY=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.0.1:8080/
NO_PROXY=master.hostname.example.com
----

[[configuring-default-templates-for-proxies]]
== Configuring Default Templates for Proxies

The
xref:../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#creating-instantapp-templates[example
templates] available in {product-title} by default do not include settings for
HTTP proxies. For existing applications based on these templates, modify the
`source` section of the application's build configuration and add proxy
settings:

----
...
source:
  type: Git
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world
    httpProxy: http://proxy.example.com
    httpsProxy: https://proxy.example.com
    noProxy: somedomain.com, otherdomain.com
...
----

This is similar to the process for xref:git-repository-access[using proxies for Git cloning].

[[setting-environment-variables-in-pods]]

== Setting Proxy Environment Variables in Pods

You can set the `NO_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment
variables in the `templates.spec.containers` stanza in a deployment
configuration to pass proxy connection information. The same can be done for
configuring a Pod's proxy at runtime:

----
...
containers:
- env:
  - name: "HTTP_PROXY"
    value: "http://<user>:<password>@<ip_addr>:<port>"
...
----

You can also use the `oc set env` command to update an existing deployment
configuration with a new environment variable:

----
$ oc set env dc/frontend HTTP_PROXY=http://<user>:<password>@<ip_addr>:<port>
----

If you have a xref:../dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.adoc#triggers[ConfigChange trigger]
set up in your {product-title}t instance, the changes happen automatically.
Otherwise, manually redeploy your application for the changes to take effect.
