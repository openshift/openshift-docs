== Overview
This topic builds upon
xref:../advanced_ldap_configuration/sssd_for_ldap_failover.adoc#setting-up-for-ldap-failover[Setting up SSSD
for LDAP Failover] and
xref:../advanced_ldap_configuration/configuring_form_based_authentication.adoc#configuring-form-based-authentication[Configuring
Form-Based Authentication] and focuses on configuring extended Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) attributes.

[[configuring-extended-ldap-attributes-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

* SSSD 1.12.0 or later. This is available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 and
later.
* mod_lookup_identity 0.9.4 or later.
** The required version is not yet available on any version of Red Hat Enterprise
Linux. However, compatible packages (RPMs) are
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/adelton/identity_demo/[available from
upstream] until they arrive in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

== Configuring SSSD
You need to ask System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) to look up attributes in
LDAP that it normally does not care about for simple system-login use-cases. In
the case of {product-title}, there is only one such attribute: email. So, you need to:

. Modify the *[domain/DOMAINNAME]* section of *_/etc/sssd/sssd.conf_* on the
authenticating proxy and add this attribute:
+
----
[domain/example.com]
...
ldap_user_extra_attrs = mail
----

. Tell SSSD that it is acceptable for this attribute to be retrieved by
Apache. Add the following two lines to the *[ifp]* section of
*_/etc/sssd/sssd.conf_*:
+
====
----
[ifp]
user_attributes = +mail
allowed_uids = apache, root
----
====

. Restart SSSD:
+
====
----
# systemctl restart sssd.service
----
====

. Test this configuration.

[[configuring-extended-ldap-attributes-config-apache]]
== Configuring Apache

Now that SSSD is set up and successfully serving extended attributes, configure
the web server to ask for them and to insert them in the correct places.

. Enable the module to be loaded by Apache.  To do so, modify
*_/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/55-lookup_identity.conf_* and uncomment the line:
+
====
----
LoadModule lookup_identity_module modules/mod_lookup_identity.so
----
====

. Set an SELinux boolean so that SElinux allows Apache to connect to SSSD over
D-BUS:
+
====
----
# setsebool -P httpd_dbus_sssd on
----
====

. Edit *_/etc/httpd/conf.d/openshift-proxy.conf_* and add the following
lines inside the *<ProxyMatch /oauth/authorize>* section:
+
====
----
<ProxyMatch /oauth/authorize>
  AuthName openshift

  LookupOutput Headers <1>
  LookupUserAttr mail X-Remote-User-Email <1>
  LookupUserGECOS X-Remote-User-Display-Name <1>

  RequestHeader set X-Remote-User %{REMOTE_USER}s env=REMOTE_USER
</ProxyMatch>
----
<1> Added line.
====

. Restart Apache to pick up the changes:
+
====
----
# systemctl restart httpd.service
----
====

[[configuring-extended-ldap-attributes-config-openshift]]
== Configuring {product-title}

Tell {product-title} where to find these new attributes during login. To do so:

. Edit the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file and add the following lines to
the *identityProviders* section:
+
====
----
identityProviders:
 - name: sssd
 challenge: true
 login: true
 mappingMethod: claim
 provider:
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: RequestHeaderIdentityProvider
   challengeURL: "https://proxy.example.com/challenging-proxy/oauth/authorize?${query}"
   loginURL: "https://proxy.example.com/login-proxy/oauth/authorize?${query}"
   clientCA: /home/example/workspace/openshift/configs/openshift.example.com/proxy/proxyca.crt
   headers:
   - X-Remote-User
   emailHeaders: <1>
   - X-Remote-User-Email <1>
   nameHeaders: <1>
   - X-Remote-User-Display-Name <1>
----
<1> Added line.
====

. Launch {product-title} with this updated configuration and log in to the web as
a new user.
+
You should see their full name appear in the upper-right of the
screen. You can also verify with `oc get identities -o yaml` that both email
addresses and full names are available.

[[configuring-extended-ldap-attributes-debugging]]
== Debugging Notes

Currently, {product-title} only saves these attributes to the user at the time
of the first login and does not update them again after that. So, while you are
testing (and only while testing), run `oc delete users,identities --all` to
clear the identities out so you can log in again.
