== Overview
{product-title} provides an
xref:../configuring_authentication.adoc#LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider[authentication
provider] for use with Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) setups, but
it can only connect to a single LDAP server. This can be problematic if that
LDAP server becomes unavailable. System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) can be
used to solve the issue.

Originally designed to manage local and remote authentication to the host
operating system, SSSD can now be configured to provide identity,
authentication, and authorization services to web services like {product-title}.
SSSD provides advantages over the built-in LDAP provider, including the ability
to connect to any number of failover LDAP servers, as well as the ability to
cache authentication attempts in case it can no longer reach any of those
servers.

The setup for this configuration is advanced and requires a separate
authentication server (also called an *authenticating proxy*) for
{product-title} to communicate with. This topic describes how to do this setup
on a dedicated physical or virtual machine (VM), but the concepts are also
applicable to a setup in a container.

[[sssd-prerequisites-for-authenticating-proxy-setup]]
== Prerequisites for Authenticating Proxy Setup

. Before starting setup, you need to know the following information about your
LDAP server.
+
* Whether the directory server is powered by
http://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page[FreeIPA], Active Directory, or another
LDAP solution.
+
* The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for the LDAP server (for example,
ldap.example.com).
+
* The location of the CA certificate for the LDAP server.
+
* Whether the LDAP server corresponds to RFC 2307 or RFC2307bis for user groups.
+
. Prepare the VMs:
+
* *_proxy.example.com_*: A VM to use as the authenticating proxy. This machine must
have at least SSSD 1.12.0 available, which means a fairly recent operating
system. This topic uses a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 server for its examples.
+
* *_openshift.example.com_*: A VM to use to run {product-title}.

[NOTE]
====
These VMs can be configured to run on the same system, but for the examples used
in this topic they are kept separate.
====

[[sssd-phase-1-certificate-generation]]
== Phase 1: Certificate Generation

[NOTE]
====
This phase generates certificate files that are valid for two years (or five
years for the certification authority (CA) certificate). This can be altered
with the `--expire-days` and `--signer-expire-days` options, but for security
reasons, it is recommended to not make them greater than these values.
====

Perform this procedure on the first master host listed in the Ansible host inventory file,
by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.

. To ensure that communication between the authenticating proxy and
{product-title} is trustworthy, create a set of Transport Layer Security (TLS)
certificates to use during the other phases of this setup. In the
{product-title} system, start by using the auto-generated certificates created
as part of running:
+
====
----
# openshift start \
    --public-master=https://openshift.example.com:8443 \
    --write-config=/etc/origin/
----
====
+
Among other things, this generates a *_/etc/origin/master/ca.{cert|key}_*. Use
this signing certificate to generate keys to use on the authenticating proxy.
+
====
----
# mkdir -p /etc/origin/proxy/
# oc adm ca create-server-cert \
    --cert='/etc/origin/proxy/proxy.example.com.crt' \
    --key='/etc/origin/proxy/proxy.example.com.key' \
    --hostnames=proxy.example.com \
    --signer-cert=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
    --signer-key='/etc/origin/master/ca.key' \
    --signer-serial='/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt'
----
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that any host names and interface IP addresses that need to access the
proxy are listed. Otherwise, the HTTPS connection will fail.
====

. Create a new CA to sign this client certificate:
+
====
----
# oc adm ca create-signer-cert \
  --cert='/etc/origin/proxy/proxyca.crt' \
  --key='/etc/origin/proxy/proxyca.key' \
  --name='openshift-proxy-signer@UNIQUESTRING' \ <1>
  --serial='/etc/origin/proxy/proxyca.serial.txt'
----
<1> Make `*UNIQUESTRING*` something unique.
====

. Generate the API client certificate that the authenticating proxy will use
to prove its identity to {product-title}.
+
====
----
# oc adm create-api-client-config \
    --certificate-authority='/etc/origin/proxy/proxyca.crt' \
    --client-dir='/etc/origin/proxy' \
    --signer-cert='/etc/origin/proxy/proxyca.crt' \
    --signer-key='/etc/origin/proxy/proxyca.key' \
    --signer-serial='/etc/origin/proxy/proxyca.serial.txt' \
    --user='system:proxy'
----
====
+
This prevents malicious users from impersonating the proxy and sending fake
identities.

. Copy the certificate and key information to the appropriate file for future
steps:
+
====
----
# cat /etc/origin/proxy/system\:proxy.crt \
      /etc/origin/proxy/system\:proxy.key \
      > /etc/origin/proxy/authproxy.pem
----
====


[[sssd-phase-2-authenticating-proxy-setup]]
== Phase 2: Authenticating Proxy Setup

This section guides you through the steps to authenticate the proxy setup.

[[phase-2-step-1-copy-certificates]]
=== Step 1: Copy Certificates

From *_openshift.example.com_*, securely copy the necessary certificates to the
proxy machine:

====
----
# scp /etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
      root@proxy.example.com:/etc/pki/CA/certs/

# scp /etc/origin/proxy/proxy.example.com.crt \
      /etc/origin/proxy/authproxy.pem \
      root@proxy.example.com:/etc/pki/tls/certs/

# scp /etc/origin/proxy/proxy.example.com.key \
      root@proxy.example.com:/etc/pki/tls/private/
----
====

[[phase-2-step-2-sssd-configuration]]
=== Step 2: SSSD Configuration
. Install a new VM with an operating system that includes 1.12.0 or later so
that you can use the *mod_identity_lookup* module. The examples in this topic
use a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Server.

. Install all of the necessary dependencies:
+
====
----
# yum install -y sssd \
                 sssd-dbus \
                 realmd \
                 httpd \
                 mod_session \
                 mod_ssl \
                 mod_lookup_identity \
                 mod_authnz_pam
----
====
+
This gives you the needed SSSD and the web server components.

. Edit the /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/55-authnz_pam.conf file and remove the comment from the following:
+
====
----
LoadModule authnz_pam_module modules/mod_authnz_pam.so
----
====

. Set up SSSD to authenticate this VM against the LDAP server. If the LDAP server
is a FreeIPA or Active Directory environment, then *realmd* can be used to join
this machine to the domain.
+
====
----
# realm join ldap.example.com
----
====
+
For more advanced case, see the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System-Level_Authentication_Guide/authconfig-ldap.html[System-Level Authentication Guide]
+
If you want to use SSSD to manage failover situations for LDAP, this can be
configured by adding additional entries in *_/etc/sssd/sssd.conf_* on the
*ldap_uri* line. Systems enrolled with FreeIPA can automatically handle
failover using DNS SRV records.

. Restart SSSD to ensure that all of the changes are applied properly:
+
====
----
$ systemctl restart sssd.service
----
====

. Test that the user information can be retrieved properly:
+
====
----
$ getent passwd <username>
username:*:12345:12345:Example User:/home/username:/usr/bin/bash
----
====

. Attempt to log into the VM as an LDAP user and confirm that the authentication
is properly set up. This can be done via the local console or a remote service
such as SSH.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not want LDAP users to be able to log into this machine, it is
recommended to modify *_/etc/pam.d/system-auth_* and
*_/etc/pam.d/password-auth_* to remove the lines containing *pam_sss.so*.
====

[[phase-2-step-3-apache-configuration]]
=== Step 3: Apache Configuration

You need to set up Apache to communicate with SSSD. Create a PAM stack file for
use with Apache. To do so:

.  Create the *_/etc/pam.d/openshift_* file and add the
following contents:
+
====
----
auth required pam_sss.so
account required pam_sss.so
----
====
+
This configuration enables PAM (the pluggable authentication module) to use
*pam_sss.so* to determine authentication and access control when an
authentication request is issued for the *openshift* stack.

. Configure the Apache *_httpd.conf_*. The steps in this section focus on
setting up the challenge authentication, which is useful for logging in with `oc
login` and similar automated tools.
+
[NOTE]
====
xref:../advanced_ldap_configuration/configuring_form_based_authentication.adoc#configuring-form-based-authentication[Configuring
Form-Based Authentication] explains how to set up a graphical login using SSSD
as well, but it requires the rest of this setup as a prerequisite.
====

. Create the new file *_openshift-proxy.conf_* in *_/etc/httpd/conf.d_*
(substituting the correct host names where indicated):
+
====
----
LoadModule request_module modules/mod_request.so
LoadModule lookup_identity_module modules/mod_lookup_identity.so

[[sssd-phase-3-openshift-configuration]]
== Phase 3: {product-title} Configuration

This section describes how to set up an {product-title} server from scratch in
an "all in one" configuration.
xref:../master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[Master and Node
Configuration] provides more information on alternate configurations.

Modify the default configuration to use the new identity provider just
created. To do so:

. Modify the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file.

. Scan through it and locate the *identityProviders* section and replace it with:
+
====
----
  identityProviders:
  - name: any_provider_name
    challenge: true
    login: false
    mappingMethod: claim
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: RequestHeaderIdentityProvider
      challengeURL: "https://proxy.example.com/challenging-proxy/oauth/authorize?${query}"
      clientCA: /etc/origin/proxy/proxyca.crt
      headers:
      - X-Remote-User
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
xref:../advanced_ldap_configuration/configuring_form_based_authentication.adoc#configuring-form-based-authentication[Configuring
Form-Based Authentication] explains how to add the login URL to support web
logins.

xref:../advanced_ldap_configuration/configuring_extended_ldap_attributes.adoc#configuring-extended-ldap-attributes[Configuring
Extended LDAP Attributes] explains how to add the email and full-name
attributes. Note that the full-name attributes are only stored to the database
on the first login.
====

. Start {product-title} with the updated configuration:
+
====
----
# openshift start \
    --public-master=https://openshift.example.com:8443 \
    --master-config=/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml \
    --node-config=/etc/origin/node-node1.example.com/node-config.yaml
----
====

. Test logins:
+
====
----
oc login https://openshift.example.com:8443
----
====
+
It should now be possible to log in with only valid LDAP credentials.
