== Overview
{product-title} can be configured to access
link:https://www.vmware.com/au/products/vsphere.html[VMWare vSphere] VMDK
Volumes, including
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_vsphere.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-vsphere[using
VMWare vSphere VMDK Volumes as persistent storage] for application data.

The vSphere Cloud Provider allows using vSphere managed storage within {product-title} and supports:

* Volumes,
* Persistent Volumes, and
* Storage Classes and provisioning of volumes.

[[vsphere-enabling]]
== Enabling VMWare vSphere Cloud Provider

To enable VMWare vSphere cloud provider for {product-title}:

.
link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-031BDB12-D3B2-4E2D-80E6-604F304B4D0C.html[Create
a VM folder] and move {product-title} Node VMs to this folder.

. Verify that the Node VM names complies with the regex `[a-z](([-0-9a-z]+)?[0-9a-z])?(\.[a-z0-9](([-0-9a-z]+)?[0-9a-z])?)*`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
VM Names can not:

* begin with numbers.
* have any capital letters.
* have any special characters except `.` and `-`.
* be shorter than three characters and longer than 63 characters.
====

. Set the `disk.EnableUUID` parameter to `TRUE` for each Node VM. This ensures that the VMDK always presents a consistent UUID to the VM, allowing the disk to be mounted properly. For every virtual machine node that will be participating in the cluster, follow the steps below using the link:https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc[GOVC tool]:
+
.. Set up the GOVC environment:
+
[source,bash]
----
export GOVC_URL='vCenter IP OR FQDN'
export GOVC_USERNAME='vCenter User'
export GOVC_PASSWORD='vCenter Password'
export GOVC_INSECURE=1
----
+
.. Find the Node VM paths:
+
[source,bash]
----
govc ls /datacenter/vm/<vm-folder-name>
----
.. Set disk.EnableUUID to true for all VMs:
+
[source,bash]
----
govc vm.change -e="disk.enableUUID=1" -vm='VM Path'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If {product-title} node VMs are created from a template VM, then
`disk.EnableUUID=1` can be set on the template VM. VMs cloned from this
template, inherit this property.
====

. Create and assign roles to the vSphere Cloud Provider user and vSphere
entities. vSphere Cloud Provider requires the following privileges to interact
with vCenter. See the
link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-18071E9A-EED1-4968-8D51-E0B4F526FDA3.html[vSphere
Documentation Center] for steps to create a custom role, user and role
assignment.

. Create the
xref:vsphere-configuration-file[vSphere
cloud configuration file `vsphere.conf`], and place it in the shared directory
that is accessible from kubelet container, controller-manager pod, and the API
server pod.

.  Add the following flags to the kubelet that is running on every node and to
the controller-manager and API server pods manifest files:
+
[source,bash]
----
--cloud-provider=vsphere
--cloud-config=<Path of the vsphere.conf file>
----

. Restart the kubelet on all nodes by reloading the kubelet systemd unit file
using:
+
----
# systemctl daemon-reload
----
+
Then restart the kubelet service for the changes to take effect:
----
# systemctl restart kubelet.service
----
+
[NOTE]
====
After enabling the vSphere Cloud Provider, Node names are set to the VM names
from the vCenter Inventory.

[[vsphere-configuration-file]]
== The VMWare vSphere Configuration File
Configuring {product-title} for VMWare vSphere requires the
*_/etc/vsphere/vsphere.conf_* file, on each node host.

If the file does not exist, create it, and add the following:

----
[Global]
        user = "username" <1>
        password = "password" <2>
        server = "10.10.0.2" <3>
        port = "443" <4>
        insecure-flag = "1" <5>
        datacenter = "datacenter-name" <6>
        datastore = "datastore-name" <7>
        working-dir = "vm-folder-path" <8>
        vm-uuid = "vm-uuid" <10>
[Disk]
    scsicontrollertype = pvscsi
----
<1> vCenter username for the vSphere cloud provider.
<2> vCenter password for the specified user.
<3> IP Address or FQDN for the vCenter server.
<4> (Optional) Port number for the vCenter server. Defaults to port `443`.
<5> Set to `1` if the vCenter uses a self-signed cert.
<6> Name of the data center on which Node VMs are deployed.
<7> Name of the datastore to use for provisioning volumes using the storage classes or dynamic provisioning. If datastore is located in a storage folder or datastore is a member of datastore cluster, specify the full datastore path. Verify that vSphere Cloud Provider user has the read privilege set on the datastore cluster or storage folder to be able to find datastore.
<8> (Optional) The vCenter VM folder path in which the node VMs are located. It can be set to an empty path(`working-dir = ""`), if Node VMs are located in the root VM folder.
<9> (Optional) VM Instance UUID of the Node VM. It can be set to empty (`vm-uuid = ""`). If this is set to empty, this is retrieved from *_/sys/class/dmi/id/product_serial_* file on virtual machine (requires root access).

[[vsphere-configuring-masters]]
== Configuring Masters
Edit or
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#creating-new-configuration-files[create]
the master configuration file on all masters
(*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* by default) and update the contents
of the `apiServerArguments` and `controllerArguments` sections with the
following:

[source, yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  admissionConfig:
    pluginConfig:
      {}
  apiServerArguments:
    cloud-provider:
    - "vsphere"
    cloud-config:
    - "/etc/vsphere/vsphere.conf"
  controllerArguments:
    cloud-provider:
    - "vsphere"
    cloud-config:
    - "/etc/vsphere/vsphere.conf"
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
When triggering a containerized installation, only the *_/etc/origin_* and
*_/var/lib/origin_* directories are mounted to the master and node container.
Therefore, *_master-config.yaml_* must be in *_/etc/origin/master_* rather than
*_/etc/_*.
====

[[vsphere-configuring-nodes]]
== Configuring Nodes

. Edit or
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#creating-new-configuration-files[create]
the node configuration file on all nodes (*_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_*
by default) and update the contents of the `kubeletArguments` section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kubeletArguments:
  cloud-provider:
    - "vsphere"
  cloud-config:
    - "/etc/vsphere/vsphere.conf"

----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When triggering a containerized installation, only the *_/etc/origin_* and
*_/var/lib/origin_* directories are mounted to the master and node container.
Therefore, *_node-config.yaml_* must be in *_/etc/origin/node_* rather than
*_/etc/_*.
====

[[vsphere-applying-configuration-changes]]
== Applying Configuration Changes

Start or restart {product-title} services on all master and node hosts to apply your
configuration changes:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master
# systemctl restart origin-node
----
endif::[]

Switching from not using a cloud provider to using a cloud provider produces an
error message. Adding the cloud provider tries to delete the node because the
node switches from using the *hostname* as the `*externalID*` (which would have
been the case when no cloud provider was being used) to using the vSphere
`*instance-id*` (which is what the vSphere cloud provider specifies). To resolve
this issue:

.  Log in to the CLI as a cluster administrator.
. Check and backup existing node labels:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc describe node <node_name> | grep -Poz '(?s)Labels.*\n.*(?=Taints)'
----
.  Delete the nodes:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc delete node <node_name>
----
.  On each node host, restart the {product-title} service.
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ systemctl restart origin-node
----
endif::[]
.  Add back any xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[labels on each node] that you previously had.
