{product-title} Installation and Configuration topics cover the basics of
installing and configuring a {product-title} cluster in your development or
production environment. Further configuration for authentication, logging,
metrics, and more are also covered. Use these topics for the one-time tasks
required quickly set up your {product-title} cluster and configure it based on
your organizational needs.

== Why OpenShift?

A developer makes an image from their code and publishes it into a repository.
{product-title} grabs the image, adds it to the cluster, then creates a
container out of it.

One relatable example is that of a web server. A developer creates, for example,
a Red Hat JBoss Web Server image with a specific, custom configuration. You can
then download this image from the registry hosting it, run this image as a
container within your own {product-title} cluster, and use this web server for
running your own website. This whole process of downloading and running your web
server should take no more than a few minutes.

== Cluster Installations at a Glance

The
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick
installation] method allows you to use an interactive CLI utility to install
{product-title} across a set of hosts. This quick installer is a self-contained
wrapper intended for usage on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 system, but
can deploy to RHEL 7 or RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems.

You can quickly get {product-title} running by choosing an installation method
in
xref:../../getting_started/administrators.adoc#getting-started-administrators[Getting
Started for Administrators].

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
The
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced
installation] method goes a step further and provides even more configuration
options. By defining an inventory file, you can run the Ansible playbooks
powering the quick installer directly to deploy your {product-title} cluster.

Installing an {product-title} cluster involves the following main steps, which
this documentation guides you through in later sections:

. **Choose an installation method: quick or advanced.** See
xref:which-install-method[Which Method Should You Use?] for recommendations.
. Because {product-title} runs as a distributed system in a cluster across
multiple hosts, **decide how large you want your cluster to be**. See
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.html#host-recommendations[Host
Recommendations] for sizing details. For example:
.. Decide whether you want a single master or highly-available clustered masters.
.. Decide how many nodes you require.
. **Run through all
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[Prerequisites]** to prepare all hosts intended for the cluster.
. **Start the installation** by following the topic for your chosen installation
method:
.. For
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick
installations], this involves running the `atomic-openshift-installer` command
and answering a series of questions via the interactive CLI about your intended
cluster before the automated Ansible-based installation is kicked off.
.. For
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced
installations], this involves defining an inventory file
(*_/etc/ansible/hosts_*) that describes the location, components, and
configuration for all hosts, plus any other cluster configuration settings, then
running the Ansible playbooks directly to kick off the installation.


[[which-install-method]]
== Which Method Should You Use?

Both the quick and advanced installations methods are supported for development
and production environments. If you want to quickly get {product-title} up and
running to try out for the first time, use the quick installer and let the
interactive CLI guide you through the configuration options relevant to your
environment.

For the most control over your cluster's configuration, you can use the advanced
installation method. This method is particularly suited if you are already
familiar with Ansible. However, following along with the {product-title}
documentation should equip you with enough information to reliably deploy your
cluster and continue to manage its configuration post-deployment using the
provided Ansible playbooks directly.

If you install initially using the quick installer, you can always further tweak
your cluster's configuration and adjust the number of hosts in the cluster using
the same installer tool. If you wanted to later switch to using the advanced
method, you can create an inventory file for your configuration and carry on
that way.

Until an advanced HA installation method has been documented and tested, users
are encouraged to use the
