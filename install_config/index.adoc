{product-title} Installation and Configuration topics cover the basics of
installing and configuring a {product-title} cluster in your development or
production environment. Further configuration for authentication, logging,
metrics, and more are also covered. Use these topics for the one-time tasks
required quickly set up your {product-title} cluster and configure it based on
your organizational needs.

== Why OpenShift?

A developer makes an image from their code and publishes it into a repository.
{product-title} grabs the image, adds it to the cluster, then creates a
container out of it.

One relatable example is that of a web server. A developer creates, for example,
a Red Hat JBoss Web Server image with a specific, custom configuration. You can
then download this image from the registry hosting it, run this image as a
container within your own {product-title} cluster, and use this web server for
running your own website. This whole process of downloading and running your web
server should take no more than a few minutes.

== Cluster Installations at a Glance

The _quick installation_ method allows you to use an interactive CLI utility to
install {product-title} across a set of hosts. This quick installer is a
self-contained wrapper intended for usage on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7
system, but can deploy to RHEL 7 or RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems.

You can quickly get {product-title} running by choosing an installation method
in
xref:../../getting_started/administrators.adoc#getting-started-administrators[Getting
Started for Administrators].

The _advanced installation_ method goes a step further and provides even more
configuration options. By defining an inventory file, you can run the Ansible
playbooks powering the quick installer directly to deploy your {product-title}
cluster.

Installing an {product-title} cluster involves the following main steps, which
this documentation guides you through in later sections:

. **Choose an installation method**: quick or advanced.
. **Plan out your infrastructure.** The Planning topic provides recommendations
based on the size of the cluster you intend to run, plus other considerations
like whether to install via RPM or containerized components.
. **Run through all Prerequisites topics** to prepare your environment and all hosts intended for the cluster.
. **Start the installation** by following the topic for your chosen installation
method:
.. For quick installations, this involves running the `atomic-openshift-installer`
command and answering a series of questions via the interactive CLI about your
intended cluster before the automated Ansible-based installation is kicked off.
.. For advanced installations, this involves defining an inventory file
(*_/etc/ansible/hosts_*) that describes the location, components, and
configuration for all hosts, plus any other cluster configuration settings, then
running the Ansible playbooks directly to kick off the installation.

Until an advanced HA installation method has been documented and tested, users
are encouraged to use the

installation method].
