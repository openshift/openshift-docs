== Overview

These examples demonstrate a few configuration scenarios for xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[StorageClasses] and Dynamic Provisioning using Google Cloud Platform Compute Engine (GCE). These examples
assume:

- Some familiarity with {product-title}, GCE, and Persistent Disks
- {product-title} is installed and xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_gce.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-gce[properly configured to use GCE].

The examples included in this sections are:

- xref:../../install_config/storage_examples/storage_classes_dynamic_provisioning.adoc#example1[Basic Dynamic Provisioning]
- xref:../../install_config/storage_examples/storage_classes_dynamic_provisioning.adoc#example2[Defaulting Cluster Dynamic Provisioning Behavior]


[[example1]]
== Scenario 1: Basic Dynamic Provisioning with Two Types of _StorageClasses_

_StorageClasses_ can be used to differentiate and delineate storage levels and
usages. In this case, the `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin` sets up two
distinct classes of storage in GCE.

- `slow`: Cheap, efficient, and optimized for sequential data operations (slower reading and writing)
- `fast`: Optimized for higher rates of random IOPS and sustained throughput (faster reading and writing)

By creating these _StorageClasses_, the `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin`
allows users to create claims requesting a particular level or service of
_StorageClass_.

.StorageClass Slow Object Definitions
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: slow <1>
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd <2>
parameters:
  type: pd-standard <3>
  zone: us-east1-d  <4>
----
<1>  Name of the _StorageClass_.
<2>  The provisioner plug-in to be used. This is a required field for _StorageClasses_.
<3>  PD type. This example uses `pd-standard`, which has a slightly lower cost, rate of sustained IOPS, and throughput versus `pd-ssd`, which carries more sustained IOPS and throughput.
<4>  The zone is required.
====

.StorageClass Fast Object Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-ssd
  zone: us-east1-d
----
====

As a `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin`, save both definitions as YAML files.
 For example, `slow-gce.yaml` and `fast-gce.yaml`. Then create the _StorageClasses_.

====
----

# oc create -f slow-gce.yaml
storageclass "slow" created

# oc create -f fast-gce.yaml
storageclass "fast" created

# oc get storageclass
NAME       TYPE
fast       kubernetes.io/gce-pd
slow       kubernetes.io/gce-pd

----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
`cluster-admin` or `storage-admin` users are responsible for relaying the correct
_StorageClass_ name to the correct users, groups, and projects.
====

As a regular user, create a new project:

====
----

# oc new-project rh-eng

----
====

Create the claim YAML definition, save it to a file (`pvc-fast.yaml`):
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
 name: pvc-engineering
spec:
 accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
 resources:
   requests:
     storage: 10Gi
 storageClassName: fast
----
====

Add the claim with the `oc create` command:
====
----

# oc create -f pvc-fast.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim "pvc-engineering" created

----
====

Check to see if your claim is bound:
====
----

# oc get pvc
NAME              STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
pvc-engineering   Bound     pvc-e9b4fef7-8bf7-11e6-9962-42010af00004   10Gi       RWX           2m

----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since this claim was created and bound in the _rh-eng_ project, it can be shared
by any user in the same project.
====

As a `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin` user, view the recent dynamically provisioned Persistent Volume (PV).

====
----

# oc get pv
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS    CLAIM                     REASON    AGE
pvc-e9b4fef7-8bf7-11e6-9962-42010af00004   10Gi       RWX           Delete          Bound     rh-eng/pvc-engineering              5m

----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Notice the xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[RECLAIMPOLICY]
is _Delete_ by default for all dynamically provisioned volumes. This means the
volume only lasts as long as the claim still exists in the system. If you delete
the claim, the volume is also deleted and all data on the volume is lost.
====

Finally, check the GCE console. The new disk has been created and is ready for use. 

====
----
kubernetes-dynamic-pvc-e9b4fef7-8bf7-11e6-9962-42010af00004 	SSD persistent disk 	10 GB 	us-east1-d
----
====

Pods can now reference the persistent volume claim and start using the volume.

== Scenario 2: How to enable Default _StorageClass_ behavior for a Cluster

In this example, a `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin` enables a _default_
storage class for all other users and projects that do not implicitly specify a
_StorageClass_ in their claim. This is useful for a `cluster-admin`
or `storage-admin` to provide easy management of a storage volume without having
to set up or communicate specialized _StorageClasses_ across the cluster.

This example builds upon <<example1>>. The `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin`
will create another _StorageClass_ for designation as the _default_
_StorageClass_.

.Default StorageClass Object Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: generic <1>
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true" <2>
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-standard
  zone: us-east1-d
----
<1>  Name of the _StorageClass_, which needs to be unique in the cluster.
<2>  Annotation that marks this _StorageClass_ as the default class. You must
use `"true"` quoted in this version of the API. Without this
annotation, {product-title} considers this not the _default_ _StorageClass_.
====

As a `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin` save the definition to a YAML file
(`generic-gce.yaml`), then create the _StorageClasses_:

====
----
# oc create -f generic-gce.yaml
storageclass "generic" created

# oc get storageclass
NAME       TYPE
generic    kubernetes.io/gce-pd
fast       kubernetes.io/gce-pd
slow       kubernetes.io/gce-pd
----
====

As a regular user, create a new claim definition without any _StorageClass_
requirement and save it to a file (`generic-pvc.yaml`).

._default_ Storage Claim Object Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
 name: pvc-engineering2
spec:
 accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
 resources:
   requests:
     storage: 5Gi
----
====

Execute it and check the claim is bound:
====
----

# oc create -f generic-pvc.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim "pvc-engineering2" created
                                                                   3s
# oc get pvc
NAME               STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
pvc-engineering    Bound     pvc-e9b4fef7-8bf7-11e6-9962-42010af00004   10Gi       RWX           41m
pvc-engineering2   Bound     pvc-a9f70544-8bfd-11e6-9962-42010af00004   5Gi        RWX           7s  <1>

----
<1> `pvc-engineering2` is bound to a dynamically provisioned Volume by _default_.
====

As a `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin`, view the Persistent Volumes defined so
far:

====
----
# oc get pv
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS    CLAIM                     REASON    AGE
pvc-a9f70544-8bfd-11e6-9962-42010af00004   5Gi        RWX           Delete          Bound     rh-eng/pvc-engineering2             5m <1>

pvc-e9b4fef7-8bf7-11e6-9962-42010af00004   10Gi       RWX           Delete          Bound     rh-eng/pvc-engineering              46m <2>
----
<1> This PV was bound to our _default_ dynamic volume from the _default_ _StorageClass_.
<2> This PV was bound to our first PVC from <<example1>> with our _fast_ _StorageClass_.
====

Create a manually provisioned disk using
link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/[GCE] (not dynamically
provisioned). Then create a xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_gce.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-gce[Persistent Volume] that connects to the new GCE disk (`pv-manual-gce.yaml`).

.Manual PV Object Defition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
 name: pv-manual-gce
spec:
 capacity:
   storage: 35Gi
 accessModes:
   - ReadWriteMany
 gcePersistentDisk:
   readOnly: false
   pdName: the-newly-created-gce-PD
   fsType: ext4
----
====

Execute the object definition file:

====
----
# oc create -f pv-manual-gce.yaml
----
====

Now view the PVs again. Notice that a `pv-manual-gce` volume is _Available_.

====
----
# oc get pv
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS      CLAIM                     REASON    AGE
pv-manual-gce                              35Gi       RWX           Retain          Available                                       4s
pvc-a9f70544-8bfd-11e6-9962-42010af00004   5Gi        RWX           Delete          Bound       rh-eng/pvc-engineering2             12m
pvc-ba4612ce-8b4d-11e6-9962-42010af00004   5Gi        RWO           Delete          Bound       mytest/gce-dyn-claim1               21h
pvc-e9b4fef7-8bf7-11e6-9962-42010af00004   10Gi       RWX           Delete          Bound       rh-eng/pvc-engineering              53m
----
====

Now create another claim identical to the `generic-pvc.yaml` PVC definition but
change the name and do not set a storage class name.

.Claim Object Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
 name: pvc-engineering3
spec:
 accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
 resources:
   requests:
     storage: 15Gi
----
====

Because _default_ _StorageClass_ is enabled in this instance, the manually
created PV does not satisfy the claim request. The user receives a new
dynamically provisioned Persistent Volume.

====
----

# oc get pvc
NAME               STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
pvc-engineering    Bound     pvc-e9b4fef7-8bf7-11e6-9962-42010af00004   10Gi       RWX           1h
pvc-engineering2   Bound     pvc-a9f70544-8bfd-11e6-9962-42010af00004   5Gi        RWX           19m
pvc-engineering3   Bound     pvc-6fa8e73b-8c00-11e6-9962-42010af00004   15Gi       RWX           6s

----
====

Since the _default_ _StorageClass_ is enabled on this system, you would need to
create the PV in the _default_ _StorageClass_ for the manually created Persistent
Volume to get bound to the above claim and not have a new dynamic provisioned
volume bound to the claim.

To fix this, the `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin` user simply needs to create
another GCE disk or delete the first manual PV and use a PV object definition 
that assigns a _StorageClass_ name (`pv-manual-gce2.yaml`)
if necessary:

.Manual PV Spec with _default_ StorageClass name
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
 name: pv-manual-gce2
spec:
 capacity:
   storage: 35Gi
 accessModes:

 gcePersistentDisk:
   readOnly: false
   pdName: the-newly-created-gce-PD
   fsType: ext4
 storageClassName: generic <1>
----
<1> The name for previously created _generic_ _StorageClass_.
====

Execute the object definition file:

====
----
# oc create -f pv-manual-gce2.yaml
----
====

List the PVs:

====
----

# oc get pv

pv-manual-gce                              35Gi       RWX           Retain          Available                                       4s <1>

----
<1> The original manual PV, still unbound and Available. This is because it was not created in the _default_ _StorageClass_.
<2> The second PVC (other than the name) is bound to the Available manually created PV `pv-manual-gce2`.
====


[IMPORTANT]
====
Notice that all dynamically provisioned volumes by default have a _RECLAIMPOLICY_ of _Delete_. Once the PVC dynamically bound to the PV is deleted, the GCE volume is deleted and all data is lost. However, the manually created PV has a default _RECLAIMPOLICY_ of _Retain_.
====
