== Overview

This topic provides an end-to-end example of using an existing Ceph cluster as
an {product-title} persistent store. It is assumed that a working Ceph cluster
is already set up. If not, consult the
link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-ceph-storage[Overview of Red Hat
Ceph Storage].

xref:../persistent_storage/persistent_storage_ceph_rbd.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-ceph-rbd[Persistent Storage
Using Ceph Rados Block Device] provides an explanation of persistent volumes
(PVs), persistent volume claims (PVCs), and using Ceph RBD as persistent
storage.

[NOTE]
====
All `oc ...` commands are executed on the {product-title} master host.
====

[[using-ceph-rbd-installing-the-ceph-common-package]]
== Installing the ceph-common Package
The *ceph-common* library must be installed on *all schedulable* {product-title} nodes:

[NOTE]
====
The {product-title} all-in-one host is not often used to run pod workloads and,
thus, is not included as a schedulable node.
====

----
# yum install -y ceph-common

[[using-ceph-rbd-creating-the-ceph-secret]]
== Creating the Ceph Secret

The `ceph auth get-key` command is run on a Ceph *MON* node to display the key
value for the *client.admin* user:

.Ceph Secret Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ceph-secret
data:
  key: QVFBOFF2SlZheUJQRVJBQWgvS2cwT1laQUhPQno3akZwekxxdGc9PQ== <1>
type: kubernetes.io/rbd <2>

----
<1> This base64 key is generated on one of the Ceph MON nodes using the `ceph auth get-key client.admin | base64` command, then copying the output and pasting it as the secret key's value.
<2> This value is required for Ceph RBD to work with dynamic provisioning.
====

Save the secret definition to a file, for example *_ceph-secret.yaml_*,
then create the secret:

====
----
$ oc create -f ceph-secret.yaml
secret "ceph-secret" created
----
====

Verify that the secret was created:

====
----
# oc get secret ceph-secret
NAME          TYPE               DATA      AGE
ceph-secret   kubernetes.io/rbd  1         23d
----
====

[[using-ceph-rbd-creating-the-persistent-volume]]
== Creating the Persistent Volume

Next, before creating the PV object in {product-title}, define the persistent
volume file:

.Persistent Volume Object Definition Using Ceph RBD
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: ceph-pv     <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 2Gi    <2>
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce <3>
  rbd:              <4>
    monitors:       <5>
      - 192.168.122.133:6789
    pool: rbd
    image: ceph-image
    user: admin
    secretRef:
      name: ceph-secret <6>
    fsType: ext4        <7>
    readOnly: false
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
----
<1> The name of the PV, which is referenced in pod definitions or displayed in
various `oc` volume commands.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> `*accessModes*` are used as labels to match a PV and a PVC. They currently
do not define any form of access control. All block storage is defined to be
single user (non-shared storage).
<4> This defines the volume type being used. In this case, the *rbd* plug-in is
defined.
<5> This is an array of Ceph monitor IP addresses and ports.
<6> This is the Ceph secret, defined above. It is used to create a secure
connection from {product-title} to the Ceph server.
<7> This is the file system type mounted on the Ceph RBD block device.
====

Save the PV definition to a file, for example *_ceph-pv.yaml_*,
and create the persistent volume:

====
----
# oc create -f ceph-pv.yaml
persistentvolume "ceph-pv" created
----
====

Verify that the persistent volume was created:

====
----
# oc get pv
NAME                     LABELS    CAPACITY     ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
ceph-pv                  <none>    2147483648   RWO           Available                       2s
----
====

[[using-ceph-rbd-creating-the-persistent-volume-claim]]
== Creating the Persistent Volume Claim
A persistent volume claim (PVC) specifies the desired access mode and storage
capacity. Currently, based on only these two attributes, a PVC is bound to a
single PV. Once a PV is bound to a PVC, that PV is essentially tied to the PVC's
project and cannot be bound to by another PVC. There is a one-to-one mapping of
PVs and PVCs. However, multiple pods in the same project can use the same PVC.

.PVC Object Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ceph-claim
spec:
  accessModes:     <1>
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi <2>

----
<1> As mentioned above for PVs, the `*accessModes*` do not enforce access right,
but rather act as labels to match a PV to a PVC.
<2> This claim will look for PVs offering *2Gi* or greater capacity.
====

Save the PVC definition to a file, for example *_ceph-claim.yaml_*,
and create the PVC:

====
----
# oc create -f ceph-claim.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim "ceph-claim" created

#and verify the PVC was created and bound to the expected PV:
# oc get pvc
NAME         LABELS    STATUS    VOLUME    CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
ceph-claim   <none>    Bound     ceph-pv   1Gi        RWX           21s
                                 <1>
----
<1> the claim was bound to the *ceph-pv* PV.
====

[[using-ceph-rbd-creating-the-pod]]
== Creating the Pod
A pod definition file or a template file can be used to define a pod. Below is a
pod specification that creates a single container and mounts the Ceph RBD volume
for read-write access:

.Pod Object Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ceph-pod1           <1>
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ceph-busybox
    image: busybox          <2>
    command: ["sleep", "60000"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: ceph-vol1       <3>
      mountPath: /usr/share/busybox <4>
      readOnly: false
  volumes:
  - name: ceph-vol1         <3>
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: ceph-claim <5>
----
<1> The name of this pod as displayed by `oc get pod`.
<2> The image run by this pod. In this case, we are telling *busybox* to sleep.
<3> The name of the volume. This name must be the same in both the `*containers*` and `*volumes*` sections.
<4> The mount path as seen in the container.
<5> The PVC that is bound to the Ceph RBD cluster.
====

Save the pod definition to a file, for example *_ceph-pod1.yaml_*,
and create the pod:

====
----
# oc create -f ceph-pod1.yaml
pod "ceph-pod1" created

#verify pod was created
# oc get pod
NAME        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ceph-pod1   1/1       Running   0          2m
                      <1>
----
<1> After a minute or so, the pod will be in the *Running* state.
====

[[using-ceph-rbd-defining-group-and-owner-ids-optional]]
== Defining Group and Owner IDs (Optional)
When using block storage, such as Ceph RBD, the physical block storage is
*managed* by the pod. The group ID defined in the pod becomes the group ID of
*both* the Ceph RBD mount inside the container, and the group ID of the actual
storage itself. Thus, it is usually unnecessary to define a group ID in the pod
specifiation. However, if a group ID is desired, it can be defined using
`*fsGroup*`, as shown in the following pod definition fragment:

.Group ID Pod Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  containers:
    - name:
    ...
  securityContext: <1>
    fsGroup: 7777  <2>
...
----
<1> `securityContext` must be defined at the pod level, not under a specific container.
<2> All containers in the pod will have the same `*fsGroup*` ID.
====

[[using-ceph-rbd-setting-default-secret]]
== Setting ceph-user-secret as Default for Projects

If you would like to make the persistent storage available to every project you have to modify the default project template.
You can read more on modifying the default project template. Read more on xref:../../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#selfprovisioning-projects[modifying the default project template].
Adding this to your default project template allows every user who has access to create a project access to the Ceph cluster.
