== Overview

This topic provides a complete example of using an existing Ceph cluster for
{product-title} persistent storage. It is assumed that a working Ceph cluster is
already set up. If not, consult the
link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-ceph-storage[Overview of Red Hat
Ceph Storage].

xref:../persistent_storage/persistent_storage_ceph_rbd.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-ceph-rbd[Persistent Storage
Using Ceph Rados Block Device] provides an explanation of persistent volumes
(PVs), persistent volume claims (PVCs), and using Ceph RBD as persistent
storage.

[NOTE]
====
* Run all `oc` commands on the {product-title} master host.
* The {product-title} all-in-one host is not often used to run pod workloads and,
thus, is not included as a schedulable node.

== Using an existing Ceph cluster for persistent storage

To use an existing Ceph cluster for persistent storage:

. Install the latest ceph-common package:
+
[source, bash]
----
yum install -y ceph-common
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The *ceph-common* library must be installed on *all schedulable* {product-title}
nodes.
====

.  Create the keyring for the client:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ ceph auth get-or-create client.openshift-test mon 'allow *' osd 'allow rwx pool=openshift' -o /etc/ceph/ceph.client.openshift-test-keyring
----

. Convert the keyring to base64:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ /etc/ceph/ceph.client.openshift-test-keyring
[client.openshift-test]
	key = AQBO2xdbq3iTDhAAWCo8loVA5RitlF4Sde5uYQ==
$ echo -n AQBO2xdbq3iTDhAAWCo8loVA5RitlF4Sde5uYQ== |base64
QVFCTzJ4ZGJxM2lURGhBQVdDbzhsb1ZBNVJpdGxGNFNkZTV1WVE9PQ==
----

. Edit the *_ceph-secret.yaml_* file to include the base64-decoded keyring:
+
.Ceph secret definition example

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ceph-secret-test
data:
  key: QVFCTzJ4ZGJxM2lURGhBQVdDbzhsb1ZBNVJpdGxGNFNkZTV1WVE9PQo= <1>
----
<1> This base64 key is generated on one of the Ceph MON nodes using the `ceph
auth get-key client.admin | base64` command, then copying the output and pasting
it as the secret keyâ€™s value.

. Create the secret:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc create -f ceph-secret.yaml 
secret "ceph-secret-test" created
----

. Verify that the secret was created:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc get secret

    readOnly: false
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
----
<1> The name of the PV, which is referenced in pod definitions or displayed in
various `oc` volume commands.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> The `*accessModes*` are used as labels to match a PV and a PVC. They currently
do not define any form of access control. All block storage is defined to be
single user (non-shared storage).
<4> This defines the volume type being used. In this case, the *rbd* plug-in is
defined.
<5> This is an array of Ceph monitor IP addresses and ports.
<6> The `ceph-image` must be created on the Ceph cluster.
<7> Enter the Ceph secret that you created. It is used to create a secure
connection from {product-title} to the Ceph server.
<8> This is the type of file system that is mounted on the Ceph RBD block device.

. Create the PV:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc create -f ceph-pv-test.yaml
persistentvolume "ceph-pv-test" created
----

. Verify that the PV was created:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc get pv
NAME                     LABELS    CAPACITY     ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE

----

. Create the PVC object definition:
+

kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ceph-claim-test
spec:
  accessModes: <1>

----
<1> The `accessModes` do not enforce access rights but instead act as labels to match a PV to a PVC.
<2> This claim looks for PVs that offer 2Gi or greater capacity.

. Create the PVC:
+
[source, bash]
----
$  oc create -f ceph-claim-test.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim "ceph-claim-test" created
----

. Verify that the PVC was created and bound to the expected PV:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc get pvc

. Create the pod object definition:
+
.Pod object definition example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ceph-pod1           <1>

    image: busybox          <2>
    command: ["sleep", "60000"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: ceph-vol1       <3>
      mountPath: /usr/share/busybox <4>
      readOnly: false
  volumes:
  - name: ceph-vol1         <3>
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: ceph-claim <5>
----
<1> The name of this pod as displayed by `oc get pod`.
<2> The image run by this pod. In this example, `busybox` is set to `sleep`.
<3> The name of the volume. This name must be the same in both the `*containers*` and `*volumes*` sections.
<4> The mount path as seen in the container.
<5> The PVC bound to the Ceph RBD cluster.

. Create the pod:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc create -f ceph-pod-test.yaml
pod "ceph-pod-test" created
----

. Verify that the pod was created:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc get pod
NAME        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ceph-pod1   1/1       Running   0          2m
----

After a minute or so, the pod status changes to *Running*.

[[using-ceph-rbd-defining-group-and-owner-ids-optional]]
== Defining group and owner IDs (Optional)
When using block storage, such as Ceph RBD, the physical block storage is
*managed* by the pod. The group ID defined in the pod becomes the group ID of
*both* the Ceph RBD mount inside the container, and the group ID of the actual
storage itself. Thus, it is usually unnecessary to define a group ID in the pod
specifiation. However, if a group ID is desired, it can be defined using
`*fsGroup*`, as shown in the following pod definition fragment:

.Group ID pod definition example
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  containers:
    - name:
    ...
  securityContext: <1>
    fsGroup: 7777  <2>
...
----
<1> `*securityContext*` must be defined at the pod level, not under a specific container.
<2> All containers in the pod will have the same `*fsGroup*` ID.

[[using-ceph-rbd-setting-default-secret]]
== Setting ceph-user-secret as the default for projects

To make the persistent storage available to every project, you need to modify
the default project template. Adding this to your default project template
allows every user who has access to create a project access to the Ceph cluster.
See
xref:../../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#selfprovisioning-projects[modifying
the default project template] for more information.
