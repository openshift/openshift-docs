== Overview

In this example, a legacy data volume exists and a `cluster-admin` or
`storage-admin` needs to make it available for consumption in a particular
project. Using _StorageClasses_ decreases the likelihood of other users and
projects gaining access to this volume from a claim because the claim would have
to have an exact matching value for the _StorageClass_ name. This example
also disables dynamic provisioning. This example assumes:

- Some familiarity with {product-title}, GCE, and Persistent Disks
- {product-title} is xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_gce.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-gce[properly configured to use GCE].

=== Scenario 1: Link StorageClass to existing Persistent Volume with Legacy Data

As a `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin`, define and create the _StorageClass_ for historical financial data.

.StorageClass finance-history Object Definitions
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: finance-history <1>
provisioner: no-provisioning <2>
parameters: <3>

----
<1>  Name of the StorageClass.
<2>  This is a required field, but since there is to be no dynamic provisioning, a value must be put here as long as it is not an actual provisioner plug-in type.
<3>  Parameters can simply be left blank, since these are only used for the dynamic provisioner.
==== 

Save the definitions to a YAML file (`finance-history-storageclass.yaml`) and create the _StorageClass_.

====
----

# oc create -f finance-history-storageclass.yaml 
storageclass "finance-history" created


# oc get storageclass
NAME              TYPE
finance-history   no-provisioning           
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
`cluster-admin` or `storage-admin` users are responsible for relaying the correct _StorageClass_ name to the correct users, groups, and projects.
====

The _StorageClass_ exists. A `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin` can create the
Persistent Volume (PV) for use with the _StorageClass_. Create a manually
provisioned disk using link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/[GCE]
(not dynamically provisioned) and a xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_gce.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-gce[Persistent Volume] that connects to the new GCE disk (`gce-pv.yaml`).

.Finance History PV Object
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
 name: pv-finance-history
spec:
 capacity:
   storage: 35Gi
 accessModes:
   - ReadWriteMany
 gcePersistentDisk:
   readOnly: false
   pdName: the-existing-PD-volume-name-that-contains-the-valuable-data <2>
   fsType: ext4
 storageClassName: finance-history <1>
----
<1>  The _StorageClass_ name, that must match exactly.
<2>  The name of the GCE disk that already exists and contains the legacy data.
====

As a `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin`, create and view the PV. 

====
----

# oc create -f gce-pv.yaml
persistentvolume "pv-finance-history" created

# oc get pv
NAME                CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS      CLAIM                        REASON    AGE
pv-finance-history   35Gi       RWX           Retain          Available                                          2d

----
====

Notice you have a `pv-finance-history` Available and ready for consumption.

As a user, create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) as a YAML file and specify the
correct _StorageClass_ name:

.Claim for finance-history Object Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
 name: pvc-finance-history
spec:
 accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
 resources:
   requests:
     storage: 20Gi
 storageClassName: finance-history <1>
----
<1>  The _StorageClass_ name, that must match exactly or the claim will go unbound until it is deleted or another _StorageClass_ is created that matches the name.
====

Create and view the PVC and PV to see if it is bound.

====
----

# oc create -f pvc-finance-history.yaml 
persistentvolumeclaim "pvc-finance-history" created

# oc get pvc
NAME                  STATUS    VOLUME               CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
pvc-finance-history   Bound     pv-finance-history   35Gi       RWX           9m


# oc get pv  (cluster/storage-admin)
NAME                 CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS      CLAIM                         REASON    AGE
pv-finance-history   35Gi       RWX           Retain          Bound       default/pvc-finance-history             5m

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can use _StorageClasses_ in the same cluster for both legacy data (no
dynamic provisioning) and with xref:../../install_config/storage_examples/storage_classes_dynamic_provisioning.adoc#install-config-storage-examples-storage-classes-dynamic-provisioning[dynamic provisioning].
