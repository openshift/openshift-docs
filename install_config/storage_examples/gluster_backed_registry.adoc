== Overview

This topic reviews how to attach a GlusterFS volume to an integrated OpenShift
Container Registry. This can be done with any of {gluster-native},
{gluster-external}, or standalone {gluster}. It is assumed that the registry
has already been started and a volume has been created.

[[gluster-backed-registry-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

* An existing xref:../registry/deploy_registry_existing_clusters.adoc#deploy-registry[registry]
deployed *without* configuring storage.
* An existing GlusterFS volume
* *glusterfs-fuse* installed on all schedulable nodes.
* A user with the
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#managing-role-bindings[*cluster-admin*] role binding.
** For this guide, that user is *admin*.

[NOTE]
====
All `oc` commands are executed on the master node as the *admin* user.

[[attach-pvc]]
== Attach the PersistentVolumeClaim to the Registry

Before moving forward, ensure that the *docker-registry* service is running.

----
$ oc get svc
NAME              CLUSTER_IP       EXTERNAL_IP   PORT(S)                 SELECTOR                  AGE
docker-registry   172.30.167.194   <none>        5000/TCP                docker-registry=default   18m
----

[NOTE]
====
If either the *docker-registry* service or its associated pod is not running,
refer back to the
xref:../registry/deploy_registry_existing_clusters.adoc#redeploy-registry[*registry*] setup
instructions for troubleshooting before continuing.
====

Then, attach the PVC:

----
$ oc volume deploymentconfigs/docker-registry --add --name=registry-storage -t pvc \
     --claim-name=gluster-claim --overwrite
----

xref:../registry/index.adoc#install-config-registry-overview[Setting up the Registry] provides more
information on using an OpenShift Container Registry.
