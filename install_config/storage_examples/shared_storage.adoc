== Overview
The following use case describes how a cluster administrator wanting to leverage
shared storage for use by two separate containers would configure the solution.
This example highlights the use of NFS, but can easily be adapted to other
shared storage types, such as GlusterFS. In addition, this example will show
configuration of pod security as it relates to shared storage.

xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-nfs[Persistent
Storage Using NFS] provides an explanation of persistent volumes (PVs),
persistent volume claims (PVCs), and using NFS as persistent storage. This topic
shows and end-to-end example of using an existing NFS cluster and
{product-title} persistent store, and assumes an existing NFS server and exports
exist in your {product-title} infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
All `oc` commands are executed on the {product-title} master host.

[[sharing-an-nfs-pv-across-two-pods-creating-the-persistent-volume]]
== Creating the Persistent Volume
Before creating the PV object in {product-title}, the persistent volume (PV) file is defined:

.Persistent Volume Object Definition Using NFS
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: nfs-pv <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi <2>
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany <3>
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain <4>
  nfs: <5>
    path: /opt/nfs <6>
    server: nfs.f22 <7>
    readOnly: false
----
<1> The name of the PV, which is referenced in pod definitions or displayed in
various `oc` volume commands.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> `*accessModes*` are used as labels to match a PV and a PVC. They currently
do not define any form of access control.
<4> A volume reclaim policy of *retain* indicates to preserve the volume after the pods.
<5> This defines the volume type being used, in this case the *NFS* plug-in.
<6> This is the NFS mount path.
<7> This is the NFS server. This can also be specified by IP address.
====

Save the PV definition to a file, for example *_nfs-pv.yaml_*, and create the
persistent volume:

====
----
# oc create -f nfs-pv.yaml
persistentvolume "nfs-pv" created
----
====

Verify that the persistent volume was created:

====
----
# oc get pv
NAME         LABELS    CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
nfs-pv       <none>    1Gi        RWX           Available                       37s
----
====

[[sharing-an-nfs-pv-across-two-pods-creating-the-persistent-volume-claim]]
== Creating the Persistent Volume Claim
A persistent volume claim (PVC) specifies the desired access mode and storage
capacity. Currently, based on only these two attributes, a PVC is bound to a
single PV. Once a PV is bound to a PVC, that PV is essentially tied to the PVC's
project and cannot be bound to by another PVC. There is a one-to-one mapping of
PVs and PVCs. However, multiple pods in the same project can use the same PVC.
This is the use case we are highlighting in this example.

.PVC Object Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: nfs-pvc  <1>
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany      <2>
  resources:
     requests:
       storage: 1Gi    <3>
----
<1> The claim name is referenced by the pod under its `*volumes*` section.
<2> As mentioned above for PVs, the `*accessModes*` do not enforce access right,
but rather act as labels to match a PV to a PVC.
<3> This claim will look for PVs offering *1Gi* or greater capacity.
====

Save the PVC definition to a file, for example *_nfs-pvc.yaml_*, and create the
PVC:

====
----
# oc create -f nfs-pvc.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim "nfs-pvc" created
----
====

Verify that the PVC was created and bound to the expected PV:

====
----
# oc get pvc
NAME            LABELS    STATUS    VOLUME       CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
nfs-pvc         <none>    Bound     nfs-pv       1Gi        RWX           24s
                                    <1>
----
<1> The claim, *nfs-pvc*, was bound to the *nfs-pv* PV.
====

[[sharing-an-nfs-pv-across-two-pods-ensuring-nfs-volume-access]]
== Ensuring NFS Volume Access
Access is necessary to a node in the NFS server. On this node, examine the NFS
export mount:

====
----
[root@nfs nfs]# ls -lZ /opt/nfs/
total 8
-rw-r--r--. 1 root 100003  system_u:object_r:usr_t:s0     10 Oct 12 23:27 test2b
              <1>
                     <2>
----
<1> the owner has ID 0.
<2> the group has ID 100003.
====

In order to access the NFS mount, the container must match the SELinux label,
and either run with a UID of 0, or with 100003 in its supplemental groups range.
Gain access to the volume by matching the NFS mount's groups, which will be
defined in the pod definition below.

By default, SELinux does not allow writing from a pod to a remote NFS server. To
enable writing to NFS volumes with SELinux enforcing on each node, run:

====
----
# setsebool -P virt_sandbox_use_nfs on
# setsebool -P virt_use_nfs on
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The `virt_sandbox_use_nfs` boolean is defined by the *docker-selinux* package.
If you get an error saying it is not defined, ensure that this package is installed.
====

[[sharing-an-nfs-pv-across-two-pods-creating-the-pod]]
== Creating the Pod
A pod definition file or a template file can be used to define a pod. Below is a
pod specification that creates a single container and mounts the NFS volume for
read-write access:

.Pod Object Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-nfs-pod <1>
  labels:
    name: nginx-nfs-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-nfs-pod
      image: fedora/nginx <2>
      ports:
        - name: web
          containerPort: 80
      volumeMounts:
        - name: nfsvol <3>
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html <4>
  securityContext:
      supplementalGroups: [100003] <5>
      privileged: false
  volumes:
    - name: nfsvol
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: nfs-pvc <6>
----
<1> The name of this pod as displayed by `oc get pod`.
<2> The image run by this pod.
<3> The name of the volume. This name must be the same in both the `*containers*` and `*volumes*` sections.
<4> The mount path as seen in the container.
<5> The group ID to be assigned to the container.
<6> The PVC that was created in the previous step.
====

Save the pod definition to a file, for example *_nfs.yaml_*, and create the pod:

====
----
# oc create -f nfs.yaml
pod "nginx-nfs-pod" created
----
====

Verify that the pod was created:

====
----
# oc get pods
NAME                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

attached to the same NFS mount on the back end.
