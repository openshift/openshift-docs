== Overview


This topic provides an end-to-end example of how to use an existing Gluster
cluster as an {product-title} persistent store. It is assumed that a working
Gluster cluster is already set up. If not, consult the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Storage/3.1/html/Administration_Guide/index.html[Red
Hat Gluster Storage Administration Guide].

xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_glusterfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-glusterfs[Persistent
Storage Using GlusterFS] provides an explanation of persistent volumes (PVs),
persistent volume claims (PVCs), and using GlusterFS as persistent storage.

For an end-to-end example of how to dynamically provision GlusterFS volumes, see
xref:../../install_config/storage_examples/gluster_dynamic_example.adoc#install-config-storage-examples-gluster-dynamic-example[Complete
Example of Dynamic Provisioning Using GlusterFS]. The persistent volume (PV) and
endpoints are both created dynamically by GlusterFS.

[NOTE]
====
All `oc ...` commands are executed on the {product-title} master host.
====

[[complete-example-using-gusterfs-installing-the-glusterfs-fuse-package]]
== Installing the glusterfs-fuse Package
The *glusterfs-fuse* library must be installed on all *schedulable* {product-title} nodes:

====
----
# yum install -y glusterfs-fuse
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The {product-title} all-in-one host is often not used to run pod workloads and, thus, is not included as a schedulable node.
====

[[complete-example-using-gusterfs-creating-the-gluster-endpoints]]
== Creating the Gluster Endpoints and Gluster Service for Persistence

The named endpoints define each node in the Gluster-trusted storage pool:


.GlusterFS Endpoint Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  name: gluster-cluster <1>
subsets:
- addresses:              <2>
  - ip: 192.168.122.21
  ports:                  <3>
  - port: 1
    protocol: TCP
- addresses:
  - ip: 192.168.122.22
  ports:
  - port: 1
    protocol: TCP

----
<1> The endpoints name. If using a service, then the endpoints name must match the
service name.
<2> An array of IP addresses for each node in the Gluster pool. Currently, host
names are not supported.
<3> The port numbers are ignored, but must be legal port numbers. The value *1*
is commonly used.
====

Save the endpoints definition to a file, for example *_gluster-endpoints.yaml_*,
then create the endpoints object:

====
----
# oc create -f gluster-endpoints.yaml
endpoints "gluster-cluster" created
----
====

Verify that the endpoints were created:

====
----
# oc get endpoints gluster-cluster
NAME                ENDPOINTS                           AGE
gluster-cluster     192.168.122.21:1,192.168.122.22:1   1m
----
====

[NOTE]
====
To persist the Gluster endpoints, you also need to create a service.
====

[NOTE]
====
Endpoints are name-spaced. Each project accessing the Gluster volume needs its own endpoints.
====

.GlusterFS Service Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: gluster-cluster <1>
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 1 <2>

----
<1> The name of the service. If using a service, then the endpoints name must match
the service name.
<2> The port should match the same port used in the endpoints.
====

Save the service definition to a file, for example *_gluster-service.yaml_*,
then create the endpoints object:

====
----
# oc create -f gluster-service.yaml
endpoints "gluster-cluster" created
----
====

Verify that the service was created:

====
----
# oc get service gluster-cluster
NAME                CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
gluster-cluster     10.0.0.130   <none>        1/TCP     9s

----
====

[[complete-example-using-gusterfs-creating-the-persistent-volume]]
== Creating the Persistent Volume
Next, before creating the PV object, define the persistent volume in
{product-title}:

.Persistent Volume Object Definition Using GlusterFS
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: gluster-pv   <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi     <2>
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany    <3>
  glusterfs:         <4>
    endpoints: gluster-cluster <5>
    path: /HadoopVol <6>
    readOnly: false
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain <7>
----
<1> The name of the PV, which is referenced in pod definitions or displayed in
various `oc` volume commands.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> `*accessModes*` are used as labels to match a PV and a PVC. They currently
do not define any form of access control.
<4> This defines the volume type being used. In this case, the *glusterfs*
plug-in is defined.
<5> This references the endpoints named above.
<6> This is the Gluster volume name, preceded by `/`.
<7> A volume reclaim policy of *retain* indicates that the volume will be preserved
after the pods accessing it terminate. Accepted values include Retain, Delete,
and Recycle.
====

Save the PV definition to a file, for example *_gluster-pv.yaml_*,
and create the persistent volume:

====
----
# oc create -f gluster-pv.yaml
persistentvolume "gluster-pv" created
----
====

Verify that the persistent volume was created:

====
----
# oc get pv
NAME         LABELS    CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
gluster-pv   <none>    1Gi        RWX           Available                       37s
----
====

[[complete-example-using-gusterfs-creating-the-persistent-volume-claim]]
== Creating the Persistent Volume Claim
A persistent volume claim (PVC) specifies the desired access mode and storage
capacity. Currently, based on only these two attributes, a PVC is bound to a
single PV. Once a PV is bound to a PVC, that PV is essentially tied to the PVC's
project and cannot be bound to by another PVC. There is a one-to-one mapping of
PVs and PVCs. However, multiple pods in the same project can use the same PVC.

.PVC Object Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: gluster-claim  <1>
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany      <2>
  resources:
     requests:
       storage: 1Gi    <3>
----
<1> The claim name is referenced by the pod under its `*volumes*` section.
<2> As mentioned above for PVs, the `*accessModes*` do not enforce access rights,
but rather act as labels to match a PV to a PVC.
<3> This claim will look for PVs offering *1Gi* or greater capacity.
====

Save the PVC definition to a file, for example *_gluster-claim.yaml_*,
and create the PVC:

====
----
# oc create -f gluster-claim.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim "gluster-claim" created
----
====

Verify the PVC was created and bound to the expected PV:

====
----
# oc get pvc
NAME            LABELS    STATUS    VOLUME       CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
gluster-claim   <none>    Bound     gluster-pv   1Gi        RWX           24s
                                    <1>
----
<1> The claim was bound to the *gluster-pv* PV.
====

[[complete-example-using-gusterfs-defining-glusterfs-volume-access]]
== Defining GlusterFS Volume Access
Access is necessary to a node in the Gluster-trusted storage pool. On this node,
examine the *glusterfs-fuse* mount:

====
----
# ls -lZ /mnt/glusterfs/
drwxrwx---. yarn hadoop system_u:object_r:fusefs_t:s0    HadoopVol

# id yarn
uid=592(yarn) gid=590(hadoop) groups=590(hadoop)
    <1>
                  <2>
----
<1> The owner has ID 592.
<2> The group has ID 590.
====

In order to access the *HadoopVol* volume, the container must match the SELinux
label, and either run with a UID of 592, or with 590 in its supplemental groups.
It is recommended to gain access to the volume by matching the Gluster mount's
groups, which is defined in the pod definition below.

By default, SELinux does not allow writing from a pod to a remote Gluster
server. To enable writing to GlusterFS volumes with SELinux enforcing on each
node, run:

====
----
# setsebool -P virt_sandbox_use_fusefs on
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The `virt_sandbox_use_fusefs` boolean is defined by the *docker-selinux*
package. If you get an error saying it is not defined, ensure that this package
is installed.
====

[[complete-example-using-gusterfs-creating-the-pod]]
== Creating the Pod using NGINX Web Server image
A pod definition file or a template file can be used to define a pod. Below is a
pod specification that creates a single container and mounts the Gluster volume
for read-write access:

[NOTE]
====
The NGINX image may require to run in privileged mode to create the mount and
run properly. An easy way to accomplish this is to simply add your user to the
*privileged* Security Context Constraint (SCC):
----
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged myuser
----

Then, add the *privileged: true* to the containers `*securityContext:*` section
of the YAML file (as seen in the example below).

xref:../../admin_guide/manage_scc.adoc#admin-guide-manage-scc[Managing Security
Context Constraints] provides additional information regarding SCCs.
====

.Pod Object Definition using NGINX image
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gluster-pod1
  labels:
    name: gluster-pod1   <1>
spec:
  containers:
  - name: gluster-pod1
    image: nginx       <2>
    ports:
    - name: web
      containerPort: 80

      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html <4>
      readOnly: false
  securityContext:
    supplementalGroups: [590]       <5>
  volumes:
  - name: gluster-vol1   <3>
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: gluster-claim      <6>
----
<1> The name of this pod as displayed by `oc get pod`.
<2> The image run by this pod. In this case, we are using a standard NGINX image.
<3> The name of the volume. This name must be the same in both the
`*containers*` and `*volumes*` sections.
<4> The mount path as seen in the container.
<5> The `*SupplementalGroup*` ID (Linux Groups) to be assigned at the pod level
and as discussed this should match the POSIX permissions on the Gluster volume.
<6> The PVC that is bound to the Gluster cluster.
====

Save the pod definition to a file, for example *_gluster-pod1.yaml_*,
 and create the pod:

====
----
# oc create -f gluster-pod1.yaml
pod "gluster-pod1" created
----
====

Verify the pod was created:

====
----
# oc get pod
NAME           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
gluster-pod1   1/1       Running   0          31s

                         <1>
----
<1> After a minute or so, the pod will be in the *Running* state.
