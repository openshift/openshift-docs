== Overview

This topic provides an end-to-end example of how to use an existing
{gluster-native}, {gluster-external}, or standalone {gluster} cluster as
persistent storage for {product-title}. It is assumed that a working
{gluster} cluster is already set up.
For help installing {gluster-native} or {gluster-external}, see
xref:../persistent_storage/persistent_storage_glusterfs.adoc[Persistent Storage Using {gluster}].
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
For standalone {gluster}, consult the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Storage/3.3/html/Administration_Guide/index.html[{gluster} Administration Guide].

For an end-to-end example of how to dynamically provision GlusterFS volumes, see
xref:gluster_dynamic_example.adoc[Complete Example Using GlusterFS for Dynamic
Provisioning].
