== Overview

This topic provides an end-to-end example of using an existing Ceph cluster as
an {product-title} dynamic persistent store. It is assumed that a working Ceph
cluster is already set up. If not, consult the
link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-ceph-storage[Overview of Red Hat
Ceph Storage].

xref:../persistent_storage/persistent_storage_ceph_rbd.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-ceph-rbd[Persistent
Storage Using Ceph Rados Block Device] provides an explanation of persistent
volumes (PVs), persistent volume claims (PVCs), and how to use Ceph Rados
Block Device (RBD) as persistent storage.

[NOTE]
====
All `oc ...` commands are executed on the {product-title} master host.
====

[[ceph-rbd-dynamic-example-installing-the-ceph-common-package]]
== Installing the ceph-common Package

The *ceph-common* library must be installed on *all schedulable* {product-title}
nodes:

[NOTE]
====
The {product-title} all-in-one host is not often used to run pod workloads and,
thus, is not included as a schedulable node.
====

----
# yum install -y ceph-common

[[ceph-rbd-dynamic-example-create-pool-for-dynamic-volumes]]
== Create Pool for Dynamic Volumes

It is recommended that you create a pool for your dynamic volumes to live in.

[NOTE]
====
Using the default pool of RBD is an option, but not recommended.
====

From a Ceph administrator or *MON* node, create a new pool for dynamic volumes:

----
$ ceph osd pool create kube 1024
$ ceph auth get-or-create client.kube mon 'allow r' osd 'allow class-read object_prefix rbd_children, allow rwx pool=kube' -o ceph.client.kube.keyring
----

[[ceph-rbd-dynamic-example-creating-the-ceph-secret]]
== Creating the Ceph Secret

. Run the `ceph auth get-key` command on a Ceph *MON* node to display the key
value for the `client.admin` user:

----
<1> This base64 key is generated on one of the Ceph *MON* nodes using the `ceph auth

kind: StorageClass
metadata:

  annotations:

----
<1> Ceph monitors, comma delimited. It is required.
<2> Ceph client ID that is capable of creating images in the pool. Default is `admin`.
<3> Secret Name for `adminId`. It is required. The provided secret must have type `kubernetes.io/rbd`.
<4> The namespace for `adminSecret`. Default is `default`.
<5> Ceph RBD pool. Default is `rbd`, but that value is not recommended.
<6> Ceph client ID that is used to map the Ceph RBD image. Default is the same as `adminId`.
<7> The name of Ceph Secret for `userId` to map Ceph RBD image. It must exist in the
same namespace as PVCs. It is required unless its set as the default in new
projects.

[[ceph-rbd-dynamic-example-creating-the-persistent-volume-claim]]
== Creating the Persistent Volume Claim

A persistent volume claim (PVC) specifies the desired access mode and storage
capacity. Currently, based on only these two attributes, a PVC is bound to a
single PV. Once a PV is bound to a PVC, that PV is essentially tied to the PVC's
project and cannot be bound to by another PVC. There is a one-to-one mapping of
PVs and PVCs. However, multiple pods in the same project can use the same PVC.

.PVC Object Definition
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ceph-claim
spec:
  accessModes:     <1>
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi <2>
----
<1> As mentioned above for PVs, the `accessModes` do not enforce access right, but
rather act as labels to match a PV to a PVC.
<2> This claim will look for PVs offering `2Gi` or greater capacity.


Save the PVC definition to a file, for example *_ceph-claim.yaml_*,
and create the PVC:
--
----
# oc create -f ceph-claim.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim "ceph-claim" created

#and verify the PVC was created and bound to the expected PV:
# oc get pvc
NAME         STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
ceph-claim   Bound     pvc-f548d663-3cac-11e7-9937-0024e8650c7a   2Gi        RWO           1m
----
[NOTE]
====
The claim dynamically created a Ceph RBD PV.

[[ceph-rbd-dynamic-example-creating-the-pod]]
== Creating the Pod

A pod definition file or a template file can be used to define a pod. Below is a
pod specification that creates a single container and mounts the Ceph RBD volume
for read-write access:

.Pod Object Definition
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ceph-pod1           <1>
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ceph-busybox
    image: busybox          <2>
    command: ["sleep", "60000"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: ceph-vol1       <3>
      mountPath: /usr/share/busybox <4>
      readOnly: false
  volumes:
  - name: ceph-vol1         <3>
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: ceph-claim  <5>
----
<1> The name of this pod as displayed by `oc get pod`.
<2> The image run by this pod. In this case, we are telling `busybox` to sleep.
<3> The name of the volume. This name must be the same in both the `containers` and
`volumes` sections.
<4> The mount path as seen in the container.
<5> The PVC that is bound to the Ceph RBD cluster.

. Save the pod definition to a file, for example *_ceph-pod1.yaml_*,
and create the pod:
+
--
----
# oc create -f ceph-pod1.yaml
pod "ceph-pod1" created

#verify pod was created
# oc get pod
NAME        READY     STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
ceph-pod1   1/1       Running  0          2m  <1> 
----
<1> After approximately a minute, the pod will be in the `Running` state.

[[ceph-rbd-dynamic-example-setting-default-secret]]
== Setting ceph-user-secret as Default for Projects

If you want to make the persistent storage available to every project, you must
modify the default project template. Read more on
xref:../../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#selfprovisioning-projects[modifying
the default project template]. Adding this to your default project template
allows every user who has access to create a project access to the Ceph cluster.
