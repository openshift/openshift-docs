== Overview

The
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#kubelet[kubelet]
exposes metrics that can be collected and stored in back-ends by
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/heapster[Heapster].

As an {product-title} administrator, you can view a cluster's metrics from all
containers and components in one user interface.  These metrics are also
used by xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal pod autoscalers]
in order to determine when and how to scale.

This topic describes using
link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics[Hawkular Metrics] as a metrics
engine which stores the data persistently in a
link:http://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra] database. When this is configured,
CPU and memory-based metrics are viewable from the {product-title} web console
and are available for use by xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal
pod autoscalers].

Heapster retrieves a list of all nodes from the master server, then contacts
each node individually through the `/stats` endpoint. From there, Heapster
scrapes the metrics for CPU and memory usage, then exports them into Hawkular
Metrics.

Browsing individual pods in the web console displays separate sparkline charts
for memory and CPU. The time range displayed is selectable, and these charts
automatically update every 30 seconds. If there are multiple containers on the
pod, then you can select a specific container to display its metrics.

If xref:../admin_guide/limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[resource limits] are defined for your
project, then you can also see a donut chart for each pod. The donut chart
displays usage against the resource limit. For example: `145 Available of 200
MiB`, with the donut chart showing `55 MiB Used`.

[[cluster-metrics-before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[WARNING]
====
If your {product-title} installation was originally performed on a version
previous to v1.0.8, even if it has since been updated to a newer version, follow
the instructions for node certificates outlined in Updating
Master and Node Certificates. If the node certificate does not contain the IP
address of the node, then Heapster will fail to retrieve any metrics.
====
endif::[]

The components for cluster metrics must be deployed to the *openshift-infra*
project. This allows xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal pod
autoscalers] to discover the Heapster service and use it to retrieve metrics
that can be used for autoscaling.

All of the following commands in this topic must be executed under the
*openshift-infra* project. To switch to the *openshift-infra* project:

----
$ oc project openshift-infra
----

To enable cluster metrics, you must next configure the following:

- xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-service-accounts[Service Accounts]
- xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-data-storage[Metrics Data Storage]
- xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-deployer[Metrics Deployer]

[[metrics-service-accounts]]
== Service Accounts

You must configure xref:../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service accounts]
for:

* xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-deployer-service-account[Metrics Deployer]
* xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#heapster-service-account[Heapster]

[[metrics-deployer-service-account]]
=== Metrics Deployer Service Account

The xref:metrics-deployer[Metrics Deployer] will be discussed in a later step,
but you must first set up a service account for it:

. Create a *metrics-deployer* service account:
+
----
$ oc create -f - <<API
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: metrics-deployer
secrets:
- name: metrics-deployer
API
----

. Before it can deploy components, the *metrics-deployer* service account must
also be granted the `edit` permission for the *openshift-infra* project:
+
----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user \
    edit system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:metrics-deployer
----

[[heapster-service-account]]
=== Heapster Service Account

The Heapster component requires access to the master server to list all
available nodes and access the `/stats` endpoint for each node. Before it can do
this, the Heapster service account requires the `cluster-reader` permission:

----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user \
    cluster-reader system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:heapster
----

[NOTE]
====
The Heapster service account is created automatically during the
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#deploying-the-metrics-components[Deploying
the Metrics Components] step.
====

[[metrics-data-storage]]
== Metrics Data Storage

You can store the metrics data to either
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent storage] or to
a temporary xref:../dev_guide/volumes.adoc#dev-guide-volumes[pod volume].

[[metrics-persistent-storage]]
=== Persistent Storage

Running {product-title} cluster metrics with persistent storage means that
your metrics will be stored to a
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volumes[persistent
volume] and be able to survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is
ideal if you require your metrics data to be guarded from data loss.  For production environments it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage for your metrics pods.

The size of the persisted volume can be specified with the `CASSANDRA_PV_SIZE`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#deployer-template-parameters[template
parameter]. By default it is set to 10 GB, which may or may not be sufficient
for the size of the cluster you are using. If you require more space, for
instance 100 GB, you could specify it with something like this:

----
$ oc process -f metrics-deployer.yaml -v \
    HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com,CASSANDRA_PV_SIZE=100Gi \
    | oc create -f -
----

The size requirement of the Cassandra storage is dependent on the number of pods.
It is the administrator's responsibility to ensure that the size requirements
are sufficient for their setup and to monitor usage to ensure that the disk does
not become full.

[[capacity-planning-for-openshift-metrics]]

After the metrics deployer runs, oc get pods output should look like this:
====
----
 # oc get pods -n openshift-infra
 NAME                                          READY             STATUS      RESTARTS          AGE
 hawkular-cassandra-1-l5y4g                    1/1               Running     0                 17h
 hawkular-metrics-1t9so                        1/1               Running     0                 17h
 heapster-febru                                1/1               Running     0                 17h
----
====

OpenShift metrics uses the Cassandra database as datastore for metrics.  Currently Cassandra is deployed with `MAX_HEAP_SIZE=512M` and `NEW_HEAP_SIZE=100M`. It is assumed that these values should cover most of OpenShift metrics installations. It is possible to change these values in https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/master/cassandra/Dockerfile[cassandra docker file] prior to deploying OpenShift metrics.

By default, metrics data is stored for 7 days.  This is configurable by specifying the `METRIC_DURATION` parameter in
https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/master/metrics.yaml[metrics.yaml configuration file].
After 7 days, Cassandra will begin to purge older metrics data.  Metrics data for pods and namespaces that have been deleted is not automatically purged.  These metrics will be removed once they've reached 7 days in age.

In a test scenario including 10 nodes and 1,000 pods, 2.5GB of metrics data was accumulated over a 24 hour period.
In a test scenario including 120 nodes and 10,000 pods, 25GB of metrics data was accumulated over a 24 hour period.

Thus a capacity planning formula for OpenShift metrics is:

====
----
(((2.5*10^9)/1000)/24)/10^6 = ~0.125 MB/hour per pod.
----
====

In a test scenario including 120 nodes and 10,000 pods, 25GB of metrics data was accumulated over a 24 hour period.

====
----
(((11.410*10^9)/1000)/24)/10^6 = 0.475 MB/hour
----
====

[width="80%"]
|================================================
| |1000 pods| 10000 pods
| Cassandra load over 24 hours - default metrics parameters   |2.5GB| 11.4GB
|================================================

Graphically these two test cases are presented on graph below

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekuric/openshift/master/metrics/1_10kpods.png[1000 pods vs 10000 pods monitored during 24 h]

If default value of 7 (days) for `METRIC_DURATION` and `METRIC_RESOLUTION` of 10 ( seconds ) are preserved,
then it is expected to  that storage requiremetns for cassandra pod would be

[width="80%"]
|================================================
| |1000 pods | 10000 pods
| cassandra storage over 7 days - default metrics parameters | 20GB | 90GB
|================================================

In the last table, an additional 10% was added to expected storage space as a buffer for unexpected monitored pod usage.

[WARNING]
====
Data loss will result if the Cassandra persisted volume runs out of sufficient space.
====

For cluster metrics to work with persistent storage, ensure that the persistent
volume has the *ReadWriteOnce* access mode. If not, the persistent volume claim
will not be able to find the persistent volume, and Cassandra will fail to
start.

To use persistent storage with the metric components, ensure that a
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volumes[persistent
volume] of sufficient size is available. The creation of
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volume-claims[persistent
volume claims] is handled by the
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-deployer[Metrics Deployer].

{product-title} metrics supports also https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/master/metrics.yaml#L130[dynamically provisioned persistent volumes].  To use this feature with {product-title} metrics, it is necessary to add an additional flag to the metrics-deployer: `DYNAMICALLY_PROVISION_STORAGE=true`.  At this time, EBS, GCE and Cinder storage backends can be used in order to dynamically provision volumes.  For more information about Dynamically Provisioned PVs, refer to https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.html[Dynamically Provisioned PVS].

[[metrics-non-persistent-storage]]
=== Non-Persistent Storage

Running {product-title} cluster metrics with non-persistent storage means that
any stored metrics will be deleted when the pod is deleted. While it is much
easier to run cluster metrics with non-persistent data, running with
non-persistent data does come with the risk of permanent data loss. However,
metrics can still survive a container being restarted.

In order to use non-persistent storage, you must set the
`*USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE*`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#modifying-the-deployer-template[template
option] to `false` for the Metrics Deployer.

Note that when using non-persistent storage, metrics data will be written to `/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes/pods` on the node where the Cassandra pod is running.  Ensure `/var` has enough free space to accomodate metrics storage.

[[metrics-deployer]]
== Metrics Deployer

The Metrics Deployer deploys and configures all of the metrics components. You
can configure it by passing in information from
xref:../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secrets] and by passing
parameters to the Metrics Deployer's
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-templates[template].

[[metrics-deployer-using-secrets]]
=== Using Secrets

By default, the Metrics Deployer auto-generates self-signed certificates for use
between components. Because these are self-signed certificates, they are not
automatically trusted by a web browser. Therefore, it is recommended to use
internal certificates for anything being accessed outside of the {product-title}
cluster, and then use the re-encrypting route to provide your own custom
certificates. This is especially important for the Hawkular Metrics server as it
must be accessible in a browser for the web console to function.

The Metrics Deployer requires that you manually create a *metrics-deployer*
secret whether you are xref:metrics-using-secrets-byo-certs[providing your own
certificates] or xref:metrics-using-secrets-autogenerated[using generated
self-signed certificates].

[[metrics-using-secrets-byo-certs]]
==== Providing Your Own Certificates

To provide your own certificates and replace the internally used ones, you can
pass these values as xref:../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secrets]
to the Metrics Deployer.

The preferred metrics deployment method is to pass the metrics secret with no
certificates:

====
----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer nothing=/dev/null
----
====

Then, use the a xref:metrics-reencrypting-route[re-encrypting route] to pass
your custom certificates to Heapster. This allows for greater control in
modifying the certificates in the future.

[NOTE]
====
Using a xref:metrics-reencrypting-route[re-encrypting
route] allows the self-signed certificates to remain in use internally
while allowing your own certificates to be used for externally access. To use a
re-encrypting route, do not set the certificates as a secret, but a secret named
*metrics-deployer* must still exist before the Metrics Deployer can complete.
====

Optionally, provide your own certificate that is configured to be trusted by
your browser by pointing your secret to the certificate's *_.pem_* and
certificate authority certificate files:

====
----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer \
    hawkular-metrics.pem=/home/openshift/metrics/hm.pem \
    hawkular-metrics-ca.cert=/home/openshift/metrics/hm-ca.cert
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Setting the value using secrets will replace the internally used certificates.
Therefore, these certificates must be valid for both the externally used host
names as well as the external host name. For `hawkular-metrics`, this means the
certificate must have a value of the literal string `hawkular-metrics` as well
as the value specified in `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*`.

If you are unable to add the internal host name to your certificate, then you
can use the xref:metrics-reencrypting-route[re-encrypting route] method.
====

The following table contains more advanced configuration options, detailing all
the secrets which can be used by the deployer:

[cols="2,4",options="header"]
|===

|Secret Name |Description

|*_hawkular-metrics.pem_*
|The *_pem_* file to use for the Hawkular Metrics certificate. This certificate
must contain the literal string `hawkular-metrics` as a host name as well as the
publicly available host name used by the route. This file is auto-generated if
unspecified.

|*_hawkular-metrics-ca.cert_*
|The certificate for the CA used to sign the *_hawkular-metrics.pem_*. This
option is ignored if the *_hawkular-metrics.pem_* option is not specified.

|*_hawkular-cassandra.pem_*
|The *_.pem_* file to use for the Cassandra certificate. This certificate must
contain the *hawkular-cassandra* host name. This file is auto-generated if
unspecified.

|*_hawkular-cassandra-ca.cert_*
|The certificate for the CA used to sign the *_hawkular-cassandra.pem_*. This
option is ignored if the *_hawkular-cassandra.pem_* option is not specified.

|*_heapster.cert_*
|The certificate for Heapster to use. This is auto-generated if unspecified.

|*_heapster.key_*
|The key to use with the Heapster certificate. This is ignored if
*_heapster.cert_* is not specified

|*_heapster_client_ca.cert_*
|The certificate that generates *_heapster.cert_*. This is required if
*_heapster.cert_* is specified.  Otherwise, the main CA for the {product-title}
installation is used. In order for
xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal pod autoscaling] to function
properly, this should not be overridden.

|*_heapster_allowed_users_*
|A file containing a comma-separated list of CN to accept from certificates
signed with the specified CA. By default, this is set to allow the
{product-title} service proxy to connect.  If you override this, make sure to
add `system:master-proxy` to the list in order to allow
xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal pod autoscaling] to function
properly.

|===

The Heapster component uses the service name DNS registry to connect to Hawkular
Metrics. In the metrics code, the URL used by Heapster to connect to Hawkular
Metrics is hard-coded. It attaches the search domain and resolves to the service
IP.

[[metrics-using-secrets-autogenerated]]
==== Using Generated Self-Signed Certificates

The Metrics Deployer can accept multiple certificates using secrets. If a
certificate is not passed as a secret, then the deployer generates a self-signed
certificate instead, forcing users to accept the certificate as a security
exception.

In order to use official certificates for the web console, you must use a
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metrics-reencrypting-route[re-encrypting route].
This allows the self-signed certificates to remain in use internally,
while allowing your own certificates to be used for external access. When
using a re-encrypting route, do not set the certificates as a secret. A
"dummy" secret named *metrics-deployer* must still exist for the Metrics
Deployer to generate certificates.

To create a "dummy" secret that does not specify a certificate value:

----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer nothing=/dev/null
----

[CAUTION]
====
If you do not use a re-encrypting route when using generated self-signed certificates you will encounter errors.
====

[[modifying-the-deployer-template]]
=== Modifying the Deployer Template

The {product-title}  installer uses a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-templates[template] to deploy the
metrics components. The default template can be found at the following path:

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
/usr/share/openshift/examples/infrastructure-templates/origin/metrics-deployer.yaml
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your installation method, the template may not be present in your
{product-title} installation. If so, the template can be found at the following GitHub
location:

https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/master/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.2/infrastructure-templates/origin/metrics-deployer.yaml
====

endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
/usr/share/openshift/examples/infrastructure-templates/enterprise/metrics-deployer.yaml
----
====
endif::[]

In case you need to make any changes to this file, copy it to another directory
with the file name *_metrics-deployer.yaml_* and refer to the new location when
using it in the following sections.

[[deployer-template-parameters]]
==== Deployer Template Parameters

The deployer template parameter options and their defaults are listed in the
default *_metrics-deployer.yaml_* file. If required, you can override these
values when creating the Metrics Deployer.

.Template Parameters
[options="header"]
|===

|Parameter |Description

|`*METRIC_DURATION*`
|The number of days metrics should be stored.

|`*CASSANDRA_PV_SIZE*`
|The persistent volume size for each of the Cassandra nodes.

|`*USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE*`
|Set to *true* for persistent storage; set to *false* to use non-persistent storage.

|`*REDEPLOY*`
|If set to *true*, the deployer will try to delete all the existing components before trying to redeploy.

|`*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*`
|External host name where clients can reach Hawkular Metrics.  This is the FQDN of the machine running the router pod.

|`*MASTER_URL*`
|Internal URL for the master, for authentication retrieval.

|`*IMAGE_VERSION*`
|Specify version for metrics components. For example, for *openshift/origin-metrics-deployer:latest*, set version to *latest*.

|`*IMAGE_PREFIX*`
|Specify prefix for metrics components. For example, for *openshift/origin-metrics-deployer:latest*, set prefix to *openshift/origin-*.
|===

The only required parameter is `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*`. This value is
required when creating the deployer because it specifies the hostname for the
Hawkular Metrics xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[route]. This
value should correspond to a fully qualified domain name. You will need to know
the value of `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` when
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#configuring-openshift-metrics[configuring
the console] for metrics access.

If you are using
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-persistent-storage[persistent
storage] with Cassandra, it is the administrator's responsibility to set a
sufficient disk size for the cluster using the `*CASSANDRA_PV_SIZE*` parameter.
It is also the administrator's responsibility to monitor disk usage to make sure
that it does not become full.

[WARNING]
====
Data loss will result if the Cassandra persisted volume runs out of sufficient space.
====

All of the other parameters are optional and allow for greater customization.
For instance, if you have a custom install in which the Kubernetes master is not
available under *_https://kubernetes.default.svc:443_* you can specify the value
to use instead with the `*MASTER_URL*` parameter. To deploy a specific version
of the metrics components, use the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` parameter.

[[deploying-the-metrics-components]]
== Deploying the Metric Components

Because deploying and configuring all the metric components is handled by the
Metrics Deployer, you can simply deploy everything in one step.

The following examples show you how to deploy metrics with and without
persistent storage using the default template parameters. Optionally, you can
specify any of the
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#deployer-template-parameters[template
parameters] when calling these commands.

.Deploying with Persistent Storage
====
The following command sets the Hawkular Metrics route to use
*hawkular-metrics.example.com* and is deployed using persistent storage.

You must have a persistent volume of sufficient size available.

----
$ oc new-app -f metrics-deployer.yaml \
    -p HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com
----
====

.Deploying without Persistent Storage
====
The following command sets the Hawkular Metrics route to use
*hawkular-metrics.example.com* and deploy without persistent storage.

----
$ oc new-app -f metrics-deployer.yaml \
    -p HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
    -p USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE=false
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Because this is being deployed without persistent storage, metric data loss
can occur.
====

[[metrics-deployer-validations]]
=== Metrics Deployer Validations

The metrics deployer does some validation both before and after deployment. If
the pre-flight validation fails, the environment for deployment is considered
unsuitable and the deployment is aborted. However, you can add
`*IGNORE_PREFLIGHT=true*` to the deployer parameters if you believe the
validation has erred.

If post-deployment validation fails, the deployer finishes in an *Error* state,
which indicates that you should check the deployer logs for issues that may
require addressing.  For example, the validation may detect that the external
*hawkular-metrics* route is not actually in use, because the route was already
created somewhere else. The validation output at the end of a deployment should
explain as clearly as possible any issues it finds and what you can do to
address them.

Once you have addressed deployment validation issues, you can re-run just the
validation by running the deployer again with the `*MODE=validate*` parameter
added, for example:

----
$ oc new-app -f metrics-deployer.yaml \
    -p HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
    -p MODE=validate
----

[[metrics-reencrypting-route]]
== Using a Re-encrypting Route

[NOTE]
====
The following section is not required if the *hawkular-metrics.pem* secret was
specified as a
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-deployer-using-secrets[deployer
secret].
====

By default, the Hawkular Metrics server uses an internally signed certificate,
which is not trusted by browsers or other external services. To provide your own
trusted certificate to be used for external access, use a route with
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#secured-routes[re-encryption
termination].

Creating this new route requires deleting the default route that just passes
through to an internally signed certificate:

. First, delete the default route that uses the self-signed certificates:
+
----
$ oc delete route hawkular-metrics
----

. Create a new route with
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#secured-routes[re-encryption
termination]
+
====
----
$ oc create route reencrypt hawkular-metrics-reencrypt \
            --hostname hawkular-metrics.example.com \ <1>
            --key /path/to/key \ <2>
            --cert /path/to/cert \ <2>
            --ca-cert /path/to/ca.crt \ <2>
            --service hawkular-metrics
            --dest-ca-cert /path/to/internal-ca.crt <3>
----
<1> The value specified in the `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` template parameter.
<2> These need to define the custom certificate you want to provide.
<3> This needs to correspond to the CA used to sign the internal Hawkular Metrics certificate.
====
+
The CA used to sign the internal Hawkular Metrics certificate can be found from
the *hawkular-metrics-certificate* secret:
+
----
$ base64 -d <<< \
    `oc get -o yaml secrets hawkular-metrics-certificate \
    | grep -i hawkular-metrics-ca.certificate | awk '{print $2}'` \
    > /path/to/internal-ca.crt
----


[[configuring-openshift-metrics]]
== Configuring {product-title}

The {product-title} web console uses the data coming from the Hawkular Metrics
service to display its graphs. The URL for accessing the Hawkular Metrics
service must be configured via the `*metricsPublicURL*` option in the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file] (*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*). This URL
corresponds to the route created with the `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` template
parameter during the
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#deploying-the-metrics-components[deployment]
of the metrics components.

[NOTE]
====
You must be able to resolve the `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` from the browser
accessing the console.
====

For example, if your `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` corresponds to
`hawkular-metrics.example.com`, then you must make the following change in the
*_master-config.yaml_* file:

====
[source,yaml,]
----
  assetConfig:
    ...
    metricsPublicURL: "https://hawkular-metrics.example.com/hawkular/metrics"
----
====

Once you have updated and saved the *_master-config.yaml_* file, you must
restart your {product-title} instance.

When your {product-title} server is back up and running, metrics will be
displayed on the pod overview pages.

[CAUTION]
====
If you are using self-signed certificates, remember that the Hawkular Metrics
service is hosted under a different host name and uses different certificates
than the console. You may need to explicitly open a browser tab to the value
specified in `*metricsPublicURL*` and accept that certificate.

To avoid this issue, use certificates which are configured to be acceptable by
your browser.
====

[[cluster-metrics-accessing-hawkular-metrics-directly]]
== Accessing Hawkular Metrics Directly

To access and manage metrics more directly, use the Hawkular Metrics API.

[NOTE]
====
When accessing Hawkular Metrics via the API, you will only be able to perform
reads. Writing metrics has been disabled by default. If you want for individual
users to also be able to write metrics, you will need to set the
`*USER_WRITE_ACCESS*` deployer template parameter to *true*.

However, it is recommended to use the default configuration and only have
metrics enter the system via Heapster. If write access is enabled, any user
will be able to write metrics to the system, which can affect performance and
cause Cassandra disk usage to unpredictably increase.
====

The link:http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html[Hawkular Metrics
documentation] covers how to use the API, but there are a few differences when
dealing with the version of Hawkular Metrics configured for use on
{product-title}:

[[cluster-metrics-openshift-projects-and-hawkular-tenants]]
=== {product-title} Projects and Hawkular Tenants

Hawkular Metrics is a multi-tenanted application. It is configured so that a
project in {product-title} corresponds to a tenant in Hawkular Metrics.

As such, when accessing metrics for a project named *MyProject* you will need
to set the
link:http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html#_tenant_header[*Hawkular-Tenant*]
header to *MyProject*.

There is also a special tenant named *_system* which contains system level
metrics. This will require either a *cluster-reader* or *cluster-admin* level
privileges to access.

=== Authorization

The Hawkular Metrics service will authenticate the user against {product-title}
to determine if the user has access to the project it is trying to access.

Hawkular Metrics accepts a bearer token from the client and verifies that token
with the {product-title} server using a *SubjectAccessReview*. If the user has
proper read privileges for the project, they are allowed to read the metrics
for that project. For the *_system* tenant, the user requesting to read from
this tenant must have *cluster-reader* permission.

When accessing the Hawkular Metrics API, you will need to pass a bearer token in
the *Authorization* header.

== Accessing Heapster Directly

Heapster has been configured to be only accessible via the
xref:../rest_api/kubernetes_v1.adoc#proxy-get-requests-to-service[API proxy].
Accessing it will required either a cluster-reader or cluster-admin privileges.

For example, to access the Heapster *validate* page, you need to access it
using something similar to:

----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
       -X GET https://${KUBERNETES_MASTER}/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/openshift-infra/services/https:heapster:/validate
----

link:https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/[Heapster] project.

== Scaling OpenShift Metrics Pods

One set of metrics pods (cassandra/hawkular/heapster) is able to monitor at least 10,000 pods.

If there is a need to scale out OpenShift metrics pods, follow the instructions in https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/master/docs/cassandra_scaling.adoc[OpenShift metrics documentation]

If persistent storage was used to deploy OpenShift metrics, it is necessary before scaling out the number of OpenShift metrics cassandra pods to create a PV (Persistent Volume) for the new Cassandra pod to use.  If Cassandra was deployed with dynamically provisioned persistent volumes, this step is not necessary.

Refer to https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html[OpenShift Enterprise documentation - how to create persistant volume] for detailed instructions on how to create persistent volumes.

To scale out the number of OpenShift metrics hawkular pods to two replicas, run the below command:

====
----
# oc scale -n openshift-infra --replicas=2 rc hawkular-metrics
----
====

It is recommended to pay attention to system load on nodes where OpenShift metrics pods runs, and based on that decide if it is necessary to scale out number of OpenShift metrics pods and spread the load across multiple OpenShift nodes.  Scaling OpenShift metrics heapster pods is not recommended.


== HPA - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

OpenShift Enterprise v3.3 does not provide support https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[HPA - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling]
for metrics pods and scaling metrics pods.

[[metrics-cleanup]]
== Cleanup

You can remove everything deloyed by the metrics deployer by performing the
following steps:

----
$ oc delete all --selector="metrics-infra"
$ oc delete sa --selector="metrics-infra"
$ oc delete templates --selector="metrics-infra"
$ oc delete secrets --selector="metrics-infra"
$ oc delete pvc --selector="metrics-infra"
----

To remove the deployer components, perform the following steps:

----
$ oc delete sa metrics-deployer
$ oc delete secret metrics-deployer
----
