== Overview

The
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#kubelet[kubelet]
exposes metrics that can be collected and stored in back-ends by
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/heapster[Heapster].

As an OpenShift administrator, you can view a cluster's metrics from all
containers and components in one user interface.  These metrics are also
used by link:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[horizontal pod autoscalers]
in order to determine when and how to scale.

This topic describes using
link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics[Hawkular Metrics]
as a metrics engine which stores the data persistently in a
link:http://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra] database. When this is
configured, CPU and memory-based metrics are viewable from the OpenShift
web console and are available for use by
link:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[horizontal pod autoscalers].

Heapster retrieves a list of all nodes from the master server, then contacts
each node individually through the `/stats` endpoint. From there, Heapster
scrapes the metrics for CPU and memory usage, then exports them into Hawkular
Metrics.

Browsing individual pods in the web console displays separate sparkline charts
for memory and CPU. The time range displayed is selectable, and these charts
automatically update every 30 seconds. If there are multiple containers on the
pod, then you can select a specific container to display its metrics.

If you have link:../dev_guide/limits.html[resource limits] defined for your
project, then you can also see a donut chart for each pod. The donut chart
displays usage against the resource limit. For example: `145 Available of 200
MiB`, with the donut chart showing `55 MiB Used`.

[[cluster-metrics-before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[WARNING]
====
If your OpenShift installation was originally performed on a version previous to
v1.0.8, even if it has since been updated to a newer version, you will need to
follow the instructions for node certificates outlined in
link:../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.html#manual-updating-master-and-node-certificates[Updating
Master and Node Certificates]. If the node certificate does not contain the IP
address of the node, then Heapster will fail to retrieve any metrics.
====
endif::[]

The components for cluster metrics must be deployed to the *openshift-infra*
project. This allows link:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[horizontal pod
autoscalers] to discover the Heapster service and use it to retrieve metrics
that can be used for autoscaling.

All of the following commands in this topic must be executed under the
*openshift-infra* project. To switch to the *openshift-infra* project:

----
$ oc project openshift-infra
----

To enable cluster metrics, you must next configure the following:

- link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metrics-service-accounts[Service Accounts]
- link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metrics-data-storage[Metrics Data Storage]
- link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metrics-deployer[Metrics Deployer]

[[metrics-service-accounts]]
== Service Accounts

You must configure link:../admin_guide/service_accounts.html[service accounts]
for:

* link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metrics-deployer-service-account[Metrics Deployer]
* link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#heapster-service-account[Heapster]

[[metrics-deployer-service-account]]
=== Metrics Deployer Service Account

The link:#metrics-deployer[Metrics Deployer] will be discussed in a later step,
but you must first set up a service account for it:

. Create a *metrics-deployer* service account:
+
----
$ oc create -f - <<API
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: metrics-deployer
secrets:
- name: metrics-deployer
API
----

. Before it can deploy components, the *metrics-deployer* service account must
also be granted the `edit` permission for the *openshift-infra* project:
+
----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user \
    edit system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:metrics-deployer
----

[[heapster-service-account]]
=== Heapster Service Account

The Heapster component requires access to the master server to list all
available nodes and access the `/stats` endpoint for each node. Before it can do
this, the Heapster service account requires the `cluster-reader` permission:

----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user \
    cluster-reader system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:heapster
----

[NOTE]
====
The Heapster service account is created automatically during the
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#deploying-the-metrics-components[Deploying
the Metrics Components] step.
====

[[metrics-data-storage]]
== Metrics Data Storage

You can store the metrics data to either
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent storage] or to
a temporary link:../dev_guide/volumes.html[pod volume].

[[metrics-persistent-storage]]
=== Persistent Storage

Running OpenShift cluster metrics with persistent storage means that your
metrics will be stored to a
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volumes[persistent
volume] and be able to survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal
if you require your metrics data to be guarded from data loss.

For cluster metrics to work with persistent storage, ensure that the persistent
volume has the *ReadWriteOnce* access mode. If not, the persistent volume claim
will not be able to find the persistent volume, and Cassandra will fail to
start.

To use persistent storage with the metric components, ensure that a
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volumes[persistent
volume] of sufficient size is available. The creation of
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volume-claims[persistent
volume claims] is handled by the
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metrics-deployer[Metrics Deployer].

[[metrics-non-persistent-storage]]
=== Non-Persistent Storage

Running OpenShift cluster metrics with non-persistent storage means that any
stored metrics will be deleted when the pod is deleted. While it is much easier
to run cluster metrics with non-persistent data, running with non-persistent
data does come with the risk of permanent data loss. However, metrics can still
survive a container being restarted.

In order to use non-persistent storage, you must set the
`*USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE*`
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#modifying-the-deployer-template[template
option] to `false` for the Metrics Deployer.

[[metrics-deployer]]
== Metrics Deployer

The Metrics Deployer deploys and configures all of the metrics components. You
can configure it by passing in information from
link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets] and by passing parameters to the Metrics
Deployer's link:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html[template].

[[metrics-deployer-using-secrets]]
=== Using Secrets

By default, the Metrics Deployer auto-generates self-signed certificates for use
between components. Because these are self-signed certificates, they are not
automatically trusted by a web browser. Therefore, it is recommended to use your
own certificates for anything being accessed outside of the OpenShift cluster.
This is especially important for the Hawkular Metrics server as it must be
accessible in a browser for the web console to function.

The Metrics Deployer requires that you manually create a *metrics-deployer*
secret whether you are link:#metrics-using-secrets-byo-certs[providing your own
certificates] or link:#metrics-using-secrets-autogenerated[using generated
self-signed certificates].

[[metrics-using-secrets-byo-certs]]
==== Providing Your Own Certificates

To provide your own certificates and replace the internally used ones, you
can pass these values as link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets] to the
Metrics Deployer.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can use a
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metrics-reencrypting-route[re-encrypting
route] which allow the self-signed certificates to remain in use internally
while allowing your own certificates to be used for externally access. If you
want to use a re-encrypting route, you must not set the certificates as a
secret, but a secret named *metrics-deployer* must still exist before the
Metrics Deployer can complete.
====

Optionally, provide your own certificate that is configured to be trusted by
your browser by pointing your secret to the certificate's *_.pem_* and
certificate authority certificate files:

====
----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer \
    hawkular-metrics.pem=/home/openshift/metrics/hm.pem \
    hawkular-metrics-ca.cert=/home/openshift/metrics/hm-ca.cert
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Setting the value using secrets will replace the internally used certificates.
Therefore, these certificates must be valid for both the externally used host
names as well as the external host name. For `hawkular-metrics`, this means the
certificate must have a value of the literal string `hawkular-metrics` as well
as the value specified in `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*`.

If you are unable to add the internal host name to your certificate, then you
can use the
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metrics-reencrypting-route[re-encrypting
route] method.
====

The following table contains more advanced configuration options, detailing all
the secrets which can be used by the deployer:

[cols="2,4",options="header"]
|===

|Secret Name |Description

|*_hawkular-metrics.pem_*
|The *_pem_* file to use for the Hawkular Metrics certificate. This certificate
must contain the literal string `hawkular-metrics` as a host name as well as the
publicly available host name used by the route. This file is auto-generated if
unspecified.

|*_hawkular-metrics-ca.cert_*
|The certificate for the CA used to sign the *_hawkular-metrics.pem_*. This
option is ignored if the *_hawkular-metrics.pem_* option is not specified.

|*_hawkular-cassandra.pem_*
|The *_.pem_* file to use for the Cassandra certificate. This certificate must
contain the *hawkular-cassandra* host name. This file is auto-generated if
unspecified.

|*_hawkular-cassandra-ca.cert_*
|The certificate for the CA used to sign the *_hawkular-cassandra.pem_*. This
option is ignored if the *_hawkular-cassandra.pem_* option is not specified.

|*_heapster.cert_*
|The certificate for Heapster to use. This is auto-generated if unspecified.

|*_heapster.key_*
|The key to use with the Heapster certificate. This is ignored if
*_heapster.cert_* is not specified

|*_heapster_client_ca.cert_*
|The certificate that generates *_heapster.cert_*. This is required if
*_heapster.cert_* is specified.  Otherwise, the main CA for the OpenShift
installation is used. In order for
link:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[horizontal pod autoscaling] to function
properly, this should not be overridden.

|*_heapster_allowed_users_*
|A file containing a comma-separated list of CN to accept from certificates
signed with the specified CA. By default, this is set to allow the OpenShift
service proxy to connect.  If you override this, make sure to add
`system:master-proxy` to the list in order to allow
link:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[horizontal pod autoscaling] to function
properly.

|===

[[metrics-using-secrets-autogenerated]]
==== Using Generated Self-Signed Certificates

The Metrics Deployer can accept multiple certificates using secrets. If a
certificate is not passed as a secret, the deployer will generate a self-signed
certificate to be used instead. For the deployer to generate certificates for
you, a secret is still required before it can be deployed. In this case, create
a "dummy" secret that does not specify a certificate value:

----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer nothing=/dev/null
----

[[modifying-the-deployer-template]]
=== Modifying the Deployer Template

The OpenShift installer uses a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html[template] to deploy the
metrics components. The default template can be found at the following path:

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
/usr/share/openshift/examples/infrastructure-templates/origin/metrics-deployer.yaml
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your installation method, the template may not be present in your
OpenShift installation. If so, the template can be found at the following GitHub
location:

https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/master/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.1/infrastructure-templates/origin/metrics-deployer.yaml
====

endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
/usr/share/openshift/examples/infrastructure-templates/enterprise/metrics-deployer.yaml
----
====
endif::[]

In case you need to make any changes to this file, copy it to another directory
with the file name *_metrics-deployer.yaml_* and refer to the new location when
using it in the following sections.

[[deployer-template-parameters]]
==== Deployer Template Parameters

The deployer template parameter options and their defaults are listed in the
default *_metrics-deployer.yaml_* file. If required, you can override these
values when creating the Metrics Deployer.

The only required parameter is `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*`. This value is
required when creating the deployer because it specifies the hostname for the
Hawkular Metrics link:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[route]. This
value should correspond to a fully qualified domain name. You will need to know
the value of `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` when
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#configuring-openshift-metrics[configuring
the console] for metrics access.

All of the other parameters are optional and allow for greater customization.
For instance, if you have a custom install in which the Kubernetes master is not
available under `https://kubernetes.default.svc:443` you can specify the value
to use instead with the `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` parameter. If you wish to
deploy a specific version of the metrics components, you can do so with the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` parameter.

[[deploying-the-metrics-components]]
== Deploying the Metric Components

Because deploying and configuring all the metric components is handled by the
Metrics Deployer, you can simply deploy everything in one step.

The following examples show you how to deploy metrics with and without
persistent storage using the default template parameters. Optionally, you can
specify any of the
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#deployer-template-parameters[template
parameters] when calling these commands.

.Deploying with Persistent Storage
====
The following command sets the Hawkular Metrics route to use
`hawkular-metrics.example.com` and is deployed using persistent storage.

You must have a persistent volume of sufficient size available.

----
$ oc process -f metrics-deployer.yaml -v \
    HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
    | oc create -f -
----
====

.Deploying without Persistent Storage
====
The following command sets the Hawkular Metrics route to use
`hawkular-metrics.example.com` and is deployed without persistent storage.
Remember, this is being deployed without persistent storage, so metrics data loss
can occur.

----
$ oc process -f metrics-deployer.yaml -v \
    HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com,USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE=false \
    | oc create -f -
----
====

[[metrics-reencrypting-route]]
== Using a Re-encrypting Route

[NOTE]
====
The following section is not required if the *hawkular-metrics.pem* secret was
specified as a
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metrics-deployer-using-secrets[deployer
secret].
====

By default, the Hawkular Metrics server uses self-signed certificates, which are
not trusted by a browser or other external services. If you want to provide your
own trusted certificate to be used for external access, you can do so using a
route with a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#secured-routes[re-encryption
termination] after deploying the metrics components.

. First, delete the default route that uses the self-signed certificates:
+
----
$ oc delete route hawkular-metrics
----

. Define a new route with a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#secured-routes[re-encryption
termination]:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: hawkular-metrics-reencrypt
spec:
  host: hawkular-metrics.example.com <1>
  port:
    targetPort: 8443
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: hawkular-metrics
  tls:
    termination: reencrypt
    key: |-
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      [...] <2>
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    certificate: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...] <2>
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    caCertificate: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...] <2>
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    destinationCACertificate: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...] <3>
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
<1> The value specified in the *HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME* template parameter.
<2> These need to define the custom certificate you wish to provide.
<3> This needs to correspond to the CA used to sign the internal Hawkular Metrics certificate
====
+
The CA used to sign the internal Hawkular Metrics certificate can be found from
the *hawkular-metrics-certificate* secret:
+
----
$ base64 -d <<< \
    `oc get -o yaml secrets hawkular-metrics-certificate \
    | grep -i hawkular-metrics-ca.certificate | awk '{print $2}'`
----

. Save your route definition to a file, for example *_metrics-reencrypt.yaml_*,
and create it:
+
----
$ oc create -f metrics-reencrypt.yaml
----

[[configuring-openshift-metrics]]
== Configuring OpenShift

The OpenShift web console uses the data coming from the Hawkular Metrics service
to display its graphs. The URL for accessing the Hawkular Metrics service must
be configured via the `*metricsPublicURL*` option in the
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file] (*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*). This URL
corresponds to the route created with the `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` template
parameter during the
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#deploying-the-metrics-components[deployment]
of the metrics components.

[NOTE]
====
You must be able to resolve the `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` from the browser
accessing the console.
====

For example, if your `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` corresponds to
`hawkular-metrics.example.com`, then you must make the following change in the
*_master-config.yaml_* file:

====
[source,yaml,]
----
  assetConfig:
    ...
    metricsPublicURL: "https://hawkular-metrics.example.com/hawkular/metrics"
----
====

Once you have updated and saved the *_master-config.yaml_* file, you must
restart your OpenShift instance.

When your OpenShift server is back up and running, metrics will be displayed on
the pod overview pages.

[CAUTION]
====
If you are using self-signed certificates, remember that the Hawkular Metrics
service is hosted under a different hostname and uses different certificates
than the console. You may need to explicitly open a browser tab to the value
specified in `*metricsPublicURL*` and accept that certificate.

To avoid this issue, use certificates which are configured to be acceptable by
your browser.
====

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
== Accessing Hawkular Metrics Directly

If you wish to access and manage metrics more directly, you can do so via the Hawkular Metrics API.

The link:http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html[Hawkular Metrics documentation] covers
how to use the API, but there are a few differences when dealing with the version of Hawkular Metrics
configured for use on OpenShift:

=== OpenShift Projects & Hawkular Tenants

Hawkular Metrics is a multi-tenanted application. The way its been configured is that a project in
OpenShift corresponds to a tenant in Hawkular Metrics.

As such, when accessing metrics for a project named `MyProject` you will need to set the
link:http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html#_tenant_header[Hawkular-tenant] header to
`MyProject`

There is also a special tenant named `_system` which contains system level metrics. This will require
either a `cluster-reader` or `cluster-admin` level privileges to access.

=== Authorization

The Hawkular Metrics service will authenticate the user against OpenShift to determine if the user has
access to the project it is trying to access.

When accessing the Hawkular Metrics API, you will need to pass a bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

For more information how how to access the Hawkular Metrics in OpenShift, please see the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/master/docs/hawkular_metrics.adoc[Origin Metrics documentation]

== Accessing Heapster Directly

Heapster has been configured to be only accessible via the
link:../rest_api/kubernetes_v1.html#proxy-get-requests-to-service[API proxy]. Accessing it will required
either a cluster-reader or cluster-admin privileges.

For example, to access the Heapster `validate` page, you would need to access it using something similar to:

----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
       -X GET https://${KUBERNETES_MASTER}/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/openshift-infra/services/https:heapster:/validate
----

For more information about Heapster and how to access its APIs, please refer the
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/[Heapster] project.

endif::[]

[[metrics-cleanup]]
== Cleanup
You can remove your metrics deployment by running:
----
$ oc project openshift-infra
$ for i in $(oc get secret | egrep "(hawkular|heapster|metrics)" | awk '{ print $1 }'); do
    oc delete secret $i
  done
$ oc delete rc hawkular-metrics heapster hawkular-cassandra-1
$ oc delete svc hawkular-cassandra hawkular-cassandra-nodes hawkular-metrics heapster
$ oc delete route hawkular-metrics
$ oc delete sa cassandra hawkular heapster metrics-deployer
$ oc delete template hawkular-cassandra-node-emptydir hawkular-cassandra-node-pv \
  hawkular-cassandra-services \
  hawkular-heapster hawkular-metrics \
  hawkular-support
$ oc delete pvc metrics-cassandra-1
----
