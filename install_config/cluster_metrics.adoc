== Overview

The
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#kubelet[kubelet]
exposes metrics that can be collected and stored in back-ends by
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/heapster[Heapster].

As an OpenShift administrator, you can view a cluster's metrics from all
containers and components in one user interface.  These metrics are also
used by link:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[horizontal pod autoscalers]
in order to determine when and how to scale.

This topic describes using
link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics[Hawkular Metrics]
as a metrics engine which stores the data persistently in a
link:http://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra] database. When this is
configured, CPU and memory-based metrics are viewable from the OpenShift
web console and are available for use by
link:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[horizontal pod autoscalers].

Heapster retrieves a list of all nodes from the master server, then contacts
each node individually through the `/stats` endpoint. From there, Heapster
scrapes the metrics for CPU & memory usage and exports them into Hawkular
Metrics.

Browsing individual pods in the web console displays separate sparkline charts
for memory and CPU. The time range displayed is selectable, and these charts
automatically update every 30 seconds. If there are multiple containers on the
pod, then you can select a specific container to display its metrics.

If you have link:../dev_guide/limits.html[resource limits] defined for your
project, then you can also see a donut chart for each pod. The donut chart
displays usage against the resource limit. For example: `145 Available of 200
MiB`, with the donut chart showing `55 MiB Used`.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
For more information about the metrics integration, please refer to the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics[Origin Metrics] GitHub project.

== Before You Begin

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[WARNING]
====
If your OpenShift installation was originally performed on a version previous to
v1.0.8, even if it has since been updated to a newer version, you will need to 
follow these steps outlined in the
link:upgrades.html#updating-node-certificates[update]
document. If the node certificate does not contain the IP address of the node, then Heapster
will fail to retrieve any metrics.
====
endif::[]

The components for cluster metrics must be deployed to the `openshift-infra`
project. This allows link:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[horizontal pod autoscalers]
to discover the heapster service and use it to retrieve metrics that can be used
for autoscaling.

All of the following commands in this topic must be executed under the
`openshift-infra` project. To switch to the `openshift-infra` project:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc project openshift-infra
----

Next: To enable cluster metrics, configure the:

. link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#service-accounts[Service Accounts]
. link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metric-data-storage[Metric Data Storage]
. link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metrics-deployer[Metrics Deployer]

== Service Accounts

You must configure service accounts for:

* link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metrics-deployer-service[Metrics Deployer]
* link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#heapster-service[Heapster]

[[metrics-deployer-service]]

=== Metrics Deployer Service Account

Create a service account for the *metrics deployer*:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc create -f - <<API
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: metrics-deployer
secrets:
- name: metrics-deployer
API
----

Before it can deploy components, the metrics-deployer service account must be granted the `edit` permission for the _openshift-infra_ project:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:metrics-deployer
----

[[heapster-service]]

=== Heapster Service Account

The Heapster component requires access to the master server to list all
available nodes and access the `/stats` endpoint for each node. Before it can do
this, the Heapster service account requires the `cluster-reader` permission:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:heapster
----

== Metric Data Storage

You can store the metrics data to either
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent storage]
or to a temporary
link:../dev_guide/volumes.html[pod volume].

=== Persistent Storage

Running OpenShift cluster metrics with persistent storage means that your
metrics will be stored to a
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volumes[persistent volume]
and be able to survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal if you require your metric data to be guarded from data loss.

To use persistent storage with the metric components, ensure that a
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volumes[persistent volume]
of sufficient size is available. The creation of
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volume-claims[persistent volume claims]
is handled by the
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#metrics-deployer[*metrics deployer*].

=== Non-Persistent Storage

Running OpenShift cluster metrics with non-persistent storage means that any
stored metrics will be deleted when the pod is deleted. While it is much easier
to run cluster metrics with non-persistent data, running with non-persistent
data does come with the risk of permanent data loss. However, metrics can still
survive a container being restarted.

In order to use non-persistent storage, you will need to set the
`*USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE*`
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#creating-the-deployer-template[template option] to `false` for the *metrics deployer*.

[[metrics-deployer]]

== Metrics Deployer

The *metrics deployer* deploys and configures all of the metrics
components. You can configure it by passing in information from
link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets] and by passing parameters to the *metrics deployer*'s link:../dev_guide/templates.html[template].

=== Metrics Deployer Secrets

By default, the *metrics deployer* auto-generates self-signed certificates for
use between components. To provide your own certificates, you can pass these
values as link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets] to the *metrics deployer*.

[WARNING]
====
By default, the Hawkular Metrics service uses self signed certificates which can
cause problems when the console accesses it in a web browser. Alternately, you
can specify your own *_hawkular-metrics.pem_* secret to use a certificate which
is trusted by the browser.
====

Optionally, provide your own certificate that is configured to be trusted by your browser by pointing your secret to the certificate's *_.pem_* and certificate authority certificate files:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer hawkular-metrics.pem=/home/openshift/metrics/hm.pem \
hawkular-metrics-ca.cert=/home/openshift/metrics/hm-ca.cert
----

You can also use the default auto-generated certificates with the following
command:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer nothing=/dev/null
----

The following table contains more advanced configuration options, detailing all the secrets which can be used by the deployer:

[cols="2,4",options="header"]
|===

|Secret Name |Description

|*_hawkular-metrics.pem_*
|The *_pem_* file to use for the Hawkular Metrics certificate. This is
auto-generated if unspecified.

|*_hawkular-metrics-ca.cert_*
|The certificate for the CA used to sign the *_hawkular-metrics.pem_*. This
option is ignored if the *_hawkular-metrics.pem_* option is not specified.

|*_hawkular-cassandra.pem_*
|The *_.pem_* file to use for the Cassandra certificate. This is auto-generated
if unspecified.

|*_hawkular-cassandra-ca.cert_*
|The certificate for the CA used to sign the *_hawkular-cassandra.pem_*. This
option is ignored if the *_hawkular-cassandra.pem_* option is not specified.

|*_heapster.cert_*
|The certificate for Heapster to use. This is auto-generated if unspecified.

|*_heapster.key_*
|The key to use with the Heapster certificate. This is ignored if
*_heapster.cert_* is not specified

|*_heapster_client_ca.cert_*
|The certificate that generates *_heapster.cert_*. This is required if
*_heapster.cert_* is specified.  Otherwise, the main CA for the OpenShift installation
is used. In order for link:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[horizontal pod autoscaling]
to function properly, this should not be overridden.

|*_heapster_allowed_users_*
|A file containing a comma-separated list of CN to accept from certificates
signed with the specified CA. By default, this is set to allow the OpenShift service
proxy to connect.  If you override this, make sure to add `system:master-proxy` to the
list in order to allow link:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[horizontal pod autoscaling]
to function properly.

|===

=== Creating the Deployer Template

The following is the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html[template]
used to deploy the metrics components.

By default, the OpenShift
installer creates this template, and it can be found in the following directory:
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/infrastructure-templates/enterprise/metrics-deployer.yaml_*

You will need to save your completed file with the file name *_metrics.yaml_*.

[[deployer-template-parameters]]
==== Deployer Template Parameters

The deployer template parameter options and their defaults are listed above in the *_metrics.yaml_* file. If required, you can override these values when creating the *metrics deployer*.

The only required parameter is `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*`. This
value is required when creating the deployer because it specifies the hostname
for the Hawkular Metrics
link:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[route]. This value should correspond
to a fully qualified domain name. You will need to know the
value of `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` when
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#configuring-openshift-metrics[configuring the console] for metrics
access.

All of the other parameters are optional and allow for greater customization. For instance,
if you have a custom install in which the Kubernetes master is not available under
`https://kubernetes.default.svc:443` you can specify the value to use instead with the
`*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` parameter. If you wish to deploy a version of the metrics components
other than _latest_, you can do so with the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` parameter.

== Deploying the Metric Components

Since deploying and configuring all the metric components is handled by the
*metrics deployer*, you can simply deploy everything in one step.

The following examples show you how to deploy metrics with and without
persistent storage using the default template parameters. Optionally, you can
specify any of the
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#deployer-template-parameters[template parameters]
when calling these commands.

.Deploying with Persistent Storage
====
The following command sets the Hawkular Metrics route to use
`hawkular-metrics.example.com` and is deployed using persistent storage.

You must have a persistent volume of sufficient size available.

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc process -f metrics.yaml -v \
HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com | oc create -f -
----
====

.Deploying without Persistent Storage
====
The following command sets the Hawkular Metrics route to use
`hawkular-metrics.example.com` and is deployed without persistent storage.
Remember, this is being deployed without persistent storage, so metric data loss
can occur.

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc process -f metrics.yaml -v \
HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com,USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE=false \
| oc create -f -

and create it:

[[configuring-openshift-metrics]]

== Configuring OpenShift

The OpenShift web console uses the data coming from the Hawkular Metrics service
to display its graphs. The URL for accessing the Hawkular Metrics service
must be configured via the `*metricsPublicURL*` option in the
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master-config.yaml]
file. This URL corresponds to the route created with the
`*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` template parameter during the
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#deploying-the-metric-components[deployment]
of the metrics components.

[NOTE]
====
You must be able to resolve the `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` from the browser
accessing the console.
====

For example, if your `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` corresponds to `hawkular-metrics.example.com`, then you must make the following change in the *_master-config.yaml_* file:

====
[source,yaml,]
.master-config.yaml
----
  assetConfig:
    ...
    metricsPublicURL: "https://hawkular-metrics.example.com/hawkular/metrics"
----
====

Once you have updated and saved the *_master-config.yaml_* file, you must
restart your OpenShift instance.

When your OpenShift server is back up and running, metrics will be displayed on
the pod overview pages.

[CAUTION]
====
If you are using self-signed certificates, remember that the Hawkular Metrics service is hosted under a different hostname and uses different certificates than the console. You may need to explicitly open a browser tab to the value
specified in `*metricsPublicURL*` and accept that certificate.

To avoid this issue, use certificates which are configured to be acceptable by your browser.
