== Overview

The
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#kubelet[kubelet]
exposes metrics that can be collected and stored in back-ends by
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/heapster[Heapster].

As an {product-title} administrator, you can view a cluster's metrics from all
containers and components in one user interface. These metrics are also
used by xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal pod autoscalers]
in order to determine when and how to scale.

This topic describes using
link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics[Hawkular Metrics] as a metrics
engine which stores the data persistently in a
link:http://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra] database. When this is configured,
CPU, memory and network-based metrics are viewable from the {product-title} web console
and are available for use by xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal
pod autoscalers].

Heapster retrieves a list of all nodes from the master server, then contacts
each node individually through the `/stats` endpoint. From there, Heapster
scrapes the metrics for CPU, memory and network usage, then exports them into Hawkular
Metrics.

Browsing individual pods in the web console displays separate sparkline charts
for memory and CPU. The time range displayed is selectable, and these charts
automatically update every 30 seconds. If there are multiple containers on the
pod, then you can select a specific container to display its metrics.

If xref:../admin_guide/limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[resource limits] are defined for your
project, then you can also see a donut chart for each pod. The donut chart
displays usage against the resource limit. For example: `145 Available of 200
MiB`, with the donut chart showing `55 MiB Used`.

[[cluster-metrics-before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[WARNING]
====
If your {product-title} installation was originally performed on a version
previous to v1.0.8, even if it has since been updated to a newer version, follow
the instructions for node certificates outlined in
xref:../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#manual-updating-master-and-node-certificates[Updating
Master and Node Certificates]. If the node certificate does not contain the IP
address of the node, then Heapster will fail to retrieve any metrics.
====
endif::[]

An Ansible playbook is available to deploy and upgrade cluster metrics. You
should familiarize yourself with the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced Installation] section. This provides information for prepairing to use Ansible
and includes information about configuration. Parameters are added to the
Ansible inventory file to configure various areas of cluster metrics.

The following describe the various areas and the parameters that can be added to
the Ansible inventory file in order to modify the defaults:

- xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-namespace[Metrics Project]
- xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-data-storage[Metrics Data Storage]

[[metrics-namespace]]
== Metrics Project

The components for cluster metrics must be deployed to the *openshift-infra*
project in order for autoscaling to work.
xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[Horizontal pod
autoscalers] specifically use this project to discover the Heapster service and
use it to retrieve metrics. The metrics project can be changed by adding
`openshift_metrics_project` to the inventory file.

[[metrics-data-storage]]
== Metrics Data Storage

You can store the metrics data to either
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent storage] or to
a temporary xref:../dev_guide/volumes.adoc#dev-guide-volumes[pod volume].

[[metrics-persistent-storage]]
=== Persistent Storage

Running {product-title} cluster metrics with persistent storage means that your
metrics will be stored to a
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volumes[persistent
volume] and be able to survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal
if you require your metrics data to be guarded from data loss. For production
environments it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage for your
metrics pods.

The size requirement of the Cassandra storage is dependent on the number of
pods. It is the administrator's responsibility to ensure that the size
requirements are sufficient for their setup and to monitor usage to ensure that
the disk does not become full. The size of the persisted volume claim is
specified with the `openshift_metrics_cassandra_pvc_size`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[ansible
variable] which is set to 10 GB by default.

If you would like to use xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[dynamically provisioned persistent volumes] set the `openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[variable]
to `dynamic` in the inventory file.

[[capacity-planning-for-openshift-metrics]]
=== Capacity Planning for Cluster Metrics

After running the `openshift_metrics` Ansible role, the output of `oc get pods`
should resemble the following:

====
----
 # oc get pods -n openshift-infra
 NAME                                READY             STATUS      RESTARTS          AGE
 hawkular-cassandra-1-l5y4g          1/1               Running     0                 17h
 hawkular-metrics-1t9so              1/1               Running     0                 17h
 heapster-febru                      1/1               Running     0                 17h
----
====

{product-title} metrics are stored using the Cassandra database, which is
deployed with settings of `openshift_metrics_cassandra_limits_memory: 2G`; this
value could be adjusted further based upon the available memory as determined by
the Cassandra start script. This value should cover most {product-title} metrics
installations, but using environment variables you can modify the `MAX_HEAP_SIZE`
along with heap new generation size, `HEAP_NEWSIZE`, in the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/master/cassandra/Dockerfile[Cassandra Dockerfile]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Cassandra Dockerfile
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
prior to deploying cluster metrics.

By default, metrics data is stored for seven days. After seven days, Cassandra
begins to purge the oldest metrics data. Metrics data for deleted pods and
projects is not automatically purged; it is only removed once the data is more
than seven days old.

.Data Accumulated by 10 Nodes and 1000 Pods
====
In a test scenario including 10 nodes and 1000 pods, a 24 hour period
accumulated 2.5 GB of metrics data. Therefore, the capacity planning formula for
metrics data in this scenario is:

(((2.5 × 10^9^) ÷ 1000) ÷ 24) ÷ 10^6^ = ~0.125 MB/hour per pod.
====

.Data Accumulated by 120 Nodes and 10000 Pods
====
In a test scenario including 120 nodes and 10000 pods, a 24 hour period
accumulated 25 GB of metrics data. Therefore, the capacity planning formula for
metrics data in this scenario is:

(((11.410 × 10^9^) ÷ 1000) ÷ 24) ÷ 10^6^ = 0.475 MB/hour
====

|===
| |1000 pods| 10000 pods

|Cassandra storage data accumulated over 24 hours (default metrics parameters)
|2.5 GB
|11.4 GB
|===

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
These two test cases are presented on the following graph:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekuric/openshift/master/metrics/1_10kpods.png[1000 pods vs 10000 pods monitored during 24 hours]
endif::openshift-origin[]

If the default value of 7 days for `openshift_metrics_duration` and 10 seconds for
`openshift_metrics_resolution` are preserved, then weekly storage requirements for the Cassandra pod would be:

|===
| |1000 pods | 10000 pods

|Cassandra storage data accumulated over seven days (default metrics parameters)
|20 GB
|90 GB
|===

In the previous table, an additional 10 percent was added to the expected
storage space as a buffer for unexpected monitored pod usage.

[WARNING]
====
If the Cassandra persisted volume runs out of sufficient space, then data loss
will occur.
====

For cluster metrics to work with persistent storage, ensure that the persistent
volume has the *ReadWriteOnce* access mode. If this mode is not active, then the
persistent volume claim cannot locate the persistent volume, and Cassandra fails
to start.

To use persistent storage with the metric components, ensure that a
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volumes[persistent volume] of
sufficient size is available. The creation of
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volume-claims[persistent volume claims] is handled by
the OpenShift Ansible `openshift_metrics` role.

{product-title} metrics also supports dynamically-provisioned persistent volumes.
To use this feature with {product-title} metrics, it is necessary to set the value
of `openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type` to `dynamic`.
You can use EBS, GCE, and Cinder storage back-ends to
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[dynamically provision persistent volumes].

For information on configuring the performance and scaling the cluster metrics
pods, see the
xref:../scaling_performance/scaling_cluster_metrics.adoc#scaling-performance-cluster-metrics[Scaling
Cluster Metrics] topic.

[discrete]
[[cluster-metrics-known-issues-and-limitations]]
==== Known Issues and Limitations

Testing found that the `heapster` metrics component is capable of handling up to
25,000 pods. If the amount of pods exceed that number, Heapster begins to fall
behind in metrics processing, resulting in the possibility of metrics graphs no
longer appearing. Work is ongoing to increase the number of pods that Heapster
can gather metrics on, as well as upstream development of alternate
metrics-gathering solutions.

[[metrics-non-persistent-storage]]
=== Non-Persistent Storage

Running {product-title} cluster metrics with non-persistent storage means that
any stored metrics will be deleted when the pod is deleted. While it is much
easier to run cluster metrics with non-persistent data, running with
non-persistent data does come with the risk of permanent data loss. However,
metrics can still survive a container being restarted.

In order to use non-persistent storage, you must set the
`openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[variable]
to `emptydir` in the inventory file.

[NOTE]
====
When using non-persistent storage, metrics data will be written to
*_/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes/pods_* on the node where the Cassandra
pod is running. Ensure *_/var_* has enough free space to accommodate metrics
storage.
====

[[metrics-ansible-role]]
== Metrics Ansible Role

The OpenShift Ansible `openshift_metrics` role configures and deploys all of the
metrics components using the variables from the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-ansible[Configuring
Ansible] inventory file.

[[metrics-ansible-variables]]
=== Specifying Metrics Ansible Variables

The `openshift_metrics` role included with OpenShift Ansible defines the tasks
to deploy cluster metrics. The following is a list of role variables that can be
added to your inventory file if it is necessary to override them.

.Ansible Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Description

|`openshift_metrics_install_metrics`
|Deploy metrics if `true`. Otherwise, undeploy.

|`openshift_metrics_start_cluster`
|Start the metrics cluster after deploying the components.

|`openshift_metrics_image_prefix`
|The prefix for the component images. With

always get the latest 3.5 image, set `v3.5`.
endif::[]

|`openshift_metrics_startup_timeout`
|The time, in seconds, to wait until Hawkular Metrics and Heapster start up
before attempting a restart.

|`openshift_metrics_duration`

|The frequency that metrics are gathered. Defined as a number and time
identifier: seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h).

|`openshift_metrics_cassandra_pvc_prefix`
|The persistent volume claim prefix created for Cassandra. A serial number is
appended to the prefix starting from 1.

|`openshift_metrics_cassandra_pvc_size`
|The persistent volume claim size for each of the Cassandra nodes.

|`openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type`
|Use `emptydir` for ephemeral storage (for testing); `pv` for persistent volumes,
which need to be created before the installation; or `dynamic` for dynamic

|`openshift_metrics_cassandra_replicas`
|The number of Cassandra nodes for the metrics stack. This value dictates the
number of Cassandra replication controllers.

|`openshift_metrics_cassandra_limits_memory`
|The memory limit for the Cassandra pod. For example, a value of `2Gi` would
limit Cassandra to 2 GB of memory. This value could be further adjusted by the
start script based on available memory of the node on which it is scheduled.

|`openshift_metrics_cassandra_limits_cpu`
|The CPU limit for the Cassandra pod. For example, a value of `4000m` (4000
millicores) would limit Cassandra to 4 CPUs.

|`openshift_metrics_cassandra_replicas`
|The number of replicas for Cassandra.

|`openshift_metrics_cassandra_requests_memory`
|The amount of memory to request for Cassandra pod. For example, a value of
`2Gi` would request 2 GB of memory.

|`openshift_metrics_cassandra_requests_cpu`

default router certificate is used.

|`openshift_metrics_hawkular_key`
|The key file used with the Hawkular certificate.

|`openshift_metrics_hawkular_limits_memory`
|The amount of memory to limit the Hawkular pod. For example, a value of `2Gi`
would limit the Hawkular pod to 2 GB of memory. This value could be further
adjusted by the start script based on available memory of the node on which it
is scheduled.

|`openshift_metrics_hawkular_limits_cpu`
|The CPU limit for the Hawkular pod. For example, a value of `4000m` (4000
millicores) would limit the Hawkular pod to 4 CPUs.

|`openshift_metrics_hawkular_replicas`
|The number of replicas for Hawkular metrics.

|`openshift_metrics_hawkular_requests_memory`
|The amount of memory to request for the Hawkular pod. For example, a value of
`2Gi` would request 2 GB of memory.

|`openshift_metrics_hawkular_requests_cpu`
|The CPU request for the Hawkular pod. For example, a value of `4000m` (4000
millicores) would request 4 CPUs.

|`openshift_metrics_heapster_allowed_users`
|A comma-separated list of CN to accept. By default, this is set to allow the
OpenShift service proxy to connect. Add `system:master-proxy` to the list when

would limit the Heapster pod to 2 GB of memory.

|`openshift_metrics_heapster_limits_cpu`
|The CPU limit for the Heapster pod. For example, a value of `4000m` (4000
millicores) would limit the Heapster pod to 4 CPUs.

|`openshift_metrics_heapster_requests_memory`
|The amount of memory to request for Heapster pod. For example, a value of `2Gi`
would request 2 GB of memory.

|`openshift_metrics_heapster_requests_cpu`
|The CPU request for the Heapster pod. For example, a value of `4000m` (4000
millicores) would request 4 CPUs.

|`openshift_metrics_heapster_standalone`
|Deploy only Heapster, without the Hawkular Metrics and Cassandra components.

|===

See xref:../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-compute-resources[Compute
Resources] for for further discussion on how to specify requests and limits.

The only required variable is `openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname`. This value is
required when executing the `openshift_metrics` Ansible role because it uses the host name for the
Hawkular Metrics xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[route]. This
value should correspond to a fully qualified domain name. You must know
the value of `openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname` when
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#configuring-openshift-metrics[configuring the console] for metrics access.

If you are using
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-persistent-storage[persistent
storage] with Cassandra, it is the administrator's responsibility to set a
sufficient disk size for the cluster using the `openshift_metrics_cassandra_pvc_size` variable.
It is also the administrator's responsibility to monitor disk usage to make sure
that it does not become full.

[WARNING]
====
Data loss will result if the Cassandra persisted volume runs out of sufficient space.
====

All of the other variables are optional and allow for greater customization.
For instance, if you have a custom install in which the Kubernetes master is not
available under `\https://kubernetes.default.svc:443` you can specify the value
to use instead with the `openshift_metrics_master_url` parameter. To deploy a specific version
of the metrics components, modify the `openshift_metrics_image_version` variable.

[WARNING]
====
It is highly recommended to not use *latest* for the *openshift_metrics_image_version*. The *latest*
version corresponds to the very latest version available and can cause issues if it brings in a
newer version not meant to function on the version of {product-title} you are currently running.
====

[[metrics-using-secrets]]
=== Using Secrets

The OpenShift Ansible `openshift_metrics` role will auto-generate self-signed certificates for use between its
components and will generate a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#secured-routes[re-encrypting route] to expose
the Hawkular Metrics service. This route is what allows the web console to access the Hawkular Metrics
service.

In order for the browser running the web console to trust the connection through
this route, it must trust the route's certificate. This can be accomplished by
xref:metrics-using-secrets-byo-certs[providing your own certificates] signed by
a trusted Certificate Authority. The `openshift_metrics` role allows you to
specify your own certificates which it will then use when creating the route.

The router's default certificate are used if you do not provide your own.

[[metrics-using-secrets-byo-certs]]
==== Providing Your Own Certificates

To provide your own certificate which will be used by the
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#secured-routes[re-encrypting
route], you can set the `openshift_metrics_hawkular_cert`,
`openshift_metrics_hawkular_key`, and `openshift_metrics_hawkular_ca`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[variables]
in your inventory file.

The `hawkular-metrics.pem` value needs to contain the certificate in its *_.pem_*
format. You may also need to provide the certificate for the Certificate Authority
which signed this *_pem_* file via the `hawkular-metrics-ca.cert` secret.

For more information, please see the
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#secured-routes[re-encryption
route documentation].

[[deploying-the-metrics-components]]
== Deploying the Metric Components

Because deploying and configuring all the metric components is handled with
OpenShift Ansible, you can deploy everything in one step.

The following examples show you how to deploy metrics with and without
persistent storage using the default parameters.

.Deploying with Persistent Storage
====
The following command sets the Hawkular Metrics route to use
*hawkular-metrics.example.com* and is deployed using persistent storage.

You must have a persistent volume of sufficient size available.

----
$ ansible-playbook <OPENSHIFT_ANSIBLE_DIR>/byo/openshift-cluster/openshift-metrics.yml \
   -e openshift_metrics_install_metrics=True \
   -e openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
   -e openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type=pv
----
====

.Deploying without Persistent Storage
====
The following command sets the Hawkular Metrics route to use
*hawkular-metrics.example.com* and deploy without persistent storage.

----
$ ansible-playbook <OPENSHIFT_ANSIBLE_DIR>/byo/openshift-cluster/openshift-metrics.yml \
   -e openshift_metrics_install_metrics=True \
   -e openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname=hawkular-metrics.example.com
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Because this is being deployed without persistent storage, metric data loss
can occur.
====

[[metrics-diagnostics]]
=== Metrics Diagnostics

The are some diagnostics for metrics to assist in evaluating the state of the
metrics stack. To execute diagnostics for metrics:

----
$ oadm diagnostics MetricsApiProxy
----


[[deploying-hawkular-openshift-agent]]
== Deploying the Hawkular OpenShift Agent

[NOTE]
====
The Hawkular OpenShift Agent is currently in Technology Preview.
====

The link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-openshift-agent[Hawkular OpenShift
Agent] can be used to gather application metrics from pods running within the
{product-title} cluster. These metrics can then be viewed from the console or
accessed via the Hawkular Metrics REST API.

In order for these metrics to be gathered, your pod needs to expose a Prometheus
or Jolokia endpoint and create a special ConfigMap, which defines where the
metric endpoint is located and how the metrics should be gathered. More
information can be found under the
link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-openshift-agent[Hawkular OpenShift
Agent documentation].

The agent runs as a daemon set in your cluster and is deployed to the `default`
project. By deploying to the `default` project, the agent continues to monitor
all your pods even if the `ovs_multitenant` plug-in is enabled.

To deploy the agent, you will need to gather two configuration files:
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin-metrics/enterprise/hawkular-openshift-agent/hawkular-openshift-agent-configmap.yaml
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin-metrics/enterprise/hawkular-openshift-agent/hawkular-openshift-agent.yaml
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ wget https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/enterprise/hawkular-openshift-agent/hawkular-openshift-agent-configmap.yaml
$ wget https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/enterprise/hawkular-openshift-agent/hawkular-openshift-agent.yaml
----
endif::[]

To set up and deploy the agent into your {product-title} cluster, run:
----
$ oc create -f hawkular-openshift-agent-configmap.yaml -n default
$ oc process -f hawkular-openshift-agent.yaml | oc create -n default -f -
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user hawkular-openshift-agent system:serviceaccount:default:hawkular-openshift-agent
----

[[Undeploying-the-hawkular-openshift-agent]]
=== Undeploying the Hawkular OpenShift Agent

To undeploy the Hawkular Metrics Agent, run:
----
$ oc delete all,secrets,sa,templates,configmaps,daemonsets,clusterroles --selector=metrics-infra=agent -n default
----

[[install-setting-the-metrics-public-url]]
== Setting the Metrics Public URL

The {product-title} web console uses the data coming from the Hawkular Metrics
service to display its graphs. The URL for accessing the Hawkular Metrics
service must be configured with the `metricsPublicURL` option in the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file] (*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*). This URL
corresponds to the route created with the `openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname`
inventory variable used during the
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#deploying-the-metrics-components[deployment]
of the metrics components.

[NOTE]
====
You must be able to resolve the `openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname` from the browser
accessing the console.
====

For example, if your `openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname` corresponds to
`hawkular-metrics.example.com`, then you must make the following change in the
*_master-config.yaml_* file:

====
[source,yaml,]
----
  assetConfig:
    ...
    metricsPublicURL: "https://hawkular-metrics.example.com/hawkular/metrics"
----
====

Once you have updated and saved the *_master-config.yaml_* file, you must
restart your {product-title} instance.

When your {product-title} server is back up and running, metrics will be
displayed on the pod overview pages.

[CAUTION]
====
If you are using self-signed certificates, remember that the Hawkular Metrics
service is hosted under a different host name and uses different certificates
than the console. You may need to explicitly open a browser tab to the value
specified in `metricsPublicURL` and accept that certificate.

To avoid this issue, use certificates which are configured to be acceptable by
your browser.
====

[[cluster-metrics-accessing-hawkular-metrics-directly]]
== Accessing Hawkular Metrics Directly

To access and manage metrics more directly, use the Hawkular Metrics API.

[NOTE]
====
When accessing Hawkular Metrics from the API, you will only be able to perform
reads. Writing metrics has been disabled by default. If you want for individual
users to also be able to write metrics, you must set the
`openshift_metrics_hawkular_user_write_access`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[variable]
to *true*.

However, it is recommended to use the default configuration and only have
metrics enter the system via Heapster. If write access is enabled, any user
will be able to write metrics to the system, which can affect performance and
cause Cassandra disk usage to unpredictably increase.
====

The link:http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html[Hawkular Metrics documentation]
covers how to use the API, but there are a few differences when dealing with the
version of Hawkular Metrics configured for use on {product-title}:

[[cluster-metrics-openshift-projects-and-hawkular-tenants]]
=== {product-title} Projects and Hawkular Tenants

Hawkular Metrics is a multi-tenanted application. It is configured so that a
project in {product-title} corresponds to a tenant in Hawkular Metrics.

As such, when accessing metrics for a project named *MyProject* you must set the
link:http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html#_tenant_header[*Hawkular-Tenant*]
header to *MyProject*.

There is also a special tenant named *_system* which contains system level
metrics. This requires either a *cluster-reader* or *cluster-admin* level
privileges to access.

[[cluster-metrics-authorization]]
=== Authorization

The Hawkular Metrics service will authenticate the user against {product-title}
to determine if the user has access to the project it is trying to access.

Hawkular Metrics accepts a bearer token from the client and verifies that token
with the {product-title} server using a *SubjectAccessReview*. If the user has
proper read privileges for the project, they are allowed to read the metrics
for that project. For the *_system* tenant, the user requesting to read from
this tenant must have *cluster-reader* permission.

When accessing the Hawkular Metrics API, you must pass a bearer token in the
*Authorization* header.

== Accessing Heapster Directly

Heapster has been configured to be only accessible via the
xref:../rest_api/kubernetes_v1.adoc#proxy-get-requests-to-service[API proxy].
Accessing it will required either a cluster-reader or cluster-admin privileges.

For example, to access the Heapster *validate* page, you need to access it
using something similar to:

----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
       -X GET https://${KUBERNETES_MASTER}/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/openshift-infra/services/https:heapster:/validate
----

For more information about Heapster and how to access its APIs, please refer the
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/[Heapster] project.

Performance Guide].

[[metrics-logging]]
== Integration with Aggregated Logging

Hawkular Alerts must be connected to the Aggregated Logging's Elasticsearch to
react on log events. By default, Hawkular will try to find Elasticsearch on its
default place (namespace `logging`, pod `logging-es`) at every boot. If the
Aggregated Logging is installed after Hawkular, the Hawkular Metrics pod might
need to be restarted in order to recognize the new Elasticsearch server. The
Hawkular boot log provides a clear indication if the integration could not be
properly configured, with messages like:

---
Failed to import the logging certificate into the store. Continuing, but the logging integration might fail.
---

or

---
Could not get the logging secret! Status code: 000. The Hawkular Alerts integration with Logging might not work properly.
---

This feature is available from
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
 version v1.7.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
 version 3.7.0.
endif::[]
You can confirm if logging is available by checking the log for an entry like:

---
Retrieving the Logging's CA and adding to the trust store, if Logging is available.

[[metrics-cleanup]]
== Cleanup

You can remove everything deployed by the OpenShift Ansible `openshift_metrics` role
by performing the following steps:

----
$ ansible-playbook <OPENSHIFT_ANSIBLE_DIR>/byo/openshift-cluster/openshift-metrics.yml \
   -e openshift_metrics_install_metrics=False
----
